Abstract
Using narrative analysis, ten academic library leaders were interviewed for stories about
their work experiences as openly lesbian and gay library professionals: how across the course of
their working lives and as they rose to senior executive roles they expressed their sexual identity;
how others in their organizations reacted; and the consequences for their leadership journeys.
Their stories, placed in the context of stigma, disclosure, life course, and transformational
leadership theories, reveal that the degree and type of identity expression evolved as the
participants moved forward across their own personal lives and also across history.
Major themes emerging from the data are the influence of time and place on disclosure
and types of disclosure; the kinetic power of disclosure; the weight of hyper-vigilance, and a
corresponding omnipresent concern about over-expression; identity management disconnects;
the utility of expression; and theoretical anomalies and gaps that emerge when comparing the
participants’ work-life experiences with the tenets of transformational leadership.

Acknowledgements
I still remember the afternoon I told my former boss, Dr. Lizbeth Martin, that I was
considering entering a doctoral program. “Don’t tell the president just yet,” I cautioned her. “I’m
not sure I’ll get into a program.” She promised not to. Five minutes after our meeting she was in
the president’s office securing a commitment to help me pay for my studies, even though I had
yet to begin studying for the GRE, let alone find the perfect program, which turned out to be at
the Simmons College School of Library and Information Science. The years ahead were full of
adventure (and a little misery), but Beth’s initial belief that I was worthy of this goal carried me a
very long way.
After the classwork comes the dissertation. No author—at least no doctoral student—
successfully writes on her own. Trudging up the long, rock-strewn hill between first proposal to
the final edits of a completed manuscript requires a village of supporters.
The very first supporter of this dissertation was Dr. Peter Hernon, who early on in my
doctoral studies enthusiastically encouraged me to write about LGBTQ issues in the context of
leadership.
I have also been extraordinarily blessed with the world’s best doctoral committee,
comprised of Dr. Michele Cloonan and Dr. Candy Schwartz of the Simmons School of Library
and Information Science, and Dr. Jennifer Putney of the Simmons School of Social Work.
Bringing up the topic of committees with doctoral students often leads to cries of woe. However,
my committee was thoughtful, responsive, encouraging, and insightful. I always felt they had my
back, even 3,000 miles away from where I lived. When I bogged down due to the inevitable life
crises, they were there to gently nudge me back to the desk, and they indulgently applauded even
the smallest progress on my work.

v
Other Simmons people were a great help. Jennifer Andrews helped me through the hard
early semesters, while Dr. Rong Tang’s crash course in how to study for comprehensive
examinations ensured I made it through that grisly milestone. I also thank my doctoral cohort—
Alexia Hudson-Ward, Kimberley Bugg, and Charles (Chuck) O’Bryan—for their
encouragement, as well as the cheering section made up of all past and current students in our
program, who periodically emerge to fête one another for achieving milestones. Chuck, however,
was exceptionally instrumental not only in my progress on this dissertation, but in my survival in
the doctoral program. I am grateful for the many hours Chuck shared with me to puzzle out
assignments, share manuscripts, compare timelines, or simply vent over our lot in life.
While conducting my preliminary literature review, I quickly realized the outsized role
James Carmichael played in LGBTQ studies in library and information science. He was a
pioneer in studying these issues in the context of our profession and turning the mirror on
ourselves. I also appreciate the work of every other researcher in this area, but Jim—writing in
the mid-1990s—stands alone.
The participants in this study were exceptionally gracious and giving of their time, and I
learned a lot from them. I thank them not only for their time in this study and the many deep
insights they shared with me about their working lives—often marked with laughter, sometimes
with tears—but also for the leadership they have shared with our profession. The colorful,
authentic stories of their working lives and how they made their way in librarianship as openly
lesbian and gay professionals are the backbone of this dissertation and add yet another dimension
to what we know about LGBTQ lives in history.
Many other people helped me along the way. When I was looking for a transcriptionist,
my colleague Dr. Pat Kreitz recommended Valerie Yvonne, who from thousands of miles away

vi
rapidly turned around crystal-clear transcripts of audio recordings, first for my qualifying paper,
and then for my dissertation. Another Valerie—Valerie Beaudrault, of Simmons Institutional
Review Board—was a patient and supportive go-between when my dissertation proposal hit the
rocky shoal of a reviewer with many questions. I also thank my copy editor, Leea Stroia, and the
parade of doctoral assistants, Simmons SLIS tech lab students, and others who have been there
for me. Dr. Mary-Ann Van Dam of San Francisco State University let me adapt her lesbian
disclosure measurement for use in this study, answered questions, and was yet another voice of
encouragement. Dr. Theresa Byrd of University of San Diego was one of a number of friends,
but the most frequent, to repeatedly check up on me to ensure I was making progress and
encourage me to finish up. Dawnelle Ricciardi and everyone else involved in interlibrary loan at
Sonoma State University requested materials for me at the speed of light, and for a while there
was hardly a day that passed when Richard Maxon would not say, “There’s another book waiting
for you.” Indeed, all the library workers and faculty I led during this period were infinitely
patient with my divided time, and visibly supportive of my endeavors.
Finally, there is no gratitude large enough for the support and encouragement of my
beloved wife, Sandy, who for years has patiently put up with this massive project absorbing most
of my free time and a lot of my attention, compounded by many other life events. She has been
my muse and my best supporter, and has forgiven me many times over for my absences or
distracted presence. For the rest of our journey, I have one last major project: our lives together.

Chapter 1: Introduction

It is a truth universally acknowledged—at least within the context of stereotype and
stigma research—that someone cannot identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or a
member of another sexual or gender minority without general agreement between that person
and the rest of society that sexual identity categories exist and that these categories have specific
social meaning as well as loci, however fungible, along the myriad strata to which humans assign
one another (see especially Crocker, Major, & Steele, 1998; Goffman, 1963; Herek, 2007; Jones
et al., 1984; Lehavot & Lambert, 2007; Link & Phelan, 2005; Major & O’Brien, 2005;
Ridgeway, 2001). Americans have seen significant legislative advances for those who identify as
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or as another sexual minority (hereafter collectively referred
to as LGBTQ), culminating most recently in the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision by the
Supreme Court that legalized same-sex marriage across the land. However, the protests that
followed, including a county clerk who went to jail rather than issue marriage licenses,
underscore the complex reality that many people still stigmatize sexual identity, which continues
to be, in the terms of Goffman (1963), a “discredited” condition that can result in reduced social
status across life domains, including the workplace.
Even professions such as librarianship commonly perceived to skew liberal have recent
history with sexual identity discrimination, and have not always been in the vanguard of LGBTQ
support. The late 1940s through the 1950s saw a purge of gay librarians from the Library of
Congress which went largely ignored by library associations; the exact numbers of librarians
forced out of their jobs are unknown, but during this period “it is clear that a much higher
number of employees weathered suspicions, suspensions, investigations, and hearings before the
storm cleared” (Robbins, 1998, p. 56). In subsequent decades, the library profession seesawed on

2
attitudes, much like the rest of contemporary culture in the United States. In 1971, American
Library Association (ALA) President Eric Moon noted approvingly in American Libraries, the
house magazine for the ALA, that at the annual conference the newly-formed Gay Liberation
Task Force (subsequently the Gay Task Force, the Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and as of this
writing, the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table, or GLTBRT) “stole most of
the association's headlines in the press, on radio and television, with their ‘Hug a Homosexual’
booth in the exhibit area” (Moon, 1972, p. 399). Yet an anonymous reporter had earlier mocked
the same event (“Up the down concourse,” 1971, p. 821). In that same era, ALA spent four years
delaying action until finally declining to take up the case of Michael McConnell, a gay librarian
whose job offer from the University of Minnesota was rescinded following his attempt to file for
marriage with his male partner (Tobin & Wicker, 1975, p. 148). It is laudable that in 1971 ALA
adopted an equal employment opportunity policy that for the first time mentioned sexual
identity: “whether the distinguishing characteristics of the minority be ethnic, sexual, religious,
or of any other kind” (“Up the down concourse,” 1971, p. 821). However the same report shows
that during discussion of this resolution, a member of ALA’s Council, after comparing
homosexuality to adultery, convinced the Council to amend the resolution to take out
introductory language specific to discrimination against LGBTQ people. To date there is no
requirement that employment ads in American Libraries be limited to organizations that offer
equal benefits or employment protection for LGBTQ employees.
Though prejudicial attitudes are understood to be malleable (Dasgupta & Greenwald,
2001), their change rarely follows a smooth trajectory. Within the library profession, change has
been nonlinear and piecemeal. Every year since 1971, GLBTRT has selected the Stonewall Book
Awards (originally the Gay Book Awards), generally recognized as the premier award for

3
English-language LGBTQ books. ALA only recognized these as association awards in 1986
(Wiegand, 2002, p. 104), and not until 2011 did ALA begin announcing the Stonewall Book
Awards in the annual broadcast announcements for other ALA book awards such as Caldecott,
Newbery, and Coretta Scott King. Just two decades ago, as described in Schneider (2016), letters
to the editor filled three issues of American Libraries, criticizing the magazine’s decision to
publish a cover photo of librarians marching in the 1992 San Francisco Gay Pride Parade
(Carmichael, 1998, p. 102; Wiegand, 2002, p. 104). It would be hard to imagine that outcry
today, when a growing number of graduate schools of library and information science offer
support groups for LGBTQ students, and the president of the American Library Association
routinely visits the conference reception for the association’s Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and
Transgender Roundtable (GLBTRT). Yet some of the librarians who wrote letters to American
Libraries in 1992 are still in the profession, as are many of the librarians portrayed in the iconic
and then-controversial cover photo, and they and their organizational descendants coexist in a
world with wide-ranging attitudes about sexual identity.
Sexual identity is a concealable difference.1 Until recently, the act of concealment, also
known as nondisclosure (Ragins, 2008) or, less formally, covering (Button, 2001), was the norm
across life domains for LGBTQ people, and it continues to be typical behavior in the workplace;
“despite a changing social and legal landscape for LGBT people, still over half (53%) of LGBT
workers nationwide hide who they are at work” (Fidas & Cooper, 2014, p. 2). Concealment
requires active, ongoing effort. Strategies include eliminating LGBTQ-related association
references from curricula vitae; norming personal dress to mute identity cues; omitting or

Variants of this phrase include concealable stigmas (Herek & Capitanio, 1996; Smart &
Wegner, 1999), invisible social identities (Clair, Beatty, &MacLean, 2005), concealable
differences (Mathes, 2007), and invisible stigmas (Ragins, 2008).

modifying key details about personal life in casual workplace conversation; avoiding office
artifacts such as photos of same-gender partners or spouses; and attending organizational events
without a spouse or partner or bringing an opposite-gender friend, who in this role is also known
colloquially as a “beard” (Button, 2001, 2004; Chrobot-Mason, Button, & DiClementi, 2001;
Clair, Beatty, & MacLean, 2005; Creed & Scully, 2000; Gates, 2012; Griffith & Hebl, 2002;
Hutson, 2010; Ragins, 2008; Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow, 2013; Woods, 1994).
Nondisclosure can include the phenomenon of presenting as heterosexual through partnering
with or marrying heterosexual opposite-sex people while maintaining a double life in which
same-sex partnering happens secretively, a practice that while unmeasurable and attributed to
various rationales, from a desire to conceal sexual identity to the idea that marriage is natural and
expected, is known to have been common in the last century, and may continue to date (Higgins,
2002; Laumann, 1994; Ross, 1979, 1983).
Nondisclosure of sexual identity takes its toll on LGBTQ employees through fear of
disclosure; emotional distance from co-workers, supervisors, and subordinates; substandard job
satisfaction and organizational commitment; low organization-based self-esteem; the sense that
one is not presenting one’s authentic self to others; the stress of constantly being on guard; and
the emotional labor required to maintain complex lies and juggle different identities across life
domains (Barretto, Ellemers, & Banal, 2006; Clair et al., 2005; Crocker et al., 1998; Fidas &
Cooper, 2014; Ragins, Singh, & Cornwell, 2007; Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow, 2013).
Concealing such a significant part of one’s identity in the workplace can create an “absent
presence” for one’s true social identity (Ward & Winstanley, 2003) and a sense of personal
inauthenticity and incompleteness that Woodruffe-Burton and Bairstow (2013) call the “not-self”
(p. 370).

5
Covering is laborious and deleterious to one’s sense of self, but it also has rational value.
The workplace, a place of powerful cultural identity as well as a source of human sustenance, is
a highly policed environment for sexual minorities, and fears of anti-LBGTQ discrimination are
well-founded. Studies of hiring practices indicate that even in this decade, employers are less
likely to hire openly lesbian and gay candidates (Pizer, Mallory, Sears, & Hunter, 2012; Tilcsik,
2011). A 2008 study of lesbian and gay employees “using probability samples representative of
the U.S. population” found that 42% of these employees “had experienced at least one form of
employment discrimination because of their sexual orientation at some point in their lives” and
27% “had experienced such discrimination during the five years prior to the survey” (Pizer et al.,
2012, pp. 722–723). A national survey of LBGTQ employees found that close to 10% had left a
job due to LBGTQ discrimination (Fidas & Cooper, 2014). Ward and Winstanley (2003), using a
narrative “double method,” in which 92 LGBTQ service employees were interviewed and 15
narratives were selected for focus group discussion, found that "most chose their coming out as
the high point of their career” (p. 1267), yet their stories also described how their coming-out
was met with discriminatory words and actions.
The extent to which employment opportunities for openly LGBTQ leaders are limited is
unknown, but there is agreement that non-majority identities experience obstacles to reaching
leadership positions (Button, 2001, 2004; Chrobot-Mason et al., 2001; Creed & Scully, 2000;
Eagly & Carli, 2007; Fidas & Cooper, 2014; Gates, 2012, 2014; Griffith & Hebl, 2002; Ragins,
2008; Ragins et al., 2007; Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow, 2013; Woods, 1994). Scholarship in
gender and culture has playfully extended the concept of the glass ceiling, an invisible obstacle
to minority success (Federal Glass Ceiling Commission, 1995), to the glass escalator, which
whisks men to the administrative suite while their female counterparts trudge up the corporate

6
stairs (Maume, 1999). Eagly and Carli (2007) further modified this metaphor into the glass
labyrinth, a high-walled maze through which women leaders struggle to reach senior positions
(Eagly & Carli, 2007), while Ryan and Haslam (2005) proposed the glass cliff, a phenomenon in
which women are overrepresented in exceptionally challenging roles. These figures of speech
have led to the metaphor of an LGBTQ-specific “lavender ceiling” for leaders in industries,
including higher education (Hill, 2006).
Crocker et al. (1998) observed, “perhaps the key feature of much prejudice against the
stigmatized is the discrepancy between what people say and what they do” (p. 513). Employees
who consider themselves enlightened may hold contradictory beliefs about LBGTQ people in the
workplace, whether or not they fully understand they are doing so. The survey of LGBTQ
experiences in the workplace by Fidas and Cooper (2014) included a subset of over 200 nonLBGTQ employees, “70% of whom agreed that ‘it is unprofessional’ to talk about sexual
orientation” (p. 3), despite the fact, as the examples of concealment strategies demonstrate, that it
requires significant effort to conceal one’s personal life in organizations where people closely
interact for dozens of hours per week, and where it is common and even expected to share
personal details such as family activities and life events:
The concept of being open in the workplace is salient as over the course of a workday
most people are often compelled or opt to reveal aspects of who they are. To not do so
can isolate a person and erode valuable rapport with co-workers, managers and would-be
mentors (Fidas & Cooper, 2014, p. 8).
Sexual identity in the workplace is made even more complex by “the well-documented
societal confounding of gender and sexual orientation (i.e., the predominant belief that wanting
same-sex partners indicates a desire to be the other sex, or that gender nonconformity is proof

7
of homosexuality)” (Fassinger, Shullman, & Stevenson, 2010, p. 210; see also Blashill &
Powlishta, 2009; Carmichael, 1992, 1998). The blurred lines of sexual identity expressions as
they play out in real life further reinforce the widespread belief that LGBTQ people flout gender
categories. Many LGBTQ people have habits of dress, behavior, speech, and other expressions
that transgress cultural norms associated with their natal genders: behavior used to “construct
identities they experience as authentic” and signal their constructed identity to others (Hutson,
2010, p. 214). An online ethnography study analyzing organizational experiences of lesbians
who present masculine (butch) identities in job interviews observed that this presentation has
utility for signaling sexual identity to other lesbians, but creates issues for lesbians in domains
outside of lesbian-only spaces because butch identity is perceived as “contravening and
contradicting sexual stereotypes, expectations and assumptions about appropriate roles for the
sexes and perceptions of those who violate traditional patterns” (Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow,
2013, p. 360). Woodruffe-Burton and Bairstow describe examples of butch lesbians who
feminized their dress for job interviews rather than risk missing job opportunities (WoodruffeBurton & Bairstow, 2013, p. 370). Studies also report it is common for lesbian and gay
employees to mute preferred workplace clothing, with its concomitant signaling of identity
expression, to conform with cultural standards for male and female dress (Brower, 2013; Gates,
2012; Hutson, 2010). Whether or not LGBTQ employees strive to mute their expression by
attempting to dress to the norm, they can still feel the effects of heavily policed gender
boundaries. Four times the number of LGBTQ workers than non-LBGTQ workers—
respectively, 16% and 4%—reported that they have been told or it has been implied that they
should try to be more feminine or masculine in their style (Fidas & Cooper, 2014).

8
Leader relationships with others in the workplace are further complicated by role
incongruity, in which a leader’s behavior falls outside the range of expected stereotypes for men
and women (Eagly, 2005; Eagly & Karau, 2002). Leadership is seen as male (Eagly, 2005; Eagly
& Karau, 2002; Ritter & Yoder, 2004; Yoder, 2001); gay men are perceived as effeminate
(Carmichael, 1992; Lehavot & Lambert, 2007); and lesbians are perceived as masculine—three
stereotypes that contribute to a maelstrom of role incongruity where gay men can be perceived as
weak leaders and lesbians can be rejected for being perceived as too male (Lehavot & Lambert,
2007). In librarianship, this state of affairs is made more fraught—though from a research
perspective, also more interesting—by the feminized nature of the profession, a field estimated
to be between 79% and 85% female (AFL-CIO, n.d.; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017). For
leaders of all kinds of institutions, sexual identity disclosure has the added complexity of the
public nature of their roles. Even the most sotto voce leaders are expected to be highly visible in
their organizations (Northouse, 2013; Yukl, 2013). Leadership scholars posit that “relational
transparency” is a central characteristic of “authentic” leaders; this transparency is defined as
occurring when leaders “share their core feelings, motives, and inclinations with others in an
appropriate manner” (Northouse, 2013, p. 264). The mantra of “relatability” is repeated in a
widely used standard textbook for library management (Steuart, Moran, & Morner, 2013, p. 362)
and also appears in popular leadership literature (Miller, 2015). However, feminist scholarship
points out that self-expression and transparency in leaders are only welcome insofar as what is
expressed maps to expected norms for leaders (Eagly, 2005)—the parameters for which are
implicitly embedded in Northouse’s qualifying phrase, “appropriate manner,” and presume that
there are no intervening stereotypes degrading this relatability, assumptions explored in depth
later in this study, particularly in Chapter 8 in a discussion of transformational leadership.

9
Despite these challenges, a growing number of people who openly identify as LGBTQ
are thriving in the workplace and ascending into leadership roles across many industries,
including libraries in higher education. To address one possible explanation—that these leaders
live in areas with high acceptance of LBGTQ people—not all LGBTQ leaders in higher
education live in LGBTQ-welcoming areas. In a study of sexual identity disclosure among
academic library directors, eight out of ten participants lived in parts of the country typically
associated with conservative behavior (Schneider, 2016), and other studies of openly LGBTQ
academic leaders include participants from many parts of the United States (Andreas, 2005;
Bullard, 2013; Christo, 2015; Coon, 2001; Kenney, 2008; Mathes, 2007). In this study, as
Chapter 3 describes, participants’ communities ranged from ultra-liberal urban enclaves to small
towns in conservative areas. Factors other than the accidents of time and place are contributing to
the ability of these rarae aves to flourish in leadership roles.
There are parallels between the life status of living openly with a concealable difference
and the nature of being a leader that hint of yet-unanswered research questions. Leadership,
particularly as it is conceptualized in North America in this era, is strongly agentic, that is, “more
assertive, independent, competitive, daring, and courageous” (Carli & Eagly, 1999, p. 209; see
also Eagly, 2005; Eagly & Johannesen-Schmidt, 2001; Fassinger et al., 2010; Northouse, 2013;
Yoder, 2001). Current definitions of leadership emphasize the ability to influence others to create
change and do things they would not otherwise do (Bolman & Deal, 2008; Bolman & Gallos,
2011; Northouse, 2013; Pfeffer, 1992, 2010; Yukl, 2013). Leadership, like sexual identity
disclosure, can thus be viewed as a temporal and developmental process involving a series of
strategic decisions, minor to momentous. Viewed through the lens of leadership research, sexual
identity disclosure has close parallels to the organizational change process. Disclosure asserts the

10
right to be different without loss of status, a symbolic rejection of the claims implicit in
presumptive cis/heteronormativity and an assertion that forever alters, or queers, the relationship
between actor and target.
Another quality of concealable differences relevant to this study is that decision-making
is ingrained in the disclosure experience; encounters with new people and new situations require
new decisions about disclosure. Ragins (2004, 2008) built on Coleman (1982) to posit that at
least as sexual identity is understood in the Western world, the declaration of sexual identity is
not a single event happening in one place and one moment, but instead is a developmental
process that includes a series of small and large decisions made repeatedly over time, beginning
with the disclosure to self and then widening across life domains such as family, workplace, and
community. Decision-making—a hallmark of leader behavior—is thus a continuous life practice
for people with concealable differences. An earlier study of lesbian and gay academic library
leaders (Schneider, 2016) found incidental evidence that disclosure in the workplace has a wide
range of expression, such as nonverbal signaling through dress, office decorations such as
rainbow flags and photos of same-gender spouses, and explicit statements of sexual identity,
either as simple declarations or yoked within a situation such as a job interview or an invitation
to a formal event to which a spouse is invited. A well-tested scale for disclosure among lesbians
has five scalar points, of which the final two are “told, but never speak of it” and “told and speak
freely without hesitation” (van Dam, 2015, p. 1326; also see Appendix F), demonstrating that
even the extent of disclosure within a specific life domain such as the workplace is a decision
that can be modulated to a finely-tuned degree.
The relationship between minority leader identity and leadership continues to be
understudied, despite calls for more research (Eagly & Chin, 2010; Fassinger et al., 2010). A

11
small body of literature from the fields of education and psychology probes leadership in the
context of sexual identity and concealable differences (Andreas, 2005; Bullard, 2013; Christo,
2015; Coon, 2001; Kenney, 2008; Mathes, 2007; Schneider, 2016). However, Henking et al.
(2014), in a non-scholarly article featuring brief interviews with “six current and past presidents
of colleges and universities who are openly gay,” commented on the continued gulf of research
about sexual identity within leadership studies, noting that “much of the current literature about
LBGTQ falls into the category of deficit-based research, which can be described as stemming
from negative beliefs and assumptions regarding gays” (pp. 60–61). Deficit-based research offers
useful contributions to the body of knowledge about workplace behavior and attitudes and is a
corrective to negative stereotypes, so it is not surprising that Fassinger et al. (2010), grounded in
the field of psychology, would focus on the experience of marginalization as a key component of
their proposed research agenda. But deficit-based research does not unlock the door to better
understanding what Fassinger et al. (2010) referred to as the enactment of sexual identity in the
context of leadership, or in other words, the relationship between on the one hand, the leadership
of organizations populated with followers, peers, and superiors who bring their own complex
selves into workplace dynamics, and on the other, the intentional expression of the leader’s
authentic, though discredited, self. This is a question that has yet to be examined within the
framework of the epistemological assumptions of leadership research.
This study is long overdue. There are well-established if not entirely understood
connections between organizational diversity and organizational excellence, as well as
correlations between innovation and organizations with co-workers of different demographics
but shared values (Jehn, Northcraft, & Neale, 1999; Milliken & Martins, 1996). A summary of
research into organizational diversity concluded that diversity has positive affective results and

12
also leads to better decision-making; “diversity in observable attributes (ethnicity
and nationality) may affect the cognitive outcomes (number of alternatives considered, quality of
ideas, degree of cooperation in complex tasks) in groups in potentially positive ways” (Milliken
& Martins, 1996, p. 416). Ward and Winstanley (2003) posit that sexual identity nondisclosure is
unhealthy for organizations because it creates “negative space” where discourse is muted or
censored. Yet despite well-intended efforts to diversify librarianship, this profession is much as it
was nearly a century ago: not only, as noted earlier, overwhelmingly female, but also 90% white
(American Library Association, Office for Research and Statistics, 2012). Recruitment initiatives
in ALA such as the Spectrum Scholarship and the Initiative to Recruit a Diverse Workforce have
increased the ethnic diversity of librarians in library school and in entry-level positions, but
minority representation of any type dwindles as professionals climb the managerial ladder, with
unidentified centripetal forces at work propelling minority librarians out of the profession. The
precise demographics of academic library leaders are unknown, but anecdotally only a fraction
of the leaders for the nearly 5,000 postsecondary libraries in the United States are visibly diverse
in ethnicity or sexual identity, with a higher presence of presumptively heterosexual white males
among the leadership, despite net increases in female recruitment over the last twenty-five years
(American Library Association, Office for Research and Statistics, 2009).
A diverse workforce has the prima facie advantage of fairly representing the world we
live in as well as the diverse communities served by academic libraries, and from a social-justice
perspective needs no other rationale. However, the organizational value of diversity and the
corresponding cost of homogeneity have far deeper implications for academic libraries. Due to
seismic changes in information technology, academic libraries have seen an “inexorable decline
in purchasing power, in some cases diminished influence on campus, and (perhaps most

13
troubling) erosion of their fabled status as sole provider or even preferred purveyor of
information” (Wood, Miller, & Knapp, 2007, p. 4). Rather than confront this crisis head-on, too
many library leaders practice incrementalism, focusing their management efforts on the annual
ritual of responding to static budgets and rising costs by determining what subscriptions to drop
and what services to curtail. In a typical example, from 1995 to 2015, the California State
University library system, the largest four-year public university library system in the United
States, saw a 20% increase in total allocations to its libraries, from $90 million to $108 million
(California State University, 2015), but in the same period consumer inflation rose 55% (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015), diminishing actual purchasing power for these libraries by a
third. Meanwhile, a crisis in scholarly publishing has been destabilizing library collections and
budgets. From 1986 to 2005, the cost of academic journals—the backbone of scholarly library
collections—increased in cost 273% (SPARC, n.d.), while the ownership model for scholarly
journals has been made vulnerable through shifting from the purchase of physical volumes to
what amounts to the annual rental, called “licensing,” of online journals. A crisis of this
magnitude in other professions might prompt major reassessment and change, but for this library
system as for many others, the crisis has led to shrinking workforces, weakened collections, and
a phenomenon this author refers to as “subsistence farming,” in which innovation and change
management too often take a back seat to providing the basic, necessary library services that can
be eked out with a workforce whittled to half-strength over two decades. Without singling out
the California State system, but rather, to underscore its orthodoxy, it is worth noting that for
most of those two decades, its leadership has been disproportionately white, male, and publicly
cis/heteronormative.
Wood et al. (2007) asserted that librarians need to “set their sights on more than survival”

14
(p. 6) in order to create the organizational change required to save libraries from extinction. To
take just one example, with materials prices rising, if not leaping, annually, there will come a
time where libraries will need to speak truth to the power of the scholarly-industrial complex and
put their weight behind new models of scholarly communication such as open access.
Diversifying academic library leadership would thus appear to be a necessary component of
creating the groundwork for innovation, change, and radical departures from business as usual, a
process that could be thought of as “queering” the norms of academic leadership; and sexual
identity, which Carmichael (1992) called the last socially acceptable prejudice, is an important
facet of that diversification. Alire (2001), discussing the value (and lack) of diversity in academic
libraries, noted the importance of “visible minorities” (p. 96; her emphasis) and the cultural
competencies they bring to the table. Though Alire limited her discussion to racial and ethnic
minorities,2 there is strong relevance to her observation that minority leaders, who by definition
have prevailed despite prejudice, marginalization, and lack of peer mentors, have the courage to
act—a concept worth exploring in this study.
Also relevant to organizational change in libraries is that visible LGBTQ status is, at least
nominally, a choice. (Chapter 8 explores identity management disconnects where participants
shared stories of others identifying them as LGBTQ when they believed they had successfully
concealed their identities.) If Heifetz, Grashow, and Linksky (2009) are correct that change can
only happen in a culture of “courageous conversations” (p. 67), then there is the potential for a
leader’s declarative nature of sexual identity disclosure to have the symbolic power to counteract
what Milliken, Morrison, and Hewlin (2003) referred to as the “mum effect” (p. 1454) in which
employees are reluctant to speak up about challenges and opportunities for the workplace.
It is a reflection of the rapid progress of LGBTQ visibility and acceptance that in 2001 Alire
identified sexual orientation as a non-visible minority.
2

15
This study addresses the need for research that “brings forth real, authentic narratives
from LGBTQ individuals from all walks of life” (Henking et al., p. 60), including organizational
leaders.3 The literature gap about sexual identity and leadership begins at the most basic level of
scholarly communication: the college textbook. Sexual identity is ignored entirely in the most
recent edition of Leadership: Theory and Practice (Northouse, 2013), a textbook “used at more
than 1500 institutions in 89 countries and translated into 12 different languages” (SAGE, n.d.).
The most recent edition of another textbook in widespread use, Leadership in Organizations,
makes one brief reference to LGBTQ status with the anachronistic phrase, “sexual preference,”
and strictly in relation to followers, not leaders, revealing an implicit assumption that sexual
minorities cannot be leaders (Yukl, 2013, p. 360). In the field of library science, a popular library
management textbook is silent on LGBTQ issues and also presents diversity as a characteristic of
followers, not leaders (Steuart et al., 2013).
Inattention to sexual orientation and gender identity not only creates a literature gap, but
is a distinct if implicit message to future leaders and leadership scholars, LGBTQ and otherwise,
that despite repeated calls for attention from other disciplines, this area of study is not of value.
Yet in 2016 Schneider, summarizing current leadership theories from Pfeffer (1992, 2010) and
others, observed that “modern leaders live highly intentional lives where clothing, office
location, language, allies, and sometimes even friends and life partners are calculated choices
selected at least partially in service of success as a leader” (p. 721). It stands to reason that the
enactment of something so fundamental to the construction of self as sexual or gender identity
has to be meaningful within the context of the practice of leadership. This study therefore also
This argument to move away from deficit-based research came from seven co-authors who are
university presidents with LGBTQ identities; six hail from the humanities and only one from
psychology—though again, none from the field of leadership per se.

16
contributes to the growing body of leadership research into gender, ethnicity, and cross-cultural
identity, and the complex relationships among leaders and other stakeholders where these issues
are relevant.
By focusing on identity enactment, this study contributes to evidence-based literature
about what leadership actually looks like as practiced within modern organizations, and offers
insights lacking from the many studies and handbooks that focus on “testing hypotheses intended
to refine and add to long lists of features and contingencies for what makes an ideal leader, rather
than illuminating the nature of the work of leadership” (Dodge, Ospina, & Foldy, 2005, p. 287).
This study also highlights the changing nature of academic libraries and counteracts common
misconceptions about academic library services. Within library research, a diary-based study of
what academic library leaders do all day revealed that these leaders spend a preponderance of
their time fundraising; interacting with peer and senior campus administrators; adjudicating
personnel issues; advocating for the library; and creating, shaping, and maintaining the library’s
symbolic presence on campus (Hernon, Powell, & Young, 2004). It could be inferred from this
study that academic library leadership is more complex and robust than the traditional (and
gendered) view of librarians as curators of library collections, suggesting that a rich portrait of
academic leadership is politically valuable to share with the broader academy.
Finally, to explore sexual and gender minority status as enacted within the context of
leadership adds to the social action value of this study, suggesting that new areas of leadership
research can have their origins from outside the presumptive and implicit default starting point of
cis/heteronormative experience that has defined so much previous research in leadership and
other disciplines. In addition to contributing to the bodies of knowledge of leadership
effectiveness and minority leadership, this study will also be valuable to human resource

17
directors, instructors in leadership programs, higher education administrators, and aspiring
LGBTQ leaders.
Declaration of Author’s Stance
Human activity is limned by belief systems acted out for the most part implicitly and
unconsciously (Goffman, 1963), and scholarly endeavors are no exception. The author agrees
with Charmaz (2014) that researchers “are not passive receptacles into which data are
poured….We are not scientific observers who can dismiss scrutiny of our values by claiming
scientific neutrality and authority” (p. 27). This author’s declaration of reflexivity acknowledges
an implicitly held, social constructivist stance driven by a core assumption that “individuals
develop subjective meanings of their experiences,” and that these subjective meanings “are not
simply imprinted on individuals but are formed through interactions with others” (Creswell,
2014, p. 8). This stance has clear implications for this study, most significantly that the
conclusions of this research are co-created by the dialogs between the investigator and the
participants. The author also acknowledges that everything from her choice of topic to her
research questions and procedures is influenced by her status as a white, middle-class, cisgender,
feminist, left-leaning, Boomer-generation, lesbian academic library leader. The data quality
section of this study in Chapter 3 explains how this study addresses reflexivity, and the reader
can balance this defense against the chapters that follow, in which as much as possible the
investigator steps back to let the participants share their lived experiences intact and in their own
voices.

18
Chapter 2: Literature Review
The chains of inquiry addressed in this chapter, which cross the literature of LGBTQ
leadership, stigma theory, disclosure and identity enactment, and leadership writ large, set the
stage for this study, pointing to the value of exploring sexual identity expression in the context of
organizational leadership.
LGBTQ Leadership
A small body of research establishes a connection between living openly as a gay man or
lesbian and the practice of leadership (Andreas, 2005; Bullard, 2013; Christo, 2015; Coon, 2001;
Kenney, 2008; Mathes, 2007; Schneider, 2016). These studies can be grouped as either deficitbased research (q.v., Andreas, 2005) or affirmation-based research—the latter being studies that
conclude there are inherent, if difficult to confirm, advantages to LGBTQ leadership, though
these studies do not tightly connect the enactment of sexual identity with the practice of
leadership (Bullard, 2013; Christo, 2015; Coon, 2001; Kenney, 2008; Mathes, 2007; Schneider,
2016). Of these seven authors, six are from the field of education and the seventh (this author) is
concerned with managerial leadership in the information professions. Andreas, Bullard, Christo,
and Mathes use phenomenology as their research method; Kenney uses microethnography;
Schneider uses grounded theory; and Coon uses an undefined qualitative method.
This body of work, built by openly lesbian and gay doctoral students, is laudable for its
pioneering spirit, and the research direction for this proposal honors this chain of inquiry. Yet
these studies reveal the need for more research into the actual practice of sexual and gender
identity expression in the context of leadership as it plays out in contemporary organizations.
Fassinger et al. (2010) recognized Coon (2001) for his study based on a postal mail survey of 50
self-identified openly lesbian and gay leaders from across the United States. However, while

19
Coon (2001) asserted that “coming out significantly impacted the leadership experience” (p.
131), the expression of the subjects’ disclosure and identity enactment did not come under
scrutiny. The objects of disclosure were also not clear in this study, as the research subjects came
from a mix of cis/heteronormative-majority and LGBTQ-majority workplaces, and the study
overall is epistemologically vague, describing the research method as qualitative research rather
than identifying a specific method. Yet Coon’s study has utility in its conclusions that “the vast
majority [of leaders in this study] believed their being out had positively impacted their personal
lives” (Coon, 2001, p. 132), a theme that persists across the studies that follow, and that was by
no means a foregone conclusion for openly-LGTBQ leaders when Coon gathered this data in the
late 1990s. Coon’s study was bolstered by participants completing the Leadership Practices
Inventory (LPI) (Kouzes & Posner, 1997) and the Q-Factor Study, from which findings appear
that anticipate later studies, such as the role others play in helping employees move forward
organizationally (Mathes, 2007), which Schneider (2016) labeled road-paving.
Andreas (2005), the first researcher known to focus on LGBTQ leaders in higher
education, conducted a phenomenological study of five openly lesbian community college
administrators in the state of Washington. Andreas’ primary conclusion was that marginalization
presented obstacles to the participants, but there are interesting hints related to the enactment of
identity, such as the administrator who was concerned with “not overwhelming or making others
uncomfortable with her sexual orientation” (p. 61). Mathes (2007) interviewed 13 higher
education leaders with concealable differences, seven of whom were lesbian or gay, “to learn
what influenced their success” (p. 4), and found they were “empathic with others with
differences” (p. 97). Mathes’ emphasis was on the lived experiences of leaders with concealable
differences, not disclosure, and several of his participants were not open about their identity.

20
However, some of Mathes’ interviews with lesbian and gay participants yielded examples of
rich, thick description of interactions of identity between LGBTQ leaders and others, such as the
political fire taken by a university president for hiring an “out gay administrator to work with
teenagers” (Mathes, 2007, p. 144).
Kenney (2008) used microethnography to examine “the ways by which five lesbian
leaders in community colleges applied their own inimitable culture to overcome the ubiquitous
domination of an exclusive heterosexual culture” (p. 45), and found that these leaders, “who
considered themselves fully out” (p. 57) sought redress for injustice. Kenney did not specifically
address the identity enactments that led to marginalization, but the study is notable for
recognizing the role of disclosure in decision-making and the emotional labor required to
shoulder the “omnipresent cloud of oppression that often force[s] lesbians to finely sift through
every thought, emotion, and action prior to engaging with anyone in any way” (Kenney, 2008, p.
33). Of value is Kenney’s focus on uncovering “tacit knowledge, the information members of
this culture know but do not talk about or convey directly” (p. 53), particularly the means
through which tacit knowledge about identity is communicated with other organizational
members.
Bullard (2013), interviewing 13 openly lesbian and gay university presidents, concluded
that “leaders were comfortable with who they were” (p. 151). Bullard did not examine the
implicit models of “who they were,” at least as enacted in organizational settings, but the
vignettes about the organizational experiences of these administrators, who were all openly
LGBTQ in their presidential search processes, hint at careful management of expression during
leader-follower dynamics. Christo (2015) examined self-perception of leadership effectiveness
among eight lesbian and gay higher-education leaders. While Christo limited the description of

21
identity enactment to the broad category of disclosure, the section on the role of partners as a
method of disclosure echoed the findings in Schneider (2016) of the antecedents and
consequences of sexual identity disclosure among 10 lesbian and gay academic library deans and
directors whose partners and spouses served as metonyms of disclosure for gaging acceptance of
lesbian and gay leaders.
All told, these seven studies are useful and important pioneering research in LGBTQ
leadership. Their investigations emphasize the centrality of sexual identity enactment while
stopping short of articulating the expression of this enactment as practiced by these subjects and
as experienced by the people in their organizations. Without diminishing the timely contributions
of these studies, they collectively make the case for the research direction of this study.
Improving the tensile strength of the chain of reasoning for any area of scholarship is a worthy
goal, and even more so when the subject is entwined with phenomena as widespread and
significant as stigma, sexual identity, and leadership.
Stigma Theory
LGBTQ leadership research would be meaningless without the context of stigma to
provide the reflective backdrop against which the enactment of sexual identity becomes
significant. Goffman (1963) observed that over a decade of research predated his book on the
topic, yet it was the publication of Stigma and his systematic review of “the structural
preconditions of stigma” (p. 2) that launched wide rivers of theory flowing over five decades of
scholarship. The following review addresses the areas of stigma theory that appear most salient
to the context of sexual identity enactment and leadership.
Why stigma exists is a mystery beyond the reach of this proposal, though Crocker et al.
(1998) speculate that “The universality of social stigma suggests that it may have functional

22
value for the individual who stigmatizes, for the group from which he or she comes, for the
society, or for all of these” (p. 508). How stigma exists is a conversation that has dominated
stigma research for five decades. Goffman can be misread as quaint, with his anachronistic
vocabulary and his failure to recognize, as Ragins (2008) puts it, that “views of stigmas may
change over time” (p. 196). But Waskul and Vannini (2006) observed that Goffman had a
sophisticated view of the body as the enactment of stigma,4 and it is not a stretch to say that
theory caught up with Goffman on this point. In keeping with the trend away from objectivism in
many research fields, and perhaps encouraged by Goffman’s own emphasis on the body as a
symbolic staging ground, stigma has evolved conceptually from a status grounded in objective
fact—someone is, for example, homosexual or alcoholic, and when that stigma is observable,
that person is discredited—to an understanding that whether a condition is in Goffman’s terms
“discredited” is relative to time, place, and shared cultural understanding (Crocker et al., 2005).
Stigma is not an isolated cultural phenomenon, but happens in a larger social context in
which there is “cooperative interdependence on the content of stereotype” (Ridgeway, 2001, p.
638). Muller (1987), working in the area of LGBTQ psychology, created a taxonomy of four
reactions to sexual identity disclosure by family members: loving denial, resentful denial, loving
open, and hostile recognition (Appendix G). This taxonomy, while apparently untested, has
remained stable to date, continues to be cited, and appears to have no correlate in other
disciplines. Link and Phelan (2001) argued that social structures such as hierarchy and power
relationships contribute to the conditions for stigma, which are created “when elements
of labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination occur together in a power
situation that allows them” (p. 367). Regardless of epistemological disagreements about the
Goffman’s work on stigma was no doubt informed by his earlier work on the presentation of
self (Goffman, 1956), a precursor rarely mentioned in stigma literature.
4

23
causes of stigma, researchers across disciplines agree that shared cultural understanding of the
stigma is a prerequisite. The labeler and the labeled must agree that this social status exists even
if these two groups disagree, consciously or otherwise, on the implications of the status (Crocker
et al., 1998; Link & Phelan, 2001; Ridgeway, 2001). Stigma is so powerful it can extend to
associates of or surrogates for the stigmatized such as family, co-workers, and friends, a
phenomenon Goffman (1963) termed courtesy stigma, which Herek (2007) observed could result
in stigma avoidance behavior by these surrogates.
The actions, internal and external, of the stigmatized and those stigmatizing have also
been the subject of extensive research. Though Crocker et al. (1998) pointed to “the diversity of
attitudes, values, and concerns that nonstigmatized individuals may bring to these interactions”
(p. 539), there is a long chain of inquiry about the practice of stigmatizing that points to a pattern
of disconnects between what people say they believe, what they think they believe, and their
unconscious beliefs (Crocker et al., 1998; Crosby, Bromley, & Saxe, 1980; Fidas & Cooper,
2014; Fiske, 1998; Gaertner & Dovidio, 1986; McConahay, 1986). Current theory holds that
primes—the cues that trigger stereotyping and stigma—can be automatically and rapidly
activated and generate stereotypes and concomitant stigma whether or not people consciously
agree with the stereotype they are assigning or that are assigned to them, a phenomenon known
as stereotype automaticity (Fiske, 1998). Primes may be highly visible and intentional, such as a
clear statement about one’s identity or a gay-themed sign on an office door, but primes can also
be “minimal nonverbal cues” that are barely perceptible to others and whether deliberately or
unintentionally projected, may signal sexual identity to other sexual minorities—the
phenomenon known informally as “gaydar”—but also, whether intentionally or otherwise, to
heterosexuals (Rule, 2016). Fiske (1998), observing that “many Americans are fundamentally

24
ambivalent about stigmatized individuals” (p. 512), adds that ambivalence or anxiety about
specific stigmas can also serve as cues for stigmatizing behavior.
Current theory holds that stigmas have a pecking order in terms of how stigmatizing they
are for the targets. Crocker et al. (1998) proposed that “the key dimensions of stigma are
visibility and controllability” (p. 505), a conceptualization that has remained stable through this
decade (Hogg, 2013). Visibility refers to whether a stigma can be observed, and its mention
evokes the first chapter of Stigma, in which Goffman describes how the word—from the ancient
Latin, a visible mark or brand, derived from the Greek word steizen, for tattoo (MerriamWebster, 2016)—became associated with the practice of cutting and burning people to “expose
something unusual and bad about the moral status of the signifier” (Goffman, 1963, p. 1).
Controllability describes to what degree others perceive the stigma to be within the person’s
ability to control, such as the debate about whether homosexuality is a “choice.” People with
stigmas are continuously aware of their difference and its implications: “[O]ne of the hallmark
features of the experience of being stigmatized is the ever-present possibility that one will be the
target of prejudice and discrimination” (Crocker et al., 1998, p. 513), an awareness Herek (2007)
calls “felt stigma” that results in hyper-vigilance on the part of the stigmatized.
Scholarship on stigma suggests that while the awareness of stigmatization does not
automatically cause low personal or collective self-esteem, “individuals who have a devalued
social identity may see their situation as fair and legitimate, and may not feel stigmatized, if they
accept the legitimating myths of their culture” (Crocker et al., 1998, p. 510). Elaborating on this
argument, Dovidio, Major, and Crocker (2000) proposed that sexual identity stigma may result in
poor self-esteem and internalized homophobia, a theory amplified by Igartua, Gill, and Montoro
(2003). Steele, Spencer, and Aronson (2002), following a trail of reasoning for “what is known

25
in the standardized testing literature as the underperformance phenomenon” (p. 579), developed
the concept of “stereotype threat,” in which “the pressure imposed by the relevance of a negative
stereotype” (p. 382) produces the stereotypical behavior the person is trying to avoid. Brown and
Pinel (2003), who studied women and math testing, found that heightened stigma consciousness
leads to increased stereotype threat. For the stigmatized, another negative outcome is the stress
created by hyper-vigilance (Crocker et al., 1998), in which the stigmatized bear the emotional
labor of continuously monitoring the reactions of others. Rios and Stewart (2015), interviewing
41 faculty and engineers who were people of color, found that nearly half (44%) reported “a
heightened sense of responsibility because of their high visibility as tokens in their departments”
including overcompensating “in order to dispel negative stereotypes” (p. 305), reinforcing the
concept of hyper-vigilance on the part of the stigmatized.
Disclosure and Identity Enactment
The organizational setting is a major context for discrimination against stigmatized
people, making the decision to disclose in the workplace rich with implications. A growing body
of research addresses sexual identity disclosure in the workplace (Button, 2001, 2004; ChrobotMason et al., 2001; Creed & Scully, 2000; Fidas & Cooper, 2014; Gates, 2012, 2014; Griffith &
Hebl, 2002; Ragins, 2008; Ragins et al., 2007; Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow, 2013; Woods,
1994). One phenomenon of disclosure is that it may vary by situation and setting, and even vary
within a single setting, such as the workplace, where, for example, someone may be out to
immediate peers but not out to employees in other units (Button, 2004; Ragins, 2008).
Van Dam (2015), discussing the evolution of ALIDA-II (A Lesbian Identity Disclosure
Assessment), a scale for measuring disclosure first developed a decade earlier, observed that
concealment or disclosure is not an “all-or-nothing phenomenon” (p. 1315). Just as individuals

26
may selectively disclose across different life domains (Ragins et al., 2007; see also Ragins,
2008), they may also “employ a combination of strategies in the workplace, rather than relying
on a single identity management strategy” (Chrobot-Mason et al., 2001, p. 324). Summarizing
the work of Woods (1994) and others, Chrobot-Mason et al. (2001) offered three categories for
concealment strategies: counterfeiting, or active dissembling to create a “false heterosexual
identity”; avoiding, or the use of “continuous self-editing and half-truths” as well as redirected
conversations; and integration, in which “ the individual reveals his or her true sexual identity
and attempts to manage the consequences” (pp. 323–324). An articulated model of identity
management was implicitly verified by the work of van Dam (2008, 2015), whose 15-question
disclosure instrument for lesbians, ALIDA-II, has been repeatedly tested and modified, and is
complementary to the work of Clair et al. (2005), whose two-factor model of passing and
revealing in the workplace included subfactors such as concealment, enabling their model to
broadly correlate to the three-factor model proposed by Chrobot-Mason et al. (2001).
Leadership
Along with stigma and disclosure theory, the dominant assumptions of modern leadership
theory are embedded in the research direction of this study. As the earlier discussions of
sexuality and gender emphasize, today’s leadership culture is presumptively cis/heteronormative.
The implicit view of leadership as white, male, and cis/heteronormative is periodically reinforced
in popular literature, such as the New York Times editorial that called for a “father figure” to lead
the country out of its post-9/11 gloom (Rich, 2001, as quoted in Eagly, 2005, p. 459). As late as
2004, the Harvard Business Review published a reflection by a major leadership scholar that
situated the “stages of leadership” along a masculinized timeline of “infant, schoolboy, lover,
soldier, general, statesman, and sage,” only partially mitigated by one example (out of seven)

27
based on a new female leader, who—in a nakedly gendered example—has to decide whether to
keep or drop old friends (Bennis, 2005, p. 48). This nostrum and its brethren naïvely reinforce
the positivistic, trait-based, and presumptively cis/heteronormative “great man” models that
dominated the study of leadership in the twentieth century and reflect the current state of
leadership as continuing to be predominately white, male, heterosexual, and cisgender, even in
female-dominant professions such as librarianship, where the relatively high percentage of male
administrators suggests male librarians are disproportionately groomed to ascend to the
administrative suite via the glass escalator.
Contemporary leadership theories have yet to entirely abandon the great-man model, at
least as it surfaces implicitly in research design and data selection. Resonant leadership theory
builds its logic on a set of case studies that Drath (2006) observed are leader-focused and that in
the foundational text overwhelmingly rely on male subjects; the lone full case of a female leader
is a cautionary tale about her over-aggressive behavior (Boyatzis & McKee, 2005), a lesson that
was intended to be about the need for leaders to be in tune with their emotions, but through a
feminist lens is more about the implicit influence of role incongruity in leadership studies. Yet
awareness of implicit assumptions of the nature of leadership has slowly expanded to begin
including angles of analysis such as different behaviors of male and female leaders; the dynamics
between leaders and followers, including follower beliefs and prejudices; and leader and
follower behaviors that emphasize communication and engagement (Eagly & Chin, 2010; Eagly
& Johannesen-Schmidt, 2001; Northouse, 2013; Yoder, 2001). Despite these advances, Eagly
and Chin (2010) also noted that discussions of diversity and leadership in handbooks and
textbooks, when they do appear, continue to be sequestered in special chapters on diversity,
rather than integrated more broadly into the texts.

28
Taken together, the research direction of this study, and the literature of LGBTQ
leadership, stigma theory, disclosure and identity enactment, and leadership present the need for
research questions designed to plumb the depths of this phenomena as well as complementary
research methods that can coax forth rich data that give depth, shape, and texture to the figures in
the carpet emerging in earlier research.

Chapter 3: Method
Reflective Inquiry
The reflective inquiry underpinning this study has its origins in an incident in which the
author, a librarian and writer experienced in fact-checking, had difficulty verifying what
appeared to her to be a simple data point for the introduction to a research study (Schneider,
2016): the number of openly LGBTQ library deans or directors who led libraries that were
members of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). The more leaders in this organization
she asked, the more answers she received, and it became clear that each individual she queried
held implicit, and unique, theories of sexual identity disclosure and enactment. Like Humpty
Dumpty, the respondents were confident they knew what they meant, but like Alice, this author
saw that the same words meant many things. The troublesome knowledge generated by this
incident led the author to conclude that her study was promising in terms of suggesting the
mental models that framed daily life for LGBTQ academic library leaders, but would have been
improved through buttressing the investigation with more and better data about what the
participants meant, and experienced, through their enactment of identity.
Theoretical Framework
As Anfara and Mertz (2014) observe, “Theory is unavoidable, whether explicitly or
implicitly used” (p. 15). They argue for the utility of theoretical frameworks, which “situate
research within a scholarly conversation,” but also note that the concept lacks “a clear and
consistent definition” (p. 15). In this study, the term is used two ways. First, “theoretical
framework” is used in its most common meaning, that of a declaration of the theories driving this
study (Anfara & Mertz, 2014; Creswell, 2013). Second, in a less-common but also valuable
usage, it refers to the declaration of the author’s stance (Walker & Solvason, 2014).

30
Central to the first definition of a theoretical framework is that whether implicit or
declared, theory is a driving force in research that “delineates the main things to be studied and
‘the presumed relationships among them’” (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 18, as quoted in Anfara
& Mertz, 2014, p. 12). Theory, in this sense, means “any empirical or quasi-empirical theory of
social and/or psychological processes, at a variety of levels (e.g., grand, mid-range,
and explanatory), that can be applied to the understanding of phenomena” and can be used as a
lens or sieve with which to focus research (Anfara & Mertz, 2014, p. 15). Theory also “plays a
key role in framing and conducting almost every aspect of the study (e.g., development of
purpose statement, research questions, data collection protocols and approaches, and analysis)”
(Anfara, 2008, p. 870), and also makes research easier to interpret from the perspective of other
disciplines (Anfara & Mertz, 2014). Thus the theoretical framework for this study provides
essential building blocks to ensure the investigation and its findings are rigorous and wellgrounded.
Theories Used in This Study
The four theories explicitly used in this study are stigma, disclosure, transformational
leadership, and life course theory.
Stigma Theory and Disclosure
The stigma theory informing this study is the modern conception of stigma as a social
construct based on shared understanding of the discredited status (Crocker et al., 1998) enacted
and influenced by social hierarchy and power (Link & Phelan, 2001) in which the body is a
major proving ground (Goffman, 1963). For disclosure, this study will use as its starting point
the general theoretical consensus that LGBTQ disclosure and subsequent expression are
developmental processes that can differ across life domains (Button, 2001; Coleman, 1982;

31
Ragins, 2004, 2008); broadly align with a three-factor model of counterfeiting, avoiding, and
integration (Chrobot-Mason et al., 2001); are not one-time events, but ongoing life phenomena of
identity expression that require continuous decision-making (Button, 2001; Ragins, 2004, 2008);
can include a wide variety of cues such as verbal utterances or writing, dress, mannerisms, and
artifacts (Hutson, 2010; Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow, 2013; Woods, 1994); may or may not be
accompanied by or result in lowered self-esteem (Dovidio et al., 2000; Igartua, et al., 2003); and
also—and of particular significance for this study—have a range of enactment that is domainspecific (home, work, and other relationships) and gradient, such as the six-point scale used in
the ALIDA-II lesbian disclosure measurement (van Dam, 2015).
Transformational Leadership
Transformational leadership (Bass & Avolio, 1994; Bass & Riggio, 2006; Burns, 1978) is
the leadership theory used in this study. At present transformational leadership is the prevailing
leadership theory (Northouse, 2013). This does not make this theory correct in any sense other
than as a predominant de facto mental model of how leadership is broadly understood to operate.
Transformational leadership emerged through the work of Burns (1978), who proposed a twofactor model in which transactional leaders focus on the transactional relationships between
leaders and followers, such as work for pay and management by exception, while
transformational leaders engage with followers in a mutual process of “raising one another to
higher levels of morality and motivation” (Burns, 1978, p. 20). Northouse (2013) describes how
Bass (1985) elaborated on Burns to create a three-factor model that begins with laissez-faire
leadership—a failure to lead aptly described by its translation from the French, “let [them] do”—
and moves through transactional leadership and then on to transformational leadership, which
Bass extended to focus more closely on the needs of followers (Bass, 1985; Bass & Avolio,

32
1991). The theory evolved to include four elements of transformational leadership that
characterize effective transformational leaders: idealized influence, inspirational motivation,
intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration (Bass & Avolio, 1991; Bass & Riggio,
2006; see Table 1, below).

Transformational leadership has also received close attention in the study of gender and
leadership (Ayman & Korabik, 2010; Eagly & Chin, 2010; Eagly & Johannesen-Schmidt, 2001;

33
Eagly, Johannsen-Schmidt, & van Engen, 2003; Yoder, 2001), thus offering a useful theoretical
lens, given the complex relationships among sexual identity, leadership, and gender (Blashill &
Powlishta, 2009; Carmichael, 1992, 1998; Eagly & Chin, 2010; Fassinger et al., 2010).
Furthermore, the theoretical model of transformational leadership is focused on the dynamics
between leaders and followers, suggesting useful parallels with identity enactment, which earns
its meaningfulness due to the shared understanding of the implications of identity expression.
However, confirming transformational leadership is not the goal of this study, and in Chapter 8
this study explores gaps and anomalies where transformational leadership theory falls short in
explaining phenomena.
Life Course Theory
For this study, life course theory provides a framework for further understanding the
trajectories created by the participants’ initial decisions to disclose sexual identity in the
workplace and their subsequent decisions to maintain that visible identity. Life course theory, a
model in widespread use in the social sciences, is informed by five principles: life-span
development, or the idea that “human development and aging are lifelong processes”; agency, or
the role of choices and actions on human lives; time and place, in which the life course is
affected by geographic location and historic events; timing, for which “the same events or
experiences may affect individuals in different ways depending on when they occur in the life
course”; and linked lives, or the impact of interdependence among lives on life courses (Elder,
Johnson, & Crosnoe, 2003, p. 11). Elder et al., explaining the origin of life course theory,
observe that “historical forces shape the social trajectories of family, education, and work, and
they in turn influence behavior and particular lines of development” (2003, p. 2).

34
Insights from life course theory imbue the leaders’ decisions about sexual identity
expression with historical sensitivity. As the world changed, the significance and types of the
leaders’ expression decisions changed as well, as the stories about participating in gay choirs and
same-sex weddings demonstrate. Life course theory also provides a structure for accounting for
key historic events, such as the long era of AIDS or critical moments such as the death of
Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming who in 1998 died five days after being
robbed, beaten, and tied to a fence (Brooke, 1998), which resulted in vigils, protests, theatrical
works, and other LGBTQ activism. To help clarify the historic context for each leader’s life
stories, Appendix H maps key historic events in LGBTQ history against the employment and
disclosure histories of the participants in this study, beginning in 1963, when the participant with
the longest employment history began full-time employment, and ending in 2016, the year the
interviews for this study were conducted. The timeline in Appendix H is selective, and
emphasizes key civil rights events, employment and marriage legislation, LGBTQ-relevant
events specific to the field of librarianship, and events described as significant by participants in
this study.
Objectives and Research Questions
For qualitative research, Creswell (2014) advised creating “one or two central research
questions” (p. 138), a recommendation echoed by Maxwell (2013) and Merriam (2016). The two
primary research questions for this study are how LGBTQ leaders express their identity, and
what happens when they express their identity. The knowledge gap identified earlier shapes the
direction of inquiry for this study into the enactment of sexual identity by academic library
leaders. It is understood that openly LGBTQ leaders express their sexual identity, and the
corpora of disclosure and LGBTQ leadership research suggest why this happens and sometimes

35
documents when it happens. But what has to date remained hazy, and yet critical to clearly
understanding how queer leaders lead, is the “how,” that is, in what manner and degree, and to
whom they expressed their identity; and “what happened”: That is, what happened when they
expressed their identities, and what happened to the people they disclosed to, to other actors on
these stages, and to their organizations.
Procedures
The population under investigation was openly lesbian, gay, and queer-identified
academic library deans and directors in the United States and Canada, drawn from over 5,000
postsecondary institutions. The pool was intentionally broad for pragmatic and epistemological
reasons. The universe of openly LGBTQ academic library directors, though unknown, is
generally understood to be very small; and for qualitative research, Seidman (2013) encourages
variation among participants in interview studies to increase the potential of generating data that
will feel true to the study’s readers (pp. 56–57). At the start of this investigation, a informal poll
of LGBTQ librarians known to the investigator, including two transgender librarians, advised
that it is unlikely there are any openly transgender academic library leaders, and though the door
was left open to recruit sexual minorities other than gay men and lesbians, none stepped forward.
There is clearly a need for research about transgender leaders. Employees with minority gender
identities are understudied, and even transgender-positive works about transgender employees
may implicitly conform to the idea that managerial leaders are cis-identified (that is, nontransgender), as is the case in Sheridan (2009), where a chapter on leadership is directed at how
leaders should support their transgender employees. That said, there is an advantage to limiting
this study to lesbian and gay participants. The LGBTQ population is only united through the very
broad category of sexual identity minority status, and as Schneider (2016) noted, limiting

36
investigations to leaders with minority sexual orientation (versus gender) identities has the
advantage of not confounding what Fassinger and Arseneau (2007) describe as “particular
dimensions of experience that differentiate these…sexual minority groups” (p. 19).
There is no absolute definition of what it means to be “openly” LGBTQ. For this study,
the definition of “out” in the workplace aligns with ALIDA-II scores 4 and 5, where the
participant reports that he or she has intentionally informed most or all workplace stakeholders of
his or her sexual identity, and where the participant and others can discuss the participant’s
sexual identity with relative comfort (see below for further discussion of this instrument). This
definition aligns well with, but is more precise than, the definition used in the survey instrument
developed by Chrobot-Mason et al. (2001): “Most employees in your library are aware you are
openly lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender,” a measurement also used in Schneider (2016).
To help generate rich data pertinent to this investigation, participation was limited to
LGBTQ leaders who had been in their roles as dean or director of their library for at least one
year. There is no directory for this population, but potential subjects were highly likely to be
members of national library associations and the associations’ divisions for academic and
LGBTQ librarians. The investigator used a call for participation on related discussion lists and
social networks to draw a convenience sample of ten subjects, with additional participants
available in the event subjects dropped out or were disqualified.
Regarding the sample size, the investigator settled on a cohort of ten, with the caveat that
the rationales about sample sizes for qualitative studies appear to be more folklore than science.
By analyzing major research design textbooks, Emmel (2013) demonstrated that sample size
recommendations are all over the map and lack evidence-based rationales, and that “there are no
guidelines, tests of adequacy, or power calculations available to establish sample size in

37
qualitative research” (p. 146). With this in mind, the investigator reviewed six earlier studies of
LGBTQ leadership in higher education that used interviews for data collection (Bullard, 2013;
Christo, 2015; Kenney, 2008; Mathes, 2007; Schneider, 2016). These studies used sample sizes
ranging from 5 to 13 participants, for a mean of 9.8, and produced quantities of data that were
thick, interesting, and thematically well-textured. Yuan, Liberman, and Cieri (2006) suggest that
an estimated average conversational speed is 196 words per minute, which for 10 90-minute
interviews had the potential to yield over 176,000 words across all transcripts. Based on this
data, it appeared that 10 was a sample size that was equally manageable and defendable, and that
900 minutes of interviewing would yield salutary quantities of data.
The data collection period was February through June 2016, a period that included the
academic year for the participants, facilitating the likelihood of potential subjects reading and
responding to the call for participation and being available for interviews.
Methodology
Merriam (2016) stated that research questions “determine how data are to be collected”
(p. 78), a view corroborated by Creswell, who credited Morse (1994) with observing that
research questions can be “encoded with the language” of the research method used in the study
(Creswell, 2013, p. 139). Narrative inquiry is a qualitative research method that is a good fit for
the research questions in this study, which resemble “research puzzles” (Clandinin, 2013, pp.
42–43) that, like all good stories, begin and end situated in the midst of human experience.
Narratives are widely understood to reflect the method in which humans “organize their
experience of the world” (Klenke, 2008, p. 243). Narrative inquiry “embraces narrative as both
the method and phenomena of study” (Clandinin, 2007, p. 5) and “begins and ends with a respect
for ordinary lived experience” (Clandinin, 2013, p. 18). Though this is the first study to use

38
narrative inquiry to explore LGBTQ leadership in higher education, it was a good match for this
task. The trope of visibility is widespread in gay and lesbian literature and scholarship (Fuss,
2013), and it follows that stories about disclosure and identity enactment—which at heart are
stories of self, evolving over time as they are told and retold—have powerful potential for
revealing the experiences of openly LGBTQ managerial leaders and situating these experiences
in meaningful leadership-focused contexts.
Riessman (2008) describes four types of narrative inquiry: structural,
dialogic/performance, visual, and thematic. The most widely used type of narrative inquiry, and
the one primarily used for this study, is thematic analysis, which emphasizes analyzing content.
While thematic analysis of narrative is similar to other qualitative research methods, it has
“epistemological and ontological assumptions” about the centrality of stories distinct from “other
forms of narrative analysis and narrative research” such as grounded theory, phenomenology, or
case studies (Clandinin, 2013, p. 16). Whereas in grounded theory the emphasis is on generating
and categorizing themes, investigators using narrative methods strive to “keep a story ‘intact’ by
theorizing from the case rather than from component themes (categories) across cases”
(Riessman, 2008, p. 53). Riessman observes that how stories are told, including word choice, is
also meaningful. To this end, Chapter 7 includes a brief structural analysis of LGBTQ-specific in
vivo expressions (that is, terms drawn from everyday life, in this case LGBTQ argot,
colloquialisms, and implicit references) used by the participants in their interviews. Also,
because spoken words have auditory and visual qualities, and these qualities provide additional
meaning, where it adds value, the stories used in this study note where the participants paused,
slowed down, laughed, smiled, or otherwise notably augmented their speech patterns.

39
Ultimately, the distinction between narrative studies and other research methods can be
subtle, boiling down to a matter of weight and emphasis, where the analysis of “data” takes an
epistemological back seat to the exploration of lives and life events; the meanings hidden in
participants’ stories; and a disposition to “attempt to keep the story ‘intact’ for interpretive
purposes” (Riessman, 2008, p. 74). To keep stories whole and to privilege the storytellers over
the investigator, as much as possible stories are presented in long paragraphs of actual dialog,
rather than excerpted or paraphrased snippets.
Narrative inquiry can also be a functional choice. Its focus on “living, telling, retelling,
and reliving” (Clandinin, 2013, p. 34), and the centrality of narrative, can elicit interpretations of
experience with rich evocations of time, place, and theme (Creswell, 2013, p. 75). Riessman
(2008) notes that people’s narratives are “strategic, functional, and purposeful. Storytelling is
selected over non-narrative forms of communication to accomplish certain ends” (p. 8). Not the
least of these ends is to reconstruct and understand personal history. “In a dynamic
way…narrative constitutes past experience at the same time as it provides ways for individuals to
make sense of the past” (p. 8). But narratives also can instruct, persuade, engage, and entertain
(pp. 8–9), which enhances the social action value of this research method.
While narrative inquiry has only recently begun “edging itself into the social sciences,
including leadership studies,” this method has an “intuitive appeal for the study of leadership”
because the stories that emerge from this research “can be powerful tools for management that
can be used to design, change, or refocus the organization’s culture” (Klenke, 2008, pp. 240–
241). De Long (2012), using narrative inquiry to explore the leadership experiences of four
Canadian library directors, concluded from her research that narrative inquiry brought rich and
deep discovery to the research process (p. 58). Because the process of asking for stories can elicit

40
thick narratives of key events in the working lives of people (Czarniawska, 2007, p. 390),
narrative inquiry has been used for deep interpretations of complex organizational phenomena
(Ospina & Dodge, 2005). Organizations as well as people are understood to be dynamic agents
undergoing continuous change and development (Czarniawska, 2007), and narrative inquiry
“highlights the relevance of narrative in the identity formation processes of institutional and
personal continuities” (Bamberg, 2012, p. 103).
As a research method, narrative inquiry has distinct vocabulary reflecting its key
assumptions and methodology. In place of memoing or similar techniques from methods such as
grounded theory and phenomenology, narrative inquirers (as Clandinin, 2013, refers to
investigators using this method) create field texts (which Riessman, 2008, calls field notes) that
evolve into interim research texts, which lead to the completed studies, or research texts
(Clandinin, 2013, pp. 44–51). Investigators are advised to “think narratively” throughout the
process, not leaping ahead to data analysis but instead remaining present for the unfolding stories
so they can reflect on what is being told (Clandinin, 2013, p. 47) as well as how it is being told
(Riessman, 2008). Furthermore, “the focus remains on lives as lived and told through the
inquiry,” not on “a search for common themes” or to “confirm existing taxonomies or conceptual
systems” (Clandinin, 2013, p. 52).
The narrative-centric guidance for data collection in narrative inquiry emphasizes literary
features such as Aristotelian unity—that is, stories have a beginning, middle, and end (Clandinin,
2013); a “focus on human intention and action—those of the narrator and others” (Ospina &
Dodge, 2005, p. 143); and an emphasis on contextual detail that in literature as well as scholarly
communications helps convince the reader of the authenticity of the stories. Creswell (2013)
notes that studies using narrative inquiry often contain turning points, or “specific tensions or

41
interruptions that are highlighted by the researchers in the telling of their stories” (p. 72).
Turning points have their literary parallel in the peak action of a narrative arc, a framework over
which a story, or a portion of a story, moves from situation to crisis and then to resolution
(Riessman, 2008, p. 84). Turning points also give the participants and investigator a focus for
story-sharing that lends strength and economy to the research texts. For this study, the
participants had common and unique turning points that lent value to the findings.
It is not merely the telling, but the widening circles of context and detail that give
narrative inquiry its analytical power. Narrative inquirers are encouraged to consider research
design in the context of three commonplaces: temporality, or considering the “past, present, and
future of people, places, things, and events under study”; sociality, or “the conditions under
which people’s experiences and events are unfolding”; and place, which is a reminder that
“people, place, and stories are inextricably linked” (Clandinin, 2013, pp. 39–41). Pentland (1999)
constructed a complementary analytical model in which the re-storying is created through four
levels: text, or the raw data of interviews and other sources; story, or the recreated version of
events from one person; fabula, or the added context for a story; and generating mechanisms,
which are the “underlying structures that enable or constrain the fabula” (p. 179, as quoted in
Klenke, 2008, p. 245).
Field texts, the data sources for narrative inquiry, can range from documents, images,
observations of living spaces, and even performance (Clandinin, 2013; Creswell, 2013;
Riessman, 2008), but interviews are a central method (Atkinson, 2007). The primary field texts
for this study were 90-minute interviews designed to coax forth stories of disclosure and
subsequent identity expression in the context of academic library leadership. The interview
questions were semi-structured, so the investigator was “free to rephrase the questions and add

42
further inquiries” (Klenke, 2008, p. 127) while ensuring essential topics were covered. Interview
questions were provided to subjects by email prior to the interviews to allow time for reflection.
Supplemental field texts were the participants’ current curricula vitae, used to identify how the
subjects currently describe themselves organizationally to others.
ALIDA-II Responses
To screen out participants who responded to the call for participation but were not in fact
openly lesbian or gay in the workplace, and to allow the investigator to prepare for the interviews
by better understanding the degrees of disclosure the participants self-identified in work and
across other life domains, prior to the interviews participants completed a version of ALIDA-II
modified to be applicable to gay men as well as lesbians (van Dam, 2015; see Appendix F).
Unique among scholarly investigations of sexual identity disclosure, “instead of treating
disclosure as an all-or-nothing phenomenon, [ALIDA] provided a qualitative gradation of
the disclosure scale” (van Dam, 2015, p. 1315). Van Dam, describing the structure for the
ALIDA-II questions and scales, notes that “both disclosure and nondisclosure decisions may
have consequences at all levels of their [lesbians’] environment” (2015, p. 1316). In ALIDA-II,
the scoring model for the first 15 questions is a six-point scale (see Table 2, below) where 0
indicates the relationship does not exist and 1 through 5 describe degrees of disclosure among
nested life domains representing experiences with disclosure decisions with immediate and
extended family; in the second domain are healthcare workers, neighbors, parenting
relationships, and religious institutions; and in the third domain, or exosystem, are employers,
co-workers, and other work-related relationships (van Dam, 2015). The fourth domain, the scale
for which is in Table 3 below, measures disclosure in the world beyond family, neighborhood,
and work, such as while traveling. All 10 participants completed the modified ALIDA-II

43
instrument, which was distributed as a manually-entered document and then rekeyed into
Qualtrics survey software for easier analysis.

To prime the subjects to share stories that illuminate the interactive nature of these
disclosure and enactment stories, prior to the interviews subjects were also provided a short
reflection piece based on Muller’s four-factor taxonomy of reactions to identity disclosure
(Muller, 1987; also see Appendix G).
To encourage broad geographic participation, minimize financial and time-related impact
on the investigation, and produce sensory-rich artifacts, interviews were conducted via Internet
telephony (FaceTime5) with an add-on application, Call Recorder, used to record video and
audio. Interviewing via Internet video telephony, versus audio-only traditional or digital
telephony, provided a face-to-face experience that enabled the investigator “to establish rapport
Though the letter of invitation (Appendix B) specified Skype, a free multi-OS product, as the
method of Internet telephony, all participants preferred or were able to use to the free iOS
product, FaceTime. Thus only one software product, the iOS-based Call Recorder, was required
for recording the interviews, which reduced the potential for problems or errors creeping in from
the use of multiple products and further ensured that data was stored in one secure location.

44
with the respondents” (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1991, p. 14) and helped the investigator
determine when the participants were struggling with the interview questions or needed a
moment to compose themselves. On a small technical note related to data quality and of possible
use to future investigators, due to the investigator’s experience with an 18-minute data loss in a
previous study, the Call Recorder software was configured to automatically open whenever
FaceTime was launched so that if the Internet connection failed during the interview, relaunching
FaceTime would also immediately resume recording.
Memory is a winding road, and the participants in this study were excavating stories that
in some cases reached back decades (for one participant, over 50 years). Typical of personal
storytelling, their narratives emerged elliptically, piecemeal, and out of chronological order. To
assist in the process of identifying and assembling stories, the investigator used Dedoose content
analysis software to connect related story elements and identify turning points. Content analysis
also enabled the creation of a typology of identity expression enactment, described in Table 4
(see p. 60), which was helpful in connecting the participants’ stories to the research questions
and literature review, and led to an atlas of in vivo expressions, documented in Appendix I, that
is used in Chapter 8 of this study to examine the participants’ assessment of their expressions.
However, to hew true to the nature of narrative inquiry, this study avoided “deconstructing
stories into coded piles… that could undermine the aims of research” (Gergen, 2004, p. 267, as
quoted in Clandinin, 2013, p. 50) and instead restrained the use of content analysis toward
helping the investigator dig deeply and iteratively into the stories and their meaning.
Limitations
The results of this study, with its focus on sexual identity, may have been subject to
social desirability bias, a form of response bias that occurs “when respondents answer based on

45
what is perceived as being socially acceptable, and not the respondent’s true state” (Graeff, 2005,
p. 411). Krumpal (2013), in a literature review of social desirability bias, recommends
“confidentiality assurances” (p. 2042) as one means of mitigating this problem. It is understood
that leaders want to present their best selves, and the data for this study may reflect this reality.
At 90 minutes, the length of the interviews may have partially offset this limitation. Clandinin
(2013) posits that narrative inquiry, with its focus on eliciting rich stories from participants, helps
abate social desirability bias by pushing participants past glib “smooth or cover stories” (p. 50),
and this study supports that hypothesis. Chapters 5 through 7 present several narratives in which
as the interview progressed, stories were deepened with complex revelations that contradicted
the sunnier, more simplistic stories shared earlier. It is also possible that the author’s status as an
openly lesbian library leader may have helped counteract social desirability bias through an
implicit trust relationship with the participants based on shared LGBTQ experience.
Two of the instruments used in data collection pose issues. First, ALIDA-II (van Dam,
2015) is the only validated scale for sexual identity disclosure. Though versions of this scale
have been tested on lesbians for a decade, ALIDA-II has not been validated for gay men,
bisexuals, or transgender people. However, van Dam is testing this scale on gay men, and
predicts that when testing has been concluded in 2017, it will prove valid for this population
(M.A. van Dam, personal communication, October 17, 2015 and October 26, 2016). Second,
Muller’s taxonomy of responses to identity disclosure (Muller, 1987) was developed as a tool for
exploring family relations in counseling psychology. Muller’s taxonomy has never been tested,
validated, or challenged, and has been primarily cited in LGBTQ-related psychology studies.
However, its use in this study was limited to stimulating thinking about life experiences related
to identity expression.

46
The investigator was also casually familiar with seven of the participants, an outcome of
research in an area with a small sample pool and whose participants have lengthy work histories
in the same field. Garton and Copland (2010) posit that familiarity with participants may
introduce unknown influences on data. Finally, the data collection process cannot be
disentangled from the humans who engage in it. Nunkoosing (2015) observed that “power is
always present in the transactions of the interview, as it is in all human interactions” (p. 701). It
is not possible to predict the influence of power relationships, but it is possible to acknowledge
they exist.
Data Quality
Creswell (2014) recommends using several or more “validity strategies” to help produce
a qualitative study that can be relied on for its “trustworthiness, authenticity, and credibility” (p.
201). Five of these strategies were built into the research design of this study: triangulation,
member-checking, clarifying the investigator’s biases, peer debriefings, and what Creswell
(2014) describes as “rich, thick description” (pp. 201–202). Using more than one data source
helped provide faceted insights into how the participants described themselves to the investigator
and how they described themselves on social networks and in curricula vitae. The goal of
evaluating multiple data sources was not to catch contradictions but to understand how
participants express their identity in different life domains.
Earlier in this proposal the investigator declared some known characteristics of her
biases, and while avoiding turning this study into an autoethnography, she practiced bracketing,
that is, remaining mindful of her biases. Peer debriefings were conducted through the process of
sharing work in progress with a member of the investigator’s doctoral cohort who has very
different research foci and worldviews. Nine hundred minutes of recorded conversations and

47
iterative refinement and revision of the interim research texts contributed to the quality of the
data. Transcripts were shared with participants, who in some cases supplemented their narratives
with new reflections, and participants were provided drafts of the study to confirm that
confidentiality was preserved to their satisfaction and to enable them to comment on how their
stories were presented.
A strong interview strategy also contributed to the goal of “rich, thick description”
(Creswell, 2013, p. 202). Charmaz (2014), who has written and taught extensively on the art of
interviewing for qualitative research, notes that for any qualitative research “proposed interview
questions must be sufficiently detailed to convince evaluators that no harm will befall research
participants yet open enough to allow unanticipated material to emerge during the interview” (p.
66). Strategies used in this study for designing the “rhythm and pace of the interview” (Charmaz,
2014, p. 66) included placing the most challenging questions in the middle of the interview and
returning to less fraught questions at the end; using the term “something” rather than “anything”
to “elicit more details”; using prompts such as “That’s interesting, can you tell me more about it”
to elicit richer information; avoiding “why” questions; and being sensitive to gender, power, and
other factors influencing the dynamics of the interview (Charmaz, 2014, pp. 66–71). Being
attuned to, and probing the meaning of, in vivo terms can “help us preserve participants’
meanings of their views and actions in the coding itself” (Charmaz, 2014, p. 134), a
recommendation which led to culling the data to create a typology of in vivo terms (Appendix I)
which contributed to the discussion of hyper-vigilance about presentation in Chapter 7 of this
study.
To improve clarity, the interview questions were reviewed successively by the
investigator’s doctoral advisor, Dr. Michele Cloonan, and members of the investigator’s doctoral

48
cohort, and then with LGBTQ academic library leaders who are emeriti of this author’s previous
study (Schneider, 2016) and had previously volunteered to assist with future research. Their
input, as well as feedback from a “dress rehearsal” of the entire interview with a participant from
a previous study, led the investigator to modify the prefatory material to more clearly describe
sexual identity expression; to specifically ask for examples of turning points; to expand the
prompts to include more examples of the types of actors with whom participants might have
interacted; and to include a prompt about professional association activity. During the interviews,
most participants commented that they were surprised to discover they had 90 minutes’ worth of
stories, and one participant shared her belief that interviewing was a good tool for this study
because it surfaced complex stories and long-forgotten memories that a survey or a more
bounded method could not.
It is understood that subjects are selective with the stories they share during interviews
(Nunkoosing, 2005, p. 701), but to mitigate corresponding selectivity on the part of the
investigator, an interview protocol (Appendix D) ensured that the interview followed a planned
course of action. A professional transcriptionist transcribed the interviews verbatim from audio
files extracted from the Internet telephony recordings. The investigator reviewed transcripts as
they were produced during the data-collection phase to ensure that the study’s objectives were
being met and to correct typographical errors, and later reviewed all transcriptions in parallel
with the audiorecordings to capture lengthy pauses, emotion, and other signifiers. Nine of the
recordings had very high audio quality, producing transcripts that enabled this study to
incorporate full vignettes and stories verbatim, with the text only redacted as necessary to
preserve participant confidentiality. However, the interview with Leader T had technical
difficulties that resulted in a transcript with numerous small gaps where words and phrases of

49
dialog were unintelligible, even after repeated playback of the recording by the transcriptionist
and then by the investigator. In many cases, though the dialog was garbled, the larger meaning
was clear. The outcome is that the narrative segments from Leader T have more summarizing
and paraphrasing than for other participants’ stories, resulting in a minor loss of fidelity for
Leader T’s narratives and how he constructed them.
The investigator also created field texts during and after the interviews to capture
reflections on setting, emotional tenor, voice, and other more ephemeral artifacts of the
interviews. Finally, the investigator used an external auditor, recruited from her doctoral
program, to “examine both the process and the product” produced by this investigation
(Creswell, 2013, p. 252). This auditor pronounced the study sound in both respects, concluding it
had a solid chain of reasoning and conclusions that fit the study.
To protect confidentiality, the investigator provided consent forms to the participants
prior to the interview. The names and locations of the subjects’ past or present institutions do not
appear in the study. To further preserve confidentiality, the investigator also provided
participants with the summaries of their interviews, and then copies of the study in draft, to
ensure details were appropriately masked in the study’s discussion. Several participants, on
reading a draft of the study, commented that the study felt “true” to their experience, and perhaps
more significantly, none declared it untrue. Data gathered in this research was secured in locked
cabinets in the office of the investigator, and five years after the conclusion of data analysis, all
data will be destroyed. Finally, the study proposal was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Simmons College.
To summarize current consensus on the issue of facts in storytelling, when people tell
stories, these stories gain their power from their assigned meaning, not their veracity, and the

50
stories evolve as people and organizations move through time (Clandinin, 2013; Czarniawska,
2007; Klenke, 2008). Klenke (2008) concluded that the stories generated by narrative inquiry
“are re-fashioned in the light of present life experiences and are often judged by coherence and
plausibility rather than ‘truth’” (p. 247). For narrative inquirers to acknowledge that stories
retrieved from memory and reworked to create meaning have a nebulous relationship with their
originating events also means “relinquishing some aspirations to power through the claim of
factuality” (Czarniawska, 2007, p. 400), but in relaxing this grip on authority, the investigation
serves a higher truth.

51
Chapter 4: General Findings
Introduction
This study revealed many types of sexual identity expression in the workplace, from
initial disclosure, which is the foundational identity expression for LGBTQ people and a crucial
turning point and developmental stage in LGBTQ lives, to elaborations of and modifications on
expression across their careers that evolved as the leaders moved up in their careers. While all
personal journeys are unique, there were four significant commonalities of expression among the
ten participants that surfaced in this study. First, all participants disclosed their sexual identity in
the workplace relatively early, once the cohort had passed the historical era where disclosure
would have almost certainly led to firings or worse. The leaders with the earliest work histories
were out by the mid- to late-1980s, but all participants had disclosed their identities at points in
time when relatively few LGBTQ employees were out in the workplace (Badgett, 1996; also see
Appendix H). Second, the participants had broadly similar periods of sexual identity expression
and turning points that correlated with and complemented their leadership journeys, so much so
that their narratives can be loosely grouped thematically across three chronological periods: early
career, mid-career, and culminations (and for the retired participant, a coda). Third and fourth,
while there were many different types of sexual identity expression—the uniqueness of which
add depth to the participants’ narratives—some of these expressions map to the principles of
transformational leadership, while others suggest gaps and anomalies in the same.
Degrees of Participation

52
Participation was strong, and ultimately, as originally planned, ten subjects participated in
this study. There were 16 initial responses to the call for participation.6 Of these, two respondents
had participated in the investigator’s previous study (Schneider, 2016); they were thanked for
their generosity and asked to review research questions and participate in practice interviews, to
which they readily agreed. A third respondent failed to reply to subsequent correspondence from
the investigator, and was removed from consideration. A fourth respondent was excluded due to
a coincidence that cannot be described without compromising participant confidentiality. The
data for a fifth respondent was excluded after the interview had been conducted when it
transpired in the interview that he had not disclosed his sexual identity status in the workplace,
despite indicating otherwise in other phases of the participant review protocol; a volunteer who
had agreed to wait in the wings as a backup was able to participate in his place. Finally, one
potential participant had retired from a senior executive position a few years before, and though
the criteria had specified participants who were currently employed, in consultation with the
investigator’s committee, it was agreed that including this participant would enrich the study.
To give the participants a sense of identity while preserving their confidentiality, the
investigator applied a random sort to their last names and then labeled this list Leader Q through
Leader Z, choosing this range because starting with the letter Q felt auspicious for this study.
Where partners or spouses needed to be labeled, they became Partner Q, Partner R, and so on.
Given the small cohort of known openly LGBTQ academic library leaders, to protect
confidentiality, descriptions of the ten participants’ characteristics were generalized and the
relationship between characteristics minimized. To further protect confidentiality, the senior

The investigator also received several email messages asking that the investigator later pursue
similar research related to aspiring LGBTQ academic leaders and LGBTQ leaders from public
libraries.
6

53
executive positions of the participants were labeled with the anonymized honorific, “Leader,”
with the understanding that in this context the term refers to the most senior executive role in the
participant’s library, which may have the title of dean, director, university librarian, associate
provost, or a similar term.
The participants displayed a strong interest in participating this study. Despite their busy
schedules, they were assiduous in completing and returning consent forms and ALIDA-II
surveys, submitting curriculum vitae, and reviewing questions and the Muller reflection piece in
advance. FaceTime interviews were scheduled—and several times, due to unanticipated work
commitments, rescheduled—around busy academic meeting calendars. Participants also
responded to raw transcripts and drafts of this dissertation and followed up with comments and
questions.
It was evident most participants had thought carefully about participating in this study,
reflecting the habits of mind of experienced leaders as well as the significance they attribute to
being visibly LGBTQ academic library professionals. Leader U described sharing his plan to be
interviewed with an executive coach he works with, which inspired a coaching session prior to
the interview (see Chapter 5 for a discussion of this story). Leader T and Leader V described
meeting friends for dinner the night prior to the interview and discussing their own history as gay
male library leaders. Several participants revealed that they had researched the investigator by
looking up her work history, professional activity, and scholarship, and by reading her blog. All
told, the response rate, the willingness of participants to complete paperwork and take 90
minutes out of their lives for the interview—for three participants, on a vacation or weekend
day—and their attentive, self-directed preparation for the interviews were harbingers of the rich
stories that transpired.

54
Characteristics of Participants
Despite some necessary masking, it is possible to describe the sweep of similarities and
differences among the participants. Of the final pool of 10 participants, one participant entered
librarianship in 1963 and had been retired for nine years, while the newest leader had been in
librarianship for 29 years and in her leader role just over one year. The shortest time in the
profession was 16 years. All told, their collective time as openly LGBTQ leaders in academic
libraries as of this study’s data collection phase totaled 250 years. Six had been in their leader
positions between one and five years; two between six and ten years; and two between twenty
and thirty years. They were a group with longevity; only one participant had less than 20 years in
the profession, and five had been in the profession more than 30 years. The relationship among
their longevity, their leadership, and their sexual identity expression is explored in each chapter,
as their lives as emerging academic library leaders crisscrossed significant historic events,
coloring their sexual identity expression with contemporaneous meaning.
Appendix H demonstrates that these leaders fall into two proximate cohorts, with Leaders
Q, S, T, and U entering the library workforce from the pre-and early-Stonewall era of the 1960s
through the early 1980s, and Leaders R, V, W, X, Y, and Z entering the library workforce from
the late 1980s through the early 2000s. The cluster of first-time leaders in a 10-year period
reflects the growing visibility of LGBTQ people in the workplace and the cultural shifts that are
slowly destigmatizing homosexuality, and evokes the life course theory of principle of time and
place. Where pertinent, the following chapters acknowledge the relevance of timing by
approaching their narratives through time-sensitive historical lenses.
The institutions represented in this study range from prestigious R1s (top-tier schools
with membership in the Association of Research Libraries) to public universities, private

55
universities, and community colleges. Based on the common library measurement of Carnegie
classification, five participants worked in large institutions; three in small; and two in medium
(Carnegie, n.d.). Five participants were from public universities, three from private secular
institutions, and two from private religious institutions. Geographic diversity was rich. Three
participants came from the West, two from the Southeast, and three from the Northeast,
occupying positions of leadership in areas that ranged from high population, highly liberal urban
areas, to smaller and far more conservative regions in the Deep South. Personal demographics
demonstrated more homogeneity than was the case for this author’s previous study (Schneider,
2016). Only one participant, an African-American, identified as a person of color; the others
were white. Four were women and six were men, a pattern consonant with the discussion earlier
about the well-documented phenomena of men having more access to leadership roles (Eagly,
2005; Eagly & Karau, 2002; Ritter & Yoder, 2004; Yoder, 2001).
In response to an interview question about sexual identity, six participants identified
without further qualification as gay males, and two as lesbians. Two participants elaborated on
their identities. Leader S self-identified as “a butch dyke,” that is, a lesbian who presents with
male-identified contemporary clothing, grooming, and mannerisms (Levitt & Hiestand, 2005),
while Leader Z identified as “Gay, lesbian, queer, butch. Actually genderqueer is another one I
use.” Participants elaborated on their identities later in the interviews, such as Leader U
reflecting that he was “the kind of little boy who played with dolls and colored”; these
elaborations are later explored in the context of identity expression.
This was a markedly partnered cohort, given the historic obstacles to same-sex
relationships. Two male participants were not in a relationship at the time of the interview, but
had been in the past; one woman was in a long-term relationship, and another woman was dating

56
a woman; and six participants, four male and two female, had in the last several years legally
married same-sex partners they had been partnered with between five and forty years. The roles
played by partners and spouses emerge particularly strongly in the chapters on mid- and
culminating careers.
In terms of data quantity, the participants for this study produced fewer words than
predicted for this study, a forecast the investigator had based on research in typical
conversational speech patterns by Yuan et al. (2006). In retrospect, the data quantity makes
sense, as the participants’ speech was anything but typical; they were accessing old memories
about sexual identity, sometimes with great emotional context. Zellner (1994), summarizing a
decade of work by Goldman-Eisler, explains that in the inter-lexical context, in which pauses are
not serving other linguistic or physiological functions, “a pause is the external reflection of some
of the cognitive processes involved in speech production” (p. 46); that is, a human speaker
pauses in order to focus on accessing and retrieving memory, much as a printer spooling a large
or complex document will pause before generating its product. Zellner also cites Klatt (1976)
regarding the relationship between the emotional state of the speaker and rate of articulation,
though it is perhaps to the credit of the investigator’s interview skills and rapport with the
participants that slower speech, though sometimes associated with sadness, is also associated
with low anxiety (Zellner, 1994, p. 49). Notwithstanding the delta between predicted and actual
word count for the interviews in this study, approximately 900 minutes of recordings produced
more than 120,000 words, a redoubtable quantity of data.
ALIDA-II
ALIDA-II was administered for the utilitarian purpose of determining if participants met
the standard of disclosure established for this study, so that time would not be wasted scheduling

57
and conducting interviews with participants who were not disclosed about their identity at work.
It transpired that responses to the modified ALIDA-II became their own field texts. The survey
responses were highly uniform, pointing to a self-conception of a high degree of disclosure at
work, as well as with family members, healthcare professionals, and neighbors. For workplace
disclosure, participants selected level 5, “Told and speak freely without hesitation,” across the
board for everyone except the people they reported to, for whom 4 were Level 4, “Told, but
rarely speak of it”; Leader Q was level 3—“Knows, but was never told”—to his immediate
supervisor. Participants were also 4 or 5 in other life domains, with one exception: only 2
participants selected level 5 for “traveling to other places in the United States.” Data about life
domains outside the workplace resonate with the discussion in Chapter 7 about the impact of
disclosure decisions on geographic selectivity in job choice.
Length and Type of Disclosure
Initial discovery of sexual identity ranged from early childhood to adulthood, but all
participants were out to themselves by the time they had completed graduate school, the
demarcation of the start of their professional librarian careers. Seven participants described being
out in the library workplace for the majority or entirety of their library careers, a pattern also
found in Schneider (2016), where disclosure among leaders was early and persistent, though the
role of the life course principle of time and place on the variations here is explored in subsequent
chapters.
As noted earlier, initial disclosure is just one form of identity expression for people with
concealable differences; maintaining identity status requires continuous disclosure as people with
concealable differences encounter new people in new situations. To ensure participants
understood the investigator’s research direction and did not limit their stories to initial disclosure,

58
the investigator described this ongoing identity declaration to participants as signaling. Mentions
of signaling beyond initial disclosure to self were flagged 284 times across the ten interview
transcripts (Table 4, see p. 60), and fell into the following broad categories: prediscursive
signaling, in which sexual identity is communicated through dress, mannerisms, and artifacts
such as office décor or car bumper stickers; signaling through relationship status, such as
showing up at a university event with a same-sex companion or spouse, inviting co-workers into
one’s home when the same-sex partner is present; direct speech, such as stating or implying
one’s sexual identity in a spoken comment, such as in a job interview or conversation with coworkers, or informing employees of a change in relationship status or a family event; written
verbal disclosure, such as information in a curriculum vitae; and activism, in which identity is
inferable through university, community, or association activity, such as participation in the
LGBTQ archives, AIDS activist groups, a gay community choir, or a LGBTQ-affiliated unit of a
professional association. Yet the raw counts and brief descriptions of these types of sexual
identity expression do not themselves answer the research questions. That requires close analysis
of the stories of the working lives of these managerial leaders as they lived out these expressions
across time, place, and situation.

Chapter 5: Beginnings
I knew in my heart of hearts that however I was going to define myself, I was going to be
true to myself.
—Leader V
Introduction
For the ten participants in this study, their early adult lives were highly typical stories of
leaving home, forming adult identities, and exploring careers; along the way they had
experiences and interactions with colleagues who helped them, in Leader Y’s terms, “figure
things out.” The significant difference was that they were launching these diasporas of discovery
in the context of coming to terms with their own sexual minority status and determining how
much of this status they could safely share in their different life domains, including the
workplace.
Coming out to Self, Family, and Friends
As is typical for LGBTQ people (Coleman, 1982; Ragins, 2008), the developmental
process of sexual identity disclosure for the ten leaders in this study took place over varying
points in their lives, and disclosure was first to themselves, then to friends and family. Leader X
described herself as a “Gold Star lesbian” (generally defined as one who has never had relations
with a man; see Mason,2013, for a brief discussion) and said she knew her lesbian identity from
early childhood and had been fully out since leaving home. However, the other nine participants
had identity discoveries that took place during college and into their early thirties, following the
well-documented phenomenon of young adulthood being a significant period for identity
experimentation and growth, including the formation of sexual identity (Thompson & Morgan,
2008). The invisibility of other LGBTQ people and the stigma and social proscriptions attached

61
to sexual identity complicated the discovery processes, particularly for the older participants
whose lives overlapped less tolerant eras, but all were out to themselves by the time they started
their library careers.
Leader U shared that prior to acknowledging his sexual identity, he knew he was
different, but in what way was unclear to him:
I’ve always liked people who are different, I’ve always felt comfortable with that even as
a little kid and maybe somewhere at the back of my head I knew I was different. I
was…the little boy who played with dolls and colored, and I didn’t like sports. I was
never the macho little kid. I hated sports, still do in fact.
Despite his sense of difference, Leader U was in college before he acknowledged his sexual
identity.
I didn’t come out to myself until I was 20.…Part of it I think is I was growing up as a gay
male in the South. There were no role models at that time, not in the 70s. There was
nobody yet. I mean, my high school [textbook] said homosexuals are unhappy people. So
I wasn’t unhappy, therefore I wasn’t a homosexual, right? It’s perfect logic. And of
course that was a textbook in high school from the early 70s saying homosexuals are
these nasty creatures who are psychologically disturbed.…It was still considered a mental
disease. That was sort of my framework for all this.…So [near the end of my
undergraduate experience] that’s right about the time I came out.
Leader U’s degree of expression was always more muted than the most expressive in this cohort,
but as subsequent chapters will illustrate, by mid-career he began to find a level of disclosure
that was a good fit for him.

62
The journey to awareness often had help from friends, partners, and schoolmates. Leader
W was raised in a small Southern town and attended a neighboring college. He recounted a
typical story:
About my last semester of college, I started realizing things about myself because I had
really not thought that way. I had gay friends and I was going out to gay bars but I
thought at the time I was just being liberal…and all of that kind of stuff. One night at the
bar, after too much to drink probably, I started realizing what was going on.
Gay friends also helped Leader U on his journey. He unwittingly went to his first gay bar
in the late 1970s, brought by two friends in graduate school who discerned his identity, even
though he thought he had successfully concealed it.
In library school…there were a couple of gay classmates. In fact it was kind of funny. I
was in school when [one of my classmates] says, “Well, we’re going out for a drink.”
We…end up at a gay bar. I had no idea it was a gay bar when I first walked in.
Until…this guy plunked down a newspaper in front of me that says like the so and so, the
South’s leading gay newspaper, and I thought, “Holy crap! I’m in a gay bar.” It felt good
in a way.…I just thought, “Wow this is fun, this is neat.”…That was my first real
exposure to the gay community because I had not been any place that was gay before
specifically. All of a sudden I was in a gay bar and um…wow! [Laughs].
Leader R described having a “tortured junior high and high school like many [LGBTQ]
people,” which like Leader U, led to him attempting to be closeted in his first full-time job, a
position he held prior to attending library school.
I actually made a decision to come out fully in the workplace based on a previous
experience at my last job, where I worked there for a trucking company and was out to a

63
few people but did not feel very safe. They had a going away party for me and when I
walked in, they asked where my partner was by name. I was shocked that they knew his
name and they knew that I was gay. They were very disappointed that they didn’t get to
meet him and I was embarrassed that I hadn’t trusted them. So I resolved from that point
onward to just be out as a matter of course in all of my work locations, and that’s what I
have done.
(The extent to which being out was actually “a matter of course” for Leader R is explored in
Chapter 7 and 8.)
Leader R used graduate school as a time to establish a scholarly agenda related to
LGBTQ issues that would eventually complement his early and mid-career campus service:
My major research project was looking at the information seeking behavior of the LGBT
community [in my home state] and how they used the library compared to bookstores,
when we still had some gay bookstores, and the community center. It was my first peerreviewed article, and it was published. So I had done a little bit of work in these library
services to LGBT populations.
For Leader Y, college was an era of gradual identity emergence. She recalled, “Well, I
didn’t know what I was. I thought maybe I was bisexual. I really started to really admit that I was
attracted to other women like in my junior and senior year of college.” Her path was facilitated
by gay male friends, who she remembered, “Taught me a lot. I felt I had so much in common
with them before I even realized what my orientation really was.”
Leader Z came out to herself in the late 1990s, in her first career, while married to a man
and after having a child. She “[went] through a messy divorce” and left her first career, a field
unfriendly to LGBTQ people. As part of her career change, she enrolled in a graduate program in

64
another state. She had planned to be circumspect, particularly as her husband was “threatening to
sue for custody” of their child:
I…had not yet decided how I would come out. I knew that I wasn’t going to be
completely closeted. I knew that I couldn’t do that anymore. I’d done that for a year—
well, I’d done that for [a long time], even to myself, but then to other people for over a
year. I knew I couldn’t be completely closeted, but…I had not yet decided how I was
going to manage it and what concentric circles I was going to come out to.
However, even before she had left her first career, her intended path for disclosure was
preempted:
I got an email from a graduate student who was two years ahead of me saying, “Hey,
welcome to the graduate program. Someone told me you were coming. This is a great
place to be gay, blah, blah, blah,” and I’m like, “What? How did you know?” And it was
[sent to] my [work] email….It totally freaked me out and I think I deleted the email
without even responding, as if that would protect me.
Leader Z then departed for graduate school, still determined to keep her identity private,
but her identity had apparently preceded her:
I was in the first week of school, I’m in the main office of the department and
another…more senior graduate student, who had been assigned as my mentor kind of
randomly and it’s the first time I met her, and she [says], “Oh yeah, you’re [Leader Z].
Hi, I’m so and so. My cousin is gay and she’s [working for your former employer]. Do
you know her?” I swear to God. I mean, across the department office. I’m like, “No, I
don’t know your cousin, and well, I guess I’m out.”…At that point I was like, “I guess
this is useless to even not be out.”…In some ways I think it helped me make a decision I

65
would have made anyway….Maybe I was even relieved at not having to make the
decision.
Nevertheless, in a couple of years, Leader Z would be confronted by a decision about her
first library job interview: Whether she should mute her butch presentation, which at that time
included what she described facetiously as “Standard dyke haircut number 2” (hair cropped very
short, similar to a men’s flat-top), men’s slacks, and men’s work shirts. The conundrum was that
she had not yet found a version of her preferred work clothing formal enough for a job interview.
“At that time I didn’t have a dressy version of the real me yet.”
I very distinctly remember not knowing what to wear to the first interview.…Even
though several of the people I would be interviewing with already knew me because I
was interviewing for a job in the same part of the organization that my grad student job
was in, and I had been doing that for four years there so they knew me, I remember
stressing a lot about what to wear. I ended up buying a suit, it was a women’s pantsuit
and…a black [shell top]….I was uncomfortable the whole time. It just was like, “Who
am I? I’m wearing a costume.” It felt so weird.
This was a turning point for Leader Z: It would be the last time she wore women’s
clothing to a job interview. For future interviews, she wore men’s wear such as suits and
neckties, and men’s shoes.
Though Leader X reported being settled in her lesbian identity from early in her life, she
shared how she used her transition from the military to undergraduate and graduate school to
realign her class identity by altering how she presented as a lesbian. “Being in the South and
being with working class people, and this was the early 80s, I was very butch then. You had to
align yourself one way or the other” (that is, assume a butch or femme identity).

66
[College] was a middle class gay and lesbian experience versus a working class gay and
lesbian experience. Oh my God, so different. When I was in the military I was positioned
to be very butch…more in my mind probably and in dress style than anything else. But as
I went to college, and then especially in [a large city], you find that the richer people are,
the more innate femininity some of the men have, that [men] can wear sock slippers and
soft jackets and silk shirts. That’s not what you see growing up if you’re working class.
It’s rough fabrics and heavy boots and calloused hands.
By the time she graduated from library school, Leader X had assumed an appearance she called
“a nicely suited soft-fabric masculine feminine.” Leader X continued, “There’s no denying that
I’m a woman, and I don’t want to [deny it], and I don’t think there’s any confusion. But I don’t
wear make-up and I don’t wear dresses or skirts.” Leader X reported maintaining this dress
standard throughout her career.
Not all people who have same-sex relationships in college or graduate school, or for that
matter at other points in their lives, stay on an LGBTQ identity path. Leader X’s graduate school
experience included exposure to “flowy intellectual lesbians until married”: women who
identified as lesbian during and sometimes shortly after the relatively safe space of college and
graduate school until they met male companions and assumed heterosexual identities. But for the
participants in this study, being lesbian or gay became their orientation for life, which had
ramifications far beyond the ivory tower. As Leader X put it, “And then of course you have to go
to work and you’re like okay, how does one make your way in the workplace?” Her question
frames the next section of this chapter.

67
Coming Out in the Workplace
For Leaders Q, T, and U, early-career sexual identity expression in the workplace during
the 1960s through the 1980s meant disclosing and maintaining identity with a small, very trusted
group of LGBTQ professionals who scrupulously maintained compartmentalized gay lives,
where they were only out in settings such as private homes, large cities, and gay bars. Leader T,
who as discussed in the next chapter would eventually come fully out in the workplace in 1991,
began his long library career in 1963, when being out in any life domain was rare, and could lead
to firing, harassment, physical abuse, public shaming, or commitment to a mental institution.
Leader T grew up in a rural Midwest state and went to college three miles from his hometown,
and did not come out to himself until he moved to a large city in 1963, enrolled in library school,
and started his first library job. Unsurprisingly, in 1963, no one was out in the workplace in
Leader T’s institution. Nevertheless, through subterranean signaling, other library workers
discerned his sexual identity and helped him connect with other gay male employees and build a
gay life outside of the workplace:
I [knew I] was gay, I just hadn’t done anything.…I was a librarian trainee [in a large
urban library]…and at my first branch…the assistant librarian was gay. I mean, he didn’t
tell me that, but he invited me home to dinner and he shared an apartment with another
man.
Though none of the men directly discussed their sexuality at this dinner, the assistant
librarian encouraged Leader T to find an apartment in a neighborhood Leader T knew to be gayidentified. This neighborhood had a “promenade that attracted young men from all over…to
come to the bar, or you could walk down the street. It was a very gay neighborhood.” Leader T

68
subsequently moved to this neighborhood, which helped him “[make] up for lost time” in
meeting other gay people and having relationships.
Once Leader T had made that first gay male connection at work, others soon followed.
“So that was my introduction and I met a young librarian who had recently shared things about
being gay and I met other librarians. In fact my third director I worked for in the department, he
was also gay.”
This phenomenon—where gay employees quietly identified one another and created
social worlds outside the workplace—would persist through Leader T’s early career into midcareer, across LGBTQ historical milestones such as the election and murder of Harvey Milk, the
emergence of AIDS, and the abolishment of homosexuality as an illness by major medical
associations (also see Appendix H). But Leader T also had an early disclosure moment outside of
his library career. He described how in 1965, two years into his first library job, he had a brief
detour out of the profession. He was determined to avoid going to Vietnam, which by then was a
full-blown war in all but name. To avoid the draft he had resigned from his library job and joined
a national service agency. He quickly realized that employees in this agency worked very closely
together for long periods of time and it would be very difficult to hide his identity, a problem
made more challenging because “it was very clear they didn’t like gays.” After several months,
he left this service agency and found a library job, but was then called up for the draft. Leader T
did not see himself fitting in well with the young men who were being drafted:
I decided that there was no way I was going to Vietnam. Because at that point I was 22 or
23 and I was in this class with 18 year olds and I thought all right, like no way. I’m not a
farmboy.
So Leader T took a risk, and outed himself at his local draft board office:

69
When I went to the draft I told them I was gay.…And they sent me to a doctor who asked
me how I could be gay…and I explained to him how that was possible, that was it. I must
have been the only person who ever said they were gay.
This life-saving disclosure would foreshadow Leader T’s full disclosure decades later, as well as
his leadership journey.
For Leader V, coming out in the 1980s, while he was in his late 20s to early 30s, was a
process that began in graduate school when he met a woman he was not physically attracted to
but who was otherwise a good match for him.
We…eventually went out on vacation and kind of nothing happened. And I
thought…there’s something wrong here. Because based on everything else, she was
someone who I would have really liked: smart, strong, professional, blah, blah, blah,
Jewish, the whole thing.
Leader V’s coming out was interwoven with his transition from paraprofessional to
managerial roles in the library profession, and took place in a supportive work environment.
Leader V described how work colleagues led by example, helping him gradually come out across
several life domains in the 1980s:
There were people I connected with at [this job] who were clearly gay and I think that’s
what drew me towards them and I think they helped me in my coming out process, both
in the workplace and personally.…[Pause] You know, I think of myself as a person of
integrity and fullness, and I think they demonstrated to me that their sexual identity or
expression was an important part of who they are, and it’s not something that needed to
be hidden or put in a closet. I think once I was able to be comfortable with myself, from

70
then on it was a process of just increasingly coming out to friends, to family, to work. I
just didn’t stop.
Like Leader T and others, Leader V’s willingness to come out early and to a widening
group of people would circle back at mid-career and beyond. Leader U had a more circumspect
early career, but found crucial fulfillment and identity in LGBTQ professional activity at the
national level:
I’m not real active in that at all now because I’ve got my focus in some other areas, but I
think when I first joined and I first started going to things, it was like calm in a way…it
was like a place I felt comfortable. I made some friends through there….There’s any
number of people I’m still in contact with now and then who I’ve met through there.
Engagement with professional associations also exposed Leader V to a phenomenon that is
markedly missing from the cohort in this study: concealing through heterosexual partnering.
Expression through Presenting as Unpartnered
However comfortable with themselves and work peers they were, for the more senior
participants in this study, simply presenting as unpartnered adults in the 1960s through the early
1980s was an expression with its own suggestive flag, not just to other LGBTQ people, but also
to heterosexual family members, friends, employers, and people in other domains. As Leader Q
put it, “You reach a certain age where people begin to say, ‘You know, you’re a pretty attractive
guy, you’re not married, you don’t have a girlfriend.’” The older male leaders in this study
described knowing gay male librarians married to women, and recounted how these men
surreptitiously connected with men in no-tell gay bars, at library conferences, and similar
settings at a remove from their domestic lives. Yet however convenient it might have been to
their careers and how many benefits it would have afforded their personal lives—such as the

71
stability of a socially-recognized partner, and the opportunity to raise children—the leaders in
this study reported never marrying or otherwise partnering themselves with opposite-gender
people in order to pass as straight. Instead, these leaders chose to live with the risk of being
identified as gay. Leader V reflected,
I think about over the last 25 or 30 years…I’ve known a number of [male] library
directors who were married to women and who had this kind of dual [life] and I always
thought it was—I mean, I would never say to them, but just from my world view, it felt
kind of schizophrenic. I knew they loved their wives and so that was I guess what was
important to them, and I also thought, well, they just came along at a different time or
grew up at a different time and made different decisions.
However nonjudgmental Leader T and Leader V were of others’ decisions, they avoided
not just the complexities of marrying for appearance’s sake, but also entering into relationships
with gay men who were married or partnered with women. Leader T described actively avoiding
interacting with gay men married to women early in his career, when for his second library job
he had relocated from a gay neighborhood in a big city to a more conservative semi-rural setting.
“There were closeted gays on the faculty married [to women], and I tried to stay away from them
as much as possible.” He recounted that he was friendly with their wives, and therefore he
wanted to avoid the conflict of having affairs with the husbands. He reflected about a party his
supervisor in the 1960s would periodically throw, where inebriation played a role in loosening
inhibitions. “There were other men there who were married and who would hit on me at the
party, so I would leave before that action. I learned not to stay too late.”
Leader T continued to encounter gay male library leaders married to women in other
settings. He recalled the 1971 conference of the American Library Association, which also

72
marked the first meeting of the LGBTQ organization in the American Library Association
known then as the Task Force on Gay Liberation (see Appendix H, 1970). Leader T, who
decades later would become active in this organization, had a memory of the social activity of
gay men he met:
[During] that ALA conference in Atlantic City, I went to a gay bar and there were five
other [library] directors…who were there. That’s what I said about being closeted, I
didn’t even know [they were gay]…gee, okay. Now, a couple of them were not married
but there at least three of them were married.
During this era, Leader Q was navigating what he described as the “down low” AfricanAmerican culture,7 in which it was even more common for gay men to identify publicly as
heterosexual: “[I]t was just a routine thing where that was what you did.” Leader Q had a
significant prior career to librarianship, during which he had several relationships with men in
which he and his partners socialized with straight people in straight settings and at least
nominally hid their relationship status. He recalled,
So during my [first career], I really wasn’t out at all except for my partner at the time. We
both lived a very “straight” life, had a number of straight friends.…When we travelled,
we were more out, but at home it was just two guys who happened to be good friends.
Early in his library career, during the 1980s, Leader Q continued to socialize in “straight”
settings, and through omissions and other tactics used presumptive heterosexuality to enable
others to conclude he was straight. He also used these straight settings to find gay male

In the interview, Leader Q referenced “a book out back in the late 90s, On the Down Low”:

with men. New York, NY: Broadway Books.

73
companions, often relying on “the gaydar, the radar: the unspoken messages [that] were
transmitted”:
I found in African-American culture, at least, there was a lot of socializing in straight
settings or straight parties, straight clubs, but there was often an undercurrent where a guy
would be there who was married or with his girlfriend and in some cases we would end
up hanging out together….Every relationship, short relationship, fling: all those
individuals I met in “straight situations,” straight parties, straight clubs, straight house
parties….And it was almost like a dance. It became a skill…I had another friend who
would laugh about the art of the dance and how much time it would take. You might meet
someone in January and then in February you say, “Oh, let’s have a drink,” and then in
March you say, “Oh, let’s have a drink,” and then in April you say, “Oh, let’s go to
dinner.”
Time and place also affected the sexual identity expression of others in this cohort. In her
first job, a stint of less than two years at a prestigious university in the early 1980s, Leader S
was, in her terms, “very closeted” (or so she assumed), and her isolation and emotional labor are
apparent from her retelling. The story begins with her cross-country move to the prestigious
university, during which she concealed from the movers and her employers that she was also
relocating her girlfriend to her new location. “We moved all my stuff over to her house and then
had the moving truck come together and I didn’t tell them that I was also moving my girlfriend.”
The effort to be closeted continued at her new job:
I really didn’t come out there. I had a very conservative boss and I didn’t know the
territory at all. It was [a prestigious university], for crying out loud. [There were two
library administrators], both who I know not to be homophobic now and very collegial,

74
but at the time I didn’t trust, I didn’t know. So I was very undercover…I didn’t talk about
my girlfriend or my life very openly in that workplace at all….I felt that I needed to
present in a professional manner, and in those early years, despite what [two career
mentors] had told me, I thought that I needed to “clean up,” as my mother used to say.
“You need to clean up a little bit and dress like a professional.” I didn’t have any role
models on the…library staff and few on the faculty, so I ended up hanging out more—my
first friends and my good friends were on the clerical staff there.…The graduate students,
there were many open lesbians among them, but they did not welcome me into their
social circles.
For Leader S, key to being “undercover,” beyond hiding her relationship with her
girlfriend, was following her mother’s advice to “dress like a professional,” which she felt would
signal heteronormativity: “I would be conscious about dividing the week with pants and skirts.”
(Decades later, Leader S would learn that she hadn’t been nearly as “undercover” as she thought,
and that administrators and peers at her first job had identified her as lesbian.) After a year and a
half Leader S moved on to new job at a library in a large, liberal city. Even though she “came
screaming out of the closet” at work and elsewhere, she initially maintained her dress code, in
order not to appear what she termed “flamboyant,” until friends staged an intervention:
I started to date one of the women on the staff—I know, bad idea—at the library. She and
a couple of her friends did an intervention with me and said, “Look, you don’t have to
wear skirts. Your skirts look terrible! Don’t wear skirts anymore. We know you hate it.
You’re fine, you don’t have to wear skirts.” So I stopped from that day. I became
embarrassed that they had noticed my effort and discomfort and I quit. I threw all my
skirts away.

75
For Leader S, throwing away her skirts was a turning point that “made me feel more
confident in my own skin.” She reflected, “I don’t think anybody gave a shit about me wearing
skirts, it was just in my own imagination.…People who mattered to me never said anything to
me negatively about my chosen dress.” Her emboldened self subsequently experienced a
flourishing of early-career LGBTQ activism, first as a volunteer in a community archive for
lesbian material, and then with direct action protest groups such as ACT-UP8 and lesbian activist
groups, as well as through extensive volunteering with the LGBTQ division of a professional
association. The strong ties she created at work and in the community in her early career
reinforced her decision to express her authentic butch lesbian self, which she signaled at work
through wearing the clothes she felt expressed her identity, such as vests and boots. Connecting
with her authentic identity led to greater engagement and social ties with other LGBTQ activists.
Leader S observed, “I felt more secure in that crazy milieu, and pressed to rise to the moment
because of the AIDS crisis that was creating a lot of homophobia and backlash, but it was also
creating spaces for me to stand.”
The decision of Leader S to visibly focus on LGBTQ concerns for her early professional
service came with professional cost in two directions. Leader S worked for a library dean who
was supportive of her dress choices, but tried to steer Leader S away from using LGBTQ issues
to build a scholarly agenda:
She would suggest that instead of just focusing on all this queer stuff, and all this
feminist…stuff, that I also do some activism that had relevance…that my career would be
served if I were to expand my responsibilities outside of the areas that I was rushing to.
Every living moment I was doing was queer-identified at that time. She was just, “Why
AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, a direct-action AIDS group formed in 1987; also see
Appendix H.
8

76
don’t you join the circulation roundtable or something?” [But] there isn’t a circulation
roundtable.
In addition to the dean who wanted Leader S to redirect her activism and scholarship
away from LGBTQ initiatives to a (nonexistent) circulation roundtable, youthful passion to the
crises of the day sometimes created workplace issues for Leader S. She recalled how the
“closeted gay men” she worked with “did not want to step off the curb.” To Leader S, this curb
represented the gay pride marches these librarians did not participate in, but also, more broadly,
the acceptance of LGBTQ-identified activism, such as conducting AIDS-related PubMed
searches on emerging treatments, as legitimate professional work. Leader S described how these
men informed on her whenever she used work resources in support of activist causes such as
ACT-UP:
[These gay men] were turning me in every chance they could get. Turning me in to the
straight man in charge, who was slightly homophobic. They were reporting that I had
been using the equipment after work, and that was not allowed, and they installed a gate
so I couldn’t get to the fax machine.
Despite her supervisor’s displeasure at her LGTBQ service and the resistance from her
peers, Leader S continued her activism.
Leader V’s recognition of his gay identity in the mid-1980s, while he was completing his
library degree and transitioning to professional library work at his place of employment, led to
his decision to change jobs and move from a rural to urban setting. While he was comfortable at
work, where he was accepted as an openly gay man, he wanted to have more gay people in the
other parts of his life so he could build a social network he believed essential to living
authentically. Leader V thus became involved in national professional activities. “I started going

77
to ALA and I somehow quickly found the gay and lesbian group.” That group welcomed him
onboard into a career-long involvement across several library associations, but it was not enough
for Leader V.
I knew that I needed to move to a place where it was easier to have a social life, whatever
that was.…I have a pretty strong sense of self.…I’m very confident and [Long pause] I’m
trying to think of the right word to say this. I knew in my heart of hearts that however I
was going to define myself I was going to be true to myself.
After relocating to an urban environment and an academic library job, Leader V found
himself having trouble with his new supervisor, who was “difficult to work with.” This
supervisor, a gay man, also had “very effeminate mannerisms. There were no barriers with him,”
creating a quandary for Leader V. He recalled, “On the one hand, I probably admired him for
feeling free who he was, but because he was such a problematic person to work with, there was
another whole side to it as well.” Settled in a neighborhood where he felt welcomed as himself,
Leader V elected to move to a gay-friendly job requiring an hour-long commute, a position he
occupied until his mid-career phase.
The other six leaders participating in this study came of age as library professionals in the
early to late 1990s, a period of greater acceptance but still marked by homophobic attitudes, antiLGTBQ crimes, and anti-LGBTQ laws. Their stories of sexual identity expression in the
workplace describe how, despite advances, being openly gay or lesbian on the job, or in other
life domains, was still rare enough to require deliberation and intent before disclosing, and also
required a conscious determination to maintain that level of disclosure as they moved to new
jobs and new opportunities.

78
After Leader W came out to himself, he decided that when he relocated to a large city to
attend library school, he “was just going to be open about who I was.” Following library school,
he sought a job in the rural Southern area where he grew up. “I knew that when I came back…I
wanted to be out and open so that maybe I would help other people in my small community.”
Matthew Shepard’s death in 1998 happened shortly after Leader W started his first library job,
and the students at his campus were deeply affected. While he considered himself out at work
and in the community, Leader W wanted to ensure that his identity was clear to others. Leader
W’s solution was to place a rainbow bumper sticker on his car:
I wanted to be visible in my small community, in case there were other people. Of course
then I found out that there were a lot of other people in my small community and they all
knew each other, but it was all still very hush-hush at the time.
Soon after, Leader W was asked to be the adviser to his college’s LGBTQ students,
cementing his early identity as an openly gay library professional. He added, “And one of the
people in that group told me that one of the reasons they chose to come to [the school] was
because they saw my pride flag on my car and so they felt like it would be a welcoming place for
them.” The rainbow bumper sticker stayed on Leader W’s car until “I traded [the car] in three
years ago.” By refusing the convenience of presumptive heterosexuality, Leader W not only
shared his authentic identity with his community, but also propelled himself to be
organizationally identified across his career as an openly gay library professional.
Leader X had joined the military after high school. Despite the safe haven of her small,
welcoming military unit, where her lesbianism was accepted, the toll of being gay in the military
pushed her into civilian life where she went to college and then library school in rapid
succession, and also into a commitment to be openly lesbian in all aspects of her life:

79
[The military] was not a place where one could be overt in who one was, be truthful, be
honest. And I was in the [military] for four years [and] during that time I saw a good
many of my friends turn to drink, turn to drugs, turn to self abuse, all because of the
strictures of what happens when one cannot be healthy and accepted regarding one’s true
authentic self. So when it became time to re-up, as much as I loved my work—and I was
offered embassy duty…and it was a dream job—I just couldn’t do it. Because if you can’t
be yourself, how can you ever be truly good with anything that you do? And so I took
myself to college, and I was determined never to be truly closeted after that.
For Leader X, early-career disclosure and a supportive environment where she was
encouraged to build LGBTQ library collections led to finding a career-long mentor who was
inspired by Leader X’s example:
I think back to my first library job…and my associate university librarian [AUL] was a
lesbian. She didn’t tell me immediately, but I used my gaydar…And I gave a talk [at a
library conference] on building gay and lesbian collections because I’d been given
specific funding and permission to really build a strong queer collection….There was a
huge crowd of people, I got interviewed by the [local newspaper], and my AUL came to
it and supported me. And I thought that was just her being lovely and supporting me.
Later on, she came up and she’s like, “I’ve never been that brave at work, ever.” And she
slowly started to come out at work in ways that she never had before.
Leader Y was also bold, but in a different way. Raised by supportive parents who
embraced her after she came out to them during her college years, Leader Y began her library
career in the late 1980s at a large university library in a liberal city where being openly LGBTQ
was “just was not a big deal”:

80
It was the first time I had felt that I didn’t have to pretend I was anything else in the
workplace. We had all these GLBTQ colleagues all over the library. I think all of our
student assistants were gay…it was incredible. There were signs up advertising all these
events that were open to the campus….They would have a lecture or a discussion group
or a film. And the periodical reading room…was known as the lesbian reading room,
which I found hilarious.…During my breaks I would go either to that lesbian reading
room or the stacks and look through books and periodicals that I had never ever had
access to before. [Pause] And I felt more alive and affirmed as a person.
Despite this LGBTQ-supportive environment, Leader Y felt this position was not a good
fit for her because of “the snobbism [directed at] my accent and because I’d gone to a land grant
university.” She felt that “it wasn’t the coming out as gay, it was the coming out as Southern that
gave me trouble.” Within two years, Leader Y left for a job at a small private university not far
from the Southern community where she had grown up, even though she knew that in this
conservative area, “once you step out of the [college] gates…you are in an area where you
[LGBTQ people] can get killed and nobody would care”:
I thought okay, I’m just going to try this [job] out because I wanted to be within a day’s
drive of my parents and…I had such a great interview there and I fell in love with the
place, as quirky and weird as it is. I decided I was going to try not to be in the closet
anymore ever again.
Still, Leader Y understood she would need support to succeed in this environment, and
she describes testing her library director’s attitudes. “Well, he helped me move in and I
introduced him to my girlfriend so I guess that was it.” Beyond simple acceptance, her director
actively encouraged Leader Y to pursue LGBTQ issues in the university and in librarianship.

81
“He encouraged me to do things with diversity…it was just all encouragement from him
constantly.” This engagement with LGBTQ issues on and beyond the campus served as a
substitute “gay community” that Leader Y lacked in the conservative Southern town beyond the
college gates. Nevertheless, she felt opprobrium from some campus employees.
I moved down there with this dreadful girl I was dating…I was very open about the fact
that she was living with me. [Pause] People cared. It’s the rural South….The people at
the library didn’t care, and the faculty didn’t care….But people in administrative offices,
et cetera—not the college administration, I don’t think they cared—they cared. There
were things said about me behind my back and it was uncomfortable. It really
was….People would just imply. I would get these looks. I had one [librarian] ask
me…“If you wanted to be out, why did you come here?”
For Leader Y, part of the answer to that question happened in her second year at this
institution, when without quite intending to, she reinforced her identity to the entire campus and
launched a career as an advocate for LGBTQ students and issues. She recalled,
There was a whole lot of homophobia among the students and they had a speaker come
from, I believe [a regional university], this young man he was a professor there. He was
on the early…gay rights speak-to-college-students circuit.
After the speaker’s presentation, Leader Y describes how “I just decided I can’t have
these students put in the same situation with no adults to talk to that my friends and I were [in at
college]”:
People were asking him all sorts of questions and I was one of two or three faculty
members in the room. My little hand shot up, something just told me to do this, and I
said, “I’ve been working here as a librarian for one year and I just wanted everybody to

82
know that I was gay. And if you need any information, if you want to talk to somebody, I
can fix you up with some books, whatever, you can see me.” And I sat down and I
thought, “Oh shit! What have I done?” Afterwards, all these kids came up and hugged
me, and I’m still friends with some of them.
Leader Y acknowledged this incident felt “very scary,” and described calling her mother and
father soon afterwards.
Then I called my parents.…I said, “I have to tell you something.” First thing they think is
something terrible has happened. I told them what I had done and I believe it was my
father who said, “That’s either the stupidest or the smartest thing you have ever done.”
Leader Y’s actions soon led to a crucial meeting with the campus chaplain, who asked Leader Y
to lead an LGBTQ group for students, launching Leader Y’s decades of campus leadership in
service to LGBTQ students and LGBTQ issues. Her reservations about leading this group melted
away after the first meeting. “I felt like I started something that was going to be useful. I was
exhausted, but I felt like the chaplain was right and I should be doing that [Laughter].” Soon
Leader Y found herself steeped in LGBTQ and gender issues. “I sort of took over the gender
studies collecting and things like that and was like the go-to person on campus for gender study
questions and research.”
While attending library school, Leader R interviewed for a library staff position at a faithbased institution. The interview was brief and the questions were focused on his ability to
perform effectively in an entry-level job, so there were no opportunities to elect to share details
about his personal life. Nevertheless, once hired, he sought ways to signal his identity.
Once I started working there, I would refer to my partner….My old trick had been to use
ungendered pronouns, plurals and talk about “we” and “us”…I started saying “he” and

83
“him” and using [my partner’s] name. My boss at the time said, “Well, I didn’t want to
pry, but thank you for telling me.” And he didn’t say anything more, not like I thought
that that might be the case, but just was very supportive.
Though Leader R described this boss as “supportive,” he also recounted an early incident
where his boss objected to a sign that identified Leader R’s office as LGBTQ-welcoming, and by
inference, signaled that the occupant might be LGBTQ:
I had a Safe Zone9 sign in my office window….I was challenged by the dean of the
library at the time, who said that it was inappropriate for me to have that. We had a
discussion about that and he said, “Well, you don’t want people to think that you’re
biased.” And I said, “Well, I am not biased, I am saying that this is a safe zone and that
people could come in.” But I took it down, under protest, and then a week later I was told
to put it back up because he had thought about it and he cried a lot and he told me about
his gay friends, which was kind of interesting because he felt like he needed to justify
what he had done. And that was the last time that was ever mentioned.
Leader R subsequently graduated from library school and applied for a faculty position at
the same institution, where he took the opportunity to reinforce his identity—and his intention to
be open about it—to the search committee:
That was an interview process that was full-blown. And in meeting with the vice
president for mission who asked what I would bring to the [faith-based] university, I
framed my response by saying, “Well, as a gay Unitarian…” And he started laughing
because he knew me at that point and knew where I was going in terms of the

SafeZone programs provide training in cultural sensitivity and offer stickers and signage for
university offices or departments to identify that they have received SafeZone training and are
supportive and welcoming for LGBTQ people (Finkel, Storaasli, Bandele, & Schaefe, 2003).

84
connections with social justice and bringing in outside perspective. So for my faculty
interview, it was a matter of record.
In his new faculty role, Leader R adapted his scholarly agenda to primarily focus on
intellectual freedom, but frequently framed his service around LGBTQ issues; and he felt
supported in his work.
Discussion
The early work journeys of these ten leaders followed many different paths and were
quite distinct from one another, from a young man in the pre-Stonewall era connecting sotto voce
with gay colleagues who helped him find his place in the world, to a scene almost 40 years later
where a butch-identified woman concludes she will never again wear women’s clothing to a job
interview. Yet the early days of their marches toward leadership share crucial commonalities: a
strong commitment to living as openly and authentically as possible, within the framework of the
time, and an early willingness to assume risks and take strong stands. Their decisions about
authentic presentation, and the persistence of their disclosure decisions, also had implications for
their life choices that would reverberate through their careers.
The complicating factor of the principle of time and place (Elder et al., 2003) meant that
the more senior leaders were not disclosed in their earliest days in the library profession. Yet
these leaders found ways early on to be as authentic as possible, a theme echoed in the small
canon of LGBTQ leadership literature (see especially Bullard, 2013; Christo, 2015; Coon, 2001).
While for protective color in a hostile era they leveraged the phenomenon of presumptive
heterosexuality, they also leveraged Kenney’s “tacit knowledge” (2008, p. 53) to ferret out one
another. These early leaders also willingly risked the inference that being purportedly “single”
implied in that era. This was not a cohort interested in sham marriages in order to further

85
themselves professionally, and two of the male participants reported avoiding married gay men
entirely. As will be discussed at length in Chapter 8, there are intriguing alignments and
disconnects between these leaders’ willingness to risk stigma and prevailing leadership theory.
Correspondingly, the emotional labor of nondisclosure, and the toll it takes on a
employee’s development as a professional, is also evident in the participant’s stories, from
Leader T risking the draft by dropping out of the service organization, to Leader S’s elaborate
strategies to hide her identity and her partner. Leader R, recalling his embarrassment at not
trusting his co-workers in his first job, reflected, “I think it’s hard to realize how much we keep
ourselves closed off until we take that leap of trusting other people.”
That “leap of trusting other people,” and correspondingly a willingness to take risks, was
vividly expressed by most of the participants, such as Leader S “throwing away her skirts” and
Leader Y blurting out her identity at a university gathering. But even unhurried actions unfolding
over time were equally agentic turning points, such as Leader R intentionally using specific
pronouns to clarify his partner’s gender, or Leader V “increasingly coming out to friends, to
family, to work.” Leader T’s story of coming out to the draft doctor demonstrated a willingness
to take calculated risks about sexual identity when the stakes were high that augured his
disclosure decisions decades in the future.
Much of the risk-taking involved taking a moral stand, such as Leader W, in the wake of
the murder of Matthew Shepard—who, like Leader W, was a young gay male in a conservative
rural setting—affixing a rainbow bumper sticker on his car to pointedly signal his identity to
everyone in his community. Leader S had to be physically prevented from using the library’s fax
machine for the AIDS activism she was deeply involved in, and she pursued a scholarly LGBTQ
agenda that clearly ruffled her supervisor, while Leader R willingly went toe-to-toe with his

86
supervisor over the Safe Zone sign. Several became, in Leader Y’s words, the “go-to person” for
LGBTQ issues, which speaks not only to their acceptance by others, but also to how alone they
often were in their institutional settings as they forged their paths as openly lesbian or gay library
professionals. These nascent leaders may have been young and relatively unempowered in their
organizations, but within their eras, they were bold.
Finally, a consistent theme for all but one participant (Leader Q, discussed in the next
chapter) loosely corresponds to Newton’s first law of motion: Once disclosed, the participants
remained disclosed. In the hyperconnected society of the second decade of the 21st century, it is
easy to forget there was a time when it would have been feasible to alter one’s presenting
identity through relocating to another region without leaving a digital trail of one’s previous self.
Rather than tailor their identities to new situations, the participants adapted their life decisions
around the level of workplace disclosure they had reached or were aspiring to, such as Leader V
taking on a grueling commute in order to have personal and professional lives where he could be
comfortably out. The participants’ visible sexual identities had a kinetic energy that would
inform their emerging leadership skills and frame their career decisions into mid-career and
beyond.

87
Chapter 6: Mid-career
I had to build every goddamn diversity committee known to humanity.
—Leader Y, reflecting on her mid-career experience
Introduction
Mid-career found these ten emerging professionals honing their managerial skills and
seeking new opportunities. As they gained experience, began moving up their respective ladders,
and were empowered with more agency over their work lives, they found new ways to express
their sexual identity, even as, in some cases, it moved to the background of how they saw and
presented themselves. Yet even when they claimed otherwise, their stories describe how they
were continuously vigilant about their minority sexual identities, which they carefully modulated
as local circumstances appeared to require.
As noted in the previous chapter, Leader Q is an outlier among the ten participants as the
only participant to step back from his sexual identity disclosure in the workplace. This took place
early in his library career in the 1980s, when he relocated from a liberal urban environment to a
university in a much more conservative area. Early in the interview, the investigator inquired
about Leader Q taking a job knowing he would have to, in his words, “step back” (that is, be less
disclosed). Initially, in his retelling, he implied the choice was strictly pragmatic:
I didn’t really think about it. It was all about career. And my mentor and dear
friend…was one of the ones who said, “If you want to build your career, you need to take
the job at [this university] because it’s giving you your real first supervisory
administrative experience.” So it was more a career thing….I wasn’t there long, but it had
nothing to do with my sexuality, it was just me being footloose and fancy-free.

88
Leader Q left that job after fifteen months for a managerial academic library position in a
large city in a more liberal environment. He initially ascribed his departure to general
disappointment about his job and his new work location. “I wasn’t happy with the direction the
library was going. And I just decided I’m not going to live in the middle of nowhere and be
unhappy at work.” However, later in the interview, when Leader Q was asked whether AIDS had
any impact on his work journey, the narrative deepened and took new turns. Leader Q’s
departure to a rural outpost, and the regression to less disclosure, gained additional context:
For me the impact of AIDS was felt most during my [city] years. I was in [a large city]
from January of ’84 through May of ’88 and I lost a number of dear friends and
colleagues during that time. Frankly, I think subconsciously that was another reason why
I wanted to leave [the city], and ended up in [a remote area]. It was more than career. I
think it was also a way to escape the depression that you felt. In some cases you weren’t
even aware, but yeah, it was like a cloud. So the excitement of moving to [the city] in
’84, by the time ’88 rolled around I was glad to get out.
Leader Q paused and in a soft voice reflected, “I haven’t been in touch with that in a
while.” He recalled of a friend from those days:
He and I were two prime examples of the worried well, where we were like every little
pimple was, “Oh my God!” So yeah, it was like, “I got to get out. I got to leave this.” I
think [going to the rural area] was like, “Yeah, let me get as far away from [the city] as I
can, and this one-horse town is just what I need.” But then I was like, “Okay, it’s time to
get back to civilization.”
This was a turning point for Leader Q that can be framed as an implicit decision to be
himself, personally and professionally. As Leader Q plumbed memories from that era, what he

89
first presented as a move that was “all about career” unfolded to reveal complex layers of
decision-making by an LGBTQ academic professional during the first years of the AIDS
epidemic. Anxiety about being infected with HIV and the depressing experience of dwelling
among so many sick and dying colleagues were factors that had Leader Q flee to a “one-horse
town” and go back into the closet. But—and very meaningfully, from a leadership perspective—
in 1989 Leader Q decamped from closets and one-horse towns for good, even though at this time
the AIDS epidemic was growing exponentially and it would be six more years before the FDA
approved the first life-saving protease inhibitors (q.v., Appendix H, 1995). Leader Q would
continue to be reticent about his identity when applying for positions and would proceed with
caution as he disclosed his identity in the workplace, but he began coming out to more people,
and small towns were behind him for good.
All ten leaders were, if not “all about career,” making professional changes that gave
them new opportunities as well as new ways to express their identities. To be near her love
interest at the time, Leader S took a position at an academic library in another big city in a
different part of the country, and this move turned into a good professional opportunity. She
found herself working for a “magnificent” dean whom she described as “a big proponent of
diversity in libraries.” She remembers the dean’s embrace of her sexual identity and the work
Leader S did in this area as an asset to the institution: “Diversity, that means you, [Leader S].
You are diverse.” This welcome came with an expectation that Leader S would work hard on
projects such as organizing conferences on diversity that would, at the dean’s urging, include
LGBTQ speakers and attendees.
Within a year of her arrival, Leader S was promoted to a entry-level management
position, in which role she continued to flourish, secure that her pursuit of LGBTQ-related

90
research, conference, and service agendas had the full buy-in and support of her leader. In her
time at this institution, Leader S also lived through the death of Matthew Shepard. At her
previous institution, Leader S, responding to AIDS and other contemporaneous crises, had
worked with LGBTQ allies outside of the workplace and experienced resistance to her work at
her job; but at her new university, LGBTQ issues were more integrated into her work experience.
The death of Shepard and its aftermath encouraged other LGBTQ academics at her institution to
come out, expanding her community of like-minded peers.
I would be remiss not to say that when…Matthew Shepard died….That was searing. I
mean, it was horrifying. The entire campus and the queer community were horrified and
afraid. [That area] in those days was a very different kind of environment, and people
were afraid….I was friends with the English department, and the English department
were not out except that they came out in those moments, in those days.
Faculty in Leader S’s institution began talking more about their LGBTQ experiences, and
classes in LGBTQ literature and history began appearing on the syllabus. She reflected, “That
was…a significant time. [Laughter] Yes, it was.”
Leader S enjoyed working at this institution and appreciated the support from her dean,
but she did not want to stay in that region. Leader S subsequently accepted a job that placed her
in an upper-level managerial position in her former city, a role that allowed her to continue her
LGBTQ-related efforts and step into roles as committee chair or primary conference organizer.
Though her writing and presenting broadened to include other topics familiar to librarian
academicians, diversity and LGBTQ issues continued to thread through her service work.
Leader T began widening his circles of disclosure after 27 years of library work and
several years into his second leadership position (but nearly 20 years prior to retirement).

91
Initially, Leader T disclosed his identity by allowing the topic of his identity to come up
naturally in conversations at work, to the point where his identity was well-known and accepted
on campus, as this vignette illustrates:
I had a [gay] friend who was getting a master’s degree in counseling and he wanted to do
an internship at [my university] and so he interviewed at the office and the head of the
office volunteered that I was the only openly gay person there [Laughter].
Leader T took another step toward more activist visibility when he joined a gay men’s chorus,
not simply for the community connection, but as LGBTQ activism:
This is about 1990, ’91, and a…gay men’s chorus came [to the area]…I went to the
concert. And a couple of people…had a signup sheet there for if you wanted to join [a
local gay men’s chorus]. And so I signed up despite my qualms about being out in the
community, which I hadn’t done.
Leader T described the mounting excitement and frissons of tension as the chorus
practiced and prepared for their first community performance:
It was momentous for everyone in the group, because this was something new in [that
region] and I think for everyone there. For most people there it was really a big step to be
out in the community. The point of the chorus was really to reach out and to project a
different image of gays and lesbians, so it was a very political thing. And I had
trepidation about doing this public concert. And sure enough, the first concert a member
of the faculty from [my university] was there.
Leader T described the relief and pride he felt even before the concert ended. “We were
all very anxious about this before [the concert started]. But then we sang and then we broke for
half hour and we came back out and we felt very excited.” He, and the other members of the

92
chorus, were “exhilarated. We had worked hard to do this and we were a new chorus and a lot of
work went into it, and a lot of people hadn’t sung for a long time, and we had an excellent
director.” The faculty member who attended the concert turned out to be gay, and later joined the
chorus.
Leader T had a natural segue into a more personal level of disclosure in the workplace
when he moved in with a partner who would later become his husband. For several years prior to
this relationship, Leader T had hosted elaborate, well-attended holiday open houses to which he
invited employees, supervisors, and others from his academic community. He grounded the
origin of these events in his sexual identity:
Shortly after I went to [my second library], I started having a Christmas open house at my
apartment. I’ll tell you why I started it. I always went home…for Christmas. And of
course as the gay son, I would decorate the Christmas tree. It’s my thing. But then my
mother decides she’s tired of having a Christmas tree and she had the nerve to give my
sister the Christmas decorations!…So then I decided, well, I’m going to have a tree. And
I invited all the library staff and faculty that worked on various campus committees to
visit at the house. So I continued this tradition when I moved into a townhouse and when
I moved out and moved in with [Partner T]. So for the first time, I had an open house, and
he’s there. I invited my boss, I invited all sorts of people to this open house. I didn’t say,
“This is my lover” [Laughter], but he’s there.
Leader T reflected, “I never went around to people saying ‘I’m gay,’ I just did things that
made it clear that I was gay, but I didn’t preach about it.”
For Leader U, a job change that moved him to middle management provided a fortuitous
opportunity of time and place. Outside of the workplace, he had opened up among his LGBTQ

93
peers in a professional association. “It was like a place I felt comfortable.…There’s any number
of people I’m still in contact with now,” even though he has moved on to be active in other
associations. For Leader U, LGBTQ-related professional activity “gave me a sense of comfort.”
But in the workplace, he frequently concealed himself by “omission.”
Leader U’s new institution had two librarians newer to the workforce who were highly
comfortable being open about their sexual identity. Initially, at his new job, Leader U continued
to be reticent: “It wasn’t like I was hiding, but I wasn’t being as open.” As he had done earlier in
the interview, Leader U placed his reticence in the context of his conservative Southern
upbringing:
I spent the first years of my life in the Deep South. It was just a more conservative
environment. So even though a lot of people knew in other places, and I had friends who
did know and I did have people I did talk with, I wasn’t as visibly out.…When I really
started coming out more comfortably…was when I went to [my next job in a more liberal
region of the country] and I was working very closely with two people, both of whom are
now academic library directors….They were both very visibly out, and it made it really
comfortable for me to be out in the workplace and to really just say, “I can do this.”
Everybody knew they were gay….A lot of people there knew they had long-time
spouses, they had partners. So I think they were just there, they were very comfortable
but once again it was not like trumpets blaring, but they just made no secret of the fact
that they had same sex partners. And everybody knew that. Everybody who they worked
with knew it. I think I thought…if they can do it, I can now feel comfortable doing it.
And they’re both younger than I am, but it was interesting having them sort of as a

94
mentor to help me say, “I can do this,” and there are no repercussions. So that’s what
kind of really helped me to finally kick that door open completely.
In subsequent chapters, the leaders’ varying concepts of “complete” disclosure will be further
explored. At this juncture, Leader U’s narrative is notable for identifying a turning point driven
by two younger librarians who nurtured his LGBTQ visibility. In an earlier study (Schneider,
2016), this researcher used the phrase “road-paving,” borrowed from a participant in that study,
to describe the phenomena of support for sexual identity disclosure and expression from a large,
heterogeneous assortment of stakeholders, who also provided support for navigating the world at
large as a visible sexual minority. (This phenomenon is discussed further in Chapter 8.) The
concept of “kicking open a door” that Leader U associated with the idea of coming out of the
closet is also a highly agentic metaphor with widely-understood resonance among LGBTQ
people of Leader U’s era. This figure of speech recalled for him a Keith Haring graphic used for
the first National Coming Out Day in 1988 in which an androgynous figure is kicking open a
door (Haring, 1988; also see Appendix H), reinforcing that this memory represents a powerful
time for him in terms of taking action toward what represented to him as being out “completely.”
For Leader V, moving into a mid-career management role was preceded by the
pleasurable quandary of deciding between two job offers at university libraries, labeled here
Library A and Library B, in the city of his choice. Library A offered domestic partner benefits,
the first time since Leader V began his longtime relationship with Partner V that this was an
option for him.
I knew that the job at Library B would have been the better choice for advancing in my
career as a librarian. It was the associate director of the library and they were interested in
me, but Library B at the time…didn’t offer domestic partner benefits. And I was with

95
[Partner V] at that point about four years, and Library A did [offer domestic partner
benefits]. And I thought, “Well, I’ve made a whole series of choices around this
relationship that objectively, if I valued my career more, I’d let go of all those
things”….Even though Library A is a world class organization, and the job was great and
I loved all the people and it was just a fabulous experience, I know had I chosen the job a
Library B, I would have progressed more quickly into a leadership position in the library,
I just would have, but that wasn’t what was important.
“What was important” to Leader V was not simply the utilitarian value of employee
benefits for him and his partner. To Leader V, “the benefits represented something about the
relationship,” which in this era, prior to marriage equality, was a validation by his future
employer that Leader V’s relationship and identity were part of who he was as an employee.
“And I was certainly very clear with the person who became my boss at Library A the
importance of this, going into the job and into the interview rounds.” In Leader V’s recollection,
even the act of filling out benefit paperwork, a mundane task that can be taken for granted by
heterosexual employees, was rich with symbolic power. He described how even all these years
later, his partner remembered the experience of going to HR with him to sign the paperwork,
“feeling acknowledged and validated and welcomed as a couple in a formal way, a ritual kind of
way.” It was an experience made even more special because the HR professional “was such an
affirming individual; it was an extraordinary experience.”
Leader V described experiencing strong support in his role at this institution. He
recounted how as an out gay man and a rising managerial leader, he had the full faith of his
supervisor that he would be able to make hard decisions:

96
When I came into the organization, I inherited a group of staff, and within a year none of
those staff were still there. My boss gave me full rein and support to really redefine the
operation, which is what she wanted to have someone come in and do. And I did it with I
think integrity and care, but I clearly established that we were going to do things
differently and that there was going to be a new vision for the way this unit operated. And
then I built [the department] from zero employees to 25.
When asked if there was a connection between his confidence that he could be a fully out
gay man in a leadership role and his ability to lead a major workforce redesign, Leader V pointed
back to “integrity,” a word that came up repeatedly in the interview, which in the conversation he
tied to the notion of strength:
I feel like I operated with integrity in doing that, and maybe in presenting myself as a
whole person and with my sexual identity just as one factor for people to see that in my
leader role there I was…[Pause] transparent and strong, I guess the word is strong.
Leader V would stay at this mid-career job eight years, only pulled away by an opportunity for a
penultimate leadership role at a nearby institution, as discussed in the next chapter.
In her interview, Leader X initially had trouble recalling what she termed “interesting”
LGBTQ-related memories from mid-career:
This is actually also when [my] identity shifts from being lesbian-centric to being almost
librarian-centric. At a certain point, life takes over. And sexual identity, once you’ve
accepted how you’re going to present yourself, how you’re going to be in the world, what
you find to be acceptable in relationships, et cetera: it’s just life. It’s just boring. Like
when we show the lesbian menace, and it’s somebody paying bills, going grocery

97
shopping, kids if you have kids, animals if you don’t, it’s just life. And so I just wasn’t
that interesting.
Yet Leader X subsequently recalled important road-paving relationships from mid-career,
people who affirmed her in her lesbian identity, encouraged her in professional LGBTQ
activities related to collections and services, and modeled a way forward as a gay leader:
I was always very active in all of my jobs in doing queer work that was embedded in
everything, [such as] the gay and lesbian collections that I built at [my library]. And that
was under the auspice of the dean of the library, who by the way was also a gay man and
who was an amazing mentor of mine. And that library I had the AUL who was a
somewhat closeted lesbian and then [a] quietly out gay man who…to this day still emails
me and calls me. He thinks of me as one of his stars, and I find that so amazing and so
cool.
Furthermore, as the interview continued, Leader X described a connection between her
sexual identity and her mid-career success. She recounted how at her first middle-management
job, the library dean selected her to represent the library to a consortium, in a setting where most
of the representatives were librarians with more experience and in more senior roles:
I was probably six months on the job there and he picked me out of all the librarians, he
says, “You’re going to be the representative who’s going to go to these meetings with the
AULs.” Because he just felt that I would learn from being in on these conversations. And
it was amazing how much I learned. It was being doused with a fire hose. It was all of
these universities…all coming together to [work on an innovative project]. And just
knowing that I was there with the big kids and that I was supported by my AUL and by
my dean, that was so powerful and I would just sit and take it all in. And that allowed me

98
to grow professionally. And I do think some of that is when you’re queer, if you’re not
following rules, you don’t necessarily say to yourself, “Well, I haven’t been in this long
enough to take on that responsibility, or I haven’t earned my seat at the table.” Rules are
not the same for us as they are for other people, I think.
When asked what she meant by rules being different for LGBTQ people, Leader X
referenced the concept of queer time (Halberstam, 2005), which she summarized:
[It] struck me…we don’t operate on the same timeline that heterosexual people do. We
don’t date in high school, for the most part. Maybe the kids now get to, but we certainly
never really got to. You learn how to do relationships at a much later age. You are not for
the most part controlled by the ticking baby clock. You are not controlled by marriage,
“Oh, you’re an old maid, oh you’re not married yet?” If you’re an out person or even if
you’re self-recognized to yourself, you know that you’re not on the same clock as your
girlfriends are, as the people you’re bridesmaids for. And so in some ways we’re always
a little separate. We have freedom to explore and to do things that people who buy into
the dominant heterosexual paradigm do not always have the ability to separate
themselves from. And some folks do. There’s no hard and fast rules for everyone, but I
do think that queers have the ability to challenge norms.
What is significant for this study is not establishing “queer time” as an objective fact, but
rather the importance of a queer-centric concept to Leader X’s construction of self in the context
of her evolution as a managerial leader. Her narrative recalls one of Bullard’s LGBTQ university
presidents commenting that “I often don’t think like other people, I look for the unexpected
solution because that is what disenfranchised people have to do normally to be successful”
(Bullard, 2013, p. 44). In the space of a few minutes, Leader X wove a tale of her mid-career

99
success in which being lesbian had become mundane, even unimportant; yet that same selfconcept was elastic enough to recognize LGBTQ relationships as crucial to her success and
included a working epistemology of her success as a leader that was at heart radical, different,
and rules-breaking—a finding that is discussed again in the context of transformational
leadership in Chapter 8.
At mid-career, Leader W was finding his way as an openly gay librarian living and
working in “a very small conservative town,” and he too poked at the rules. He recalled town and
gown activism on behalf of all LGBTQ people in his community. “We would hold diversity
weeks there and I really think because of that, I think that some of those things helped [the local
Pride festival] come into being. I think we made real inroads.” Yet, Leader W also observed, “At
the same time we still had a lot of struggles.” He recalled an encounter with a university
president over students who wanted to hold a drag show (an entertainment event in which artists,
often but not always male, outfitted in opposite-sex garb and grooming, perform with an
exaggerated sensibility):
The one that comes to mind most that really bothered me was the students wanted to have
a drag show on campus and I tried running that through administration and would not get
an approval for it. But at the same time, we didn’t have fraternities at [my institution]—
but we did [Laughter]. They were named something else, but they were all male and they
had initiation stuff and all that but they were able to do womanless beauty pageants….I
wrote to the president at the time that that really bothered me because I see them as
misogynistic in some way in their portrayal of women, whereas drag is a celebration of
women, I think. So that bothered me there.

While the social function of drag has been subject to extensive debate—see Rupp, Taylor, and
Shapiro (2010) for a compact summary of the chain of inquiry regarding “whether drag affirms
or contests hegemonic gender” (p. 277)—what is significant here is that Leader W felt quite
clearly that gay students were experiencing discriminatory treatment. However, on the heels of
this memory, Leader W also recalled successes:
But at the same time, I was also able to get sexual orientation into the nondiscrimination
policy there. And I said, “If you really want to be progressive, you’ll include gender
identification,” but they weren’t ready to go there yet. [Laughter] So making those little
inroads.
Leader W carried his LGBTQ activism and related work history to another mid-career
position in a small conservative town, where he “became the advisor to the gay students,” and
continued his activism on behalf of LGBTQ issues. He concluded, “I think my being out there,
again, made the students feel safe and secure in being who they were on campus.”
For Leader Y, who stayed at the same institution from the mid-1990s until 2015, midcareer was a time when she was making her own “little inroads” on campus on behalf of
students. Living in a conservative community where she did not feel safe being disclosed outside
of her university, she divided her time between the college and her involvement with national
LGBTQ professional activity. For the students, in addition to creating events and get-togethers,
Leader Y served as someone to whom they could safely come out. Students would “drop by the
office and just tell me they were gay and then they’d leave, just so they could say it. It was pretty
amazing. It was very intense.”

101
When Leader Y met and fell in love with a faculty member in another department at her
institution, her campus advocacy broadened to include employee issues, and she leveraged skills
she had gained from her work with professional groups.
I was in a relationship…for 14 years.…She and I were very out, they called us the lesbian
power couple.…One of the things that I did because of her was I sort of took the
leadership position on getting domestic partner benefits. I started at the faculty senate
level.
Leader Y explained that through LGBTQ association work, she had been taught that
LGBTQ allies who are job-seeking want to know that prospective institutions support LGBTQ
employees. She believed it was important to stress that her institution had “lost good people”
who chose not to apply, or who left, due to lack of these benefits. Leader Y’s advocacy for
domestic partner benefits initially met pushback. Her director reported to a dean, who sent
Leader Y an email criticizing her for having a “political agenda.” Leader Y recalled, “And I
wrote back and I said, well, this is what’s happening in the world.” Leader Y persisted on the
issue of domestic partner benefits, writing reports about competitive institutions in her
institution’s region that offered benefits, and repeatedly bringing the issue to faculty senate,
including during the reign of a hostile college president who then moved on. “I think it was, oh
my gosh, it was like the year 2002, they finally did it [approved domestic partner benefits], after
I needled [presidents and trustees] for seven years, and the faculty senate began needling them.”
Throughout this time she felt confident not only in the support of “almost the entire faculty,” but
also in the support of her library director, who had made it clear he thought Leader Y was a great
asset to their college. “I think I even said to [him], ‘I know that you’ll protect me if somebody
decided maybe I shouldn’t work here anymore because of this.’ And so I kept on.”

102
For Leader Y and others, “keeping on” also meant negotiating the tokenism and sense of
obligation associated with being “the only one,” particularly when it was known there were other
LGBTQ employees in key positions who chose to conceal their identity. Leader Y’s frustration
with being the sole leader of LGBTQ advocacy for students and faculty led to an opportunity to
prod others on campus to become more involved in LGBTQ diversity initiatives.
I was the only out faculty member on campus, the first.…I knew for a fact there were
other gay people on the faculty, gay women, one gay man. Well, he wasn’t out, they just
knew he was gay, it just wasn’t discussed.…I was angry at them. [I thought] “Why
haven’t you done something for these students? Why?”…I had to build every goddamn
diversity committee known to humanity. And then I got fed up and I said, “Look, you
guys never accomplish anything, the same people are always on these committees,” and I
said, “I don’t want to be on this committee anymore,” so I quit.
At which point others on campus stepped up to participate, and over time, closeted LGBTQ
faculty began disclosing their identities.
Leader Z reported having a relatively smooth mid-career progression in a liberal
institution, but she recounted stories that describe negotiating her butch identity in the
workplace, particularly as an up-and-coming managerial leader:
I’d run into problems of how to dress up…it must have been at whatever point I started to
be going to meetings or social events where you had to dress it up. From there I was like,
“Well, the way to dress this up is to go for a suit” [Laughter].
Leader Z could not recall the first time she wore a menswear suit to work, but she had
clear memories of leaders who let her know that she was welcome just as she was. As with other
participants in this study, as the interview progressed, her stories at times revealed internal

103
struggles that contradicted her initial bravado. Though she said, “Never once did I fear that my
sexuality or my gender presentation was going to jeopardize my job in any way,” her narratives
suggest otherwise, pointing to a preoccupation with how her gender expression was interpreted.
She described one of the university librarians she worked for as “a totally straight guy” who was
nonetheless “a phenomenal mentor to me,” and she recalled,
It was probably one of the first times I was wearing a tie and he made some comment
about “nice tie,” and he was serious. And then a couple of weeks later we had some
donor event that afternoon and he says, “Hey, [Leader Z], I’ll do you one better. I got a
bowtie for today.” So he shows me his bowtie and it’s like, “Yeah, I never really figured
out the bowtie thing.” He’s like, “I can teach you how to tie a bowtie.” And then a couple
of days later I’m headed to [a] conference and he sends me an email about his favorite
store in [that town] to buy bowties. I mean, you really can’t ask for anything more
supportive than that, right? And I really know that that is a lucky thing.
Leader Z’s cadence slowed as she reflected, “That is just an amazing privilege to be able
to feel like I don’t have to worry.”
Leader R’s mid-career journey included increasing managerial responsibility, but he
continued to provide instruction and research help to university students. While, as noted in the
previous chapter, at the beginning of the interview Leader R had referred to “being out as a
matter of course,” his stories made clear that Leader R was monitoring disclosure and its
repercussions and adapting his behavior accordingly. He recalled how he took his cues for when
to be “neutral” and when to speak up from a mid-level administrator who was a road-paver for
Leader R:

104
At my previous job…there is [an openly gay man] who’s worked in a number of roles
there.…He really knew the community very well and when I was first starting there, I
think it’s safe to say that he set a standard for what would be acceptable and how to
balance that, being open within the family of the university but not drawing the ire of the
[larger religious community of this institution].
Despite the career success of this openly gay man, the lessons of his experiences were
also cautionary. Leader R recalled how this administrator, who had led campus ministry—a
significant, highly visible role in faith-based institutions—had to change roles at the university.
“They actually had to move him from that position because the [denomination’s religious
leaders] became aware and decided that it was inappropriate for him to be serving in that role.”
Leader R’s approach was to create what he called a “neutral persona.”
There were times when I was working at [this university] when I had my reference
librarian hat on and I felt like I had to try to present a more neutral persona, especially if
there were students who might be researching issues about sexuality. And that I wouldn’t
want my own situation to influence their ability to ask me questions about stuff that
maybe I didn’t agree with.
As with Leader Z’s bowties, Leader R’s symbolic “reference librarian hat” represents
metonymically how he negotiated his identity as an LGBTQ professional in this space where
there were limits, however hard to discern, around identity expression. Nevertheless, there were
also limits to Leader R’s neutrality, as this story about a classroom incident demonstrates:
I can think of one occasion where I confronted a student who in a classroom setting said
“That’s so gay” about something. And I said, “I’m sorry,” and asked her to explain
herself. And I said, “I’m gay. What are you trying to say about something being gay?”

105
And she got very flustered and her work partner said [to the student], “Dude, that’s not
cool.” And she was very apologetic and I said, “That’s fine, just use the right
terminology. Now, let’s work on finding what you need for your paper.” She was kind of
horrified, but I just went with it and we worked through it.
As with Leader Y, Leader R also found himself in the “town queer” role, this time not
merely as an advocate for students and faculty but as living proof of his institution’s commitment
to diversity, a story he recounted without apparent rancor:
I had been the faculty advisor to the LGBT student group of [my previous university] for
16 years. And whenever there was an issue that came up, say we had a student who was
harassed and their parents came to campus and they were upset, I would be brought in
kind of as the professional gay, the official gay, to talk about how we just really were a
welcoming place.
Leader R also noted that he felt comfortable pursuing association work related to LGBTQ
issues and that it was no impediment to tenure, and he recalled LGBTQ librarians in other
institutions who, recalling the earlier experiences of Leader S, were discouraged from LGBTQrelated activities and scholarly agendas:
I had colleagues who were at the same point in their career that I was pursuing tenure,
who could not pursue committee work with GLBTRT because it would not look good on
their CV or that they would not get support for it. And sometimes the message then was
pretty clear that you really need to focus on your own area of work responsibility. So they
wouldn’t say “We’re going to discriminate against you because of this,” but “You should
focus more on this,” even if there was a clear connection [from LGBTQ activity to their
work]. I never felt that.

106
This delicate balance at Leader R’s formative institution played out for well over a decade. He
recalled how he learned to empower students to seek answers to questions regardless of their
worldviews, but to also to enforce a respectful classroom environment; and he saw that it was
possible to be too gay, particularly in the wrong role. But he was also welcome to pursue
LGBTQ issues as part of his scholarly agenda, and he was valued for presenting the university’s
commitment to diversity in a flattering light.
Discussion
The mid-career identity negotiations of Leader R and the other participants helped shape
them into the leaders they would become, in their strengths and complexities, and began
establishing their leadership agendas. At the same time, as their political acumen developed, their
sexual identities thrummed in the background, identities they were at once proud of, concerned
about, and believed they were managing.
The small body of literature related to LGBTQ leadership in higher education
acknowledges that identity enactment is important (Andreas, 2005; Bullard, 2013; Christo, 2015;
Coon, 2001; Kenney, 2008; Mathes, 2007; Schneider, 2016). But this body of literature is
generally silent on exactly how leaders express or enact their sexual identity in their
organizations and across their work histories, a finding that drove this study. The participants’
stories suggest that in some cases, their earliest experiences in the workplace set a pattern of
expression that accompanied them into their mid-career. Leader T’s growing representation of
his identity through community choruses and through the presence of his partner at social events
echoes one of his first narratives in the previous chapter, when as a very junior librarian, two
senior librarians took him under their wing to share their knowledge and welcome him, while not
actually articulating that they were gay. It is as if that early experience, embedded in an era when

107
so much was unspoken, created a model of identity expression—unmistakable in its message, but
performed, rather than articulated in everyday speech—that Leader T would adapt to his own
needs and circumstances.
Several of these leaders carried their early student-centered advocacy into mid-career,
whether through the long slog of Leader Y establishing “every goddamn diversity committee,”
through Leader S and W addressing crises of the moment such as the murder of Matthew
Shepard, or through Leader W’s experience with addressing inequities in LGBTQ student
programming and campus policy. Their activities also gave them crucial social-organizational
connections through a wide range of allies and stakeholders—phenomena observed by Bullard
(2013), Mathes (2007), and Schneider (2016), and discussed in greater depth later in this study—
and also served as methods for signaling their identity.
Turning points for these leaders ranged from responding to crises of the moment, such as
the death of Matthew Shepard, to the longer, gentler progress made by Leader Q and Leader U,
for whom sexual identity expression was complicated by time and place, as well as by racial
identity, in the case of Leader Q. A change in region, and daily contact with two younger
LGBTQ professionals more comfortable in their identities, helped Leader U, if not exactly kick
down the closet door like Keith Haring’s cartoon figure, share more about his identity in the
workplace and not use the art of omission to let others assume he was straight. Leader Q, in the
interview, initially dismissed the significance of his desert experience, only to find, as he
surfaced long-sleeping and painful memories of that era, that he could connect his retreat to the
back of the closet in the middle of nowhere to the existential angst of the AIDS era. Leader Q’s
subsequent decision to return to civilization can be seen as an implicit decision to be more
himself, personally and professionally, in the face of this crisis. For Leader S, an opportunity for

108
a step up also placed her in a workplace that was distinctly affirming of her identity-focused
activism and scholarly work and encouraged her to use this work to develop managerial and
leadership skills.
All of the participants implicitly or explicitly exercised high selectivity about their midcareer job choices. Leader V’s decision to take the job at Library B—a slower path to leadership
at a more affirming institution—illustrates how openly LGBTQ professionals carefully negotiate
career decisions. The scholarship in this area documents how job selection is driven not only by
pragmatic decisions about workplace rights and benefits and assessments about the degree of
welcome in surrounding regions, but also by the degree to which employees feel truly welcome
as they are (Button, 2001; Chrobot-Mason et al., 2001; Griffith & Hebl, 2002; Ragins, 2008;
Ragins et al., 2007; Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow, 2013). Leader V’s story of visiting the HR
representative to sign domestic partner paperwork is notable not only in that it represents a
positive outcome of a carefully-considered career decision; but from the framework of narrative
inquiry, it stands out that an incident so seemingly mundane would be remembered at all, and is
an example of the ongoing consciousness of minority identity the participants carried into their
leadership roles, a key outcome of stigma (Crocker et al., 1998; Fiske, 1998; Goffman, 1963).
The participants’ stories, and how they told them, also revealed a vulnerability and
pattern of concern that fit well with stigma and stereotype theory in describing constant
emotional labor, or minority stress, experienced by the participants (Meyer, 1995), and recall the
observation of Crocker et al. (1998) that “the stigmatized are never entirely free of the possibility
of encountering prejudice in others” (p. 516). But this minority stress appears to have been
balanced with a pragmatic and persistent long-range will to endure and survive. This concept is
hard to express in English with a single term, but is known in German and Yiddish as

109
überstehen. The participants took on roles as the “town queer,” forged ahead for years as the lone
advocates for basic workplace rights such as domestic partner benefits, and confronted prejudice
from administrators and students. They also juggled the minority stress and tokenism of being
“the only one,” sometimes in situations where they knew that they were not the only LGBTQ
people in their institutions, but rather the only ones who had elected to be open about their
identity. When they were confident in the support of their leaders, they occasionally “punched
up,” as Leader Y did when the dean confronted her, and they sometimes lost fights but soldiered
on, as Leader W did when his administration forbade gay students to hold a drag show even as it
approved heterosexual male students to dress as women for amusement.
Crocker et al. (1998) observed, “The tendency for stigmatized individuals to deny or
minimize the role of prejudice and discrimination in their personal lives does not seem to apply
to their judgments of the role of prejudice and discrimination in the outcomes of their groups” (p.
523). Even if at the start of their interviews for this study the participants initially presented their
work lives with a patina of leader-like bravado and minimized the role of prejudice in their
experience, the transcripts show that participants worried about how they appeared and how they
were received, indicating that they understood the workplace to be a place of potential
discrediting and discrimination. In a similar vein, Leader Z’s statement that she did not “have to
worry” about her butch identity points to the constant awareness, or hyper-vigilance, common to
the stigmatized, as does her comment that this level of acceptance is “a lucky thing,” suggesting
that this lack of worry is infrequently experienced by others. Leader X similarly brushed off her
mid-career experiences with humorous comments and suggestions that at that time her sexual
identity was not as important to her as her work identity, but then reframed her mid-career work
experience within queer theory. This duality—to portray themselves as successful, while

110
constantly negotiating an environment where their identity always carried the potential to
implicitly or explicitly undermine their success—would follow them into their penultimate and
senior executive roles.

Chapter 7: Late-career and Retirement

When I interviewed [a librarian] to be head of Reference and Research Services, in our
one-on-one meeting at the end of the day, he asked how an openly gay man would be
received at a [religious] institution. I smiled and replied, “I don't think you will have a
problem. Your prospective boss is an openly gay man.”
—Leader Q

Introduction
As the leaders moved into penultimate and then senior executive positions, they also
moved forward in parallel with the rushing tide of history and their personal development. While
Appendix H demonstrates that LGBTQ rights have not had strictly linear progress across time,
overall, the world these leaders occupied underwent extraordinary changes, even as they matured
as adults and became seasoned professionals with sharpened acumen and well-honed managerial
toolsets. The leaders encountered LGBTQ-related challenges, but generally resolved them, and
often operated comfortably as the “only one.” At the same time, their experiences, as well as
their political sophistication, and their ongoing awareness of their minority identity, produced a
certain persistent guardedness, or “armor” as Leader X referred to it, in which they continuously
monitored their own presentation of self while simultaneously monitoring, or speculating on, the
reactions of others.
Leader T, whose career began in 1963 and who was a senior executive from early in his
career, retired approximately 40 years later, after being openly gay in the workplace for over 15
years. Though he was the “only one” in a senior administrative role in his faith-based institution,
he described feeling comfortable in his role and accepted by his superiors, who made a point of

112
acknowledging his identity. He recalled, “I was very pleased when my boss [would say], ‘Please
bring your significant other [to a university event].’” Leader T also participated in securing a
$100,000 donation for the library from a local donor. While the question of his identity did not
come up for these donors, he reported that it was understood by his superiors that he was open
about his identity when he was enlisted for this advancement activity, and he believed their trust
was another indication of his level of acceptance at his campus.
Since retirement, Leader T has used his time to participate in LGBTQ professional
activities, bringing his decades of leadership experience to association groups that tend to attract
early-career librarians and taking on time-consuming committee roles that as a working leader he
had not had the time for. He also encouraged library leaders he knew to be closeted gay men to
take steps out of the closet through attending LGBTQ professional activities such as receptions
for LGBTQ book awards. He explained, “I just thought they could be more open, actually. They
were hiding but didn’t need to hide. I didn’t need to, and they didn’t need to either.”
In previous chapters, Leader U had recounted his reticence and his relatively slow
journey out of the closet compared to his peers, and how younger colleagues had demonstrated to
him that sharing identity through everyday conversation could feel natural and comfortable. His
ability to be more clearly disclosed resulted in an opportunity while in a penultimate leadership
role to road-pave for a young gay Latino librarian for whom Leader U was the first gay male he
had reported to. Leader U reflected, “I think I was a mentor to him in a lot of ways.” For Leader
U to be openly gay made this librarian “more comfortable with me as a boss, and made him more
comfortable being who he was.” Leader U spoke to the advantage for this young man of Leader
U representing that “you too can do this, you can be gay and move upward in management.” He
recalled,

113
Even though it was a boss-employee relationship, we would sometimes cross that area
more like two buddies, just two friends.…We didn’t go out socially, we didn’t do
anything social, other than lunch occasionally. But I think it helped him, and it helped
him also having someone…fairly openly gay, but also someone who was achieving more
and was aspiring to do more.
After being hired into a senior leadership role, Leader U sought the services of an
executive coach to hone his skill set, as well as address lingering questions he had regarding his
comfort level with being openly gay in the workplace. He noted, “She’s really good at asking
questions and drawing people out.” He and the coach “went through a whole series of different
types of things within the context of my leadership and trying to say where did it impact me,
where did it not.” In reflecting on what he learned from the coaching sessions, his observations
suggest the role nondisclosure can play in reinforcing stereotype threat:
I think what I finally decided is it [being gay] doesn’t matter that much. It really doesn’t.
I’m still the head of [the library], I’m still all this, and that really any place where it
[being gay] does start to impact is me driving, it’s not the other person. It’s where I feel
uncomfortable, but not that they’ve done anything, not that they’ve said anything….So
often times it’s just me, and it’s not them. It’s not their influence, it’s probably all my
history and my background of choosing to be less open.
Leader U also found he could leverage his role to help disenfranchised people at his
institution and in the profession at large. When asked if being the leader of the library gave him
additional power to speak truth to issues, he said,
It certainly does, it gives me a lot of power, which I think is a piece of it. As I have
gained more and more power because of leadership roles, it makes it easier because now I

114
have the backing…of the university if I challenged someone’s behavior on something
like that, that they would back me back on it.
Leader U recalled a “situation” where one employee made a racist comment to another,
and though the situation was ultimately handled by the diversity office at his institution, Leader
U made sure the employee who was the object of the comment understood that he had Leader
U’s support. He smiled as he recalled, “I told the employee…‘I will back you 100 percent here,’”
and reflected,
It’s taken a lot for me to evolve to this place, I guess it’s partly my evolution as a leader
but partly my evolution as a gay male, and as a gay male also partly is being out there
and…evolving those processes, at some points intersecting, at some points maybe
diverging.
For Leader U, it also helped that his new institution was in a region more welcoming than his
previous institution, and that he was not the “only one.” He underscored that the university’s
leadership circle he was part of included an African-American woman, an African-American
man, and a woman from the Middle East, and he clearly took pride in his “fairly diverse
campus”:
We have some people here [in administrative roles] who…are very visible and openly
gay. The head of our faculty development center just recently married her long-term
partner. I think this university is very clearly not homophobic.…One of the reasons I’m
enjoying being in [a more liberal region] again is getting away from the institutional
homophobia that exists in other places.
While Leader U was unsure if the students in his institution always understood he was
gay, he had recently volunteered for a student mentoring program and had told the program that

115
he would be “especially interested in mentoring LGBT students.” He noted the value to these
students “when they are 20 or 18 years old [seeing] there are people who are senior leaders who
are out”; while he did not explicitly connect this to his own experience, there was clearly an
implicit connection to his journey.
For Leader Q, a senior leadership role led to a flourishing of expressed identity through
the encouragement of an unanticipated road-paver. In the mid-1990s, Leader Q, after deciding a
penultimate administrative position he was in had reached a dead end, “dusted off his résumé”
and applied for a senior executive academic library job in a liberal urban environment. Similar to
his earlier story about moving to a remote site, he initially described his primary motivation for
that assignment as being “really about career,” not about being in an LGBTQ-welcoming
environment. Yet Leader Q also noted that he had “done my time in those places” (meaning nonurban regions) “and I’m only going to go to certain places for a job,” suggesting again that place,
and its level of welcome for his sexual identity, had significance for him.
Leader Q recalled, “every time I moved to a new location, I took a step back” in
deliberately expressing his sexual identity. Leader Q approached this job search and his first
months on the new job with reticence about his sexual identity. In this case, a new role as senior
leader, as well as being employed by a faith-based institution, reinforced his decision to be
discreet. But in recounting his experience concealing his identity, Leader Q also acknowledged
the human capacity for self-deception:
I think you begin to fool yourself in that, okay, so you’re coming to this job as the new
dean, you’re a young guy, people think you’re attractive, you think you look pretty good
and yet you’re single. So I think I was kind of ignoring the fact that if nothing else,
people’s wheels were beginning to turn and they say, “Oh, he’s not married, oh!” But to

116
me it’s like well, I’m not…marching down [a major thoroughfare] holding a gay flag, so
why would they think that I was gay?
Leader Q concluded, “I was kidding myself, and probably had been kidding myself even
in earlier jobs.” Leader Q prefaced the following story by saying, “I say this to go back to the
perception of how you’re being perceived.” During his job interview, a gay member of Leader
Q’s search committee deduced Leader Q was gay, though Leader Q thought he had successfully
masked his identity; in turn, Leader Q correctly deduced the employee’s sexual identity, and
shortly thereafter disclosed his status to the employee. After Leader Q began his new job, a gay
man working in another part of the university had seemingly chance encounters with Leader Q
that blossomed into a relationship. Leader Q and the employee who had served on his search
committee subsequently had a conversation:
He said, “Are you dating anyone?” I said, “As a matter of fact, I am, you know them.”
And he said, “Who?” And I said, “[Partner Q]”.…He said, “Oh my God! You won’t
believe this, but after you interviewed I told [Partner Q] that we are getting ready to hire
this very sharp new dean…and I think you and he will make a great couple.” And so I
was shocked, because in my mind no one [participating in the job interview] had any idea
what was going on with me. And while I was interviewing, [that employee] was sitting
there and the wheels are turning, “Hmm, I think he and [Partner Q] would be a good
match.”
Partner Q subsequently became a critical road-paver for Leader Q, though it was a path
Leader Q was sometimes pulled along reluctantly. Up to then, though Leader Q was out to key
people in his workplace, it was an identity he intended to manage quite carefully. He assumed he
was controlling who had this information and the timetable for when they received it, and one

117
method for control was through communicating that he was not living with a same-sex partner.
Leader Q’s identity agenda became complicated by Partner Q, who wanted to move their
relationship forward by living together. Leader Q said that up to that point he had never lived
with a man, and had assumed that living alone communicated, “you can think what you want, but
I’m not living with another man, I’m not living with a woman so you can guess, but I’m not
confirming.” He recalled,
So we find this place and we decide to buy….I go to work after we take time off to move
in…I run into a colleague and he says, “Oh how are you [Leader Q]? I haven’t seen you
in forever.” So I said I’m fine. He said, “What have you been doing?” I say, “I took a few
days off, had a nice holiday but bought a house [in a neighboring city] so took some time
to move in.” “Oh great, congratulations.” A couple of days later, he runs into [Partner Q].
“Oh Partner Q, how are you?” “Oh, I’m fine.” “Good, what have you been doing?” “Oh
well you know, took a few days off, I just bought a house in [a neighboring city]…” And
our colleague says, “Oh, what a coincidence. I saw Leader Q the other day and he bought
a house in [a neighboring city].” And Partner Q says, “Yeah, we bought a house
together.” And I remember being so ticked. I’m like, “What? I saw [that mutual
colleague] and I just said I bought a house, I didn’t say…” And [Partner Q] said, “Oh,
please. You need to get over that.” So frankly he was very instrumental in me finally
taking the big leap.
When asked about what comprised the “big leap,” Leader Q replied that it meant
disclosure to “colleagues, friends, and…family.” He attributed his long-term reticence to his
relationship with his mother, with whom he was very close in many ways, but with whom he
also had also maintained a decades-long façade of denying or at least occluding his identity. The

118
purchase of the house with Partner Q prompted Leader Q to preemptively address his mother
head-on. “I never came out to her, I never sat down and said, ‘Ma, your son is gay,’ but I stopped
pretending and hiding and just said, this is my life.…It was a great sense of relief.”
As noted earlier, longstanding theory holds that developmentally, for LGBTQ people,
disclosure to parents is a critical precursor that if left unaddressed becomes unfinished business
that can hinder disclosures in other life domains, including in the workplace (Button, 2001;
Coleman, 1982; Ragins, 2004, 2008). Leader Q attributed the degree of disclosure he reached
with his mother to helping him relax and became less guarded at work. Viewed through theory,
this disclosure allowed him to fill the “absent presence” of his unspoken identity (Ward &
Winstanley, 2003) and to replace his “not-self” (Woodruffe-Burton & Bairstow, 2013) with a
more integrated presentation of self. At work, Leader Q stepped beyond his unconfirmed identity
and began clarifying who he was through artifacts, speech, and action:
I…started talking about Partner Q. I have pictures of him and [their dog] in my office.
I’ve had work people [in our home], colleagues know, all my bosses have known – well,
[one leader] didn’t know, but he was only my boss for two years, but every boss since
then, the three other provosts that I’ve worked for, they all know. All of my dean
colleagues know, everyone in the library knows, everyone across campus knows. So
professionally now everyone knows.
The degree to which Leader Q became agentically present with his identity is evident in
the story of the aftermath of his wedding to Partner Q shortly after their state legalized same-sex
marriage. Leader Q and Partner Q opted for a simple civil ceremony in which they exchanged
rings, and “we both decided to do a little test, a little experiment”:

119
So we said we’re not going to say anything at work, we’re going to wait for people to
notice whether or not. And I wear jewelry and he doesn’t. So we went to work that
Monday morning and I think before 10:00 am, his staff [said], “You got married!” No
one noticed that I have a wedding ring on, and finally I just told folks.…They were all
very happy.
Leader Q reflected on the value of disclosure in the workplace:
I think if anything because of the comfort level of being out and unconcerned, it makes
me be a better [leader]. I don’t have any pretenses. I think in some respects it may even
humanize me a bit more, that staff and colleagues know a bit of my personal life.
Leader Q also discussed the intersection of his racial and sexual identities. “The other thing
that’s interesting for me in the workplace is being open without hesitation to my African
American colleagues.” He discussed how he believed that “the whole ‘down low’ aspect of
African American culture” affected disclosure:
Particularly if you’re a religious person, the whole religious piece connected in. As I
think back over my career [if I had been religiously observant] I never would have been
out. Even if I had been out to my white colleagues, I probably never would have been out
to my black colleagues, and if so, very selectively. Because of the whole church, which
has a great impact on the African American cultural dynamic. But as I became more
comfortable, I decided that I needed to be me, and to be me, that meant being out in the
workplace, to whoever.
Leader Q reflected on an incident that confirmed he was respected by his peers in his
institution. After his school’s provost resigned, “There was a movement on campus from faculty
to appoint me as interim provost.” The institution ultimately hired a former provost to serve in

120
this role, much to Leader Q’s relief, as he had a full plate running his library. Nevertheless,
Leader Q found this validation powerful, particularly in the intersection of sexual identity, race,
and the “diminished influence on campus” and concomitant status anxiety of academic librarians
referenced in this study’s introduction (Wood et al., 2007, p. 4). “It was so affirming for me to
know that I had that level of respect across campus as an out black library dean, not dean of arts
and sciences, but library dean.” He concluded, “I got more joy and satisfaction of knowing that
people thought I could do it rather than actually being appointed to do it.”
In her leadership role, Leader S was also highly attuned to perceptions of her status as a
sexual minority and a librarian. She had not sought a path to leadership:
I didn’t think I was ever going to be a library leader. I’m surprised. I didn’t plan on it. I
didn’t have a career trajectory to accomplish it particularly. I haven’t positioned myself
well ever. I’ve made more job moves because I had a girlfriend somewhere, than because
I needed to do this “thing.”
Leader S described tapping into her own experiences to shape her leadership agenda,
reflecting the challenges and opportunities she experienced as she worked in a variety of settings
over several decades, experiences she used to shape not simply how people work in her
institution—including unfettered access to library equipment, a rebuke to the gated fax machine
from her early days—but also the standards for how library workers would be evaluated:
The kind of leadership that I provide for my staff allows them a great deal of leeway in
using library equipment for whatever they want. I have a lot of flexibility and a lot of
encouragement for people to be involved outside of the library in communities, and I
work with them to sort of translate that into professional attributes. We even recently just

121
changed our promotion and tenure guidelines to reflect different varieties of academic
activism and process as elements that allow for promotion in review.
Leader S described leveraging her experience with direct-action activism and organizing
around causes of the day to build constituencies to support her objectives:
I tend a great deal to the student constituency, and use them or apply them when I want
something that I’m not getting right away from the administration. Say I want a library
classroom on the second floor. I talk to the students about how great it would be to have a
library classroom that they can book, and we can book, and teach stuff in there. So I think
more than other administrators I’m not afraid to use them….Sometimes it doesn’t work,
like sometimes they don’t care about what I want. But often times if I imagine that they
will care about something then I’ll engage them fully with the concerns.
Leader S noted with pride that she was so well accepted in her institution that her peers
who served with her on a council would honor her by wearing her preferred garment, men’s
vests, and referred to her as “the vested one.” However, Leader S was not immune to questioning
the impact of her open sexual identity and butch presentation on her ability to lead. She mused,
“I think sometimes the straight people [in the library] are wondering, ‘God, if she would get off
that or if she were a little bit different maybe we could get somewhere.’” Regarding her own
employees and the perceptions of peers and administrators in her institution, she referenced the
constant subtext of minority stress and the potential for stigma:
They make me wonder…if there is something that I could be doing….But it’s the path
that I’ve cut for myself, it’s the only thing I could think to do. All the chickens have come
to roost, it’s what I am, it’s what I’ve got, it’s what I bring. And sometimes it will work
and sometimes it won’t work so well, but we always wonder. I always wonder. Often.

122
And I hear this from other colleagues who are on the social fringes for whatever reason:
youth or age or ethnicity, race, class, presentation. I hear this a lot. You always wonder.
However picaresque her path to leadership and her curiosity about the perceptions of others,
Leader S felt that her identity-centric activism in early and mid-career, often in the face of
disapproval by others, helped make her a better leader, and in the long run had done more good
than harm:
The full engagement that I was able to have and share with my constituents and with the
causes of the day, and the crises of the day and the principled political positions of the
day, benefited professionally in the end. There was absolutely no harm done. Maybe
advancement didn’t take place for me as fast as it would have, but it did not hinder my
career. It only helped me personally and it helped me as part of the community and so
that allowed me to succeed.
The idea that there was “absolutely no harm done” is countered by the stories Leader S
shared about her earliest work experiences, where she felt the need to be closeted, then faced
opprobrium at her second job for pursuing LGBTQ-related research and activism, only to have
her diversity agenda fully embraced at her fourth job. The interviews surfaced concerns about
whether her identity held her back, but the same decisions and actions co-exist as factors that
contributed to her success.
Leader V reported a relatively smooth rise to his senior leadership position. For him, a
significant critical moment in his organizational development was framed by a personal life
crisis. Several minutes into the interview, while discussing his husband, Leader V said with a
catch in his voice, “you should know that [Pause] he’s at the very end of his life.” Leader V then
shared stories that had a common theme: his willingness to be what he called “true to himself”

123
and live with “integrity,” which included being very direct about his sexual identity. Leader V
talked about how by being open, he had built the foundation of knowing that in a personal crisis
he had the support and empathy of his organization, and that he did not need to disaggregate who
he is was a gay man from either his leadership role or his role as a employee with a seriously ill
spouse. In effect, though he did not frame it this way, he had built the capacity to out himself in
one of the most common areas for concealing behavior: the medical crisis of a family member
(Charmaz, 1991; Goffman, 1963).
Leader V’s husband was receiving care at an institution affiliated with Leader V’s
workplace, and Leader V stated he felt comfortable leveraging his position to advocate for the
best care possible. When asked what he thought the people that he leads were learning during
this health crisis, he responded,
That I’m a strong person, that they know how important [Partner V] is in my life to me.
When he’s come here for treatments and we’ve been outside I’ve invited people to come
out and see him and sit with him. And that I’m a caring individual. And I can also
continue to function, both in my work and outside my work. And that I bring the same
sort of personal characteristics and skills to my work that I’ve been doing in his
caring.…I’ve just been very open and forthright about it.
Even in the depths of his family medical crisis, Leader V continued in the informal
“professional gay” role reported by most of the participants as a spokesperson and educator for
LGBTQ awareness and sensitivity:
The one interesting thing has been, and it continues to this day, you’re on the phone with
someone and I’ll say my spouse blah, blah, blah, I’m representing my spouse and they’ll
say, “What’s your wife’s name?” And I don’t hesitate, I’ll say, [Partner V]. And I just

124
think it’s been a really interesting experience at…[an] academic center like this…to try
and educate people to think maybe a little more carefully before they make assumptions.
Leader Y experienced a very different kind of crisis in late career, one that was seismic in
its impact on her life and yet opened career opportunities she had not anticipated. She had been
comfortable in her penultimate role at an institution she had worked at since early in her career,
and assumed she would advance to her library’s leadership role someday, following the
retirement of her director. Her earlier campus advocacy had been tempered by the demands of
supervision, management, scholarly activity, faculty governance, and leading a building project
to a successful conclusion. Nonetheless, Leader Y continued to assume greater responsibilities in
LGBTQ professional activities at the national level and continued to live a visible lesbian
identity on campus. However, after her institution was rocked by a sudden, Brobdingnagian
financial and governance crisis, Leader X found herself seeking employment for the first time in
over two decades. She recalled,
When I started applying for other positions, one of these positions that I applied for,
everybody thought, “Oh you’ll get an interview, it’s so obvious,” because it was an
institution that was looking for a director, a private institution [nearby]. And somebody
who knows that institution well, he’s about to retire from [the institution], he’s a gay
man, he said, “Girl, I hope you de-gayed that résumé.” And I said, “Of course not.” And
he said, “Did you get an interview?” And I said no. “Well, why do you think you didn’t?”
And I said, “Really? Well then I didn’t want to be there anyway” [Laughter].
I asked Leader Y why she had not “de-gayed” her résumé. She replied, “Well, because I don’t
approve of lying, for one thing.” She continued by describing the LGBTQ-related activity on her
résumé and how this work had helped her build managerial skills and had “given me these

125
opportunities to know people across a huge spectrum of our profession,” and she believed that
redacting these activities from her résumé would diminish her scholarly record. She concluded
by exclaiming, “Why would I take those off my résumé? Tell me. Do I want to be in a place
where I have to lie? No. I’d rather work at Whole Foods.”
After several job interviews, Leader Y was hired into a senior executive library role in
her wider region. The new position not only gave Leader Y the opportunity to be a senior leader,
it also resulted in her meeting a woman on campus who would soon become her partner. She
described how she explained to her new employees, “Before you hear it through the grapevine, I
am seeing [Partner Y],” to which she described her employees responding, “‘Oh my God, that’s
so great. I really appreciate you telling us. I’m so happy for you.’” Leader Y added that as a new
leader in an institution where the previous leader had been there several decades, being able to
talk about her relationship with her employees “makes me more human” to them.
Leader Y also shared that her new region was more liberal than the region for her
previous institution, something that brought unexpected benefits:
But something also has clicked in my head about living here and how much better off I
am living here. Because [Partner Y] and I were walking down the street to this diner to
have breakfast one morning and she took hold of my hand, and I froze. And she said,
“Listen, nobody cares, this is [the city we live in]. Don’t even think about it. Nothing will
happen to us. Nobody even sees this anymore.”
Leader Y reflected, speaking very slowly, “I have never, ever felt this free with my
orientation in my life, really.” So in an interesting twist on the LGBTQ person who is closeted at
work but open elsewhere, and after staying true to herself in her job search, the crisis of an

126
unanticipated job change led to Leader Y finally being able to be more fully herself in another
life domain where she had for so long felt restricted.
When opportunity presented itself, Leader X left her penultimate library leadership
position for a senior executive role in another institution. She felt fulfilled professionally, but
noted that while she was open about her sexual identity she kept her guard up in her position as a
leader and also as a lesbian. “There are rules, there are lines that you have to have. I don’t trust
that people won’t misconstrue. I don’t trust that people come with open hearts, and so I try not to
take chances.” She continued,
And that’s a lesson I’ve had to be very careful about learning. And I don’t always
remember it and I have to remind myself, don’t relax, don’t get too casual with the people
who you can’t trust. And that’s pretty much anybody that works for you, that’s basically
a managerial perspective but I think it’s doubly important when you’re gay or lesbian.
There are crazy people out there, and do not put yourself in a position where somebody
can use your sexual identity against you.
To illustrate her worldview, Leader X shared a story about confronting a peer who
boasted to her about his children having the opportunity to be present during a Congressional
vote for anti-LGBTQ legislation. “And I was like, ‘Really? Do you know who you’re telling this
story to?’ And he’s like, ‘Ah, what?’ And he was fucking clueless.”
To Leader X, the “clueless” peer was part and parcel of work life. “I still do work with
him, we’re working on a big project together, but I will never like him again and I will seldom
trust him.” But Leader X focused on what happened next as the central “tell” of her story. Her
peer had spoken these words in front of Leader X’s provost and another dean, who remained
silent during this incident. Leader X recalls that after the peer departed, the provost and another

127
peer turned to Leader X and said, “Can you believe he said that?” Leader X replied to them,
“And neither of you could say anything while he was right there.” The provost and peer replied,
“Well, ah.” Leader X chose to deflect her anger and “made a joke. And I wasn’t surprised, none
of this is a surprise.” Leader X noted that this is a story she does not repeat at work because
“What would it gain?” But as an emblematic story from her leadership role, it describes how she
believes that support and affirmation cannot be assumed in the presence of stigma, which recalls
the concept that surrogates will avoid stigma by association (Goffman, 1963; Herek, 2007), and
also describes the omnipresent awareness of the threat of stigma (Crocker et al., 1998; Fiske,
1998; Goffman, 1963).
Despite that incident, Leader X said she was comfortable being out in her role, and talked
about how her open sexual identity helped her connect quickly with other LGBTQ people on
campus. “That’s a way of getting to know other people much more quickly. It turbocharges our
interactions in some ways, and that’s always special.” She also shared her belief that being out
has positive outcomes for the students in her institution:
Students want to see people like them in front of them.…And in both places, both at [my
former institution] and here, the heads of the gay and lesbian centers have sent students to
me, particularly because “oh they’re doing a research topic.”… I’m like, “Well I’m not
the person really that you want to work with, I’ll connect him with one of my librarians,”
but I always take time to visit with the student and to see the student before I connect
them to somebody so that they feel like they’re somebody, that there are people who care
about them, who have their back, who represent what they could be, which is just a
successful person in the workplace.

128
Leader W reported having a successful rise to senior leadership roles, though he qualified
that by reflecting, “I can’t help but wonder sometimes if it [being gay] has prohibited me from
some positions I’ve applied for.” He had ascended to his first senior leadership position a decade
ago in a small rural institution and had changed jobs twice before this study, each time moving
up in the same conservative rural region to a senior role in a larger institution with more
responsibilities. He felt being “himself” helped him connect with employees and students, and
said,
I don’t know that it’s my being out, but again being comfortable with who I am, I
think…it’s made them able to feel more comfortable with me. I think by my being open,
it really helps them to be open and know that we’re all working together to do what’s best
for the organization and for our students.
Like Leader X, Leader W shared a story about grappling with a situation colored by
stakeholders with varying attitudes toward LGBTQ people. Leader W had been serving as
president of a regional library association when their state legislature passed anti-LGBTQ
legislation. Despite pressure from other groups to move quickly, Leader W felt highly aware of
his status as an openly gay leader, and was also concerned about the impact of taking a stand on
this position on funding for libraries in his state. Leader W noted that a national LGBTQ
association might be quick to condemn such legislation, but for him and for the regional
stakeholders, who relied on government funding, the issue was more complex, “when you’re
living in it and it affects your daily life.” He recalled,
So I wanted to wait till we all met and get their consent before we actually responded.
And when we first met about it I said, “I want to bring this up,” but I said, “I want to take
off my president’s hat for a second and just ask you all to do this.” I said, “Because as a

129
gay man…I don’t want this to be seen that I’m pushing any kind of agenda. I want it to
come from the board as a whole.”…They voted unanimously that we send the letter and
condemn it, so that’s what we ended up doing. It was maybe a month after the passage of
it, but at least I felt good that we finally were able to respond to it and that it did come
from the whole board.
Leader W praised the strong stance taken on this anti-LGBTQ issue by a national
LGBTQ professional association, but added, “Just inside me, I worry that maybe they thought I
wasn’t doing enough as president of our [regional] association.” Speaking very slowly, he also
reflected on the connection between this story and what he described as his style of leadership.
[Pause] Again, as the leader [Pause], I didn’t want to push a certain agenda. And maybe
that’s not a leadership way to attend to it, but as a leader I try to have a very participatory
leadership. In my management of my libraries as this library director, I hope and I try not
to be very dictatorial about it. I try to bring a consensus together of my leadership team.
For Leader W, this consensus-building was not simply a style driven by preference for cozy
collaboration and buy-in. Recalling the situation he confronted in mid-career (described in
Chapter 6), where he felt his identity stood in the way of recognition of the caliber of his
leadership, Leader W noted that institutional consensus was a buffer for his decision-making:
I do think that as an out gay man in a leadership role, I probably do want to create
consensus more. Because I do think that there is a different path that someone who is
heterosexual can take because usually the administration relates to them more.
So underlying Leader W’s leadership style was a concern about how he felt he was able
to lead as a gay man, a leadership style influenced by monitory awareness as well as experience

130
that taught him that his “relatability” was not entirely within his control. As Leader X had
described, Leader W sensed that stigma was present even when it was not palpable.
When Leader R decided he was outgrowing his penultimate job, he applied for a senior
leadership role in an institution in a more conservative area in his state. The search committee
signaled that they welcomed him as a gay man and encouraged him to feel welcome in their
institution:
Of course I was not asked directly about [my sexual identity] because that would be
illegal during the interview process. I did disclose voluntarily during the social events
about my family situation and also about my concerns about moving to a more
conservative community. So members of the search committee took great pains to assure
me that the campus will be a welcoming place and that they would connect me with
progressive people within the town.
Leader R describes being clear about his identity in the workplace, leveraging his
husband as a handy signal:
My staff knows; they learned about [Partner R] first through baked goods because
[Partner R] would bake cookies for the staff and I would bring in and then I would say,
“[Partner R] baked cookies for you again.” We also hosted the library holiday party in
December at our home and everyone knew that it was our home and they were so excited
to meet [Partner R] to thank him for all the baked goods.
Leader R believes that being forthright with his staff helps him as a managerial leader:
When there are issues that they have going on in their own life, they don’t see me as just
some nameless person that sits in his office all day. They know me as a person, and

131
they’re more likely to come to me and talk about concerns that they have, maybe with
things outside the workplace that are impacting them.
For Leader R, being an openly gay male administrator also meant he could fulfill his
administration’s expectations for community engagement by campus leaders:
The chancellor made it clear when I interviewed that I would need to be part of the
community and I would be expected to live in town.…So to be out there and representing
myself but also in a way representing the school in community organizations, it is viewed
positively by my bosses because they like to see that involvement.
At the same time, Leader R described using his community work to extend and amplify
his felt identity. Like Leader T, Leader R is active in choral work, in this case a gay men’s
community chorus. In addition to benefiting from “the emotional support that comes from being
in a brotherhood of singers,” participating in this chorus serves as a form of community
engagement, but also a form of identity expression. The chorus is “a great place to help support
and affirm my identity as a whole person”:
In terms of my staff, it gives them a chance to see me as a whole person, even though
very few of them took the opportunity to see me in elf costume in a holiday concert. And
when those who did not see it found out that they could have seen me in an elf costume,
they were really disappointed that they skipped it.
So here Leader R describes leveraging the protective color of community service, where
he can be comfortable presenting himself to the world—including his workplace—in a more
transgressive manner than he would present in the workplace, at once literally singing his felt
identity while presenting it performatively. This expression makes Leader R “whole” (a term he
used twice), which suggests that on some level, at work he is, if not less than whole, selectively

132
presenting portions of his identity—typical behavior for all humans (Goffman, 1963), but, in the
context of a concealable difference such as sexual identity, doubly significant for its affirmation
of the theory that concealing behaviors lead to the “absent presence” (Ward & Winstanley,
2003).
Leader R’s administration also expected him to interact with donors, which made him
feel accepted but was also a source of apprehension, as advancement work was new to him. He
wanted to be forthright with donors about his identity in a way that felt natural and yet
professional, and in this case, he felt most comfortable meeting the donor in a social setting and
introducing his husband:
I’m glad to do this in a way where it actually worked out better that I could meet them
and introduce [Partner R] at the same time, without having to somehow make sure that
our photo was prominently displayed in the office or…my Hello Kitty mug that really a
straight man shouldn’t have in his office but I do because I like Hello Kitty just a little
[Laughter].
For Leader Z, the decision to seek a senior executive role meant exposing herself to
judgment and assessment by institutions where her butch identity might not be embraced. As the
previous chapter recounted, she had committed to living her butch identity in all life domains,
and years later, as she began thinking about applying for senior executive roles, she recommitted
to that position.
So then fast forward ten years and I’m thinking okay, I might interview again someday,
what would I wear now? I…thought about it for a while and decided, you know what,
I’m just going to do it [wear a man’s suit] because…I’m not going to play dress-up every

133
day on the job if I get the job, which is what it felt like to wear something different, so I
just decided I’m just going to go for it.
This was not a cavalier decision for Leader Z. “I was a little nervous. I wondered how
people would react.” She had two job interviews around the same time; “I think I wore the same
suit, probably different ties.” The two institutions reacted differently to her expressed identity,
and to Leader Z, the cues were subtle but clear. At the institution that would ultimately hire her,
interview team members and others pointedly shared their own identities and commented
favorably on her outfit. “There were other people who came out to me during the interview
process…and people who told me what a nice tie—like it’s all not an issue here.” At the other,
“stuffier” institution, the interview day wore on with no discussion about identity until the
interview dinner.
It’s not that I blurt out that I have a wife, I just mentioned my wife…so one of the guys
on the committee, his eyes light up and he says, “Oh, well now that you’ve said
something about it, we can mention it. This is a very good place for being gay. There is a
very good gay community here.” And like that was it. I mean, just so different.
Leader Z concluded that she was not the finalist at this institution for reasons other than
identity, and that she landed in an institution that was a good fit all around. But for Leader Z,
after years in a setting where her butch identity was openly discussed as part of who she was, the
interview process also reinforced for her that it was not enough for her for an institution to be
willing to “mention” identity; she was seeking an organization where she and they could, as
ALIDA-II describes it, “speak freely.”
Before arriving at her new institution, Leader Z learned that though she was welcome,
she was nonetheless, like most of the participants in this study, a bit of a rare bird:

134
After my interview for this job, I got an email from somebody, a fairly junior librarian
here, who just said, “Look, your interview was great, hope you get the job. I don’t know
where things are, but I just have to say whatever happens, it was so awesome to see
somebody who looked like me…” because [for] this particular interview there was a big
job talk at the front of a very large audience and stage. The whole library staff and all the
faculty were invited, and she said, “Just to see somebody like me up on that stage like
that was moving.”
After arriving at her new institution, Leader Z was again met with the paradox of feeling
very welcome as she was, but also realizing she was a trailblazer, not simply in her butch
identity, but as an openly LGBTQ leader:
They threw a big party here when I got here, a welcome reception kind of thing, and
again I make a little speech and I mentioned moving here with my dog and my wife, and
a grad student who happened to be in the audience came up to me afterwards and said
how great it was to have somebody openly gay at the mic.
Leader Z, summarizing her journey as an openly LGBTQ leader, said she felt “no
pressure” and that she was “incredibly lucky that the path I ended up on lent itself to this being
fairly easy and natural.” However, Leader Z also described herself as the only butch lesbian at
her administrative level, and was unsure if anyone else at that level was LGBTQ. So in her very
welcoming institution, she is still moving through her role in a place where she is “the only one,”
and her description of feeling “no pressure” needs to be understood as a presentation of her ideal
self.

135
Discussion
By late career, all of the participants had spent decades working in academic libraries,
and except for the historical vanguard of Leaders Q, T, and U, had spent the great majority of
their working lives as openly lesbian and gay professionals. The narratives of their working lives
bristle with new information about how intentionally disclosed sexual minorities ascend and
manage in leadership roles, data that arranges itself into six key themes: the influence of time
and place; the kinetic power of disclosure; the weight of hyper-vigilance, and a corresponding
constant concern about degree of expression; identity management disconnects; the utility of
expression; and—discussed in the following chapter—findings about anomalies and gaps in
prevailing leadership theory.
Time, Place, and Disclosure
The influence of time and place, and the kinetic power of disclosure, have a symbiosis
that recommends exploring these two concepts simultaneously, as is represented by Leader T’s
reflection that in retirement he was helping gay leaders come out of the closet because he had
learned “I didn’t need to [be closeted], and they didn’t need to either.” His statement suggests his
own personal growth, but also points to the significant reductions in LGBTQ stigma across the
last five decades. As they assumed senior executive roles and moved forward in history, the
leaders’ sexual identities became if anything more concretized and centralized as part of who
they were and how they presented themselves to others, a finding that aligns well with the
developmental theory of sexual identity, in which LGBTQ people move across time toward full
integration of their sexual and other aspects of their identity (Coleman, 1982; Ragins, 2004,
2008).

136
Leader Y’s emphatic rejection of the suggestion to “de-gay” her curriculum vitae
illustrates how, for all of the participants, living openly became a reinforcing mechanism with
greater force and magnetism than other choices and opportunities. This integration, as well as life
theory’s principle of time and place, is exemplified by Leader Z applying a standard for
evaluating a potential job, not simply by the extent to which she could be openly LGBTQ, but by
the extent to which her butch identity was fully acknowledged and the degree to which she felt
the institution was able to initiate open conversations about her identity. Leader Q and Leader U
became more affirming of their sexual identity after reaching senior leadership roles; their ability
to curb their self-censure reinforces Ragins (2008), who posited that stigmas can change over
time for either actor in the process. There is also the potential that the inherent affirmation of
becoming a leader emboldened Leader Q and Leader U to confront stereotype threats within
themselves, though Leader Q received significant assistance from his future husband’s
unwillingness to embrace courtesy stigma or move backwards on his own developmental
journey.
Type of Disclosure
How the participants expressed their identity evolved over time. As leaders and busy
administrators living with changing LGBTQ issues, attending ACT-UP meetings and adopting
Safe Zone signs and rainbow bumper stickers gave way to disclosure mechanisms such as casual
conversation or, as Leader R’s job interview described, humorous asides. Their partners or
spouses were major disclosure mechanisms, a pattern observed in earlier studies of LGBTQ
leaders in higher education (Christo, 2015; Schneider, 2016) and reinforced by the collective 48
mentions of disclosure via partner and spouse in Table 4 (see p. 60). As noted earlier, eight out

137
of ten participants were partnered during the data collection phase of this study.10 Their visible
partners or spouses provided utilitarian value, serving metonymically as expressions of sexual
identity, in which the visible spouse serves as convenient prediscursive shorthand—nothing or
very little needs to be said—while simultaneously normalizing the leaders to others through the
cultural power of a legally-recognized relationship (Hull, 2003). Leader X acknowledged the role
her partner played, including the standard office photo: “I had a horrible photo of us…I put it up
at work, not because I liked it, but because every other administrator had their spousal photo up,”
and noted that the photo was “one of those little ‘tells’ that you put up, that this [the relationship]
is normalizing.” The normalizing aspect of a legal or de facto spouse is further illustrated by
Leader R’s story of pushing for a lunch with a prospective donor and Partner R so he could avoid
introducing his identity through other means, such as meeting in his office where the donor
would see Leader R’s Hello Kitty coffee mug, a clear transgression of heteronormative male
behavior. Leader R bringing his husband’s cookies in to work for his employees is intriguing in
this context, as if his husband were serving as the feminine foil to help Leader R seem more
male, mitigating role incongruity and affirming his leadership qualities (Eagly, 2005; Eagly &
Karau, 2002; Ritter & Yoder, 2004; Yoder, 2001). Similarly, Leader Y reported on the
humanizing value of sharing her relationship with her new employees, which in her own style
she did through directly addressing them through speech. Leader Q’s post-nuptial march through
his institution, in which nobody noticed he was wearing a wedding ring, followed by him
speaking directly to his employees, describes his newfound comfort with his identity and the
possibility that his identity still mattered to him on a level that it might not to most members of a
younger generation, at least in his liberal enclave.

Leader V was subsequently widowed.

138
Hyper-vigilance
Despite their successes, most participants alluded to or directly referenced an ongoing
high awareness that their visible identities were, had been, or in the future could be, potentially
discrediting, or were at least unusual, such as Leader V noting that he corrected people who
assumed his spouse was a woman. Stigma and stereotype theories predict that the hypervigilance created by constant awareness of stigma—that is, felt stigma—and the constant
decision-making about disclosure lead to minority stress (Crocker et al., 1998; Herek, 2007). On
the positive side, hyper-vigilance is at essence a type of self-monitoring (Gangestad & Snyder,
2000), which is “the extent to which individuals regulate their self-presentation to achieve a
desired public appearance,” a trait that is associated with leader effectiveness (Ayman &
Korabik, 2010, p. 162). There were also positive stories about acceptance that rang true, such as
Leader V’s description of his institution rallying behind him during a life crisis, Leader Y’s staff
expressing happiness over her relationship, and Leader R’s staff affirming his identity by
praising his husband’s cookies.
The interview process is a trust-building exercise between interviewer and participant
(Charmaz, 2014). At the start of these interviews, as social desirability bias theory predicts
(Graeff, 2005), the participants emphasized events and motivations that appeared positive and
pragmatic, such as Leader Z claiming she felt “no pressure,” or Leader X initially describing her
sexual identity as a minor part of who she is. But as predicted by Clandinin (2013), as the
interview process wore on and as long-forgotten memories and their associated emotions
bubbled up, the participants drew back the curtains to share more complex versions of their
working lives. Thus Leader Z described—if not intentionally—how much it meant to her to work
in a welcoming environment, illustrated by a supervisor who affirmed her preferred gender

139
expression, while Leader X shared the story of being unsupported by a peer and her supervisor
when she faced bigotry from another dean to illustrate her awareness of the omnipresence of
stigma (Crocker et al., 1998). Leader R stressed the importance of trusting people, but he also
shared the story of the deposed gay leader, as well as the story of his institution trotting him out
as their emblem of diversity.
The participants’ hyper-vigilance lived in tension with their satisfaction with their career
progress. Leader S described her peers emulating her preferred dress as homage to her
leadership, an example of Muller’s “loving open” (Muller, 1987) literally performed by members
of an organization. However, Leader S also commented on her tendency to always “wonder”
how others were assessing her, and questioned if being so visibly different was good for their
institution, a concern and question posed nearly verbatim by Leader W. This is also illustrated
through Leader W’s story of building consensus before taking a major, controversial stand by his
association in order to buffer himself against unseen but anticipated prejudice. Leader W’s
comment that “usually the administration relates to them [heterosexual employees] more” evokes
the observation of Eagly (2005) that “There are two sides to leadership because it resides as
much in followers’ reactions as leaders’ actions” (p. 460), the implications of which in the
context of leadership theory are explored in the next chapter. Even Leader Q’s deep satisfaction
with the affirmation of his peers who proposed he serve as interim provost co-exists with his
understanding that this was happening within the intersection of the triple-discredited status of
being gay, black, and a librarian.
Thus these leaders were very aware that at all times eyes were on them, a persistent
consciousness that is true for all leaders (Northouse, 2013) but particularly true for people with
minority identities (Crocker et al., 1998; Goffman, 1963; Fiske, 1998; Herek, 2007). This is

140
further illustrated through the participants’ use of LGBTQ idioms in their interviews. Though
this study is based largely on thematic analysis of whole stories or story fragments, the following
section uses structural analysis to train a close-up lens on word choice and its significance to
these leaders’ narratives.
In Vivo Language and Policing the Perimeters
Stories are crafted word by word, and whether selected consciously or otherwise, each
word can function on many different levels. For example, variations on the word “comfort”
occurred 35 times across the 10 participant interviews, a notable frequency in light of the known
effects of felt stigma: discomfort felt because of judgment on one’s essential self (Herek, 2007).
Terms such as “human,” “humanizing,” and “whole” also pepper the transcripts, as well as
statements such as Leader R saying of his employees, “they know me as a person,” and Leader Z
referring to her butch presentation as “the real me.” These statements are implicit commentaries
on, and validations of, the “not-self” phenomenon of concealed identity (Woodruffe-Burton &
Bairstow, 2013) that also informs previous studies about LGBTQ leadership in higher education,
with their less precise but nonetheless valuable conclusions that disclosure in the organization
had personal value (Andreas, 2005; Bullard, 2013; Christo, 2015; Coon, 2001; Kenney, 2008;
Mathes, 2007).
Structurally, another even more visible theme to emerge across the participants’ stories
that persists across time, place, and life course development and into their leadership roles was
the ongoing concern, which the participants expressed explicitly and implicitly, about the overexpression of sexual identity, such as Leader V’s concern about the ineffective gay boss who had
“no barriers” to his identity expression. This preoccupation with over-expression echoes
Andreas’ finding that the lesbian administrators in her study worried about “not overwhelming or

141
making others uncomfortable with [their] sexual orientation” (Andreas, 2005, p. 61). Nowhere is
this phenomenon more evident than in the participants’ use of in vivo terms from the argot of
LGBTQ experience, detailed in Appendix I, to describe modes of identity expression they felt
were garish and too evident. Leader V used the term “flamboyant” four times, and Leader S used
it twice, as well as the words “flaming” and “screaming,” in the context of highly visible sexual
identity. These are common LGBTQ in vivo uses for these terms, as is the use of “overt” and
“obvious” by Leader X, “strident” by Leader R, and “swish” by Leader S. Also of note was
Leader U’s disclaimer, “it’s not as if I just blow it out,” and describing himself as not “super
butchy,” and Leader Y’s comment about the comportment on campus of a lesbian couple, “it was
not like trumpets blaring.” Leader W not wanting to “push an agenda” evoked, however
unintentionally, the longstanding cultural meme of the “homosexual agenda,” in which LGBTQ
people endeavor to undermine society (Sears & Osten, 2003). Leader T’s comment that “I just
did things that made it clear that I was gay, but I didn’t preach about it” suggests he felt it was
important to restrict himself to prediscursive signaling, even though in his wider community he
literally gave voice to his identity.
While all leaders present themselves intentionally (Northridge, 2013; Yukl, 2013), as a
group, the participants’ need to draw limits to their degrees of disclosure, setting themselves
apart from “flamboyant” LGBTQ people, accompanied by the ambivalence they felt about how
they were perceived, has a whiff of the internalized homophobia described by Igartua et al.
(2003) that stereotype and stigma theories predict as an outcome of experiencing prejudice from
others (Crocker et al., 1998; Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002). There was a zone of
appropriateness for sexual identity expression for each emerging leader that shaped their

142
leadership agendas and how they presented themselves in the working world, and to venture
beyond that zone was a risk they were not willing to accept.
Identity Management Disconnects
If it is possible to be “too gay,” it follows that people may believe that sexual identity
expression can be managed and controlled, a belief on which, not coincidentally, rests much of
the theoretical foundation of concealable differences (Button, 2004; Chrobot-Mason et al., 2001;
Crocker et al., 1998; Goffman, 1963; Major & O’Brien, 2005). The concept of controllability
also aligns well with the prevailing measurement tool for sexual identity disclosure (van Dam,
2015) and is congruent with the concept of the hierarchy of controllability and visibility among
stigmas (Crocker et al., 1998).
The previous chapters demonstrate how the leaders’ collective desire to control the
degree of their identity revealed stands in contrast to their actual life experiences. These leaders,
like the higher education presidents interviewed by Bullard (2013) and the community college
leaders interviewed by Andreas (2005), may have believed they were in control. Nonetheless, in
Leader Q’s terms, “the perception of how you’re perceived” was at times highly misleading for
these participants, and resulted in identity management disconnects. Seven out of ten reported
incidents where they had believed they had successfully managed to conceal their sexual identity
only to find out sooner or later that they had been identified, whether it was Leader U being
taken to a gay bar in library school, Leader R’s embarrassment when at a going-away party he
learned his co-workers knew his identity, Leader Z being greeted by another lesbian graduate
student, or Leader S finding out decades later that her complex concealing behaviors at her first
job had failed. But the actual degree to which they successfully managed their identities, versus
the degree to which, again quoting Leader Q, they were “kidding themselves,” takes a back seat

143
to the observation made in the previous section: They felt the need to modulate their identity and
that there was a level of sexual identity expression, unique to each leader, that would be out of
sync with how they presented as leaders.
Utility of Expression
Despite the stigma associated with their identity, their persistent concern about overexpression, and the documented disconnects between how they believed they were presenting
and how they were perceived, the participants nonetheless found personal, professional, cultural,
and utilitarian value in expressing their sexual identity. In their senior leadership roles, they
found ways to express their identity that worked for them. Several noted serving as role models
for LGBTQ students in their institutions, so that, as Leader X put it, they could “see people like
them,” a phrase echoed nearly verbatim by Leader Z. Leader U connected his ability to be more
visibly gay in the workplace with his ability to mentor a young gay male Latino librarian, a nice
turn-about from the road-paving role his young colleagues had played for him a decade earlier.
Leader S reflected that she was “was intelligible to the gay, lesbian, bi, trans and queer students
and I continue to be,” and that her visibility made her a vector between students and the
administration, not just for LGBTQ issues, but for many other causes as well. For Leader V, his
longstanding, very open identity, with his focus on “presenting myself as a whole person,”
facilitated the conditions under which he could be supported by his institution while in the depths
of his husband’s health crisis, and also led to him being very open about one of the most
frequently concealed human conditions. Leader R found a means to at once satisfy his
institution’s requirement for community involvement while using a setting outside the workplace
to present himself as more authentically himself, literally surrounded by other gay men on a

144
public stage and at times slyly transgressing his professional presence, such as wearing an elf
costume in a holiday performance or having a Hello Kitty mug on display in his office.
In sum, these leaders created spaces where their identity was simultaneously affirming,
problematic, and useful, and they managed to soldier on. Their collective stories describe their
überstehen as they moved ahead as highly visible lesbian and gay leaders, facing and at critical
times confronting discrimination from others while frequently wondering what others were
thinking of them, often serving in a role as “the only one,” but nonetheless persevering. All told,
their queer journeys to leadership raise questions about predominant leadership theory and
suggest alternative characteristics for leading people in a pluralistic world, as the next chapter
will explore.

145
Chapter 8: Transformational Leadership Theory and Sexual Identity Expression
Introduction
Transformational leadership is considered a mature theory (Northouse, 2013; Yukl,
2013). Given its predominance as the prevailing leadership theory as well as the prescriptive
nature of the characteristics of effective transformational leadership, it is worth stepping back to
ask if the narrative analysis presented in this study, with its focus trained on LGBTQ leader
experiences in higher education, points to anomalies, gaps, and contradictory evidence for this
theoretical model. The answer is unsurprisingly complex. There are areas of these life stories that
align well with expected characteristics of transformational leaders, particularly in the cluster of
leader characteristics in the idealized influence quadrant. Yet there are parts of the narratives in
this study that sharply diverge from the theory’s predictions—not isolated within any quadrant of
transformational leadership (see Table 1), but implicitly embedded across the theoretical
model—as well as outlier data that provide possible new insights into the nature of minority
leadership.
The main tenets of transformational leadership, outlined in Table 1, emphasize a leaderfollower dynamic in which leaders and followers are “raising one another to higher levels of
morality and motivation” (Burns, 1978, p. 20). As scholars analyzing transformational leadership
have pointed out, this theoretical model, with its focus on followers as well as leaders, is an
improvement on the “great man” theories, with their emic origins and their focus on the traits or
learned skills of leaders. Gender scholars Chin and Sanchez-Hucles, critiquing a special issue on
leadership in American Psychologist for failing to “include attention to issues of diversity and
intersecting identities as they pertain to leadership,” pointed out that “great man” theories of
successful leadership have been historically drawn from case histories of those already in

146
positions of leadership, leaders who have typically been white, cis/heteronormative men (Chin &
Sanchez-Hucles, 2010, p. 608).11 The epistemological limitations of “great-man” theories can
“privilege certain types of scientific knowledge and marginalize other viewpoints” (Ayman &
Korabik, 2010, p. 160) and contribute to self-fulfilling prophecies where the precursors of
success are determined by the characteristics of those in power and their accomplishments. As
Eagly and Johannesen-Schmidt (2001) frame it, “because men have long held these roles, they
have defined the styles to which people have become accustomed” (p. 782). Eagly and Chin
(2010), summarizing a body of research on transformational leadership and studies of women
and other non-majority cultural groups, comment that transformational leadership is an
improvement on earlier theories because it “appears to be infused with a good deal of cultural
femininity, especially in its inclusion of support and mentoring that leaders provide to followers”
(p. 221), and they cite studies and meta-analyses which have surfaced the characteristics of
success for women and other minority leaders as viewed through the lens of this theoretical
model. Yet Ayman and Korabik (2010) advise that there is no single minority-leader model of
transformational leadership: “[G]ender and culture matter because they can affect a leader’s
style, behavior, emergence, and effectiveness in many complex ways” (p. 166). The homophilic
view of this approach would emphasize the value of focusing on each particular group, as this
study has done; as Goffman put it, “persons who have a particular stigma tend to have similar
learning experiences regarding their plight” (1963, p. 32).

The letter by Chin and Sanchez-Hucles (2010) is a sterling example of the power of speaking
up within the framework of association work. The letter, written on behalf of the Executive
Committee of the American Psychological Association’s Division 35, The Society for the
Psychology of Women, is over 1,100 words long and includes eight scholarly references. It has
been cited widely (42 citations in Google Scholar as of December 2016), and appears to have
played a role in American Psychologist convening a special issue on diversity and leadership in
2010, with Chin as guest editor (Chin, 2010).

147
Idealized Influence: Alignment and Divergence
The participants’ stories had some congruence with the concept of idealized influence
(Table 1, see p. 33), but there was also divergence. The resolve of these participants to be as
authentic as possible within the contexts of their eras aligns well with the transformational
leadership characteristics of holding high standards of moral conduct and inspirational
motivation. In their earlier days, these behaviors sometimes appeared with the spontaneity and
high energy of youth. Leader Y raised her “little hand” to volunteer her identity; Leader S leapt
into AIDS and other activism in and away from the workplace (sometimes with unanticipated
consequences); and Leader X empowered her associate librarian to be more open in the
workplace. As Leader X reflected, “We always say people can lead from any point within their
career, and I realized that somehow my obnoxious little self had somehow given her permission
to be more free, to be more out.” The participants were operating at once with the carefree
qualities of youth tempered by the constant awareness of their minority differences.
As they rose up in the ranks and became more powerful in their organizations, the
leaders’ forms of expressions had greater ramifications, such as Leader T coming out in a
community concert during the AIDS era, Leader S organizing diversity conferences, and Leader
R confronting a student’s anti-gay remarks. As the participants evolved into late-career
professionals, they would use the power they gained to help others as they had been helped, such
as Leader U mentoring a young gay Latino librarian and taking an active role in letting a student
know he would protect him from racism; Leader W confronting a university president over the
ban on drag shows; and Leader T mentoring closeted library directors. The “idealized influence”
category is also well-served by the participants’ collective contributions to scholarly literature in
library science related to serving LGBTQ library users and building LGBTQ collections.

148
However, the participants’ stories also describe divergence from two of the tenets of
idealized influence: first, that transformational leaders “act as strong role models,” and second,
that they are “deeply respected” (see Table 1, p. 32). These tenets are predicated on the naïve
assumption, rejected implicitly by all contemporary models of stigma theory, that respect is
culturally neutral and that between two actors there are no discrediting stigmas in force. As
stated in the introduction to this study, prevailing leadership theory argues that leaders need
“relational transparency,” that is, leaders should be “open and honest in presenting one’s true self
to others” (Northouse, 2013, p. 264). But this transparency is a window that assumes no
stigmatizing, explicit or implicit, on the part of those gazing in, and no acknowledgment of
stigma, or awareness of its burden, on the part of those gazing out. The stories in this study
describe how the participants believed implicitly when they entered the workforce that the more
visibly they presented their queer selves, the more they would face discrediting, whether in the
form of overt homophobia (which in a critical early moment Leader T used to his own advantage
to avoid the military draft) or through subtler actions such as more senior librarians attempting to
steer them away from LGBTQ scholarship and activism; peers tattling to the boss about misuse
of library equipment for AIDS activism; or a supervisor objecting to a Safe Zone sign in an
office window. Queering the standard for individualized influence, it could be said most
participants were willing to risk being discredited in order to fulfill another tenet of
transformational leadership, to “hold very high standards of moral and ethical conduct.” This is a
characteristic of leadership that could be readily applicable across genders, identities, and
cultures.
Intellectual Stimulation

149
The participants’ stories have a complex relationship with the transformational leadership
concept of intellectual stimulation, which prescribes that transformational leaders “challenge
their own beliefs and values and those of the organization” (Table 3, see p. 44). Like all minority
groups, the participants lived out this challenge to their organizations simply by being openly
different, and in their case, by deliberately choosing to signal their difference. Yet also like other
visible minority groups, the participants lived with stigma awareness. There is something
missing in a leadership theory that does not account for the concept that a leader may struggle
not only with challenging personal “beliefs and values,” but also with affirming deeply-held and
understood beliefs and values about oneself that others reject or question, a situation that is only
heightened when they are the “only one” in an institution doing so. The participants’ ongoing
efforts to throttle their presentation—to be themselves, but bounded within a code of what they
gaged acceptable to others—as well as their career-long commitment to LGBTQ issues,
demonstrate that the tenet of “challenge” could be deepened to a more complex understanding of
what it means to embrace the choice to be different even when that difference is mutually
understood to be borne by the self as clearly as the bodily signs that the ancient Greeks cut or
burned into people to communicate their discredited status. The naming of the scars of the cross
on historical Jesus as stigmata, the Latin plural for stigma (Merriam-Webster, 2016), may speak
to a longstanding awareness in human culture that the choice to live with visible discrediting is a
phenomenon of irreducible complexity and eternal inquiry.
There are other phenomena observed in this study that point to the need to deepen the
concept of “challenge.” As briefly noted in the discussion of gay male library leaders married to
women, the participants in this study shared an empathetic perspective regarding leaders who
took different paths. The participants may have had limited tolerance for prejudice and

150
discrimination, but, perhaps encouraged by their own experiences, they had deep empathy for
those who for whatever reason stayed partially or fully in the closet, even if, in Leader T’s terms,
“they didn’t have to.” The leaders repeatedly described with fondness quietly gay mentors who
like Leader X’s associate librarian had come of age in a time when visibility was hazardous for
careers. Leader X reflected,
Even people we assume have power, don’t always take that power, and aren’t always
strong enough to be their true selves. So it’s something I think about a lot and try not to
judge people on no matter where they are in their career.
When asked what they would say to a closeted leader, the participants again expressed a
compassionate perspective, implicitly informed by the awareness of the price of living openly.
The leaders offered encouragement, as Leader Z’s typical response illustrates: “[I]f you’ve got
the privilege and the safety to be out, it can have a big impact and so come on, think about it.” At
the same time, Leader Z echoed others when she said, “I am a big fan of letting people find their
own comfort level.…But without pressure.” Leader Z recalled a senior colleague who was her
mentor: “I think there were actually times when she was almost—not jealous exactly, but sort of
wished she could be more as comfortable. But she…came up in the profession in a totally
different era than me.” As Leader W framed it, “I think that it’s better to be out, but that is a
personal decision that you have to make.” If at times it was exasperating or discouraging to be
out on a limb, consciously choosing to be a visible minority while others were quiet—situations
particularly observed in the narratives of Leader S and Leader Y—these quiet fellow travelers
were understood to be part of the participants’ journeys and their life stories. Rather than prod
them, in terms of transformational leadership, to “personal challenges”—a goal that assumes a

151
threshold of challenge of far lesser consequence than that historically experienced by LGBTQ
people and other minorities—there was compassionate consensus to let them be.
Theoretical Gaps in Transformational Leadership Theory
The participants’ stories surface an interesting gap in transformational leadership theory
regarding the roles of the many stakeholders in a leader’s rise to power. Transformational
leadership, like most contemporary leadership theory, posits a two-factor leader-follower model;
Table 1 (see p. 32) illustrates how the very language used for leader characteristics—exclusively
focused on “leaders” and “followers”—is embedded in this theory. But as the narratives
demonstrate, along their career journeys, out of necessity, these LGBTQ leaders engaged with,
and were engaged by, co-workers, leaders, followers, students, association members, and people
outside the institution, a phenomenon also noted in Andreas (2005), Christo (2015), and Mathes
(2007). For example, Leaders R, S, W, X, and Y reported advocating for, interacting with, and
seeking alliances with students, starting with LGBTQ students but fanning out to all students as
they moved up in leadership. Leader S reflected:
Being openly queer, openly out, openly gay, lesbian, from an early point on allowed me
to resonate with students I think, particularly to queer students, but resonate with those
students in ways that my peers could not.
While this is a self-reported outcome, the stories shared by the leaders about their
engagement with students throughout their careers suggest that, if nothing else, most of them
have created and maintain implicit monomyths of their own success grounded in narratives that
include their ability to engage with a complex matrix of stakeholders. Early in their careers, these
leaders developed patterns of social support for decision-making, such as Leader T having
mentors and peers who helped him find a gay-friendly neighborhood; the friends who helped

152
Leader Y find her sexual identity; the African-American librarians who helped Leader Q
navigate the complex “down low” world; the gay library students who took Leader U to a gay
bar; and the gay co-workers who helped Leader V become comfortable with his identity.
These early engagements may have helped augment what Leader S referred to as
“intelligibility as somebody on the outside of the mainstream”—that is, a cultural fluency with
other minorities and outsiders in their organizations, a skill also missing as an explicit
characteristic of transformational leaders as described in Table 1 (see p. 32). As they moved
across their careers and into leadership roles, the leaders’ stories describe how they put a
premium on being a sounding board for LGBTQ youth, mentoring young gay professionals,
supporting LGBTQ professional association activities, and going to bat—sometimes for years,
often alone, and not without personal cost—for LGBTQ issues. It is not hard to see a dotted line
connecting Leader W affixing a rainbow bumper sticker on his car to his advocacy for students
to the moment when he realized that he needed to ask his board members to be the voice of a
politically-charged resolution. A similar relationship is evident between Leader S and her
passionate early AIDS, lesbian, and feminist street activism and her willingness to go directly to
students when she needed support for an initiative she felt was student-centered. Leader R spent
years being trotted out as evidence of diversity support at an institution where one of his role
models had his gay wings visibly clipped, but with years of acumen developed in working with
students as well as with younger members of LGBTQ professional associations, he now has the
reward of being able to guide campus diversity policy. Leader X, despite holding a worldview in
which no one can be trusted, still made space to welcome and guide LGBTQ students that passed
her way.

153
There is no obvious fit for these types of leader relationships in the leader-follower model
of transformational leadership, in which even mentoring is viewed as a function of the superior
and subordinate paradigm. The stories in this study show complex matrices of interdependence
among senior, junior, lateral, and associated actors. This possible gap in the transformational
leadership framework is not presented as an LGBTQ-unique theoretical observation; rather, it is
a more general observation that has emerged by studying a minority population. Similarly, the
extensive road-paving above, below, and laterally across organizational relationships
documented in this study and in the author’s previous study (Schneider, 2016) could be unique to
LGBTQ leadership, but it is also likely that it is a phenomenon that is simply not accounted for
by predominant leadership theory.
The one- or two-factor model of leadership is also implicitly embedded in the metaphors
for obstacles to leadership for minorities discussed in the introduction to this study: the glass or
lavender ceiling one’s head abuts; the escalator that whisks people of privilege to the
administrative suite ahead of equally- or more-qualified peers; and the twisting, high-walled
labyrinth through which determined women fjord their paths to leadership (Eagly & Carli, 2007;
Hill, 2006; Maume, 1999). As useful as these metaphors are for describing obstacles in accessing
senior executive roles, they are still implicitly leader-focused and deficit-based concepts, and as
such, fail to account for the relationships that can help all leaders, but particularly minority
leaders, move forward professionally.
In the spirit of adapting Eastern-European terms, there are parallels between the
participants’ organizational stories and the sport of volksmarching, a noncompetitive activity in
which a self-identified group walks along a course of their choice (American Volkssport
Association, n.d.). While Bolman and Gallos (2010) and Pfeffer (1992, 2010) would surely

154
observe that the arena of higher education is far more competitive and political than this
communitarian metaphor implies, the conceptual model of a lavender volksmarch honors the
phenomena noted in this study of a self-selected group of stakeholders helping one another find
their paths and move forward across time and place even as they encounter the inevitable bumps
in the road. This general conceptual model has, if not a theoretical antecedent, a close relative in
the work of Dodge et al. (2005), who, in the second of a three-part series on using narrative
analysis for public administration research, describe the need for viewing leadership as “meaning
making in communities of practice,” which they source in an essay by Drath and Palus (1994)
about meaning making and leadership, and argue that research methods should match this
paradigm (p. 288). Given the centrifugal forces at work for minority leaders—stereotype threat,
stereotype automaticity, the emotional labor of hyper-vigilance, and of course the outcomes of
prejudice and discrimination—the support and encouragement of stakeholders may well be a
significant centripetal counterweight that nourishes their journeys and keeps them on their paths.
As more studies emerge on leadership in the lived contexts and intersections of gender, identity,
and culture, transformational leadership may evolve again to account for a much broader aspect
of players in the evolution of leaders and the practice of leadership.

155
Chapter 9: Conclusion
In Emma, Jane Austen’s eponymous heroine remarks to her father, “One half of the world
cannot understand the pleasures of the other” (Austen, 2015, p. 66). Emma was superficially
making an innocuous and general observation (in this case, about childrearing practices), but like
so much of the dialog in Austen’s oeuvre, Emma’s words are encoded with a knowing nod to the
complexities of human gender and sexuality and awareness that those who vary from prevailing
norms are never entirely understood by the majority.
The participants in this study began their careers as sexual identity outliers, spending
decades navigating career paths that eventually placed them in senior executive roles in
academic libraries. The narratives of their work histories, drawn from interview questions
grounded in stigma, stereotype, transformational leadership, and life course theory, tell how they
simultaneously maintained, and closely managed, their gay (but not too gay) identities,
presentations of self that were at once wellsprings of pride, anxiety, personal discrediting, and
strength. While the movement forward in history abated some of the stigma associated with
being LGBTQ, their narratives describe a world still complicit in what has been called the last
socially acceptable prejudice, and delineate their full awareness of their outsider status
(Carmichael, 1992; Carmichael & Shontz, 1996). If there is one general observation about all of
the participants, it is that the people around them may have at times forgotten (at least
consciously) their identities, but they nonetheless lived their lives continuously aware of their
difference. This status, rather than deterring these leaders, became at once embedded in and
visibly integral to their leadership, not unlike the scars used in antiquity to identify stigmas,
writing on the body that also bore witness to the gulf between those discrediting and the
discredited.

Austen’s novels famously focused on the quotidian and the near at hand, and she
portrayed her art as “this little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a
brush” (Austen, 1952, p. 469); yet her stories contain multitudes. Without any illusions that this
study compares to the work of Austen, the research reaped rich new data by closely training its
focus on working lives in a single professional field in the modern workplace, with a wide lens
spanning entire working lives and their inevitable detours, diasporas, and later-regretted
decisions. While the participants’ stories recall critical cultural milestones such as AIDS, the
death of Mathew Shepard, and the advent of employee rights, they are often the most ordinary of
stories, taking place in offices, meeting rooms, and well-trampled university walking paths, and
often recount the most minute of topics—a sign a supervisor objects to; a committee meeting; a
change of address—that describe periods of growth, challenge, and discovery. Sometimes, as in
any good story, true or otherwise, the critical moment is quite modest, such as signing a form in
a human resources office. This again underscores the value of scholarly investigations that
broaden their scope beyond the monomyths of success typical of popular leadership literature.
The research design of this study, using interview questions that probed entire work
histories, also provided a mechanism to closely examine not simply the fact of one-time
disclosure but the lived reality of long-term sexual identity expression, affording fresh insights
into minority leader behavior as well as stigma and identity expression. The power of personal
narratives brought forth not simply the fact of their alien status—phenomena satisfactorily
established in earlier studies—but also rich, complicated, and often vivid stories that situate the
participants in time, place, and history. Their stories describe the moment-by-moment dramas of
their working lives embedded within the massive, ever-changing stage set of the modern
workplace and its well-peopled tableaus, with additional walk-on performances by partners,

157
community members, and family, punctuated by turning points that would become, as Emma
described at a critical moment in her own self-discovery, “a development of self” (Austen, 2015,
p. 332). As noted in the previous chapter, the “volksmarch” view of leadership as a
developmental process engaged in by a wide and diverse matrix of actors—a view that became
unavoidable for this study—adds a salutary element to prevailing leadership theory, with its
overdependence on single and two-factor models, and points to the value of investigations that
begin their inquiry as far as possible from default populations and prevailing assumptions. The
participants in this study may have needed to rely on a wide range of assistance to help them
march toward the executive suite, but in the end, this situation benefited them as well.
This study earlier observed, “current definitions of leadership emphasize the ability to
influence others to create change and do things they would not otherwise do” (p. 9). The leaders
in this study may not have singlehandedly vanquished the crisis of the scholarly-industrial
complex, described earlier in this study, that looms over our profession, its spiraling demands so
far unstoppable. But time and again they changed their organizations, speaking truth to power,
empowering not just their subordinates but their peers and leaders to be more authentic, and
leading—and creating—climates of “courageous conversations.” They helped create more
diverse institutions, a sign but also a cause of organizational health, as well as the right thing to
do. They were present for, and co-created, the outcomes of significant historic moments, from
protesting federal inaction over AIDS to leading the vigils for Matthew Shepard that helped
others in their institutions out of the closet, intensifying their own presences by the new presence
of others.
Their influence on students in their institutions was also significant. Their stories describe
leaders in touch with the fundamental purpose of higher education—teaching and learning—and

158
willing to exercise a muscular compassion on behalf of vulnerable young people, stepping in
time and again to be not just visibly but proudly different, even if that difference was at times an
armor shielding their doubting selves. They changed higher education for these students and
students to come, and set examples of how to lead change, whether negotiating with a director
anxious about a Safe Zone sign or doggedly establishing and leading an endless stream of
university committees.
The participants also changed their profession through decades of service deep within the
gears of library associations. As the introduction to this study demonstrated, for all the labeling
of librarianship as liberal, associations are cautious, even conservative, in their approach to social
change. It took forty years for the American Library Association to acknowledge LGBTQ book
awards in its annual announcements, but it finally happened (see Appendix H, 2011). In a similar
vein, the introduction to this study notes that in the 1970s ALA obfuscated its way out of coming
to the aid of Michael McConnell when an academic library job offer was retracted due to his
LGBTQ activism (see p. 3); yet in 2016 the association honored him and his husband Jack Baker
as the inaugural recipients of the ALA GLBTRT Award for Political Activism, and also noted
McConnell’s four decades of distinguished service to the Hennepin County Public Library,
which, as the award suggests, reaped the benefits of his leadership rejected by the University of
Minnesota (American Library Association, 2016). The past cannot be edited, but change can
happen, reparations can be made, and lessons duly noted.
The stories in this study also surfaced rich details of the “what” and “how” of identity
expression. Four of the participants, those with the longest careers, began their academic library
careers partially or fully closeted, but by the time of these interviews, these leaders had
collectively amassed 250 years as openly lesbian and gay academic library leaders, with several

159
who were fully disclosed in the workplace as early as the beginning of the 1980s. Their modes of
expression changed and were more carefully modulated as they matured and moved forward in
history. Their prediscursive expression ranged from artifacts like bumper stickers and office
photos to bringing a same-gender spouse to an event, while their oral and written expression was
shared in curriculum vitae, job interviews, in the workplace, and in the world at large. The
presence of stigma was always palpable if often unseen, but with one brief, early exception, the
participants were continuously and increasingly open about their sexual identity in the workplace
as they moved forward across time and history and upward in their professions.
Major themes emerging from the data in this study were the influence of time and place
on expression and types of expression; the kinetic power of disclosure; the weight of hypervigilance, and the corresponding omnipresent concern about over-expression; identity
management disconnects; the utility of expression; and theoretical anomalies and gaps that
emerge when comparing the participants’ organizational narratives with the tenets of
transformational leadership. These findings confirm the broad brushstrokes of earlier studies in
LGBTQ leadership in higher education, but greatly deepen our understanding of the management
of stigmatized identity, as well as its costs and benefits.
The reinforcing power of disclosure suggests a research direction on whether failure to
disclose any concealable difference is its own self-reinforcing mechanism across the course of a
career. The complex working relationships with a broad variety of stakeholders that shaped their
professional agendas and moved them forward point to the need for more organizational research
into the intricate matrix of the influence of beliefs and motivations of all organizational
stakeholders as well as the mechanisms through which actors confront or adapt to stigma and
stereotype. The valuable insights into the academic sector of librarianship suggest more research

160
into all types of library leaders, as well as exploration of leadership and other types of sexual
minorities, and point out the value of research into minority populations to extend or challenge
grand theory. The compelling and unique nature of each of their stories recalls the observation by
Ayman and Korabik (2010) that “leadership styles are not generalizable over all individuals,
regardless of their gender or culture” (Ayman & Korabik, 2010, p. 166), and argues for the use
of research methods such as narrative inquiry that eschew aggregated analyses of disembodied
data in favor of examining life experiences grounded in place and historical context, a method
that also provides the sharers of stories their honor and their due. The lengthy careers of the
participants and their survival up and into leadership point to the value of continued research into
the success factors of leadership, minority or otherwise, and demonstrate the participants’ ability
to prevail, their adaptability, and, captured through the long view of time, their überstehen.

K.G. Schneider, March 2016
Introduce myself. Script: Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study. You are participating
in this study because you have self-identified as an LGBTQ academic library director who has
disclosed his or her identity in the workplace. This study examines sexual and gender identity
disclosure and enactment in the context of academic library leadership. I will ask you to describe at
least one event, experience, or situation in your life relating to experiences of your disclosure of
sexual identity as an openly LGBTQ academic library director.
Explain that this interview will be recorded and later transcribed. Turn on recorder. Announce date.
Ask permission for this interview to be recorded.
Ask demographic questions: name, institution, time at institution, position title, sexual identity
status, relationship status.
4. (Statement) In this interview we will explore the relationships between sexual identity expression
and leadership. Sexual identity expression can be broadly defined as how you signal your sexual
identity to others through telling people about your identity, the way you dress, campus groups you
belong to, artifacts in your office, and so on. I will be asking questions related to your expression
and how it relates to your leadership. I encourage you to reflect and share stories that are
emblematic of people, places, and events connected to your sexual identity expression in the
workplace.

During the proposal revision process (pre-IRB), the investigator will present interview
questions mapped against the objectives and research questions.
12

played a central role in your sexual identity expression in the workplace? Sub-prompt: A mentor, a
colleague, someone who reported to you, a friend, or a partner/spouse?
6. What happens when you express your sexual identity in the workplace?
Prompt: Thinking about the Muller sexual identity reaction matrix, how have other employees
responded to your identity expression? How has it changed them? How has it changed you?
7. What have been the positive outcomes of sharing your identity in the workplace?
Prompt: Has expressing your sexual identity contributed to your development as a leader? Can you
share a story? Has expressing your sexual identity contributed to a healthier workplace, fuller
development of personnel, or other positive outcomes for your institution?

7. Is there a connection between your sexual identity expression and your evolution as a leader?
8. Can you describe any negative outcomes of sharing your identity in the workplace?
Prompt: Have you ever been told to curb or modulate your expression? Have you encountered
discrimination? Has your sexual identity expression affected which positions you have applied for
during your career? Have you ever felt the need to curb or modulate your expression?
9. Is there anything else you would like to share with me about expressing sexual identity in the
workplace?
10. Concluding script: Now that the interview is complete, first, thank you so much for taking the

time to share your stories with me. The interview will be transcribed within six weeks and I will
send you a copy of the transcript for your review. You are encouraged to make changes to the

Appendix G: Muller Four-Factor Model
Reflection piece: Muller’s four-factor model of reactions to sexual identity disclosure
K.G. Schneider
3.26.15
Despite recent gains in acceptance and legal protections for LGB people, studies indicate that
reactions to sexual identity expression in the workplace vary widely. Fidas and Cooper (2014),
surveying 200 non-LBGTQ employees, many of whom claimed to be supportive of LGB coworkers, found that 70% “agreed that ‘it is unprofessional’ to talk about sexual orientation” in
the workplace (p. 3).
There is no known scale for identifying reactions to sexual identity disclosure in the workplace.
However, Muller (1987), working in the area of LGB psychology, created a taxonomy of four
reactions to sexual identity disclosure by family members: loving open, loving denial, resentful
denial, and hostile recognition. This taxonomy continues to be cited today.
Here is how Muller described family reactions to sexual identity disclosure by parents of LGB
adult children:
1. Loving open: Little or no denial of sexual identity. “Open and positive” (Muller, 1987, p.
56); feels comfortable with people outside the immediate family; may speak publicly to
advocate for LGB children.
2. Loving denial: Limited acceptance, usually of partner. Warm, but may ask that LGB
status not be discussed within family. LGB people tend to curb discussion of LGB status.
3. Resentful denial: Prefers not to acknowledge sexual identity. May express criticism of
LGB status. Actively hides LGB status of child from relatives and others.
4. Hostile recognition: Belligerent, angry, hostile. May result in estrangement, and in the
past sometimes involved legal action, such as suing for custody of children by the LGB
person (Muller, 1987, p. 53).
Before our interview, reflect on the people you have encountered in your career. How would you
describe their reactions? Are there key moments in your working life related to reactions,
positive or negative, to your sexual identity?
