This study examines the organizational structures and decision-making
processes used by school districts to recruit and hire school librarians. For students to
acquire the information and technology literacy education they need, school libraries
must be staffed with qualified individuals who can fulfill the librarian’s role as leader,
teacher, instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator.
Principals are typically given decision rights for hiring staff, including school
librarians. Research shows that principals have limited knowledge of the skills and
abilities of the school librarian or the specific needs and functions of the library
program. Research also indicates that those with specific knowledge of school library

programs, namely school district library supervisors, are only consulted on recruiting
and hiring about half the time. School districts entrust library supervisors with
responsibilities such as professional development of school librarians only after they
are hired.
This study uses a theoretical lens from research on IT governance, which
focuses on the use of knowledge-fit in applying decision rights in an organization.
This framework is appropriate because of its incorporation of a specialist with a
specific knowledge set in determining the placement of input and decision rights in
the decision-making processes. The method used in this research was a multiple-case
study design using five school districts as cases, varying by the involvement of the
supervisors and other individuals in the hiring process. The data collected from each
school district were interviews about the district’s recruiting and hiring practices with
principals, an individual in HR, library supervisors, and recently hired school
librarians. Data analysis was conducted through iterative coding from themes in the
research questions, with continuous adjustments as new themes developed.
Results from the study indicate that governance framework is applicable to
evaluating the decision-making processes used in recruiting and hiring school
librarians. However, a district’s use of governance did not consistently use
knowledge-fit in the determination of input and decision rights. In the hiring process,
governance was more likely to be based on placing decision rights at a certain level of
the district hierarchy rather than the location of specific knowledge, most often
resulting in site-based governance for decision rights at the school-building level. The
governance of the recruiting process was most affected by the shortage or surplus of

candidates available to the district to fill positions. Districts struggling with a shortage
of candidates typically placed governance for the decision-making process on
recruiting at the district level, giving the library supervisor more opportunity for input
and collaboration with human resources.
In districts that use site-based governance and that place all input and decision
rights at the building level, some principals use their autonomy to eliminate the
school library position in the allotment phase or hire librarians that, while certified
through testing, do not have the same level of expertise as those who achieve
certification through LIS programs. The principals in districts who use site-based
governance for decision rights but call on the library supervisor for advisement stated
how valuable they found the supervisor’s expertise in evaluating candidates for hire.
In no district was a principal or school required to involve the library supervisor in
the hiring of school librarians.
With a better understanding of the tasks involved, the effect of district
governance on decision-making, and the use of knowledge to assign input and
decision rights, it is possible to look at how all of these factors affect the outcome in
the quality of the hire. A next step is to look at the hiring process that school
librarians went through and connect those with the measurable outcomes of hiring:
school librarian success, retention, and attrition; the quality of school library program
services, outreach, and involvement in a school; and the perceptions of the success of
the school librarian and the library program as seen from students, teachers,
administrators, parents, and other community stakeholders.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Personnel responsibilities [of school district library
supervisors] include selection, supervision, and
evaluation of library staff, and collaboration with
principals in the selection and evaluation of building
level library personnel. Closely related activities are
the development of job descriptions, the recruitment of
school library personnel, and provision for their
professional development.
—Position Statement from the American Association of
School Librarians’ Supervisor’s Section (AASL, 2012,
p. 2)

School librarians and the programs they run are an integral part of schools and
are essential for the growth of students as 21st century learners. For students to
acquire the information and technology literacy education they need, school libraries
must be staffed with qualified individuals who not only meet the certification
requirements of the school district in which they work, but are knowledgeable about
the specific needs of their student population, have an understanding of the numerous
roles that the school librarian must play, and work seamlessly with the many groups
and individuals within their school’s community.

1

Schools and students are successful when districts hire quality school
librarians. To accomplish this, they need appropriate recruiting and hiring practices.
In the organizational structure of school districts, principals are typically given
decision rights for recruiting and hiring staff for their schools, including school
librarians. Research shows that principals have limited knowledge of the skills and
abilities of the school librarian or the specific needs and functions of the library
program (Hartzell, 2002; Lau, 2002; Marcoux, 2005; Shannon, 2009), with their
knowledge of school libraries coming mostly from previous experiences with
librarians as a principal or former teacher (Church, 2008; Hartzell, 2002). The work
of school librarians is different from that of classroom teachers; therefore specific
knowledge about school library programs is required to hire school librarians
effectively. Research indicates that those with specific knowledge about the needs
and requirements of school library programs and school librarians, namely school
district library supervisors, often are not consulted about these recruiting and hiring
decisions (Weeks et al., n.d.).
Research in information technology (IT) governance in business organizations
indicates enterprises that give decision rights to those who have the appropriate
knowledge produce superior outcomes to those organizations which have less
effective governance (Clark, 2005; Henry & Kirsch, 2003; Tiwana, 2009; Weill &
Ross, 2004). This higher organizational performance depends, in part, on a good fit
between the distribution of knowledge among the people and the arrangement of

2

decision rights. This is particularly important for recruiting and hiring decisions
because of the impact those decisions have on the organization.
In this chapter, I will detail the purpose of the study and the operational
definitions and assumptions for this work. I will then argue the need for the study. I
then present the research questions, followed by the theoretical lens used to frame the
study.
1.1 Statement of Purpose
This study on recruiting and hiring is a step toward a broader understanding of
how to organize and manage effective hiring of school librarians to fully realize the
potential for school library programs in supporting student achievement. This study
investigates the organizational structure and decision-making processes of school
districts that affect the recruiting and hiring of school librarians. The purpose is to
identify the structures and processes through which the individuals involved do or do
not share information and how those individuals collectively or individually make
decisions about recruiting and hiring. The individuals most involved in such decisions
are building-level principals, district-level human resource departments, and school
district library supervisors (hereafter, will be most commonly referred to as
“supervisors” or “library supervisors”) (Shannon, 2008). While library supervisors
are more likely to have the appropriate knowledge to make decisions regarding school
library programs and staff, principals typically hold the rights to make those decisions
for their school building (Harris, Rutledge, Ingle, & Thompson, 2010).

3

1.2 Operational Definitions


School district library supervisor: the individual in charge of library services
at the district level. This individual may also have other responsibilities at the
building level (e.g., they may also be a building-level librarian and work as a
supervisor as an extra duty) or at the district level (e.g., they may also be in
charge of social studies, technology, or textbooks).



Principal: the administrator at the building level tasked with running an
individual school.



Human resources department (HR): the office serving all levels of the school
district, including carrying out operational requirements of such tasks as
recruiting and hiring. This office is also mandated with carrying out the
policies and protocols of the governing board regarding the many aspects of
personnel and human capital (Tsui, 1987).



Building-level school librarian: an individual in charge of a building-level
school library program. Their roles include leader, teacher, instructional
partner, information specialist, and program administrator (AASL, 2007).



Certified librarian: an individual who has met the educational qualifications
of the state. Individuals typically gain their certification by either attending a
state accredited certification program (usually at the graduate level) or
obtaining a library endorsement through testing. States differ in their
requirements for certification, thus what constitutes a certified librarian may
differ from state to state.

4



Governance: the structure used by an organization for determining
organizational objectives and monitoring performance to ensure that
objectives are attained (Ad Hoc Task Force on Corporate Governance, 1999).
Within the context of this study, this refers to the structure of the school
district and how hierarchies, policies, protocols, and procedures affect
communication and collaboration among different parts of the organization.



Input: the right and/or responsibility given to an individual or group by an
organization or superior to share knowledge with and provide information to
the individuals making a decision in an organization. Sometimes referred to as
input rights or input responsibility.



Decision rights: the act of a superior or organization entrusting decisionmaking authority to an individual or group within that same organization,
allowing them to make the decision without the consequence of reversal
(Dessein, 2002).



Knowledge-fit: the assignment of decision rights by an organization based on
the fact that certain individuals have the knowledge valued to make that
particular decision within the organization (Jensen & Meckling, 1992).



Knowledge sharing: the act of making one’s knowledge available to others in
an organization. The act is purposeful and must be done voluntarily (unlike
reporting done out of obligation), and provided in a way that can be
understood and used by others (Ipe, 2003). Knowledge sharing should not be
confused with knowledge transfer (the movement of knowledge from one

5

location or individual to another in an organization) or shared knowledge
(knowledge that is not exchanged between two or groups, but a state in which
both groups possess the same knowledge).


Recruiting process: the process by which school districts attempt to increase
the number of applicants to their school district.



Hiring process: the process by which an individual is hired for a position at
the building level in a school district. This includes the application process,
selection of potential candidates, interviewing of potential candidates, and the
selection of the final individual for hire.

1.3 Assumptions
In this study, I operate under the assumption that a school district library
supervisor has sufficient knowledge of the district’s school library program and the
work of the school librarian to sufficiently manage and advise on the program. While
this assumption may not be universally true, research from the 2012 Lilead Survey
indicates that the majority of library supervisors were formerly school librarians with
multiple years of service in the school library prior to becoming the district supervisor
(Weeks et al., n.d.). Results from the Lilead Survey also indicate that some
individuals supervise libraries as a part of other responsibilities and may not have had
previous experience with school libraries. However, I assume that even in these
instances, the inexperienced library supervisor is still the most likely individual to

6

have knowledge at the district level about what is happening in school libraries and
the needs of the building- and district-level programs.
1.4 Need for the Study
School library programs are vital to students acquiring skills in reading,
information, and technology literacies; learning the ethical use of information;
receiving equitable access to books, technology, and information; gaining a social
context for learning; and becoming lifelong learners (AASL, 2007). School library
programs must be appropriately staffed with certified professionals prepared to be
leaders, teachers, instructional partners, information specialists, and program
administrators (AASL, 2009).
With such an important and unique role in the school, it is necessary that
individuals who conduct the recruiting and hiring of school librarians either be
knowledgeable about the librarian’s work and the contributions of the school library
program to student learning, or use the expertise of someone with the necessary
knowledge to assist in evaluating candidates throughout the recruiting and hiring
processes. In the hiring of librarians, it is not enough to be aware of what it takes to
be an excellent teacher or knowledgeable about the needs of the school; an
understanding of the many roles of the school librarian is also required.
It is standard in a school for the principal to make the final decision on hiring
individuals for that school, with earlier decisions in the recruiting and hiring
processes sometimes occurring at the district level (Wise et al., 1987). However,

7

principals and others in the school district often have outdated or inaccurate
information about the roles and responsibilities of the school librarian (Church, 2008;
Everhart, 2006; Hartzell, 2002; Naylor & Jenkins, 1988; Shannon, 2009). The district
library supervisor has knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of school librarians
and the goals and objectives of school library programs. They can help ensure that the
best and most qualified school librarians are recruited and hired. However, baseline
research indicates that as many as 40 percent of library supervisors have no
involvement in the hiring of school librarians (Weeks et al., n.d.). If the supervisor is
not involved in the decision-making processes of recruiting and hiring school
librarians, what assurance is there that principals or HR have the proper knowledge to
effectively complete those processes?
There is limited research about the recruiting and hiring processes for school
librarians. With such a pivotal role in the preparation of lifelong learners for an
unknown technological future, it is necessary to better understand the recruiting and
hiring processes of school librarians, particularly the roles of those with the most
knowledge about the benefits of the school library program. A greater understanding
about the governance of recruiting and hiring decision rights and the use of
knowledge-fit in making those decisions may help ensure that students have the
librarians they need in their schools.

8

1.5 Research Questions
Based on the need for understanding more about the recruiting and hiring
process of school librarians and how the knowledge of school district library
supervisors is incorporated into knowledge-fit for decision rights in a school district,
this study examines the following research questions:
1. How do school districts make decisions about recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
a. How does the organizational structure of the school district influence
the decision-making processes of recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
b. How do school district policies and procedures influence the decisionmaking processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians?
c. How do the actual processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians
adhere to or differ from school district policies or procedures?
2. How do the specific knowledge sets held by different district-level
departments influence the decision-making of principals regarding recruiting
and hiring school librarians at the building level?
a. How are school district library supervisors involved in making
building-level recruiting and hiring decisions?
b. How are human resource departments involved in making buildinglevel recruiting and hiring decisions?
c. In what ways, if any, do principals, supervisors, and human resource
departments coordinate on decisions on recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
1.6 Theoretical Lens: Governance and Knowledge-Fit in Decision Rights
Hiring school librarians is different from hiring a classroom teacher. School
librarians hold a specific knowledge set and work in a different environment than a
classroom teacher. Rather than managing a classroom, school librarians manage an
entire program for the school, while at the same time teaching information,

9

technology, and literacy skills in conjunction with other parts of the curriculum. To
better understand how the organizational structure and unique knowledge of
individuals can affect the decision-making process, I looked outside the educational
field for a theoretical lens through which to view the processes of recruiting and
hiring school librarians. Research in IT governance pointed to a theoretical
framework that included all of these factors about governance, knowledge-fit, and
decision rights.
Each group and individual in an organization has a specific knowledge set that
can contribute to the organization as a whole. Governance of an organization is most
effective when decisions are made by those with the appropriate knowledge to make
those decisions (Clark, 2005; Henry & Kirsch, 2003; Tiwana, 2009; Weill & Ross,
2004). When decision rights are assigned to those without the necessary knowledge,
or actions are taken without proper advisement—aspects of ineffective governance—
less effective decisions may be made. According to research, those with the
knowledge background to make the decision should be consulted or should have the
rights to make that decision. This makes for the best knowledge-fit for decision
rights. However, this is a largely theoretical solution. There are numerous instances in
which policies, personalities, organizational structures, and bureaucratic red tape can
keep decision rights from those with the knowledge, or those with the knowledge-fit,
from having an influence over decisions.
A great deal of research has been done on IT governance and the knowledgefit for decision rights. Such research provides an option for organizations to make

10

effective use of their IT products both for their work within the organization and for
tools used by and sold to clients. This theoretical perspective may be applied to the
decision-making process of recruiting and hiring school librarians. In many school
districts, the governance structure gives principals decision rights, though they may
not have the necessary knowledge to make those decisions. A principal has these
rights because of his/her specific knowledge of the school and the needs of the
students. However, because the needs of the library program are specific and different
from those of the regular classroom, the principal cannot necessarily be expected to
successfully recruit and hire school librarians alone. Including the knowledge of the
library supervisor may make for more effective decisions and a better governance
structure.
1.7 Summary of the Introduction
The purpose of this study is to investigate the organizational structures and
decision-making processes that best enable school districts to make decisions
regarding recruiting and hiring school librarians. To ensure that qualified individuals
are being placed and retained as librarians in schools, there must be an understanding
of how decisions are made regarding recruiting and hiring school librarians within a
school district. With limited research in the area of school librarianship being
applicable to study these questions, this study uses a theoretical lens from research on
IT governance using knowledge-fit in decision rights. The next chapter reviews the
literature from which the research questions for this study were developed.

11

Chapter 2: Background

Although there is limited research on the practice of recruiting and hiring
school librarians, this chapter will provide the background and an overview of the
literature upon which this study builds. First, I present research on the importance of
the role of the school librarian. Then, I present prior research on recruiting and hiring
of school librarians. Next, to better understand how they might be a part of the
decision-making process on the recruiting and hiring of school librarians, I discuss
the previous research on school district library supervisors, their roles and
responsibilities, impact, and specific knowledge set. Finally, I present the theoretical
lens through which the study is viewed: how governance and the use of knowledge-fit
affects decision rights and the decision-making process in an organization and how
this lens can be used to observe decision-making in school districts.
2.1 The Importance of the School Librarian
The study of school librarians’ work is essential because of the skills they
teach in reading, information, and technology literacies, which are so vital to students
in today’s global information economy. Numerous studies provide correlational
evidence that school library programs and school librarians are associated with higher

12

levels of student academic achievement. In particular, these studies show that having
a full-time, certified librarian in a school, specifically teaching information literacy, is
highly correlated with student achievement on standardized tests. The most notable of
these research studies are commonly referred to as the “state studies.” Lance,
Welborn, and Hamilton-Pennell (1990) first conducted one of these studies in
Colorado, investigating the correlation between different aspects of school library
programs and students’ achievement on standardized test scores in their state. Their
research pointed to a positive correlation between academic achievement and school
library programs with a full-time librarian, adequate budgets for resources, and an
appropriate number of books per student in the school library’s collection. The study
took into consideration the socioeconomic status of the students, the demographics of
the school, and the academic achievement levels of their parents. This study has been
repeated in other states with studies finding that school library programs staffed with
a full-time school librarian have students that achieve higher average standardized
test scores (Achterman, 2008; Baughman, 2000; Baxter & Smalley, 2004; Klinger,
Lee, Stephenson, Deluca, & Luu, 2009; Lance, Hamilton-Pennell, & Rodney, 2000;
Lance, Rodney, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2001; Lance, Rodney, & Russell, 2007; Lance,
Rodney, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2000b; Lance, Rodney, & Schwarz, 2010; Quantitative
Resources, 2003; Rodney, Lance, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2002, 2003; School Libraries
& Student Achievement in Ontario, 2006; Small, Shanahan, & Stasak, 2011; Smith,
2006; Todd, Gordon, & Lu, 2010; Todd & Kuhlthau, 2005; Todd, 2005).

13

The literature also shows that, along with having a certified librarian in the
school library, actively teaching information literacy in the school library program
has a positive correlation with academic achievement on standardized tests
(Achterman, 2008; Baughman, 2000; Farmer, 2006; Klinger et al., 2009; Lance,
Hamilton-Pennell, et al., 2000; Lance, Rodney, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2010; Lance,
Rodney, et al., 2000b; Lance et al., 2001; Lance, Rodney, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2002;
Lance et al., 2007, 1990; Lance, Rodney, & Schwarz, 2010; Rodney et al., 2002,
2003; School Libraries & Student Achievement in Ontario, 2006; Smith & EGS
Research & Consulting, 2001; Smith, 2006; Todd et al., 2010; Todd & Kuhlthau,
2005; Todd, 2005). Hiring individuals who are unprepared to effectively teach
information literacy would put students at a distinct disadvantage, making proper
hiring of school librarians an important undertaking.
Additionally, information literacy cannot be taught in a vacuum. School
librarians must collaborate with classroom teachers to ensure that students learn
information literacy skills in context throughout the curriculum. In schools where
teachers and school librarians are given time to collaborate, and such collaboration is
a priority, students perform better on standardized tests (Achterman, 2008; Brodie,
2006; Chambers, 2001; Farmer, 2006, 2009; Lance et al., 2001; Lance, Rodney, &
Hamilton-Pennell, 2010, 2000a; Lance, Rodney, et al., 2000b; Marcoux, 2007; Morin,
2008; Rodney et al., 2002, 2003; Smith & EGS Research & Consulting, 2001; Todd,
2008; Yukawa & Harada, 2009). More than just the opportunity for collaboration,
teachers and school librarians need support from their administration. The efforts of

14

school librarians and teachers to collaborate on projects are more effective when they
have the support of their principal (Church, 2008; Farmer, 2006, 2007; Morris &
Packard, 2007).
2.2 Recruiting Building-Level School Librarians
The research on both the recruiting and hiring of school librarians is extremely
limited. I was only able to find one study that focused on recruiting school librarians
into positions in schools. Shannon’s (2008) work looked specifically at the recruiting
of school librarians into school districts in South Carolina. In studying principals,
supervisors, and human resource directors, she found that little recruitment was
actually being done. Human resources and supervisors relied mostly on the placement
services of the public university, and did so at twice the rate of principals, who were
mostly unaware of the resource. Few individuals at any level placed advertisements
for positions of any kind. Most individuals, principals in particular, relied on
applications sent by prospective employees to populate their applicant pool. In
Shannon’s study, only two supervisors reported recruiting efforts that involved using
tuition reimbursement for current teachers to become school librarians. No other
school library employers reported any sort of long-term plan to deal with recruitment.
Other literature on recruiting school librarians focuses on recruiting
individuals to become future school librarians through universities that teach library
and information science (LIS) at the graduate level (Bishop & Janczak, 2007;
Everhart, 2002; Whelan, 2003), rather than recruiting individuals for specific library

15

positions. This type of recruiting may be the result of school districts being forced to
use provisional and emergency certification of teachers. When the applicant pool is
not large enough, schools sometimes recruit teachers to run the library, under the
agreement that they will obtain school library certification on a part-time schedule
while working (Everhart, 2000). Many cohorts at LIS schools are formed in this
manner, with school districts and universities working together to bring teachers into
the school library field. The advantage of creating such a cohort over other types of
recruiting is the experience that teachers already have in education before seeking
their certification in school librarianship. The disadvantage is placing an individual
with possibly no previous experience into the school library while they are earning
their certification. Regardless, with so little literature on how recruitment is being
done, there is little knowledge of how such recruiting decisions are being made and
who is organizing these cohorts.
2.3 Hiring Building-Level School Librarians
The literature around the hiring practices of school districts regarding school
librarians is limited, as is the literature on recruiting. Most recently in the Lilead
Survey (Weeks et al., n.d.), supervisors were asked, “What is your level of
responsibility in the hiring of building-level librarians?” Only 12 percent said they
were “responsible” for hiring building-level librarians. Forty-seven percent indicated
that they play an “advisory role.” The remaining 41 percent said that they were “not
responsible” for hiring in any way. These declared levels of responsibility and

16

involvement in hiring differ in comparison with the supervisors’ responses on other
topics, such as professional development. Ninety-three percent of respondents
indicated that they are responsible for the professional development of the school
librarians in their district, with seven percent indicating that they play an advisory
role. Not a single respondent indicated that they play no role at all. Based on such
statistics, it appears school districts entrust the development and expertise of their
school librarians to the supervisors once they are hired. However, only slightly more
than half of library supervisors are consulted in some manner when those same
individuals are hired into their schools. The disparity between supervisors’ work in
hiring and professional development is in great part why this research is being
conducted and will be discussed in more detail in the next section on the library
supervisor.
In his research on the perceptions of supervisors and their work as seen by
others, Held (1986) asked supervisors, their immediate superiors, library educators,
and state school library administrators, about their thoughts on the role that
supervisors play in hiring school librarians. The supervisors believed that they should
have more responsibility in this task. The supervisors’ immediate superiors felt
differently. Superiors thought the library supervisors should have less responsibility
in hiring and preferred that they be removed from the process. Held was unable to
identify the cause of the superior’s disfavor for library supervisors’ involvement in
recruiting and hiring, but speculated that it might be related to the organizational
structure of the school district and called for future research.

17

When Shannon (2009) asked principals about what they look for when hiring
school librarians, she found that their focus had shifted somewhat from the traditional
role of program administration to that of teaching and learning. Shannon noted that
this move from program administration to teaching is also reflected in the standards
for school library programs. However, there was still very little said about the school
librarian as both a leader and collaborator in working and planning lessons with
teachers. Shannon also found that principals looked for some skills not listed in
school library standards, like Information Power (AASL, 1998), such as interpersonal
and communication skills, among other affective factors. However, she found that
principals said little about the specific knowledge or professional skills librarians
should possess when interviewing for positions at their schools.
With so little known about recruiting and hiring school librarians, there are
significant questions to ask about the decision-making processes in districts. The
literature shows that the knowledge required often is not held by the principals who
have decisions rights about recruiting and hiring. What knowledge, then, is held by
district library supervisors, and how they can contribute to the decisions being made
about school librarians?
2.4 The School District Library Supervisor
Because principals generally hold the decision rights on the recruiting and
hiring of school librarians, and they often have outdated or insufficient knowledge
about school librarians and school library programs (Alexander, Smith, & Carey,

18

2003; Dorrell & Lawson, 1995; Kaplan, 2006; Kolencik, 2001; Lau, 2002; Marcoux,
2005), this study seeks to understand how the knowledge of the school district library
supervisor can best be brought into the decision-making process. This section will
provide information on the role of supervisors and how they can contribute
knowledge to the decision-making process.
Since the early 1900s, organizations have created and revised school library
standards to communicate contributions the school library can make to a school’s
learning program (Ersted, 1953; Henne, 1968; Marcoux, 2008; Michie & Holton,
2005; S. Nelson, 1987). In these standards, school library leaders have long held that
a school district library supervisor is integral to the district and building-level library
program’s success (AASL, 1960, 1994, 1998, 2012; ALA & AECT, 1975, 1988;
Coulter, 1990). This section first focuses on the national standards description of the
role of district library supervisors. Second, I discuss research completed on
supervisors at the national level. To better understand how complicated the role of the
supervisor within the school district is and how important that role could be, I discuss
the previous research on perceptions of the supervisor’s roles, responsibilities, and
impact on building-level programs.
2.4.1 The Role of Supervisor as Described in National Standards
Standards for School Library Programs, released in 1960, devoted an entire
chapter to the school library media supervisor at the district level. These standards
typify the kinds of statements that appear consistently in standards from that time

19

through the end of the 20th century. According to the 1960s document, a school
library supervisor for a city, county, or multi-district school system “works with
administrators, teaching staff, and other supervisors to provide better educational
experiences for children and young people” (AASL, 1960, p. 42). Documents
supporting the standards asserted the value of the supervisor as one who “interpret[s]
the role of the library to everyone...so that people are made aware of the importance
of the library in all places in the school program” (Saunders, 1968, p. 149).
The 1975 national guidelines published by the American Library Association
(ALA) and the Association for Educational Communications and Technology
(AECT), Media Programs: District and School, even more clearly defined the
importance of district-level support in creating and maintaining effective library
media programs. “The organizational structure places the director of the district
program in a key role in decision-making related to setting overall goals, analyzing
curriculum, selecting instructional modes, and establishing and maintaining
responsible evaluative processes” (ALA & AECT, 1975, p. 11). In the 1988 national
guidelines, Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs, the
district-level office was described as “offer[ing] special support to school library
media specialists in such areas as advocacy, technical services, cooperative
programming, opportunities for resource sharing and leadership on a wide range of
issues” (ALA & AECT, 1988, pp. 124-125).
The American Association of School Librarians (AASL) explicitly described
the role and value of the district supervisor in a position statement updated in 2012. In

20

this statement, AASL declared that the “responsibilities of a supervisor encompass
many areas but can be classified as those of leader, administrator, communicator, and
teacher” (AASL, 2012, p.1). Most important to this study, however, are the details
about what the supervisors does as an administrator.
The school library supervisor formulates, oversees, and administers a
progressive school library program based on a collaboratively developed
action plan directed by the district’s mission statement, goals, and objectives
supporting increased student achievement while interfacing with academic
and technology integration. …Personnel responsibilities include selection,
supervision, and evaluation of library staff, and collaboration with principals
in the selection and evaluation of building level library personnel. Closely
related activities are the development of job descriptions, the recruitment of
school library personnel, and provision for their professional development.
(AASL, 2012, p. 2)
This recent position statement argued that supervisors should play a prominent role in
both the recruiting and hiring of school librarians. However, it did so without citing
research; it simply advocated for the position.
The possible contributions of the library supervisor and the school library
program may become more relevant with the passing of the Every Student Succeeds
Act of 2015 (ESSA). Title 2, Part A of ESSA allows school districts to use federal
funding to support “the instructional services provided by effective school library
programs” (ESSA, 2015). There are additional authorizations for literacy programs
and student enrichment, both of which funding for the school library program is
authorized. However, nowhere in ESSA is the participation or funding of the school
library program required; it is allowed and authorized. It will be up to the individual

21

schools and districts, and the advocacy efforts of library supervisors and school
librarians, to have library programs included.
It is unclear what the reach of these standards and policy statements is beyond
the school library field. Such statements will have little-to-no impact if those in
school and district administrative positions do not know about them or do not
incorporate them into the work of the school district. How can others in education
know when to call on the library supervisor for his/her expertise if they are unaware
of what the library supervisor can do?
2.4.2 Prior Research Studies on Supervisors
Despite the significant roles and responsibilities outlined in the national
guidelines and policy documents, little is actually known about the influence and
impact of the presence or absence of district-level leadership on building-level
programs. As a result, the claims from AASL that they are important are not
compelling. In 2012, researchers at the University of Maryland conducted the Lilead
Survey, a three-year study involving both a survey and an online community, which
looked at supervisors at the national level. They found that the majority of supervisors
in large school districts held little responsibility when it came to hiring or evaluating
school librarians (Weeks et al., n.d.).
Until The Lilead Project team began its work, the last comprehensive study of
district-level supervisors was conducted by Bundy, Wasserman, and O'Connell in
1967-68, and published in 1970. This landmark study, funded by the U.S. Department

22

of Health, Education, and Welfare, explored the characteristics and perceived roles of
the school library supervisor as part of a larger study on library directors and
organizational change. The survey reported that the majority of 99 supervisors from
the largest districts throughout the country believed they lacked the leverage
necessary to influence activities and developments system-wide. Indeed, they
described their role as largely advisory, with a mission “to coerce, to encourage, and
to indirectly provoke activity in individual libraries,” revealing a less than optimistic
outlook on what they could accomplish (Bundy, Wasserman, & O’Connell, 1970, p.
73). Thus, while AASL asserted that supervisors are important, to date the theoretical
arguments and empirical evidence supporting these claims is significantly
underdeveloped.
2.4.3 Roles and Responsibilities of the School District Library Supervisor
Beyond these national studies, most of the research on district library
supervisors has focused on smaller populations and is largely concerned with either
what supervisors and others perceive their role in the district to be or how effective
supervisors are in making a positive impact on building-level programs.
Between 1970 and 1990, three studies assessed the role of the supervisor from
the supervisor’s own perspective. In Ahlers’s study (1974), supervisors agreed that
their most essential roles included program management and supervision;
professional leadership; curriculum and in-service instruction; media provision; and
programmatic research, design, and evaluation. However, a similar study in Texas by

23

McCulley (1989) revealed significant differences in perceived and actual involvement
among supervisors. The supervisors reported completing different activities from one
another on a day-to-day basis. Additionally, they did not agree on what they should
be doing as their tasks. After the 1988 Information Power guidelines were released,
Coulter found that “the greatest area of participation on the part of the responding
district library media supervisors [was] in the area of consultation followed closely
[by the area of] leadership,” while the least involvement was in the coordination area
(Coulter, 1990, p. 29). None of these studies specifically mentioned any role that the
supervisor might play in recruiting and hiring school librarians.
Studies have examined the views of different stakeholders and how they
regarded the roles and responsibilities of the district-level supervisor. Principals,
supervisors, teachers, and building-level school librarians often see both the perceived
and actual roles differently (S. Nelson, 1987). Other administrators at the district level
have perceived supervisors as being more involved in organizational management and
instruction than did the supervisors themselves (Held, 1986). Krentz (1986) found
that principals, school librarians, and supervisors in Wisconsin all perceived the role
of the supervisor in relatively the same way, only to later find out that this was due to
an extensive information campaign by the State’s department of education on behalf
of the supervisors.
Similar to the findings by Bundy, Wasserman, and O’Connell in 1970, other
studies have identified supervisors as having little confidence in their power to
influence programs at the building or district level. In a survey of supervisors only,

24

Andwood (1984) found that the supervisors held high ideals for their positions but
low expectations of what they could actually accomplish. Nelson (1987) reported that
supervisors rated their influence on program development higher than did their
respective superintendents. However, the supervisors in Nelson’s study also
concluded that they had little influence in the area of supervision.
These studies indicate that unless there is a concerted effort to provide
information on the role of the supervisor in the district (which there rarely is), there is
significant variation in supervisors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations about what
the library supervisor does. Making clear arguments and providing evidence of the
role of supervisors—in this case regarding their part in the process of recruiting and
hiring decisions—is worth accomplishing.
2.4.4 Effectiveness of the School District Library Supervisor
Despite concerns about school library supervisors’ influence, studies that have
examined their effectiveness frequently show that the position has a positive impact
on the school district. Eberhard’s findings indicate:
The presence of the District School Media Director does appear to affect
positively the library media program and services as reflected by the overall
involvement of [districts with supervisors the following] six services:
Educational Program Development, Administration and Supervisory,
Instruction, Acquisition, and Evaluation, Special Services, Preparation and
Production of materials (1974, p. 178).
Coleman (1982) found that the supervisor not only had a positive effect, but that a
supervisor with prior teaching experience, a master’s degree, or professional

25

organization membership had a positive effect on perceptions of service compared to
supervisors without these qualifications. More recently, in a study in North Carolina,
Cogdell (2004) found that there were significant differences in school library media
expenditures, collection size, software, computers, and resources between middle
schools with district supervisors and those without them.
Zsiray (1986) concluded that the supervisor’s support did not contribute to
higher levels of professional performance by building-level school librarians, nor did
it have an effect on the school librarians’ professional activities. However, Zsiray
recommended further study that specifically analyzed the role of the supervisor.
Dandridge (1988) learned that although the supervisors provided some services, such
as individual guidance in reading instruction, the relationship between supervisors’
administrative practices and the frequency of services was not statistically significant.
Based upon the research reviewed, it is clear that there is not an extensive
amount known about the roles and responsibilities of the supervisor. Although the
profession has promulgated the value and importance of the supervisor over many
years through many statements of standards and guidelines, there is little empirical
data about the scope of the responsibilities assumed by these individuals and the
effect they have at the building and district levels.
2.5 Governance and Knowledge-Fit in Decision Rights
With little published on the recruiting and hiring of schools librarians and no
broader theory or framework regarding the human resource management of school

26

librarians, it was necessary to find a theoretical framework outside of the literature on
school librarianship. Though I looked at the literature on recruiting and hiring
classroom teachers, I was unable to find a model about human resources in education
that factored in the need for a specialized area of expertise. For these reasons, I
sought a theoretical lens that looked at decision-making processes outside of school
librarianship and K-12 education. In attempting to identify how school districts make
decisions about recruiting and hiring school librarians, knowledge-fit and decision
rights in the governance of the school district seemed the most appropriate lens.
Through this lens, I examine how the knowledge sets of different groups and
individuals are used to make decisions about school librarians and how governance in
the district distributes those decision rights.
In information technology (IT) governance, researchers have conducted
numerous studies on knowledge-fit and decision rights. These studies examined how
decisions regarding IT projects in organizations should be made and who should be
making those decisions. Specifically, knowledge-fit refers to the assignment of
decision rights by an organization based on certain individuals having the knowledge
necessary to make a particular decision within the organization (Jensen & Meckling,
1992). Decision rights are defined as a superior or organization entrusting decisionmaking authority to an individual or group within that same organization, allowing
the individual or group to make a decision without the consequence of reversal
(Dessein, 2002).

27

There are both business and technical decisions to be made around
development projects in IT. Throughout this literature review of IT governance, the
two main groups discussed are business managers and IT specialists. Business
managers are tasked with providing a service to the customer or company that will be
of sufficient use and productivity for a given purpose. They hold the decision rights to
most of the business aspects of a shared project. IT specialists are tasked with actually
creating the product or tool that will be used by the customer or the company. As
such, IT specialists hold the decision rights to most of the technical aspects of a
shared project. Understanding where the knowledge is in an organization allows that
organization to create the correct governance structure to assign decision rights to the
appropriate group or individual. This same model for viewing knowledge-fit and
decision rights can be used in observing the recruiting and hiring of school librarians.
A comparison of the knowledge and decision rights of business managers and IT
specialists versus principals, HR departments, and school district library supervisors
is provided in Figure 2.1.
This section proceeds with a discussion of IT governance using knowledge-fit,
and describes how organizations benefit when decision rights are aligned with
knowledge. Throughout each section, parallels will be drawn between the lens of
governance, knowledge-fit, and decisions rights in IT and how it might similarly be
applied to the process of recruiting and hiring school librarians.

2.5.1 IT Governance
There is much research on knowledge-fit and decision rights centered on IT
governance and software development. This section specifically details some of the
research on IT governance and how this research can be used as a lens for looking at
the governance around decisions of recruiting and hiring in school districts. Weill and
Ross (2004) define IT governance as “specifying the decision rights and
accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in using IT” (p. 8). They
also provide an example as to how this would work in a corporation:
… governance determines who holds the decision rights for how much the
enterprise invests in IT. Management determines the actual amount of money
invested in a given year and the areas in which the money is invested. The
senior management team designs IT decision rights and accountabilities to
encourage the enterprise’s desirable behaviors. If desirable behavior involves
independent and entrepreneurial business units, IT investment decisions will
be primarily with the business unit heads. In contrast, if desirable behavior
involves an enterprisewide view of the customer with a single point of
customer contact, a more centralized IT investment governance model works
better. More centralized models for HR (and other key assets) would assist in
achieving a single point of customer contact. Problems occur when there is a
mismatch between desirable behavior and governance (pp. 8-9).
Decision rights and the models used (centralization versus decentralization) are based
on the desired needs of the institution and the preferred outcomes.
Weill and Ross (2004) state that effective IT governance is the most important
factor in determining how much an organization can gain from their investment in IT
projects. The central questions around IT governance are:
1. What decisions must be made to ensure effective management and use of IT?

30

2. Who should make these decisions?
3. How will these decisions be made and monitored? (p. 10)
In comparing IT governance to decision-making in the recruiting and hiring of school
librarians, I have made the following observations:
1. What decisions must be made to ensure effective recruiting and hiring of
school librarians? The decisions that must be made are who and where to
recruit individuals for open positions and who to hire for those positions.
2. Who should make these decisions? Typically in school districts, the principal
is the individual who makes the final decision about who gets hired in their
school, possibly working with a group of teachers in their school and
coordinating with their HR department.
3. How will these decisions be made and monitored? The first part of this
question is directly addressed in the research questions of this study. How are
recruiting and hiring decisions about school librarians made? The monitoring
of these decisions does not fall under the purview of this research study, but
should be studied in the future.
Weill and Ross (2004) further break down this third question, asserting that the
governance of an organization divides the decision-making process into two parts:
who has input on a decision (decision-making contributors) and who has decision
rights (those who actually make the decision). This aspect of decision-making is
integral to the research questions of this study. While it may be understood that

31

principals almost universally have the decision rights, who else has input into those
decisions and how much input do they have?
2.5.1.1 Governance Archetypes
Based on their research of over 250 organizations, Weill and Ross (2004)
identify a number of IT governance archetypes and describe how each type makes
decisions about IT. These archetypes may be helpful in understanding how school
districts make decisions about human resources management. Each type of
governance style affects how decisions are made within the organization. A process
or the creation of a product may require multiple decisions, and each of those
processes and decisions may be governed by a different archetype. If different
districts have different archetypes of governance in making decisions, having
terminology already in place to compare them will be helpful. In Figure 2.2, the
archetypes are detailed according to the placement of input and decision rights.
The type of governance system in each enterprise can vary, based on the type
of IT decision being made. For example, in the technical issue of making decisions on
IT architecture, 70 percent of the enterprises studied by Weill and Ross use an IT
monarchy governance structure where IT holds the decision rights. “The dominant
decision-making role of IT in architecture decisions suggests that business managers
feel unqualified, uninterested, or unneeded—they are confident that IT professionals
can translate IT principles into an architecture.” In this instance, the leaders in IT are

32

given input and decision rights for technical decisions, with the enterprise
determining that they have the most knowledge to make those decisions.

The type of governance system in each enterprise can vary, based on the type
of IT decision being made. For example, in the technical issue of making decisions on
IT architecture, 70 percent of the enterprises studied by Weill and Ross use an IT
monarchy governance structure where IT holds the decision rights. “The dominant
decision-making role of IT in architecture decisions suggests that business managers
feel unqualified, uninterested, or unneeded—they are confident that IT professionals
can translate IT principles into an architecture.” In this instance, the leaders in IT are
given input and decision rights for technical decisions, with the enterprise
determining that they have the most knowledge to make those decisions.

33

In another example, the federal and IT duopoly archetypes are modeled more
often in decisions on business application needs in IT:
Business needs for IT applications often has two conflicting objectives—
creativity and discipline. Creativity involves identifying business applications
that support strategic business objectives and facilitate business experiments.
Discipline is about architectural integrity—ensuring that applications leverage
and build out the enterprise architecture rather than undermine architectural
principles (Weill & Ross, 2004, p. 40).
Whereas the decisions regarding IT architecture are more technical and rest
with the IT executives, decisions about business applications still require a great deal
of input from IT, but also need the knowledge of executives and business unit leaders.
Both the federal and IT duopoly archetypes allow for the knowledge outside of the IT
department to be included.
As businesses use different archetypes for governance in different IT
decisions, the same may be true for school districts in making decisions about
recruiting and hiring school librarians. If the political archetypes can be applied to the
governance processes around decisions in school districts, the separation of decisions
may be necessary. While part of the same process, the decisions around recruiting and
hiring are different and may result in different governance structures surrounding
those decisions.
2.5.1.2 Other Factors in IT Governance
Along with the governance archetypes, there are other factors to consider,
including centralization and decentralization. Business organizations that are highly
centralized are also likely to have highly centralized IT governance. Similarly,

34

organizations with a decentralized structure tend to decentralize their IT governance
(Sambamurthy & Zmud, 1999). However, the centralization of authority “is only
optimal if top management has the information which is important to the main
decision, or is able to check and verify the information provided by lower levels the
hierarchy” (Dessein, 2002, p. 832). Similarly, school districts have different ways of
organizing; some districts provide great autonomy to building-level administrators,
while others make very centralized decisions (Liu & Johnson, 2006).
If school districts and human resources management prove comparable to
business organizations and their IT governance, the level of centralization, or districtlevel decision-making, within the district structure could prove to be important.
Figure 2.3 compares the concept of centralization in both corporate and school district
governance regarding IT and recruiting and hiring decisions. It is possible that
district-level decisions about recruiting and hiring school librarians may only be
effective when the individuals making the decisions have sufficient knowledge to do
so. However, the same is also true of a decentralized system, where administrators
must possess the appropriate knowledge to handle site-based decision-making in
human resources management on their own.
In some instances, governance is dictated through the use of power by the
decision-maker. It is specified in the governance of most school districts—the
principal is the one that has decision rights regarding the individuals who will work in
his or her school (Harris et al., 2010). In comparison with IT governance, this would

make principals the business manager. Hann and Weber (1996), found that when the
business manager (or “superior”) was more uncertain of the task at hand, they were
actually less likely to delegate decision rights to others, which ran counter to Hann
and Weber’s predictions. Business managers were also more likely to exert control
when the project was in line with the manager’s goals and objectives. The instances

36

in which IT managers were given more control were when they had a longer tenure at
the organization and when the project manager exerted less control over the planning
process specifically (Hann & Weber, 1996). In school districts, this could indicate
that principals exert more control over the hiring and recruiting process when they are
uncertain of the task. However, if there is a supervisor or HR liaison for school
librarians in long standing with the district, they may be the de facto person to whom
principals defer for recruiting and hiring decisions. In either case, it is uncertain when
principals in school districts will seek assistance from supervisors or delegate the
responsibilities of recruiting and hiring to others in the school district.
Another concern of IT governance is that not all decision rights are extended
to a single individual or group. Some IT decisions must be made cooperatively, using
the knowledge of both the business manager and the IT specialist. The same may be
true in recruiting and hiring school librarians. The decision to hire a particular
individual will likely require the knowledge of more than one group or individual to
factor into a decision. In Henderson and Lee’s research (1992), they posit that both
business managerial control and IT specialist control can coexist in IT governance.
Managerial control appears more effective when [results are] behavior
oriented while team-member control is more effective when [results are]
outcome oriented. This suggests that effective teams have a manager with the
skills and capabilities to influence how work is accomplished while the
pressure to meet deadlines and commitments arises from one’s peers
(1992, p. 773).
This could be reflected in the governance structure of school districts as building and
district-level personnel work together to make decisions. While the principal may be

considered the managerial control, those in HR and the supervisor are the ones,
potentially, with outcome-oriented goals, making them the most effective individuals
to have control in this aspect of governance.
There are many factors in the governance of an organization. Some are
determined by constructs such as the structural archetype with which an organization
aligns or how centralization affects decision-making processes. What changes in an
organization, though, when the specific knowledge sets of its different groups and
individuals are taken into consideration? What improvements can be made when
those who have a certain understanding of a particular decision are given the right to
make that choice on behalf of the organization?
2.5.2 Knowledge-Fit and Decision Rights
Rarely is an individual in an organization capable of having the knowledge to
make all decisions. It is therefore necessary that decisions and input on decisions be
divided amongst those individuals and groups with the necessary knowledge to make
the best choices. Jensen and Meckling (1992) provide further explanation:
The limited capacity of the human mind and the costs of producing and
transferring knowledge mean that knowledge relevant to all decisions can
never be located in a single individual or body of experts. Thus, if knowledge
valuable to a particular decision is to be used in making that decision, there
must be a system for assigning decision rights to individuals who have the
knowledge and abilities or who can acquire or produce them at low cost (p.
271).
In IT governance, different groups must often work together, each with specialized
knowledge sets. Ideally, decision rights originate at the very top of an organization

38

and may then be distributed in the way that results in the best possible outcomes for
the enterprise:
The bundle of decision rights owned in the name of such an organization is
vested nominally in its board of directors and CEO, and the rights are then
partitioned out among decision agents in the organization. Those
organizations that accomplish this partitioning in a fashion that maximizes
their value will tend to win out in the competition for survival (Jensen &
Meckling, 1992, p. 272).
There are project managers and business groups with the business and user
application knowledge about a given project. Then there are the technical managers
and IT teams with the technical knowledge. Hence, there must be a governance
structure in existence to get decisions rights to those with the appropriate knowledge.
Within software development, there are two types of knowledge that are
relevant to the process. There is the technical knowledge, which encompasses all of
the specifics of design, programming, and product development. Then there is the
business knowledge, which entails all the rules, processes, policies, and
understanding of the needed use of the system (Tiwana, 2009). Both of these types of
knowledge are necessary and complementary to the process of finding the best
software development project solution. Without one or the other, the project is likely
to have inadequate results (Faraj & Sproull, 2000).
This construct of knowledge-fit within software development projects is
comparable with the process of recruiting and hiring school librarians in a school
district. The principal has the knowledge of the school: how it is run, what the overall
needs of the students are, and other specific, building-level needs; this is comparable

39

to that of the business manager in IT governance. The HR department has all the
knowledge of hiring practices within the district and how to adhere to the specific
policies of the district; this is analogous to the IT specialist and their technical
knowledge. In the case of recruiting and hiring school librarians, however, the
knowledge of the needs of, and expectations for, the library program rest with the
school district library supervisor. The library supervisor could possibly represent a
third entity in the governance structure, or rather another specific knowledge set that
make be linked to the specific knowledge that resides in the HR department.
2.5.3 Knowledge Sharing
One factor in knowledge-fit and decision rights is the sharing of knowledge
between groups working together (Henderson & Lee, 1992; K. M. Nelson &
Cooprider, 1996; Pee, Kankanhalli, & Kim, 2010; Tiwana, 2009). This factor is of
importance to this study because the final decision rights for hiring personnel are
unlikely to be moved from the building level. If the decision rights for hiring school
librarians are to remain where there is not the best knowledge-fit, then some form of
dialogue and knowledge sharing must occur between principals at the building level
and the library supervisor and HR department at the district level.
In IT governance, knowledge sharing between individuals or groups allows
the party with decision rights to gain some knowledge of the others’ work to make
better decisions. “Assigning project decision rights to one department over the other
enhances neither systems development efficiency nor effectiveness unless the

40

associated department also has the pertinent complementary knowledge in the other
department’s domain” (Tiwana, 2009, p. 194). When business managers and IT
specialists work together, the best decisions are made when each group has some
knowledge of the other’s process and work. Business managers should have some
understanding of the technical aspects of a project, and IT specialists should have an
understanding of the business results of a project. The same situation exists with
recruiting and hiring school librarians, since principals, HR departments, and district
library supervisors all need to have some idea of the concerns, needs, and policies and
procedures of other areas to make correct decisions in recruiting and hiring.
There are many factors that play into the usefulness of knowledge sharing in
an organization. Pee, Kankanhalli, & Kim (2010) effectively outline those factors in
their work on knowledge sharing in information systems development. Some of the
factors most relevant to the governance in school districts for the recruiting and hiring
of school librarians include:


The expertise, capability, and professional experience of the person sharing
knowledge (the sender) (Faraj & Sproull, 2000)



The absorbative capacity of the person with whom knowledge is shared (the
receiver) (Ko, Kirsch, & King, 2005; Tiwana & Mclean, 2005)



The intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of both parties to send and receive
knowledge (Ko et al., 2005)



The relationship (Ko et al., 2005), influence, and trust between the sender and
receiver (K. M. Nelson & Cooprider, 1996)

41

It is uncertain how or if any of these factors may play a role in the governance of
recruiting and hiring school librarians; however, there are many instances in which
knowledge sharing could occur in school districts, such as a library supervisor
instructing a principal on how to judge a candidate’s responses to interview questions.
2.6 Summary of the Literature Review
The recruiting and hiring processes used by districts for school librarians are
largely unexplained. Current literature does not reveal the mechanics of who is
involved beyond the general understanding that principals, though they may be
lacking in the specific knowledge of library programs, are largely given final decision
rights on all building personnel. And while school district library supervisors have the
specific knowledge of library programs, many are not involved in the hiring process
at all.
Decision-making processes in other areas, such as IT governance, have
undergone more intensive research. These processes provide ways of looking at how
outcomes can be affected by setting up governance that enables those with a
particular knowledge-fit to hold decision rights. This research from IT governance
can be used to study the decision-making processes in the recruiting and hiring of
school librarians and to help identify the district organizational structure used to
determine the location of decision rights and how different individuals and groups in
the district work with one another throughout these processes.

42

Chapter 3: Methods

In this chapter, I present the use of an exploratory, multiple-case study design
as the method for this study. Next, I discuss the population of districts used and the
grouping and selection of districts for study. Finally, I present the types of data
collected and analysis completed.
3.1 Research Questions
Based on the need for more information about the recruiting and hiring
processes of school librarians, and how the knowledge of school district library
supervisors is incorporated into the governance and knowledge-fit of a school district
for decision rights, this study examines the following research questions:
1. How do school districts make decisions about recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
a. How does the organizational structure of the school district influence
the decision-making processes of recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
b. How do school district policies and procedures influence the decisionmaking processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians?
c. How do the actual processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians
adhere to or differ from school district policies or procedures?
2. How do the specific knowledge sets held by different district-level
departments influence the decision-making of principals regarding recruiting
and hiring school librarians at the building level?

43

a. How are school district library supervisors involved in making
building-level recruiting and hiring decisions?
b. How are human resource departments involved in making buildinglevel recruiting and hiring decisions?
c. In what ways, if any, do principals, supervisors, and human resource
departments coordinate on decisions on recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
3.2 Research Design
For this study, I chose a multiple case study design. The use of case studies is
ideal for this research. The research questions examine “how” a process occurs, it
observes contemporary events that the researcher cannot change, and there is need to
study the contextual conditions of the phenomena to understand their relevance (Yin,
2009). These case studies allow for an in-depth analysis of the decision-making
processes in each school district.
The use of multiple cases allows me to draw comparisons, as findings
replicate or contrast across cases (Yin, 2009). To draw comparisons between districts,
selection of participating districts was purposeful, with districts differing in the
number of tasks performed by the library supervisor in the hiring process, the number
of groups or individuals involved in the hiring process, and the geographic location.
This process included selecting candidates from previous research conducted by the
Lilead Project research team and a screening survey that I conducted specifically for
this study. I will discuss the selection of school districts in detail later in this chapter.
The purposeful selection of each case allows for the exploration and comparison of
variables, which may contribute to differences in governance, the use of knowledge,

44

and the placement of decision rights in each district regarding the recruiting and
hiring process.
This type of case study design is often used to study IT governance. These
studies have produced frameworks for institutions to help them make better decisions
about their IT needs and uses. Specifically, Weill and Ross (2004) used numerous
case studies to develop a framework for making decisions about institutional IT
needs. The case studies for this research are based on similar designs, but these are
the first to consider the involvement of different individuals and groups in decisionmaking in school districts regarding recruiting and hiring of school librarians.
The unit of analysis for each case study is the entire school district and all its
encompassing parts. I consider the individual participants of each district as parts of
the whole. While I compare individuals, such as an HR representative, against their
counterparts in other districts, they are considered sub-units of the school district and
not their own units of analysis.
3.3 Study Population of School Districts
The districts invited to participate in this study were part of the 2012 Lilead
Survey. The Lilead Project (Weeks et al., n.d.) surveyed library supervisors from
school districts across the country. The population of respondents included all school
districts in the U.S. with more than 25,000 students. In the event that a state did not
have at least one school district with more than 25,000 students, the supervisor in the

45

largest school district in that state was selected to participate. This brought the
number of supervisors surveyed to 290.
The survey had 166 complete responses. The school districts of these 166
respondents formed the initial population for this study. From this initial list of 166
school districts, I excluded districts for the following reasons:


The supervisor indicated that they only served as the supervisor on a parttime basis.



The supervisor indicated that they also worked at the building level.



The student population was less than 25,000.

Of the 166 completed responses from the 2012 Lilead Survey, this left 147 school
districts remaining in the population for this study.
3.4 Obtaining Research Approval
For this study, I was required to go through the Internal Review Board (IRB)
process for the University of Maryland (UMD) and each of the individual school
districts. At UMD, I obtained IRB approval before contacting the districts in any way.
This included receiving approval for the follow-up survey. With that process
complete, I was able to use approval from UMD to obtain approval from each school
district.
After completing the screening process with the library supervisor, I contacted
the person in charge of conducting research in the district. Each district had certain
forms and explanations that I was required to provide. In some districts, the approval

46

process went through a single individual. In other districts, the process required the
convening of a committee or council to review the entire research proposal. More
than one district required further explanations before the research was approved.
However, no school district required any changes to the study before I could proceed.
3.5 Grouping Districts for Selection
To compare case studies and their processes in decision-making, I determined
it was necessary to group school districts and then select one district to study from
each group. I did not choose school districts at random, because responses from the
Lilead Survey indicated differences among districts regarding the involvement of
library supervisors in the hiring process. A random selection of districts posed the risk
of none of these differences being present. While repetitive case studies based on
random selection could still reveal a pattern on how governance affects the recruiting
and hiring school librarians, the purpose of this study is to see how specific
differences among school districts concerning governance and knowledge-fit have an
effect on the involvement of library supervisors in recruiting and hiring school
librarians. However, responses to the Lilead Survey did not provide the information
necessary to group districts for selection in this study. In the Lilead Survey, two
close-ended questions asked the supervisors about their participation in the hiring
process. They appear in Figure 3.1. The survey did not ask supervisors about the
extent of their involvement or the involvement of others in the process. Additionally,

47

there were no questions on the Lilead Survey that asked about the supervisor’s
involvement in recruiting.

Figure 3.1. Hiring Questions from the 2012 Lilead Survey
15. How important are the following personnel tasks in your position as
district library supervisor?
Prompt: Hiring staff at the building level
Responses: Extremely important; Important; Somewhat important;
Not important; Not applicable to my position
22. What is your primary role in the following tasks or decisions?
Prompt: Hiring staff at the building level
Responses: Responsible for tasks or decisions; Advisor on tasks
or decisions; Not my responsibility.

In considering the research questions, I sought to group school districts based
on two sets of criteria. For the first research question on how school districts make
decision on recruiting and hiring school librarians, it was important to understand
how many individuals were involved in those processes in each district. To address
the second research question about the involvement of particular individuals, I wanted
to specify the level of involvement of the supervisor. The 2012 Lilead Survey did not
collect this information. For this reason, a follow-up survey was necessary.
3.5.1 Follow-up Survey
The follow-up survey provided data to better group school districts for
selection for this study. Of the 147 qualifying school districts and their responding

48

library supervisors from the 2012 Lilead Survey, there was no need to send the
follow-up survey to 48 Lilead Survey participants because these respondents
indicated they were “not responsible” for any part of the hiring process and that they
spent no time on hiring because it was “not applicable” to their position. The
remaining supervisors in 99 districts were asked to complete an additional survey to
clarify the number of people involved in the recruiting and hiring processes and the
number of tasks they completed in these processes. There were 57 complete
responses for a response rate of 58 percent.
One question in the follow-up survey asked supervisors to name all other
individuals or groups involved in the hiring process of librarians (see Figure 3.2).
From this question, I tallied the number of people involved in the hiring process in
each school district. Every participating supervisor indicated that the school principal
was involved. Supervisors’ responses indicated that as many as four other groups or
individuals were involved in recruiting and hiring processes. Figure 3.3 shows the
number of individuals or groups involved in each school district, as indicated by the
library supervisor.

Regarding the second research question, which focuses on the number of tasks
and the level of involvement of the supervisor in hiring, the survey contained two
questions asking about specific tasks supervisors complete during the hiring process.
Both questions and responses appear in Figure 3.4. From that list of activities, each
supervisor was given a cumulative score of all the activities they participated in. The
results of those scores can be seen in Figure 3.5.
3.5.2 Grouping Follow-Up Survey Responses to Select Case Studies
Cross tabulating the questions on the number of individuals or groups
involved in hiring and the number of tasks completed by supervisors gave the results
in Figure 3.6. When the individual cross-tabs are clustered into groups, a pattern
becomes more obvious (Figure 3.7). The number of tasks performed by the
supervisors was positively correlated with the number of individuals involved in
recruiting and hiring, c2(1, N = 57) = 9.906, p = .001647. This correlation points to a
pattern of centralized and decentralized decision-making regarding building-level
hires. When the decision rests mostly with the principal in building-level decisionmaking, the supervisor is less likely to have a high number of hiring responsibilities.
When the decision is spread out and more individuals and groups are involved in the
process, then supervisors are more likely to have a high number of responsibilities to
complete in the hiring process.

In selecting case studies, the cross-tabbed responses from supervisors were
split into slightly smaller groups. For this purpose, responses were grouped in smaller
clusters as seen in Figure 3.8. From this table, the selection of school districts
occurred at the extremes of each grouping. The selection of cases at the extremes
allows for more comparison among cases, whereas selecting districts closer to the
averages might produce more repetition. For example, one district was chosen from
the group in which the supervisor completes two to four tasks and one to two people
are involved in the hiring process (highlighted in purple in Figure 3.8). One district
was also chosen from the group in which the supervisor completes 10 to 13 tasks and
3 to 5 people are involved in the hiring process (highlighted in blue in Figure 3.8).

For this study, six case studies were selected. I chose four cases from each of
the following groups, based on the results of the follow-up survey:





Low number of tasks performed by supervisors, low number of individuals
involved (highlighted purple in Figure 3.8, 10 districts)
Low number of tasks performed by supervisors, high number of individuals
involved (highlighted green, 5 districts)
Medium number of tasks performed by supervisors, high number of
individuals involved (highlighted orange, 4 districts)
High number of tasks performed by supervisors, high number of individuals
involved (highlighted blue, 6 districts)

Using the group in which the supervisors performed a medium number of tasks
instead of a low number of tasks when there was a high number of individuals or
groups involved was necessary because there were no potential cases with a low
number of tasks completed with a high number of involved individuals. I did not
include any of the districts in which the supervisor said they completed zero to one
task because of the possibility in which a person may not have completed any tasks.
Additionally, I chose two districts from the 48 districts previously mentioned
in which the supervisor indicated in the 2012 Lilead Survey that they were not
involved in the hiring process in any way. These cases could possibly help determine
why the supervisor is not involved in the hiring process. These two case studies were
to be compared with one another and with the other case studies to assess any
differences in governance among those districts in which the supervisor is at least
somewhat involved in the recruiting and hiring processes and those districts in which
they are not involved.

55

3.5.3 Controlled Variables
Rather than choose districts at random from each of these groups, I attempted
to control for three variables in case study selection. The intention of such controls
was to ensure that differences in hiring practices were not based on other major
differences among the school districts. After grouping, school districts were ranked in
each group as being closest to the group mean for the following variables:




student population
expenditures per pupil (EPP)
number of schools in the district

As will be seen in the description of the selection process to follow, I was forced to
abandon some of these attempts at control because of unanticipated factors. However,
attempts were made to select districts that were similar regarding these variables.
3.6 Selection
After grouping the school districts according to the supervisors’ responses to
questions about their participation in the recruiting and hiring processes and the
number of people involved in those processes, I began the selection process. Selection
included ranking the districts in each group by controlled variables and then screening
each district as a possible participant.
3.6.1 Screening School Districts
After establishing the four groups for case studies, I conducted a screening
process to make sure a district in a chosen group was viable for participation in the

56

study. A preliminary, but not exhaustive, list of questions for screening is in Figure
3.9. I gathered responses to these questions by making contact with the supervisors in
each district. Contact began with an initial email and numerous follow-up contacts if
there was no response to the initial email. If response to email was positive, I called
the supervisor for a brief discussion that included the screening questions in Figure
3.9. Certain responses eliminated a school district as a viable candidate to participate
in the study. For example, if the supervisor was unwilling to participate, the district
could not be considered. Another consideration was the IRB process. Individual
districts’ IRB processes ranged from single-page forms approved by one individual to
multi-part document applications approved by a board that meets irregularly. If the
IRB process was deemed too involved for a timely completion of the study, I
eliminated that district from participation.

Is the supervisor willing to participate in the study? What is required to
complete the IRB process for the school district?
Have school librarians been hired in the school district within the last
five years?
Are there a significant number of school librarians in school buildings
for the district to be considered comparable to other districts?
Is the school district involved in any legal action regarding its recruiting
and hiring practices?
Are employees of the school district able to discuss the recruiting and
hiring practices of the school district?
Is the supervisor the one actually involved in the recruiting and hiring
decisions, or is it another individual at the district-level library services
office?

57

3.6.2 Selecting from Groups
With each group established, I was able to select the primary candidates for
inclusion in the study. Among the districts in each group, I chose school districts
based on the geographic location of the school district and the district closest to the
group’s mean population, expenditures per pupil (EPP), and number of schools.
In each group, there was the possibility that the first choice was not available
or applicable for participation in the study. In total, nine districts did not pass the
screening process before I arrived at the districts selected for the study. The reasons
varied. In one district, the supervisor was unable or unwilling to participate. In two
school districts, the school librarians and been laid off and there were no plans to
replace them or they were to be replaced with non-certified staff. In more than one
district, the supervisor and others in the school district did not respond to email or
phone calls.
My original intention was to include two districts as controls in the study to
get a better understanding of the possible factors that contribute to the library
supervisor not participating at all in the recruiting and hiring processes. After all other
selections were completed, I chose two geographic locations not represented by the
districts selected from the four groups. For one control, I looked at school districts in
the southwestern area of the country. In the other control group, I chose a district
from a state in which there was a large number of supervisors, but none participated
in the hiring process. In the latter group, no one was available to participate in the
study.

58

3.6.3 Selections
All participants in the study were ensured anonymity in their participation. For
this reason, all names and locations use pseudonyms. The locations of each district
are identified by their division in the U.S. census (for a map of U.S. census divisions,
see the Appendices). After going through the screening process and receiving
approval from each individual district to conduct research, the final selections were as
follows:


For the district with a low number of tasks performed by the supervisor and
low number of individuals involved in hiring, the participating district was
Cotesworth School District, located in the South Atlantic U.S. Census
Division.



For the district with a medium number of tasks performed by the supervisor
and high number of individuals involved in hiring, the participating district
was Maine North School District, located in the East South Central U.S.
Census Division.



For the district with a high number of tasks performed by the supervisor and a
low number of individuals involved in hiring, the participating district was
Red Rock School District, located in the South Atlantic U.S. Census
Division (in a different state than Cotesworth).



For the district with a high number of tasks performed by the supervisor and a
high number of individuals involved in hiring, the participating district was

59

Paris School District, located in the West South Central U.S. Census
Division.


For the control district in which there was no involvement of the supervisor
and an unknown number of individuals involved in hiring, the participating
district was Sunville School District, located in the Mountain U.S. Census
Division.

3.7 Data Collection
Data collection focused on semi-structured interviews with multiple
individuals from each of the school districts. During the interviews, I asked
participants about their process for recruiting and hiring school librarians and the role
of different individuals and groups in those activities. The individuals interviewed
from each school district included:





the school district’s library supervisor,
a representative from human resources,
two to three principals at any grade level, who had hired a school librarian
within the last five years, and
three to four school librarians hired in the last five years.

The individuals interviewed for each case study were selected either because they
were most likely to be involved in the recruiting and hiring of school librarians
(principals and human resources representatives) or they were the individuals with the
most knowledge of school librarians (supervisors). As individuals who went through
the hiring process, but from the perspective of a candidate and not an employer, I

60

interviewed school librarians to verify the information given by the other three types
of participants.
I chose to use interviews rather than focus groups to gain perspectives from
individuals rather than groups. Individual interviews helped avoid groups coming to
consensus and premature conclusions about the decision-making process of how they
conducted recruiting and hiring (MacDougall & Baum, 1997). Particularly in the case
of principals, it was important to gather information about their own personal and
specific processes regarding recruiting and hiring without the outside influence of
other individuals within the district. Individual interviews also prevented the
possibility of agreement and collaboration between departments and individuals
where none may actually exist, a problem that could skew the findings. Individual
interviews also allowed for an expansion of exploratory questioning throughout data
collection. With each successive interview, subsequent interviews were tailored to
follow new or adjusted lines of inquiry, based on the responses of others.
I conducted interviews over the phone with each participant. Though
conducting interviews in person would have been ideal, it was also cost prohibitive. I
used my mobile phone to record each interview with the expressed permission of the
participant. In two interviews, there was user error and the interviews were not
recorded. For these interviews, I took extensive notes immediately after the interview
was completed.
Using the recording, I transcribed each interview, leaving out material that
was not pertinent to the study (e.g., conversations about evaluating school librarians

61

were not transcribed, as they do not fall under the purview of this study). Once
transcribed and edited to include only data pertinent to this study, I performed
member checks by sending each transcription back to the participant for review. Each
participant was given the opportunity to make any changes needed to clarify their
response. Once member checks were complete, I loaded transcriptions into NVivo for
coding and analysis.
3.7.1 Interviews with School District Library Supervisors
Interviews were conducted first with district library supervisors. Interviews
were semi-structured, following a pre-determined protocol (see the Appendices for
the complete protocol). The protocol included a list of questions to start the
conversation and to ensure that all research questions were addressed, but the semistructured nature of the interview allowed for participants to bring up other related
topics. This process was in keeping with the exploratory nature of the study. In all
five cases, the supervisor of library services participated in an interview.
3.7.2 Interviews with Human Resources Representatives
From the interview with the supervisor, I determined which person in the
district’s human resources department should be interviewed. If the supervisor
indicated there was a specific liaison for recruiting and hiring school librarians, that
individual was asked to take part in the study. If no specific person was identified,
then I made contact with HR without the assistance of the supervisor and preliminary
inquiries in the department determined who would be the best candidate for

62

participation in the study. Similar to the interviews with supervisors, interviews with
HR representatives were semi-structured, following a pre-determined protocol (see
the Appendices for the complete protocol). Questions shifted in focus to the
responsibilities of HR and specific policies regarding recruiting and hiring within the
school district. In all five cases, a representative from HR participated in an interview.
3.7.3 Interviews with Principals
Though they were somewhat difficult to identify, I attempted interviews with
at least three principals in each school district. Primary selection was based on
principals who had made the most recent hires of school librarians in their school
district, information I obtained from the district library supervisor. It was preferred
that all hires had occurred within the last three years. If finding principals with recent
hires was not possible, I attempted to contact principals who had hired a librarian
within the last five years. If hiring had been completed more than five years ago, the
principal was not eligible to participate.
At the outset of the study, a secondary consideration for principal selection
was school grade level. However, getting principals to participate in the study proved
difficult, and grade level was removed as a factor for inclusion in the study. Principals
were mostly non-responsive to requests to participate; a few principals refused
participation. Figure 3.10 shows the number of principal participants in each school
district. In each district, principals contacted were identified by the district library
supervisor or recently hired school librarians.

63

Interviews were similar to those of supervisors and HR representatives and
were semi-structured, following a pre-determined protocol (see the Appendices for
the complete protocol). The questions focused on the building-level responsibilities of
the principal and how they conduct recruiting and hiring while keeping in
consideration the needs, vision, and mission of their particular school.

3.7.4 Interviews with School Librarians
Data collection with school librarians in each district was conducted through
interviews that differed slightly from the others. In this study, school librarians were
considered an outside observer of the decision-making processes in recruiting and
hiring. While school librarians take part from beginning to end and their hiring is a
result of the decisions made, they have no authority in the process and, thus, offered a
different perspective. Their participation provided a way to triangulate the data
coming from the interviews with those people doing the hiring.
A protocol was used to conduct a semi-structured interview with the school
librarians (see the Appendices for the complete protocol). The protocol included

64

questions similar to those of the other interviews, but focused on how the librarian
was hired, as opposed to how they were involved in the decision-making process. The
interviews remained semi-structured to allow participants to bring up related, but
unforeseen, topics.
3.7.5 Triangulation of the Data
In case study research, it is ideal for the researcher to triangulate the data by
using multiple sources: interviews, documents, and observations are a standard
example (Yin, 2009). Unfortunately, such triangulation was not possible in this study.
For legal reasons, it was highly unlikely I would ever have gotten approval from a
school district to observe hiring practices. The events in hiring that are observable,
such as the interview with a candidate, are typically confidential and the approval
process for using such data would have required a much more rigorous IRB approval.
Additionally, a researcher can use document analysis to verify and triangulate
the data that are obtained from interviews. In this particular study, such data is
extremely limited. While participants did talk about some policies that are a part of
the recruiting and hiring processes, such policies exist at such a high level that they
do not directly affect the actual processes of recruiting and hiring. These policies are
generally created at the state or district levels and are not concerned with recruiting
and hiring, but rather with the legal stipulations that go into hiring practices, such as
equal opportunity employment. Such policies are typically general to educators and
not specific to librarians. Additionally, participants did not refer to any of these

65

documents or policies on a consistent basis. For this reason, they are not included in
this study as a part of the data collected for analysis.
3.8 Data Analysis
Data analysis was qualitative and categorized based on the research questions
of the study. Analysis followed the step-by-step approach prescribed by Creswell
(2009) for qualitative analysis:
1. Organize and prepare the data for analysis: This step involved transcribing
interviews and scanning and uploading documents into NVivo.
2. Read through all the data: This process gave a sense of the overall data
collected and how different pieces and sections related to the corresponding
research questions.
3. Begin detailed analysis with a coding process: After familiarizing myself with
the data, I used codes generated from the research questions to label the data.
When necessary, codes were added, adjusted, and merged with repeated
analysis of the data.
4. Use the coding process to generate a description of the setting and people as
well as categories or themes for analysis: Through analysis of the codes,
themes were developed and applied.
5. Advance how the description and themes will be represented in the qualitative
narrative: Themes were collated and all related data exported into
corresponding research questions, developing a narrative for interpretation.

66

6. Interpretation of the data for framework creation: Data analysis led to an
integration of how school librarians are recruited and hired with the
theoretical lens of IT governance. The codes relating to the specific research
questions were used to create this framework and are reported in the findings.
3.9 Summary of the Methods
The method used in this research was multiple case studies of five school
district chosen to be as similar as possible in district population, number of schools,
and EPP. While similar in some aspects, school districts were selected from different
groups based on the library supervisors’ responses to a survey about a) their
participation and b) the participation of others in the hiring of school librarians. The
data collected from each school district were interviews about the district’s recruiting
and hiring practices with principals, individuals in HR, library supervisors, and school
librarians. Data analysis was conducted through iterative coding from themes in the
research questions with continuous adjustments as new themes developed.

67

Chapter 4: Findings

This chapter presents the findings of this study. The first section of this
chapter is an overview of the general tasks and processes that most school districts go
through in recruiting and hiring school librarians. It includes definitions for each of
these tasks and the order in which they are most often completed. Following the
overview of the general process, I present the findings for each of the five case
studies. Each case begins with a description of the school district, followed by
descriptions of that district’s practices in recruiting, hiring, and transfer hires. As
stated previously, the findings focus on the following research questions:
1. How do school districts make decisions about recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
a. How does the organizational structure of the school district influence
the decision-making processes of recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
b. How do school district policies and procedures influence the decisionmaking processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians?
c. How do the actual processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians
adhere to or differ from school district policies or procedures?
2. How do the specific knowledge sets held by different district-level
departments influence the decision-making of principals regarding recruiting
and hiring school librarians at the building level?
a. How are school district library supervisors involved in making
building-level recruiting and hiring decisions?
b. How are human resource departments involved in making buildinglevel recruiting and hiring decisions?

68

c. In what ways, if any, do principals, supervisors, and human resource
departments coordinate on decisions on recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
4.1 General Tasks and Processes
This section includes an overview of the general process that school districts
go through while recruiting and hiring school librarians. In presenting the process,
definitions are provided for key actions and strategies used in each process. As will
be discussed, transfer hires feature prominently in the school districts taking part in
this study. The process of hiring transfers will be discussed separately from new hires
throughout this chapter.
The way in which a school district or individual completes a task in these
processes can be considered formal or informal. A formal process is one governed
by a policy, set of steps, or documentation in the school district. In a formal process,
each individual in the school district is meant to perform tasks in the same manner. In
an informal process, policies and guiding steps or documentation may not be readily
available. A district may do things a certain way, but that practice is more likely to be
verbally agreed upon, as opposed to formally written and set in place by guiding
policies. Different steps in the recruiting and hiring processes can be varying degrees
of formal or informal, or may include some combination of both types of processes.
4.1.1 Recruiting
Recruiting candidates to apply for open positions begins the process of
bringing school librarians into the district. The recruiting process includes word-of-

69

mouth recruiting, job postings, job fairs, recruiting through certification programs,
creating district cohorts for certification programs, and evaluating the recruiting
process.
When a district becomes aware that a school library position will be open,
word-of-mouth recruiting is often the first tactic used by most schools and districts
trying to hire for a position. Word-of-mouth recruiting includes any action on
behalf of a school or school district in which current employees reach out to potential
candidates for positions in an informal manner; it is used both inside and outside a
school district. As this is specifically for recruiting purposes, the word-of-mouth
strategy must come from the efforts of someone already working in the school district.
If word-of-mouth tactics are used by an applicant, this is referred to as applicant
efforts. Applicant efforts include any interaction in which an applicant specifically
reaches out to someone inside the district to obtain information about an opening.
Depending on the district and certain procedural requirements, additional
recruiting techniques include job postings and job advertisements. Job postings come
in a number of different formats, and their detail and descriptiveness of positions
available vary. Job postings may appear on district websites, social media, traditional
print advertisements, listservs, online job aggregators, and many other places. The
terms jobs postings and job advertisements (job ads) are used interchangeably.
At some point in the recruiting process, school districts may hold or attend job
fairs to offer an opportunity for prospective applicants to seek out a number of

70

positions in a short amount of time. There are three types of job fairs discussed in this
study:


Unidistrict job fairs are events held by a school district in which any school
in the district seeking to hire for a position may send representatives for their
school. Attendees are job seekers from both within and outside the school
district and may take the opportunity to talk with specific schools, all at the
same event.



Transfer job fairs are events held by a school district in which any school in
the district seeking to hire for a position may send representatives for an
exhibit booth for their school. Attendees are current employees of the school
district who are considering or actively looking for a new position in the same
school district. These job fairs are not open to individuals not already
employed by the school district.



Multidistrict jobs fairs are events held at places like universities or
convention centers. They are typically sponsored by the university, a state
Department of Education, or are attached to a professional conference. These
job fairs may have exhibit space for individual schools, but more often are
used to advertise and recruit for whole school districts. Districts will hand out
recruiting materials and discuss available positions with potential applicants.
Unlike unidistrict or transfer job fairs, the districts exhibiting may not be
recruiting for specific positions, but instead are recruiting for people to apply
to be a part of a candidate pool for available positions in the district.

71

Job fairs typically occur during the hiring season at the end of the school year and
during the summer. At that time, school districts hope to know how many positions
will be available and that job announcements for those positions are already posted.
In addition to attending multidistrict job fairs, a district may find others ways
to connect with students at local universities that have school library certification
programs. Visits to pre-service students are one way for representatives from HR or
library services to be in touch with university programs and to visit students seeking
certification in school librarianship. Such visits may include specific recruiting efforts
or come in the form of a supervisor attending classes as a guest lecturer or expert in
the field.
The previous actions taken by districts are completed regularly during the
hiring season and are meant to recruit for positions for the next school year. A longterm recruiting tactic by a school district is the creation of cohorts for school library
certification programs. In districts with a shortage of school library candidates,
creating cohorts to attend a certification program can be one recruiting solution.
Cohorts involve recruiting current district staff—library aides, classroom teachers,
paraprofessionals, and other staff—to go through a certification program together.
Tuition for students in these cohorts is sometimes funded by the school district, grants
obtained by cooperation between the school district and a university, or a
combination of funding between the students in the cohort and any of these
institutions. For example, at the University of Maryland in 2005–2007, there were
eight teachers from DC Public Schools who completed the MLS program as a cohort.

72

Their tuition was paid through a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library
Services (IMLS).
As a part of the recruiting process, a district may evaluate its strategies and
practices in recruiting. Evaluating the recruiting process includes any formal or
informal efforts by the school district to assess or change the district’s efforts in
recruiting school librarians.
4.1.2 Hiring
During and after recruiting, the hiring process begins. Unlike the recruiting
process, in which all tasks are completed by the school district, the hiring process has
tasks completed by the school district and applicants to the district. Events during the
hiring process include the application process, screening applicants, creating
candidate pools, conducting interviews, selecting final candidates, making job offers
and finalizing paperwork, conveying the terms of provisional employment, and
evaluating hiring processes.
Typically, the first step in the process of hiring is for an individual to fill out
an application. The application process includes any online or print paperwork
necessary before the screening or review process can begin. The application process
is typically formal, with applicants filling out specific forms and submitting required
documents and qualifications. The process of “applying” to a position can be
significantly different for transfers, which is addressed in the next section.

73

Once an individual has submitted an application to a school district, a
screening process may begin. Throughout this study, there is a distinction in the
hiring process between an applicant and a candidate for a position. An applicant is
any individual who has applied for a job in the school district. A candidate for a
position is an individual who has passed the screening process. For the purposes of
this study, the screening process is any step that occurs before an applicant is placed
in a candidate pool or recommended to building-level personnel for an interview.
Depending on the school, the screening process could include such actions as:


Reviewing Applications and Qualifications: This task includes the logistical
process of reviewing applications for experience and qualifications once
completed by applicants. It includes reviewing applications to ensure that the
applicant is qualified and working with the applicant to be certain that all of
the necessary paperwork and certifications are correct and current.



Screening Interviews: Once applications are reviewed, some districts
conduct screening interviews. These interviews are events in which district
personnel interview an applicant before placing them in a candidate pool for
review by building-level personnel.



Other Evaluations: Beyond screening interviews, a district may formally
require an applicant to complete other tasks before being considered a
candidate for a position. Such tasks may include performing a mock lesson
plan, providing writing samples, or role playing conversations with parents or

74

community members. If performed, such evaluations are typically a part of
standard protocol and are considered formal procedures.
After completing the screening process, a school has created a candidate pool. A
candidate pool is a group of individuals who have passed the screening process. If a
district uses a candidate pool, then this is the group of individuals from which
building-level personnel may draw from to interview for a position.
Some districts do not create candidate pools. In these districts, any applicant is
considered a candidate and that person can be selected for an interview. For districts
that use candidate pools, it is at this stage that the interviewing begins. The interview
includes actions in which building-level personnel question a candidate’s
appropriateness for a position. Interviews have two major factors: the parties involved
in conducting the interview and the content of the interview. In differentiating
screening interviews from candidate interviews, building-level personnel must be
involved in a candidate interview; however, this requirement does not exclude
district-level personnel from participating in the building-level interview. The content
of the interview may involve questions about a number of issues, including the
candidate’s ideas and philosophies on teaching, school libraries, collaboration, and
program management.
After interviews are conducted at the building level, a final hiring decision or
selection is made, choosing one candidate from all of those interviewed. The decision
of selection could rest with one individual or an entire group.

75

Once a decision is made on who to hire, the next task is to make a job offer to
the selected candidate. The job offer can include re-verifying the certification and
qualifications of the candidate, making a formal offer, having the candidate sign a
contract, and completing any paperwork involved in provisional employment
(discussed in the next section).
As a part of the hiring process, a district may evaluate its strategies and
practices in hiring. Evaluating the hiring process includes any formal or informal
efforts by the school district to evaluate or change the district’s efforts in recruiting
school librarians.
4.1.3 Transfer Hires
It was the intention of this study to look at the recruiting and hiring practices
concerning school librarians who were new to their positions. Enlisting individuals to
participate in the study was difficult, and when asking new hires to participate I came
up against a major complication: while some librarians were new to their position and
many were new to their role as a librarian, many of the participants in the study were
transfer hires. A transfer hire is the filling of a position with someone who is already
employed by the school and/or school district. The previous position of the hire is
typically either a school librarian from another school in the district or a former
classroom teacher. Transfer hires, who were formerly classroom teachers, can come
from within the school or from somewhere else in the school district. This prevalence
of transfers was evident from those interviewed for the study and the way they talked

76

about other librarians new to their positions in the school district. For instance, Ms.
Young of Cotesworth School District said:
Most of the media specialists that I know…were all hired within the same
school they worked in or at least [came from] the school district. The few I
can think of who were hired in the past years were already working at that
school in a different role or maybe transferred within [the district].
Ms. Standish of Maine North School District stated, “Most school librarians in the
district were classroom teachers first. That’s what I’ve heard at least, from the ones I
have met.”
The prevalence of transfer hires over new hires in these school districts
warranted further detail in the findings of this study. Employees who transfer from
one position to another in their own school or district are not recruited or hired in the
same way as new hires. The transfer process is typically more informal and often
occurs in a shorter timeframe than for new hires. Additionally, although the districtlevel offices of HR and library services are often involved in recruiting and hiring
new individuals into the district, they are less likely to be involved in the transfer
process, though there are exceptions.
The tasks and events in transfer hires include recruiting internally, employee
efforts, intent forms and transfer requests, informal hiring inquiries and interviews,
the transfer process, and district-level involvement in transfers. Throughout the
findings, the minutiae of the transfer processes of each school district are not
described at the same level as recruiting and hiring in this study, but because how

77

frequently transfers are hired over new school librarians, how they affect the
recruiting and hiring processes must be considered.
The transfer process is often more informal than recruiting and hiring
processes. The most formal way for the transfer process to begin is through intent
forms or transfer requests. In the transfer process, this paperwork replaces the
application used for new hires. Intent forms and transfer requests are documents
created at both the building and district levels that inform the administration of an
employee’s desire to transfer positions. These documents may exist formally at the
district level and be a part of an official process, or they may be informal documents
specific to an individual school and created by the principal.
In other instances, the transfer process may begin with a school or district
recruiting internally, very similar to word-of-mouth recruiting, which includes any
efforts by district- or building-level personnel to recruit for a position within their
own school or district. Internal recruiting can begin with or without the involvement
of individuals or offices at the district level. Such efforts may be through word-ofmouth or transfer job fairs. Regardless, these efforts are focused solely on recruiting
someone who already works for the school or school district.
From an alternative beginning point, a transfer may begin with the efforts of
the employee to be transferred. Employee efforts include any efforts by an employee
to transfer within a school or school district. The most frequent example of efforts
made by the employee is the informal hiring inquiry, in which an employee makes
an effort to speak with district- or building-level administrators about open school

78

library positions in their school or district. An informal inquiry may occur before an
open position is officially posted by the school or district. This inquiry by a potential
transfer may be followed immediately, or at a later date, by an informal interview, a
discussion between the potential transfer and a building administrator that acts the
same way as an interview does for a new hire. To be considered an informal interview,
the conversation must occur before any job posting or announcement is made. After
an announcement is made, such a discussion is no longer unique to the transfer, who
has no more knowledge of an open position than does any applicant in the general
public.
Transfer hires are selected and finalized after all internal forms, inquiries, and
conversations have occurred. This process can differ greatly among districts and even
between schools in a district. To be considered a complete transfer hire, all actions
must take place before an announcement is posted to the public. If the district makes a
public announcement because of hiring policies, but no outside candidates are
actually considered for a position because an internal transfer is already planned, this
would still be considered a complete transfer hire. When an internal candidate must
go through the entire process in the same way as an outside candidate, they are only
considered a partial transfer hire. While they are still a transfer hire, the process
may be significantly more involved for an internal candidate than it is to go through a
more informal transfer process.
Not all of the stated tasks and events related here for recruiting, hiring, and
transfer hires occur in every district or for every hire in a district. Additionally, they

79

may not occur in the same order. However, this is the general process used in districts,
and deviations from this process will be highlighted throughout the findings. This
chapter continues with a presentation of the findings for each school district.

80

4.2 Cotesworth School District
Cotesworth School District is located in South Atlantic U.S. Census Division.
It is a county district just outside a major metropolitan area, and the U.S. Census
categorizes it as suburban in population and density. Magazines such as Forbes have
named the county as having one of the highest average household incomes in the
country. Further demographic details about the district and its students are in Figures
4.1 and 4.2.
I chose this district for participation in the study as representative of the
school districts in which the library supervisor has very little involvement in the
hiring of school librarians and a low number of people or groups involved overall in
the hiring processes.
The state in which Cotesworth is located has policies regarding the staffing of
school libraries with certified school librarians in each school. However, these
policies do not apply to Cotesworth, which is part of a special, statewide program that
allows districts and schools to be more flexible with their staffing allotments. To be
certified as a school librarian in the state, one must have a Master of Library Science
or Master of Library Media Technology. The library supervisor stated that one could
get an add-on endorsement for libraries as a teacher, but “no one is going for that
anymore because it’s practically worthless.”

4.2.1 Recruiting
Recruiting efforts in Cotesworth School District rely heavily on word-ofmouth, and the district’s appeal is, according to Ms. Lyman of HR, due to being “one
of the top school districts in the country when it comes to technology.” Positions in
the school district are highly sought after, sometimes with too many candidates
applying, said one principal.
Ms. Lyman of HR stated that current employees reaching out to possible
applicants using word-of-mouth was a major recruiting tactic in their district. “If
someone knows someone…, [principals] can ask anyone involved or knowledgeable
at the central office level, but they don’t have to.” She also specifically mentioned
principals and district administrators asking the better-respected media specialists in
the district if they knew of anyone available before seeking out new hires from
outside the district. Ms. Lyman said that the only place the district is required to post
a job opening is on a website sponsored by the state Department of Education.
The Director of IT, who is the senior administrator for school libraries, Mr.
Moss, agreed that getting a job in the district is definitely about “who you know.” The
library supervisor, Ms. Hayes, agreed: “If a teacher knows someone and recommends
them for a position in the school, that’s how that position is going to be filled.”

84

Regarding job postings, Mr. Lyman stated, “Each school is required to put up a job ad
when a position is available,” though he did not elaborate on where those openings
were posted.
As a principal, Ms. Seaborn indicated that whether she uses word-of-mouth as
a recruiting tactic depends on the position for which she is hiring: “I may want
someone who knows our system and how it operates” or sometimes “I purposely
want outside blood, new ideas, a new way of looking at things.” She takes the
recommendations of others in the school district very seriously. In her last two
instance of hiring a school librarian, she had received suggestions of people to
interview from the central instructional technology department (where the library
services department is housed), but she emphasized that she was not required to do it
and that her most recent hire was not a recommendation from that department.
The recently hired librarians in Cotesworth School District, some of whom
were transfer hires, indicated that word-of-mouth is extremely important in the
process of being hired. Ms. McGarry, when asked about the effectiveness of
recruiting efforts in Cotesworth, stated that her experience was excellent, but “I am
not sure it was excellent for those who did not happen to hear about it…. It was such
a quick turnaround…. For those who didn’t get word-of-mouth, that’s a shame.”
While the state requires that jobs be posted on the Department of Education’s
website, it appears that the district may not require them to be posted anywhere else.
Neither Ms. Lyman of HR nor Mr. Moss of the IT department indicated any
additional required postings, and Principal Seaborn was of the impression that all

85

postings were optional. Principal Seaborn stated that she does not always put up
postings for positions. In one specific instance, she said she was opening up a new
school as the principal. In that case, “people know you’re opening a school and you
need all the positions,” and so there is no need to advertise. Additionally, she
indicated that such advertisements can be cumbersome. Confirming statements by
those at the district level, she discussed the advantages of recruiting and hiring
someone through word-of-mouth:
When I know someone who has already caught my teachers’ eye or a fellow
administrator’s eye, and they know what kind of teacher we are looking for at
Cotesworth, then I would go with those avenues first…. Sometimes when we
post [an opening], that can bring in tons of emails from people who are
interested, and sometimes that just doesn’t pan out as far as the time expended
in going through all the resumes.
While describing autonomy in an administrator’s decision to advertise or not, Ms.
Seaborn did relate that the last school librarian she hired found out about the position
by going through the job listings posted by HR on the district’s website.
Ms. Ziegler, a school librarian in Cotesworth, had much to say about posting
jobs:
I would like there to be somewhere you could see what positions are open. In
our county, if you know you have a position open, you keep it to yourself,
because you know who you want to hire already. You don’t know if a
principal is hiring a media specialist, you just have to ask…. I don’t know the
process if you want to apply besides asking your principal to ask someone else
who is a principal. It’s a lot who you know in this county [instead of] knowing
what postings for a job are there. It would be nice if it were a little more
formal so you could see what your options really are.

86

In Cotesworth, there is very little recruiting effort beyond job postings and
word-of-mouth. The only job fair mentioned was a transfer job fair. Ms. Ziegler, a
school librarian, stated that if a school can find a good candidate for a position at the
transfer job fair from the staff desiring a transfer, then the school would not open up
the position to applicants outside the district. She was not aware whether school
librarians would actually find any available positions at this job fair. No other
individual in Cotesworth made any specific mention of using other job fairs as a form
of recruitment. District-level administrators in Cotesworth also made no efforts to
conduct pre-service visits to school library certification programs or create cohorts
from within the school district to attend such programs. With the appeal of the school
district drawing in many candidates, such efforts appear to be unnecessary. No one in
the district made any mention of formally or informally evaluating recruiting efforts.
4.2.2 Hiring
In a district like Cotesworth where principals have far more autonomy in how
they conduct hiring, the application process is not as structured as in other districts.
Additionally, there is less involvement from individuals at the district level. For
instance, neither HR nor the district library supervisors conduct screening interviews
to create a pool of applicants from which principals can select individuals to
interview. This is in keeping with their district’s process of building-level
administrators having a great deal of autonomy in recruiting and hiring. The
candidate pool is created by those who apply for a position. There is no intermediary

87

between principals and the active pool of applicants who have applied. Ms. Lyman in
HR stated that principals are able to view application materials as soon as they are
completed. After viewing these materials, principals can bring in anyone they want
for an interview.
The library supervisors, Ms. Hayes, and her superior, Mr. Moss, also have no
involvement in the interview process. Instead of using the expertise or assistance of
those at the district level, principals in Cotesworth mentioned relying on individuals
in their schools. With technology integration being such a high priority in Cotesworth,
many principals look for a school librarian who can pair well with an instructional
technology specialist (ITS). The roles of librarian and ITS can be matched in different
ways. Principal Seaborn, for instance, sees them as complementary: both individuals
should be well-versed in instruction, resources, and technology, with the school
librarian focusing more on the resources and the ITS focusing more on technology.
Another principal, Ms. Cregg, leaves such decisions on allotments completely open
when assessing her school’s needs and looks first at the candidate pool before
deciding what she wants. Instead of providing specific qualifications in a job ad or in
discussion with others, Ms. Cregg will leave items like the certification requirements
open-ended. She said that it allows her to review candidates who may not have
otherwise been “qualified,” but their experience and other qualifications may make
them perfectly suitable for the position. Specifically, she said she would not
necessarily require a school library certificate as a prerequisite for a position in the

88

school library, because she may find that someone with different certification to be a
better fit.
Principal Seaborn described in detail how she uses other faculty in her school
to hire all staff. She typically begins the hiring process by screening individuals for
hire, either by reviewing their applications and/or speaking with them in a brief
screening interview. She selects a few candidates she thinks will work well within the
school, all of whom she is willing to hire, and then has a panel of faculty and others at
the building-level interview those candidates more thoroughly. She said that
sometimes she sits in on the panel interviews, but there are times when she leaves the
hiring process almost entirely up to the hiring panel she assigns. She has the hiring
panel make a selection and always goes with their recommendation, which is why she
tries to screen candidates in advance of placing them in front of a hiring panel. For
her recent hire of a school librarian, she had her instructional technology specialist
(ITS) conduct the interviews for the school librarian. As stated previously, the ITS
and the school librarian work together very closely in her school, so she considered
the ITS conducting the interviews to be analogous to the process she uses with
teachers hiring other teachers.
At another school in Cotesworth, Ms. McGarry was hired to be a school
librarian in a process similar to the one described by Principal Seaborn. She went in
for an initial interview with the principal and the ITS, then was asked to return for a
second interview conducted by a hiring panel. In another school, the librarian, Ms.
Young, was only interviewed by the principal. However, she explained that this was a

89

special circumstance. The school was getting a new assistant principal and ITS, so
there was no one to assist the principal in the interview. However, Ms. Young stated
that now they also use panels to hire other individuals for the school and that she is a
member of the hiring committee.
In the first interview Ms. McGarry went through with the principal and the
ITS, she said that content was focused mostly on how she might work with the ITS.
Ms. McGarry felt the principal, Ms. North, was really looking to see how their
personalities worked with one another. Her second interview with a hiring panel of
other school staff focused on teaching and learning, how she would run the media
center, her ideas for lessons and curriculum, and other skills.
With the school district guided mostly by site-based decision-making, Ms.
Lyman of HR said that the decision of selecting the final candidate for an open
position typically resides with the principal. A principal will make a recommendation
for hire to HR, who will complete the request. As demonstrated by the hiring panels
used in multiple schools, principals can involve whomever they choose at the
building level. However, ultimately the decision belongs to the principal, and no one
at the district level has much to do with it. Ms. Lyman noted that the practice of sitebased selection was not because of any policies or procedures put into place, but that
it’s just “good practice.”
Principal Cregg said she could not express enough the importance of the level
of autonomy that allows principals to make the final selection decision:

90

We’re the top-ranked public school that’s listed in [our state]…. Many of my
colleagues are in the top ten in [our state]. I strongly feel that it has a lot to do
with the autonomy we’re given, the flexibility we are given within our
buildings, and not confined to thinking of things in a traditional manner.
While Principal Seaborn also feels similarly in regard to the autonomy they are
afforded, she relies heavily on others at the building level to assist in hiring anyone in
her school, as was stated earlier. The decision of selection stays at the school, but
there is a hiring committee that makes a recommendation of who to hire, and Ms.
Seaborn could not think of a time when she had gone against the recommendation of
the committee.
Regarding the evaluation of hiring processes in Cotesworth, most participants
had nothing to say and little to no interest in changing the current processes. The
Director of IT, Mr. Moss, said:
I wouldn’t say that I’m unhappy with the way things are done, but I would
like to see our department more involved in the process. I don’t want to be
telling principals who to hire, but I would like them to ask us for assistance
when they need it and to help them in hiring. It’s not that only bad people are
hiring, it’s that things are currently hit or miss, and that could be improved
upon.
The library supervisor, Ms. Hayes, agreed with him on this point. They are both
relatively new to their positions and are trying to become more involved, but at the
time of their interview, their involvement was uncertain.
4.2.3 Transfer Hires
The library supervisor in Cotesworth indicated that HR’s involvement in
recruiting is passive; they largely leave that responsibility at the building level. At

91

each school, principals often reach out to individuals in their buildings, asking
teachers if someone is interested in working in the library (or with instructional
technology, depending on their chosen allotment), or if they know of anyone
searching for a position that meets the school’s teaching philosophy. Since word-ofmouth is more likely to reach someone internally than externally, this can often result
in transfer hires instead of new hires.
Principals will often find out about the interest of one of their teachers, or
another teacher in the school district, being interested in a school library position
through the efforts of the applicant, or in the case of transfers, the employee wishing
to make a transfer. In Cotesworth, the librarians interviewed, who were transfer hires,
said that their own efforts factored in prominently to their being hired to their current
position. Ms. McGarry heard about her position while she was teaching summer
school and decided to apply for a transfer. Ms. Young completed her internship for
her school library certification at the school where she was already teaching in the
classroom. When the former librarian decided to leave, Ms. Young went to both the
outgoing and incoming principals and expressed her interest in transferring from the
classroom to the school library. She interviewed at other schools as well, but liked the
principal coming to the school and wanted to stay.
Ms. Ziegler went through a similar situation in her own school when she
found out that the former school librarian was retiring. She spoke with her principal
during her end-of-year review as a classroom teacher. In that review, she expressed
her interest in being the librarian the next year. They discussed her credentials, and

92

Ms. Ziegler informed the principal of some ideas she had for the library. Once the
principal knew what her allotments were for the next school year, she told Ms.
Ziegler that the transfer was granted. This was the only interview in which Ms.
Ziegler participated. She had little knowledge of how an applicant would apply
without knowing anyone: “I don’t know the process if you want to apply besides
asking your principal to ask someone else who is a principal.”
Such informal interviews are not always the case. Ms. Young was working as
a classroom teacher and wanted to move to a librarian position within the district. She
expressed her interest in transferring to her principal before he moved to another
position, and then she sent an email to her new principal. Her new principal, not
knowing her at all, did conduct a more formal interview for the position. Ms. Young
also interviewed at other schools in the district, but she wanted to stay at her current
school.
Principal Cregg found out that her current school librarian wanted to move
from the classroom to the library at the end of the previous school year. Toward the
end of each school year, she has faculty inform her of any desire to transfer within or
outside the school by submitting an intent form. Ms. Ziegler said that intent forms are
mostly used in elementary schools where transfers from grade to grade are more
common. This transfer becomes even easier if, as in the case of Cotesworth, school
librarians are on the same contracts as teachers. Little to no paperwork is necessary to
complete the transfer, so the efforts of a transfer applicant can go a long way in
securing a school library position.

93

Also in Cotesworth, Ms. Ziegler pointed out that there is a transfer job fair,
which is only open to people currently employed by the school district. This transfer
job fair occurs before any unidistrict job fairs for outside candidates take place. Ms.
Ziegler said that it is common for a school to fill all of its open positions, including
the school librarian, with transfer hires from Cotesworth and to not review outside
candidates at all.
The finalization process for transfer hires is much less effort as compared to
new hires in Cotesworth. Ms. Young had minimal contact with HR; she just needed to
register her new school library certificate with them and the transfer was complete:
“[My principal] let them know I was changing positions. That’s pretty standard for
the county, the principal just notifies [HR] there’s a change.” Ms. Ziegler agreed that
the process was easy and there was not much contact necessary.
4.2.4 Cotesworth Case Summary
In Cotesworth School District, the district administration gives principals
almost complete autonomy in the recruiting and hiring of school librarians. The
school district library supervisor and her superior, the Director of IT, have almost no
involvement in the recruiting and hiring processes. This autonomy is noted even
before recruiting begins, in the allotment for positions in a school. The district allows
principals to determine whether they will include a school library position in their
budget, or use that funding for a different position in the school. Recruiting is also
done at the building level using the word-of-mouth tactic almost exclusively.

94

Recruiting is of little concern because participants in the district indicated that there is
a surplus of candidates for available positions. How individuals schools conduct
hiring varies (some schools choose to use hiring panels and some do not), but is
nearly always completed at just the building level. Principals can determine whether
to conduct hiring on their own or in partnership with others at the district level.
Transfer hires in the district were relatively common, as those in the district were
often the first to find out about open positions through informal inquiries to others
and the use of word-of-mouth. Overall, the district puts decision-making mostly at the
building level without input from district-level offices, making it’s governance
entirely site-based and decentralized.

95

4.3 Maine North School District
Maine North School District is located in the East South Central U.S. Census
Division. It is a county district incorporating a major metropolitan area, and the U.S.
Census categorizes it as urban in population and density. Further demographic details
about the district and its students are in Figures 4.3 and 4.4.
I chose this district for participation in this study from the group of school
districts in which the library supervisor had little involvement in the hiring of school
librarians and there was a low to medium number of people or groups involved
overall in the recruiting and hiring processes.
The state in which Maine North is located requires that every elementary and
secondary school have a certified librarian to maintain the school library.
Certification requirements state that a school librarian must have a Master of Library
Science. However, there are numerous stipulations that provide for provisional
employment of teachers on a temporary basis while working toward their MLS.

Participants


Mr. Reynolds is the library supervisor of Maine North. At the time of his
interview, he had held that position for 18 years. He has experience as a
library supervisor, school librarian, and classroom teacher in other districts
before coming to Maine North.



Ms. Clark is a staffing specialist in Human Resources. She has a PhD in
Educational Leadership and a Master of Reading Education. At the time of her
interview, she had been in Human Resources for 10 years and had worked in
Maine North for almost 20 years. She held multiple positions in Human
Resources before becoming a staffing specialist.



Ms. Bender is a school librarian at a high school in Maine North, and it was
her second year at the time of her interview. She has 14 years of experience as
a school librarian and had worked for a few years as a district cataloger. She
has a Master of School Library Media and has National Board Certification.



Ms. Johnson is a school librarian who was in her fifth year at a Maine North
high school at the time of her interview. She was previously a high school

97

English teacher. She has her Master of Library Media Education, and the
district hired her provisionally for her position one year before finishing her
degree.


Ms. Standish is a school librarian at a Maine North elementary school. She
had been in her position for just over a year at the time of her interview. She
has a Master of Library Media Education. Her only other teaching experience
was as a substitute in the school district before she was hired as a librarian.



There were no principals who had recently hired school librarians that were
available or willing to participate in this study.

4.3.1 Recruiting
According to Mr. Reynolds, Maine North has an ample number of candidates
in a pool every year. He said that some of these individuals stay in the pool year after
year, waiting for a position to open up in the district. Mr. Reynolds attributes the
strength of this candidate pool in part to having one of the highest salaries for faculty
in the region. In his opinion, the school district is also supportive of the library
program, which makes the district attractive. He also referenced the state law, which
requires each school to have a certified school librarian and, though there have been
exceptions, Mr. Reynolds believes that the district has attempted to uphold the
requirement as much as possible. Additionally, school-based councils and principals
sometimes decide to have a library aide, as well, which can be very attractive to an
applicant. He could only recall being understaffed at the beginning of the school year

98

once in his 18 years in his position as the supervisor, and that was only in one school
where the principal and school were having trouble finding a person who was the
“right fit.”
Mr. Reynolds stated that word-of-mouth is how a number of potential
applicants or transfer hires from within the district end up speaking with him. He
indicated that principals are very aware of his position in the school district, in part
because of some of his other duties with textbooks, curriculum resources, and
technology. He said teachers often contact him after speaking with their principals or
their school’s librarian and express interest in becoming a school librarian. Those
building-level individuals often refer interested teachers to Mr. Reynolds, who then
discusses possibilities with them, both for getting their certificate for school
librarianship and the available positions in the district. Mr. Reynolds also stated that
he often finds that principals, when they know they have a school librarian retiring or
transferring, will have a teacher or librarian “waiting in the wings” to fill a position.
No job opening is posted, and so these positions are filled either by the efforts of the
transferring candidate, through “word-of-mouth,” or a combination of the two.
In Maine North School District, Ms. Clark in HR was very clear about the
actions the district takes toward posting job advertisements:
We post our positions on our website and the [State] Department of
Education’s website. Those are the only places that get updated perpetually.
We are exploring alternate ways to advertise our positions, but right now, it’s
just on our application site and then the [State] Department of Education.
There’s nothing done specifically for librarians. They’re on the list posted
along with the other positions.

99

Other participants in Maine North School District made no comments to support or
contradict this process.
In addition to job postings, Ms. Clark talked about attending multidistrict job
fairs at universities where new graduates are entering the field of education. However,
she stated that specific recruiting for school librarians is often not the focus. HR is not
purposefully in contact with the departments or colleges granting degrees in library
science and mostly work with colleges of education. She said they would like to be in
touch with library departments, but that there is no specific plan in place to do so. The
library supervisor, Mr. Reynolds, said that he does not visit job fairs or pre-service
programs for school librarians. He does have a relationship with the local university
and is invited to guest lecture on occasion. When visiting these classes, students may
ask him about getting a job and look for suggestions or tips, but he did not mention
doing these visits for recruiting purposes. It is more an opportunity to share his
experiences with pre-service individuals.
Regarding the evaluation of recruiting tactics in the district, Ms. Clark in HR
mentioned a number of ways in which recruiting processes might be changed. At the
time of her interview in the fall, Ms. Clark mentioned that it was the time of year in
which they evaluate their recruiting efforts and decide what changes need to be made
for the upcoming recruiting season in the spring. She mentioned specifically that she
wanted to be more intentional regarding the district’s efforts for recruiting school
librarians, as they have had to be more creative in recent years, due to a decrease in

100

the number of available applicants. Her efforts on being more intentional focused on
the fact that their efforts in recruiting were not laid out in a specific plan, but were
mostly reactionary to communication with local universities that have school library
certification programs and minor efforts to reach out to graduates of those programs
each spring.
While recruiting is not a concern overall, the library supervisor, Mr. Reynolds,
did mention minority representation as an issue in recruiting. He has been working
with human resources to pay more attention to recruiting minority candidates, as they
are not represented in the population of school librarians. He was the only participant
in any of the school districts to mention this as a concern in the processes of
recruiting and hiring.
4.3.2 Hiring
In Maine North School District, applicants are required to fill out a general
application before being considered for a position. Ms. Standish, a librarian, stated
that the application she completed was for a K-12 school library position; she
believed any school looking to hire a school librarian could review her application
and send her a request for an interview.
Once applications are complete, HR reviews them to make sure that the
applicant meets the qualifications before they can become a part of the candidate pool.
In Maine North, HR first considers whether a person is qualified to be a school
librarian. Ms. Clark in HR stated: “We are going to entertain any applicant who is

101

minimally qualified. If we have a healthy pool we can start making decisions about
what’s most appropriate for a school setting.” In describing the creation of a
candidate pool, Ms. Clark stated:
My role would be to search our applicant pool and come up with a list of
candidates for the school in need of filling a vacancy…. We screen the
applicants for minimum qualifications, then send the names of the qualified
applicants to the principals or departments, so they can see…. We send that
list of about ten people—for library, we don’t typically have ten applicants.
This list of names will usually be accompanied by an application, resume, references,
and supporting documentation, but Ms. Clark said that during peak hiring times they
may just send a school a list of names and ask the school to contact candidates for
information on their own.
Maine North is in a state that requires school librarians to be certified through
the completion of a master’s program. Ms. Clark stated that they have a number of
applicants who were previously public, university, or another type of librarian, but
because they do not have certification in K-12 school librarianship, they are not
eligible for school positions. Ms. Clark said she would like to see some kind of
provision for those individuals so that they do not have to complete the school library
certification, as they are already trained as librarians.
While there is not a provision in Maine North for other types of librarians who
already have their MLS, there is a provision for those who have already started a
school library certification program. If an individual has completed at least nine credit
hours toward certification and commits to completing the program, he/she can be

102

provisionally hired as a school librarian. When reviewing applications, Ms. Clark said
that previous experience and whether the person had completed their practicum in
Maine North were valuable indicators in getting past the initial screening process.
Once HR reviews qualifications and creates a candidate pool, the supervisor,
Mr. Reynolds, does informal and unofficial screening interviews. He conducts these
over the summer or when there is a shortage in the pool of available candidates. He
stated that these interviews are a good time for him to evaluate a candidate’s
professional needs: if a principal were to hire this candidate, what kind of support
would the library services department have to provide them? He made it clear that
these are not official interviews; he is simply looking to see if an applicant is
someone they would like to have in the candidate pool. In his time as supervisor, the
relationship with HR has changed, and he is more certain of the role he has to play in
the hiring process:
When I first came here, I was not sure if I was invading Human Resource’s
territory [in conducting screening interviews], so I tread very carefully. And
then I discovered that they wanted all the help they could get and that it was
not a territorial thing…. I almost have to remind myself and others, we are not
part of Human Resources. So we can go this far and then that is it…. By
knowing our role and staying within the boundaries of our role, it keeps us as
a good partner with Human Resources. I do not ever pick up the phone and
call, and say, “Hey, I just met this great librarian, John. You need to hire him.”
I would never do that. I would never call a principal and say I just met this
great librarian. You need to hire him. That is not my job. Now if they call me,
I might say, “Well, I have got John, and I have got Mary, and I have got Sally.
And I will send you their contact information and let me know what you think
of them.” I might do that, but it’s not my role to tell them who to hire.

103

As mentioned previously in the recruiting process, Mr. Reynolds also has
conversations with classroom teachers and other individuals in the school district who
are interested in becoming librarians. He likes to use these “interviews” as an
opportunity to understand why an individual wants to become a school librarian,
making sure that they are not trying to “get out of the classroom,” because he
considers the work of librarians to be just as involved in instruction as any teacher. If
principals contacts him directly, Mr. Reynolds may give them a list of names, but he
indicated that it does not happen very often and that principals are typically dealing
directly with HR.
During the “official” interviewing at the building level, Maine North School
District uses hiring panels almost exclusively. Ms. Clark of HR described site-based
decision-making councils that are in place in each school. If a school does not have
this council, it is because it is an alternative school and has a different governance
structure. Ms. Clark said that these councils are responsible for making decisions
from “budget to instructional program to hiring. They make recommendations and the
principal is to consult the council for any certified staffing positions.” When asked if
there were any deviations from this system of decision-making and interviewing, Ms.
Clark said that some occasions did call for alternative policies:
Anytime a [“recommendation to hire” form] comes in, it is signed by the
council or the committee that is the branch of the council; all of their names
are on it. The principal signs attesting that the site-based council has been
consulted. The accountability piece is built into the recommendation, so
should there ever be a question that form is what is looked at to see if the
principal followed the law and the policy. In some cases, I can tell you, in the

104

summer, when it’s particularly difficult to convene an entire council with
people away on vacation, they have alternate policies that give the principal
leeway to make decisions in their absence. But, again, they’re still following
the council policy by doing that.
Mr. Reynolds, the library supervisor, does not participate in any of these hiring panels.
Occasionally, the resource librarian, one of the professional staff working in the
district-level library services office, will be asked to participate, but that is not often.
His office’s participation is mostly limited to the screening interviews described
earlier.
Two of the three librarians interviewed in Maine North, who were recently
hired, confirmed this process of using a panel for interviews. Ms. Standish said that in
almost every interview she went on in Maine North, including where she was hired,
there were four to five people at each of her interviews. In one school, she only
interviewed with the principal and the resource coordinator. She attributed the lack of
a panel to the school being on a time crunch. Ms. Johnson had a similar situation at
her school, with teachers and building administrators in attendance during her
interview. However, the three teachers who were on the panel were not affiliated with
her school, but were teachers from other schools. She was not able to elaborate on
why this was the case.
During her building-level interviews, Ms. Johnson, a librarian, stated that they
were very canned and there was not much dialogue between her and the panels; it was
just question-and-answer. She said, “I think for an interview to be effective, there

105

needs to be more, which is hard, because I have to tried to do interviews, and it’s
tough.”
Mr. Reynolds indicated that he would also like to see some changes in the
content of the interviews, but emphasized an uncertainty as to whether some
principals would be able to conduct such interviews. Principals sometimes contact
him for assistance in what questions they should ask during an interview, and he had
the following to say about those interactions:
Principals call me to ask, “Can you send me some sample questions for me to
use when I interview?” and so I had my standard list of twenty questions that
they could pick ten from. Then I had this one principal and she said, “I do not
want that question of ‘Why did you become a librarian?’” And so I said,
“Okay. You want some questions? I will give you my questions from the
evaluation instrument that I have developed,” and I thought were like really
heavy hitters…. I put the disclaimer, these are really tough questions….
Looking at evaluation is part of a continuum that begins at hiring rather than
after they have been hired and doing [professional development]. I am hearing
way too much of “anybody can be a good school librarian if they get enough
PD.” And I don’t think that’s true. I think we need to back up even more and
say, “well, let us help this person be successful by hiring the right people to
begin with.”
After the interviews are complete, Mr. Reynolds said that principals make the
recommendation to hire for HR, and he is happy it works this way. He stated that he
did not have anything to do with final hiring decisions and he felt that was
appropriate. Once the recommendations for hire are complete, HR does the work to
double-check certification requirements, make an offer to the final candidate, and
finalize all paperwork to complete the hire.

106

In evaluating hiring practices, Mr. Reynolds said that he was considering
comparing the process and standards for hiring based on an evaluation instrument the
district was developing:
We are almost finished with all the documentation for the librarians’
evaluation instrument here in [our state]. As I look at the exemplars in that
evaluation instrument, it seems to me that if this is the end result that we want,
then we should begin our screening [of job candidates] by asking questions
that help identify people that will give us the end result…. What would that
look like in terms of interview questions? And just for fun, which is my
sadistic fun, I sat and wrote questions based upon the evaluation instrument.
And they are pretty heavy-duty questions. So they probably need to be boiled
down some.
As mentioned earlier, Mr. Reynolds has shared these new questions with a few
principals, but only when they asked for something more rigorous than the standard
questions. There was no move to put these additional interview questions into action.
Ms. Standish, a librarian, said that one factor she believes affects hiring in
Maine North is whether a candidate will be a first-year teacher or already has
experience. She stated that the process of hiring a first-year teacher is much more
involved for a school, so they may not want to hire someone who has no experience.
She said that there is more observation, coaching, and mentoring required for new
faculty, and not all schools want to have to go through that. This statement was not
verified or duplicated by anyone else in the school district.
4.3.3 Transfer Hires
In Maine North School District, hiring transfers from within the district was a
common practice. The librarian, Ms. Standish, stated, “Most school librarians in the

107

district were classroom teachers first. That is what I’ve heard at least, from the ones I
have met. They were teaching in a classroom and going to school to get their master’s,
so they already had their teacher certification.”
Mr. Reynolds indicated a trend of recruiting internally for school librarians
when there is an open position:
We still have the phenomena of principals identifying teachers that they think
would be good librarians. So that with the knowledge that their librarian may
be getting ready to retire or transfer or leave, to try to have one in the wings, if
you will, to come in and take their place. So there is recruiting going on in the
school building, but it is not being done by me.
This process of internal recruitment is encouraged by current policies in Maine North
regarding who can work in the school library. Ms. Clark of HR indicated that any
teacher who wants to become a librarian could do so with relative ease:
One of the little known facts, and this is one of the ways we recruit people,
anyone that has an existing [teaching] certificate working in one of our
schools can actually begin working as a librarian, if they have started a
program to a certain point and are willing to remain in the program, they can
begin teaching or working as a librarian. I think if more people knew that, we
might have more people who are interested.
Schools may only hire a person in this way when there are no certified librarians
available, but Ms. Clark indicated that the school district is “in that position a lot,”
which is contrary to some of Mr. Reynolds’s statements about almost always having a
ready pool of candidates for positions. Because of this predicament, Ms. Clark stated
they recruit internally with different groups, including substitutes who have a
preference for working in the library, substitutes who already hold library media

108

certification, teachers interested in obtaining certification, and library clerks who may
already be in certification programs.
Two of the librarians in Maine North found out about their current positions
through referrals by past administrators. Ms. Johnson was working on her degree and
certification to move from the classroom to the library. When her assistant principal,
someone she considers a mentor, moved to another school where a library position
was available, the assistant principal recruited Ms. Johnson to join her. While
recruited internally, Ms. Johnson is considered a partial transfer hire as defined in this
study. She had to go through the entire application and interview process, as would an
outside candidate.
Another school librarian, Ms. Bender, had a very informal interview during
her transfer process. The principal asked her to stop by during the day for a discussion,
which turned into an interview. By the end of the discussion, he offered her the
position and she accepted. Unlike other schools in the district that would have
required her to undergo a panel interview, her school is a priority school with Title I
classification. Such schools in Maine North do not require panel interviews with
school-based decision councils.
Ms. Bender found out about her previous position in the district through wordof-mouth, though she was changing from being a library aide to a certified librarian.
Her former principal knew she was planning to move into the role of librarian from
clerk and told her about the opening at the school where she currently works.

109

Regarding her transfer, she stated, “I don’t think that’s any different than any other
business. You have to know somebody.”
Mr. Reynolds, the library supervisor, noted that the frequency of transfer hires
can be a problem in his school district: “I never really know where my real vacancies
are. Because someone could be transferring over to that school across the street,
thereby creating a vacancy at the school that I thought was staffed…. I just have to
live in that grey area…”
4.3.4 Maine North Case Summary
In Maine North School District, principals have some autonomy, but there is
significant involvement at the district level in the recruiting and hiring of school
librarians. However, there were a number of instances in which there was either
miscommunication or disagreement between HR and the library supervisor on the
needs of the school district. While the library supervisor believed there to be an ample
supply of candidates for positions, HR considered there to be a shortage. HR
indicated using more recruiting tactics beyond word-of-mouth, but the library
supervisor did not participate in recruiting efforts. The hiring process was conducted
mostly at the building level. Schools in Maine North are required to site-based
decision-making councils in many aspects of their governance, according to district
policy. This council is used in each school to conduct recruiting and hiring, similar to
the hiring panels used in other districts. The library supervisor was rarely involved in
the hiring process, though occasionally someone from his office would participate in

110

interviews. Overall, while much of the hiring process is conducted at the building
level, there is some involvement of district level staff. Alternatively, the recruiting
process is conducted almost entirely at the district level, with almost no building-level
involvement.

4.4 Paris School District
Paris School District is located in the West South Central U.S. Census Division. It
is a city district that incorporates a major metropolitan area. The U.S. Census
categorizes it as urban in population and density. Further demographic details about
the district and its students are in Figures 4.5 and 4.6.
I chose this district for participation in this study as representative of the
school districts in which the library supervisor has a high number of tasks in the
hiring of school librarians and there were a high number of people or groups involved
overall in the recruiting and hiring processes.
The state in which Paris is located requires that each school in the state have a
functional school library. The specifications for staffing vary based on the school’s
grade level and the number of students in the school. For instance, a middle school
with 300 to 500 students must have either a full-time certified librarian or a half-time
librarian and a full-time library aide. Certification requirements in the state in which
Paris is located requires that a school librarian must have a Master of Library Science
or an equivalent degree, such as a Master of Education in Library Media.

Participants


Ms. Vosen is the Director of Instructional Media and Library Services in Paris
School District. She had only been in this position for a few months at the
time of her interview. She has a Master of Library and Information Science
and certification in school librarianship, but no other certifications. She has
previous experience as an elementary classroom teacher and nearly 15 years
experience as a school librarian. She has spent all of her career in Paris School
District.



Ms. Zorn was the previous supervisor for library services in Paris School
District. She was initially contacted to be a part of this study, but had left for a
position outside the school district and was not interviewed for this study. Ms.
Zorn had been the library supervisor for more than 15 years and had worked
for Paris School District for nearly 40 years, according to Ms. Vosen. Though
I was not able to interview her, she is included in this list because of the many
times she was mentioned by the participants in the study.

113



Mr. Parsons is the Director of Certified Talent in Human Resources. He is
responsible for working on the hires of certified personnel, including
librarians. He has been with the school district for more than 20 years. At the
time of his interview, he had been in this position for two years and was in his
fifth year in Human Resources.



Ms. Abbott is an elementary school librarian in Paris School District. She had
been at her school for five years at the time of her interview, though she had
been in the district for seven years. At her current school, she was a
kindergarten teacher before transferring to the position of school librarian. She
was a school librarian for two years while she earned a Master of Library and
Information Science, which she had just finished before her interview.



Ms. Bourne is an elementary school librarian who had just recently earned a
Master of Library and Information Science and was in her first year at her
school at the time of her interview. She has previous experience working in
the public library.



Ms. Conklin is an elementary school librarian who was in her first year at her
school at the time of her interview. She has a Master of Library and
Information Science, with previous experience working in an academic library
and high school library in another school district.



Ms. Landy is an elementary school librarian in Paris and was in her second
year in her school and the district at the time of her interview. She has a

114

Master of Library and Information Science, but no other prior experience in
libraries or education.


There were no principals who had recently hired school librarians that were
available or willing to participate in this study.

4.4.1 Recruiting
In Paris School District, Mr. Parsons in HR considers the position of school
librarian to be at a critical shortage, superseded only by special education. He stated
that it was a problem mirrored overall in his district by elementary positions of all
varieties, for which the district makes a number of emergency hires each year. He did
not give a reason for this shortage and stated that he needed to do more investigation
in the area, as he is new to his position in HR. District library supervisor, Ms. Vosen,
attributed the shortage in part due to salary. The state in which Paris is located has
lower-than-average salaries for teachers as compared with neighboring states.
According to Ms. Vosen, they “lost a lot to [neighboring states]. They’re relatively
close and pay a significant amount more.” She stated that this causes their pool of
applicants to shrink significantly.
While pointing to the lower salaries as a problem for the district, Ms. Vosen
did indicate a one thing that draws school librarians to apply. Paris School District is
in a state that does not have a large number of districts with supervisors. The
supervisor, Ms. Vosen, indicated that Paris “attracts the most applicants, because
[they have] structure that other districts don’t have. A lot of times [librarians in other

115

districts] report to their principals who report to the superintendent. They’re on their
own.”
Paris School District has attempted to turn the generally informal process of
word-of-mouth recruiting into a slightly more formal process. Mr. Parsons in HR
created a recruiting program (the catchy name of which cannot be shared for
confidentiality reasons), which allows building-level employees to recommend
specific individuals for available positions. Current employees use the program to
submit names to HR, who can then follow up with those individuals. Mr. Parsons
stated that the process is particularly helpful for positions with a critical shortage,
under which he believes school librarians fall.
The program includes an internally editable document for staff, which allows
employees to inform HR of highly qualified individuals who might be interested in
working for Paris School District. The program is not just for librarians, but all levels
of staff in the district. Mr. Parsons of HR stated that current employees who provide
“a certain number of leads will get a token of our appreciation…. I think the first year
when we had no money to give tangible gifts, we would send a handwritten letter to
the [the employee’s] direct supervisor, letting that direct supervisor know that they
were really contributing to the field of education, which is actually part of their
evaluation.”
In Paris School District, Mr. Parsons of HR made no mention of job postings
on the district’s website for open positions. He stated, “We have put ourselves in Ed
Week. Anything that is educationally renowned.” Mr. Conklin, a school librarian,

116

reiterated this fact: “The newspaper ads seemed to be more prevalent, and I think they
had more big announcements about the job fairs. I want to say there was even a
special classified section one time before school started that listed all the job
openings.”
Another librarian, Ms. Bourne, stated that job listings online were not readily
available: “My understanding, when I applied [was that] they had about five openings,
but they didn’t have anything posted on the website.” She also felt that the district
relied on word-of-mouth recruiting over advertising and that advertising the district
did completely online was ineffective:
It seems like they’re not really interested in recruiting librarians. It seems that
anytime there is an opening, they go about it telling their current librarians
that they’re hiring [and asking] if they know anybody…. To me, that seems
kind of silly, because there is a library school [at the state university]….
They’re missing out on a pool of qualified candidates by doing this friends
and family-only hiring process. Just toss it up on the website, and if
everybody who applies is a dud, who cares? No big deal. You tried it.
Ms. Bourne only found out about a school library opening in Paris School District
through a friend while she was in the MLS program at the state university. Many of
the students in her program were teachers in Paris School District, and they were
always “talking about how great their jobs were and I was like, I want to [work]
there!”
Ms. Landy applied to a school library position in Paris through what she
described as a slightly vague job listing. She stated it was somewhat odd, in that the
posting was for a generic position as a librarian and did not list any specifications

117

about the school, grade level, or anything else. Until the principal at the school where
she was eventually hired contacted her, she had no idea what jobs were available and
for which positions she was being considered. She stated that at some point the
district did start posting positions on a local university’s library jobs listserv, but she
did not attend that university.
Although Paris School District does have a shortage of applicants for school
library positions and they do attend multidistrict job fairs, they do not attend them for
school library vacancies; they only attend for other teaching positions. Mr. Parsons of
HR specifically mentioned a number of other strategies, but attending job fairs was
not one of them. Recruiting is newly under his jurisdiction this year, and he stated
that they “basically just go to university career fairs for teachers and hope that [school
library] candidates come to us.”
Though it was not mentioned by HR, the recently hired librarian, Mr. Conklin,
did mention attending a unidistrict job fair for Paris School District. The school
district did not advertise that there were librarian positions open at the job fair, but he
decided to attend anyway. He spoke with a number of schools and handed out his
resume before running into the previous director of library services, Ms. Zorn. Ms.
Zorn was able to give Mr. Conklin a list of schools at the job fair that had library
positions open. Meeting Ms. Zorn was “lucky,” as he had not known she would be
there, and no one else was providing a list of openings for librarians. Mr. Conklin
stated, “If I did not have [that list], it would have been me walking up and asking
[each individual school] if there were openings.”

118

In Paris School District, the library supervisor, Ms. Vosen, stated that the
district had relationships with two local universities with graduate programs for
school library certification. She often has conversations with the faculty at those
institutions, and they keep her abreast of candidates they believe will be applying and
those whose applications she might want to consider. Being new to her position, Ms.
Vosen said that her predecessor, Ms. Zorn, spoke at several of the classes about what
it is like to be a school librarian, “which helps develop a relationship with those
candidates.”
In addition to recruiting through visits to the local universities, Ms. Vosen said
that in the past there had been cohorts of teachers and other staff from Paris who were
sent to get their certification from those university programs. However, she said there
had been no recent cohorts created, and she did not foresee any upcoming push from
the district to encourage other certified staff to become librarians.
Regarding the evaluation of recruiting processes, Mr. Parsons in HR stated
that he began his position during the middle of the recruiting and hiring season and
had not yet had a chance to reflect on the recruiting process; however, he indicated at
the time of his interview that he thought he should be doing it. He also stated that he
would like to develop more goals and metrics for HR to see if they were meeting their
current goals and fulfilling the mission of the school district, but those measures were
not currently in place.

119

4.4.2 Hiring
The online application for Paris School District is a general one. The librarian,
Ms. Landy, said that there was no place to specify school, grade level, or any other
preferences in one’s application. Mr. Conklin said this process differed from other
school districts he applied to in the area. In other districts, he was able to specifically
apply to schools, an element of the application he preferred over just becoming a part
of a general candidate pool. He felt that he had to spend much more time contacting
principals directly in Paris, because there was no other way for him to indicate his
interest in a particular school. Other than the drawback he identified, he stated that the
online application process was straightforward and easy to complete.
In Paris School District, they have one of the more involved screening
processes of the districts in this study. It consists of three parts: an informal screening
interview, a data exercise for teachers, and a verbal example of a lesson taught over
the phone. Interestingly, Mr. Parsons of HR did not mention that the screening
interview is a part of the hiring process for school librarians. In speaking with others
in the district, it became apparent that the screening interview was entirely informal
and was done at the library supervisor’s discretion. While talking about the hiring
process, Ms. Vosen reiterated that she had just recently become the district library
supervisor and that all of the librarians who participated in the study had been hired
during Ms. Zorn’s tenure as the library supervisor. The librarians Bourne, Conklin,
and Landy all participated in a screening interview with Ms. Zorn. Ms. Landy said
that her interview with Ms. Zorn was over the phone and was specifically tailored to

120

her, as she did not have a background in education before taking a position in Paris.
This interview was both important and reassuring to Ms. Landy, as she had some
reservations about moving into the school library. But Ms. Landy stated that Ms. Zorn
had convinced her she would have the support she needed to succeed in that setting.
Mr. Conklin had a similar experience. He had a friend who already worked in Paris
School District, who recommended he speak with Ms. Zorn. When he called to let her
know he was interested in working in the school district, they spoke at length about
his work experience and his philosophy of school libraries. He stated that it was an
informal conversation, but about halfway through he realized he was actually being
interviewed.
Ms. Bourne and Ms. Landy both discussed the involvement of the previous
library supervisor, Ms. Zorn, in informal screening interviews. Both Ms. Bourne and
Ms. Landy stated their awareness of Ms. Zorn passing their names off to principals
who later contacted them for interviews. Ms. Bourne said that she believed knowing
and working with Ms. Zorn during the screening process is the reason she obtained a
position as a school librarian. She stated that the school district wants applicants to
complete everything online, “but unless you have someone who can hook you up with
a principal directly, not much happens.” With HR not mentioning the supervisorconducted screening interviews, and Ms. Bourne’s statement that most of the
application process was completed online, it is unclear how informal the screening
process the interviews are. Regardless, principals contact Ms. Vosen, and previously
Ms. Zorn, for recommendations of individuals to interview, so the creation of a

121

candidate pool is at least an informal part of the hiring process. One librarian said that
Ms. Zorn was integral to the process during this stage because she had “a good finger
on the pulse of what librarian should go where and why.”
While the library supervisor may be conducting informal screening interviews,
HR manages two official screening processes for applicants: a data writing exercise
and a mock lesson plan over the phone. There was a great deal of variation on the
protocol and processes of these two exercises, with some librarians completing the
exercises to become a part of a candidate pool and other librarians completing them
after interviewing with a principal, but just before getting an official job offer. Mr.
Parsons in HR said that these exercises are specifically a part of the screening process,
but they are not a “screening in, whether this is an excellent candidate. [They are] are
screening out; this person may definitely not be worth [the principal’s] time.”
These application exercises are conducted by an independent contractor with
the school district and are not conducted by the HR department. For the lesson plan,
applicants are sent materials describing the process. They are to create a five-minute
lesson plan, which they deliver to the outside contractor over the phone. Then the
contractor asks the applicant numerous questions about the lesson plan. Mr. Conklin
said the phone lesson was “a bizarre experience. I taught a lesson about narrowing
your search…. You had to pretend like the person was doing what you were doing….
It was interesting, but really strange, and I kind of stressed about it.”
Applicants complete the data exercise electronically. Mr. Parsons of HR
described the process as follows:

122

We have them complete a data writing exercise, during which they look at
some given data on a classroom of students and are asked questions about
what they would do in this situation, how does it affect their thinking…. Then
there’s a writing component, too, where we ask them to single out a particular
student and write a letter home to their parents. We are looking at their writing
skills and the personal interactions. Are they positive about the student and
then bring about some concerns? Are they dismissive?
Mr. Parsons stated that this process is the same for school librarians as it is for
teachers, because “we consider [librarians] teachers.”
The school-based interviews conducted with candidates for library positions
varied throughout the district. As the current supervisor, Ms. Vosen is sometimes
involved in those interviews, though she said that some principals choose not to invite
her to participate. In the interviews in which she was involved, she was always asked
to be an active participant. She described the difference between the questions
principals had for candidates and the questions they wanted her to ask:
[They ask,] “How many books do you think it’s appropriate to check out for
this grade? Is that normal? At this school, we check out three books.” They
wanted me to ask questions that were a little harder to see as principals. How
[candidates] handled their budget, how they worked with teachers. “What do
you do if you have a teacher that doesn’t want to work with you? What are
your strategies?” A lot of time principals didn’t know to ask those questions.
They only knew the things that they saw. A lot of times the questions from the
principal were, “What sort of activities do you do with the kids to promote
reading?” “How do you do your story times?” Mine were more specific to the
library.
Mr. Conklin said that he appreciated being interviewed by hiring panels for
schools in Paris. In particular, he liked being able to have conversations with potential
co-workers and getting more than just a top-down view from administrators of what

123

the culture is like in a school. In two of the three interviews he had in Paris, the
previous supervisor, Ms. Zorn, was on the hiring panel. In one of those interviews,
both Ms. Zorn and Ms. Vosen were on the panel, as Ms. Vosen was the individual
leaving as the school librarian to move into the district supervisor position. He said
that most of the questions were related to his philosophy of how a school library
program should be. Rather than focusing on logistics or metrics, he spent most of his
interview talking about what the library should look and feel like to a student, how he
would work with other teachers in the school, and how the library would be an open
and inviting place for all students in the school.
When Ms. Landy was interviewed for her position, it was only with the
principal. The principal mentioned that he wanted to have the exiting librarian there,
but she was not able to attend. To substitute for this, he had the previous librarian
send Ms. Landy a list of questions for her to answer in written format, which both the
former librarian and the principal then reviewed. She said that the questions were
most focused on teaching and only a few questions dealt with the school library. She
realized that some of the questions were specifically tailored to her experience, as she
did not have any prior education experience. She was given a tour of the library
during her interview, but was not given much time with the collection.
Ms. Bourne, a librarian, had the previous library supervisor, Ms. Zorn, in her
interview. She said that Ms. Zorn spent a lot of time explaining things to Ms.
Bourne’s future principal during her interview: “She mostly was answering questions
about the library stuff for me, since the principal is kind of removed from that.” In

124

keeping with what Mr. Parsons of HR stated about how the school district’s needs
affect the hiring process, Ms. Bourne stated that her future principal also spent a lot of
time explaining the school’s Title I categorization, the needs of an impoverished
community, and working with students with low socioeconomic status.
As with most other school districts, decision of selection for a position in Paris
is based at the school level, according to Mr. Parsons. He said that HR is only
involved if requested, usually just for clarification or support and never actually
assisting in making a decision. As with her involvement in interviews, Ms. Vosen
said she is sometimes there to consult with principals as they make their final
selection: “A lot of times, after the applicants left, [the principal and I] would discuss
the interview. They would make their decision right there and I would know right
away.” Although she sometimes participated discussion about the candidates, the
principal made the final decision.
Mr. Parsons and Ms. Vosen’s statements were confirmed by the recently hired
librarians interviewed for this study. Ms. Abbott and Ms. Bourne both stated that the
principal was the only one involved in the process and was the one to make the final
decision, as far as they understood. When Mr. Conklin was hired, he said he was
given a tour of the library by two teachers, while Ms. Vosen and his principal
discussed his interview. When they were done discussing, they joined him in the
library and he was offered the position on the spot.
The finalization of a job offer can be somewhat complicated in the Paris
School District. They have a number of school librarians who are working on a

125

provisional status. In the words of Mr. Parsons, “We’ve had a difficult time finding
the number of high-quality candidates of [school librarians] that we need, so in some
cases we have had to petition the state to do some waivers while folks are actually
going through their program.” These individuals are typically hired only if there are
no qualified individuals applying. Being hired provisionally requires both HR and the
library supervisor to submit paperwork to the school board, who must then make a
request to the state Department of Education for a waiver for provisional employment.
Waivers can be renewed, and it is important to keep track of them, because those
seeking their degree must finish in a certain amount of time and HR must provide that
information to the state during times of accreditation. At the time of the interviews for
this study, Paris School District had approximately eight individuals working as
school librarians who were employed under a waiver. Ms. Bourne is one of them. She
found the process particularly frustrating because she already had more than one
teaching certificate; however, she still needs certification as a school librarian, so she
had to go through the additional schooling while on a provisional waiver. Ms. Bourne
said that most of the assistance she received in making sure the waiver went through
came from Ms. Vosen, the library supervisor, and not HR.
Regarding the hiring process, Mr. Parsons said that they are always in the
process of evaluating their practices. His current concern is the amount of time it
takes for applicants to go from submitting their applications, through the process of
completing the data exercise and mock lesson plan phone call, and then invited to a
school for an interview. The librarian, Ms. Bourne, indicated that this process had

126

been incredibly slow when she was applying to Paris. HR surveyed those applying for
positions, looked at the numbers, and found that the process was taking far too long.
Ms. Vosen said that HR has also approached her to change the data exercise
librarians do as a part of the screening process. As Mr. Conklin noted, the data
exercise seemed a little strange because it was geared toward teachers and not
librarians. Ms. Vosen stated that HR came to her saying, “We’ve had a couple of
comments on [the data exercise]. We would like to work with you to develop
something different for librarians.”
Ms. Vosen said she would also like to change the lesson taught over the phone
for librarians, and hopes that working with HR on the data exercise will allow her to
make that change: “Instead of having the phone lesson plan, maybe [applicants] come
in and sit down with me, instead, and I give [HR] the go ahead or say no.”
4.4.3 Transfer Hires
When discussing recruitment, Ms. Vosen mentioned that internal recruitment
supported by building-level staff is important in keeping a current pool of candidates
for librarian positions. “We do actively seek teachers. The librarians are all aware of
what would make a good librarian, so oftentimes they’ll come to us and say, ‘I’ve got
this teacher who would really be great. Would you talk to them?’” She stated that
beyond such casual conversations, there is, presently, no real push for teachers to
become librarians.

127

Ms. Abbott was a classroom teacher in Paris before becoming a school
librarian there. She and numerous other school librarians in the district have been
hired through such internal recruitment:
The way that I’m understanding it, the majority of the pool of librarians that
PSD picks from are former classroom teachers of PSD…. They don’t do a lot
of hiring outside of the school district, only because there are usually qualified
people within the district that they can choose from…. At any given time,
there are usually several people in the district who are working on becoming a
school librarian that [Paris has] to pull from.
Ms. Abbott could only recall three or four of the hires in recent years being from
outside the school district. In Ms. Abbott’s case, she was recruited to librarianship
through the help of a colleague. She was interested in becoming a librarian because of
the encouragement of Ms. Kramer, the librarian at her school, a good friend of hers.
Ms. Kramer found out from the district library services office that scholarships were
being offered to two Paris School District employees to attend the state university to
receive their MLS with school library certification and informed Ms. Abbott. Ms.
Abbott was a recipient of that scholarship and, while she was in graduate school, Ms.
Kramer transferred to another school district. Ms. Kramer had spoken with the
principal about Ms. Abbott before switching districts, recommended Ms. Abbot for
hire while she was still getting her MLS, and the principal offered Ms. Abbott the
position as soon as Ms. Kramer announced her resignation.
In Paris School District, the process Ms. Abbott went through was only
slightly different because she was being transferred as a provisional employee; she
had not yet completed her certification in school librarianship. She said that HR and

128

the library services office handled all of the paperwork necessary for both her transfer
and provisional employment, which requires that certain documents are approved by
the Board of Education and then are sent to the state education agency. Nothing was
completed at the building level by her principal. She said this all went seamlessly,
though, and the hardest part was moving the materials from her classroom to the
library.
4.4.4 Paris Case Summary
In the Paris School District, there was both formal and informal involvement
of the library supervisor in the recruiting and hiring of school librarians. Paris has a
shortage of candidates for library positions and HR outlined a number of specific
tactics used to address this shortage, including the formalization of a word-of-mouth,
or referral, recruiting program. Despite the shortage of candidates, neither the library
supervisor nor HR spoke about collaborative opportunities for recruiting between
their two offices. The hiring process is conducted mostly at the building level, but the
library supervisor indicated that she had a number of opportunities to serve on hiring
panels and advise principals throughout the hiring process. Whether principals
involve the library supervisor in hiring is a choice left up to them. There is no
requirement for them to involve anyone at the district level when hiring a librarian.
Transfer hires were common in the district, with many of the librarians having been
former classroom teachers, some of whom were hired provisionally before
completing their LIS programs. Overall, the district had a mix of decision-making and

129

involvement between the building and district levels throughout the recruiting and
hiring processes.

130

4.5 Red Rock School District
Red Rock School District is located in the South Atlantic U.S. Census Division
(in a different state than Cotesworth School District). It is a county district that
incorporates city and rural areas. The U.S. Census categorizes it as midsize suburban
in population and density. Further demographic details about the district and its
students are in Figures 4.7 and 4.8.
I chose this district for participation in this study from the group of school
districts in which the library supervisor completed a high number of tasks in the
hiring of school librarians and there were a low number of people or groups involved
overall in the recruiting and hiring processes.
The state in which Red Rock is located requires that each school in the state
have a functional school library. Each school must have a regularly available,
certified school librarian. Certification requires a Master of Library Science or
Instructional Technology from an institution that meets the state standards for
certification programs.

Participants


Ms. Dodgson is a principal at an elementary school. She had been the
principal at her school for seven years and worked in the school district for
more than 20 years at the time of her interview. She has previous experience
as an assistant principal, teacher specialist, and a classroom teacher. She has
her teaching certificate and a Master in Supervision Administration.



Ms. Grant is a Human Resources Staffing Specialist in Red Rock. She had
been in her position for two years at the time of her interview, after receiving
a Master of Human Resources. She has worked in the district for 10 years,
serving eight of those years as an elementary classroom teacher.



Mr. Hammond is the principal at a joined middle and high school where
there is a school librarian for each set of grade levels. He was new to his
position at the school at the time of his interview, but had previously served as
a principal in another school district.

132



Ms. Malcolm was in her first year as a full-time school librarian in her middle
school at the time of her interview. She had previously served as a part-time
librarian in the same school for three years and in three other schools, all in
Red Rock School District. She has a Master of Library Science and previous
experience as an elementary classroom teacher. Most of her teaching
experience is in Red Rock School District, though she had worked in other
districts before she became a school librarian.



Ms. Murphy is the Supervisor of Library Services for Red Rock School
District. At the time of her interview, she had been in her position for eight
years. She has previous experience as a classroom teacher and a school
librarian. She has a Master of Library Science and a Certificate of
Administration. Though she has other work experience, all of her educational
experience has been in Red Rock.



Ms. Nedry was in her second year as a high school librarian in her school, but
her fourth year as a librarian in Red Rock School District. She had previous
experience as a classroom teacher in Red Rock before becoming a librarian.
At the time of her interview, she was still in the graduate program getting her
Master of Library Science, but her concentration was not in school libraries,
but rather e-government. Once she completes her degree, she does not intend
to stay in education.



Ms. Sattler is an elementary school librarian. She was in her second year at
her school as the librarian and, before moving to the library position, was an

133

elementary teacher for ten years in the same school. She has a second master’s
degree in instructional technology; her first master’s degree was in early
childhood education. As an educator, she has only worked in Red Rock
School District.
4.5.1 Recruiting
Red Rock School District has a low appeal for potential applicants, based
primarily on a competitive compensation problem with nearby districts. When asked
to speculate on why Red Rock School District had a shortage of applicants and why
there were school library positions open at the beginning of the school year, low
salaries was the first reason cited by nearly all individuals in Red Rock. Participants
said that salaries in the district are far too low; employees have not received a raise in
over five years. According to the library supervisor, Ms. Murphy, they are in the top
20 percent of school districts in student family income and the bottom 20 percent in
teacher pay. Ms. Nedry, a librarian, stated, “When I tell [other people] I work for Red
Rock School District, you can just see this look on their face.”
In Red Rock School District, the posting of ads and the screening process is
more rigid; word-of-mouth recruiting is not a common practice. Ms. Grant from HR
said that occasionally a principal will identify a candidate for a position of which HR
was not aware, having found a person on their own through word-of-mouth and other
techniques. However, this is not common and happens only five or so times each
hiring season. Ms. Grant said that, typically, such hiring practices happen in the

134

elementary school and usually because an individual was a substitute teacher or a
field study student. Ms. Grant did not specifically mention this happening for school
library positions. No other individual in Red Rock School District mentioned wordof-mouth as a recruiting tactic.
Ms. Grant noted that the process of posting jobs for recruitment was in
transition. They have an application system that they use locally, which includes job
postings online. This system feeds directly into another, which offers educational job
postings nationwide. Beyond those regular resources, she had begun trying new
tactics:
Beside posting it to our website, I’m just getting into posting into the actual
universities. Yesterday, I was able to post to [one local university]. Part of it is
because the person who used to do [job postings] is no longer in this
department; it is discovering where she had accounts and what she did.
The district library supervisor, Ms. Murphy, stated that she serves in an advisory role
in this stage of recruitment. After saying this, though, her statement did not indicate
any real involvement in the process of posting job ads. She plays an “advisory role”
in the recruiting process, but then clearly stated that she “doesn’t get into the
specifics.”
Ms. Grant also had much to say about using multidistrict job fairs for
recruiting. She gave a detailed account of the job fairs HR attends. While taking over
this responsibility of recruiting from someone else, there already existed a list of
criteria for job fairs (e.g., candidate availability, degree-granting specialties, job fair
attendance) and the results of HR’s attendance at a job fair (e.g., feedback, number of

135

persons interviewed and/or hired). According to Ms. Grant, they attend a number of
multidistrict job fairs. One fair includes districts recruiting from the entire state, while
other job fairs are at different universities. In attending those job fairs, Ms. Grant
noted that other school districts are sometimes able to conduct interviews and offer
job contracts at the job fair, which she regrets that Red Rock is not able to do. She
indicated that this has to do with how the budget is approved by the local government
and then the school board, noting that such things were never complete at the time
that multidistrict job fairs are held, which leaves HR unable to offer contracts at such
a time.
Ms. Grant specifically mentioned that she had not been to any job fairs with
Ms. Murphy, the library supervisor. Ms. Grant attributed this to the fact that she was
relatively new to her position in HR. However, she also noted that there is a job fair at
a nearby state university with a library degree-granting program. Ms. Murphy had
told her the district does not attend that job fair, though Ms. Grant did not know why.
Ms. Grant mentioned, “If I could take Ms. Murphy with me, that would be beneficial,”
because they could do both pre-screening interviews for school library candidates at
the same time (more will be discussed on the pre-screening process in the section on
“Hiring”). Additionally, Ms. Grant stated that they are trying to expand their efforts to
participate in job fairs because of the number of library positions that remained open
after the school year had begun. She mentioned both making more direct contact with
universities that offer programs for school librarians and attending large job fairs in
neighboring states as future tactics she would like to do for recruiting. Ms. Murphy,

136

the library supervisor, confirmed that HR was heavily involved in attending job fairs
to recruit candidates and that she had attended in the past, but no longer found it
worth the amount of time necessary to attend:
The events I’ve been to did not have library as their [focus]…. If there are
other colleges that [recruiters] are going to and they know there is a library
program, I would be more than happy to go but I don’t know what their
schedule is and why they go to which colleges, so I don’t really know how it
hits their radar. If it is a college that has that program, I would love to go.
Ms. Grant in HR said that pre-service visits to the nearby institutions granting
school library certification have not been a part of their recruiting tactics in previous
years. Ms. Grant said that she would like to change this, but she did not specifically
mention coordinating this effort with Ms. Murphy. Ms. Murphy did not mention
visiting pre-service students as a part of recruiting. A failure to make a connection
with nearby institutions was specifically a complaint of one librarian, Ms. Malcolm:
They don’t come down to [the state university]. They don’t seem to make an
effort to reach out at places where I know people are looking for jobs. When I
was in graduate school, we had supervisors from several counties come to our
classes, and we had a panel where they answered our questions. I don’t think
Ms. Murphy ever did that or has done that. That made me want to apply to
those counties that were there, because I felt I would know what I would be
getting. That would have been helpful.
In addition to more visits with students in pre-service programs, Ms. Grant
said that they would like to do something with one of the local universities to send a
cohort of teachers to a school library program, but they are only in the initial stages of
that process. The library supervisor, Ms. Murphy, made no mention of creating such a
cohort. Ms. Nedry, a recently hired librarian in the district who was formerly a

137

classroom teacher, said she started out thinking she was going to be in a cohort
sponsored by Red Rock when she began her certification program years ago. She said
the district told a group of interested individuals that classes would be held just for
them in the school district, so they would not have to commute to the university.
However, she said, “[Red Rock and the university] did not keep their promise and no
cohort was ever established.” She proceeded with the program and was the only
attendee from Red Rock. She mentioned being particularly disappointed because a
neighboring school district had successfully created a cohort for the program, and she
felt like an outsider throughout her coursework.
In evaluating the recruiting process, Ms. Grant seems to have some metrics in
place. As mentioned, HR attends a number of multidistrict job fairs at local
universities. She said that they try to look each year at how valuable attending those
job fairs is, including specifically looking at the job fairs’ attendance rates, feedback
from recruiters and participants, the number of potential candidates interviewed at a
job fair, how many put in a final application, how many of those were interviewed,
and how many of those were hired. She identified all this as data important to the
process of evaluating recruiting.
Ms. Murphy said she typically gets together with HR once a year to establish
the recruiting efforts and see what needs to be done in the hiring season. She also said
she felt HR was understaffed. When asked how she would like to change things, she
stated:

138

I’d like to be in charge of everything and just hire who I want when I want,
but that isn’t happening. I can’t think of how to change getting more recruits. I
really don’t. This is something we don’t have control over and I don’t know if
it is actually a national thing or if is just in [our state]. It just seems that there
are not a lot of people out there and I’m not sure what’s happening.

4.5.2 Hiring
As in other districts, the hiring process in Red Rock begins with an individual
submitting an online application. The application is a part of a software system HR
uses to track applicants and applications throughout the entire hiring process. The
online application requires the submission of several documents, including
certification, references, test scores, and transcripts. The library supervisor, Ms.
Murphy, also has access to this application system. She was the only supervisor to
indicate such easy access to the applications. She stated that whenever she sees
something is missing or requires more information, she could easily contact HR to get
in touch with that individual.
While in other districts the screening of applicants was left mostly to HR, if it
was completed at all, in Red Rock the library supervisor is very involved in the
process. The supervisor, Ms. Murphy, indicated that she participates in reviewing
applications as soon as they are complete. No other supervisor indicated that level of
involvement during the screening stage of the hiring process.
While screening applications, Ms. Murphy mentioned that she pays close
attention to how applicants view their future library position, particularly those
applicants who come from other states. Ms. Murphy finds that some applicants from

139

other states do not see the school library as a place where instruction occurs, but a
repository where books stored and sometimes circulated. She wanted them to
understand that in the school library they will be teaching the majority of the time and
not just checking out books and running reading programs.
Red Rock School District also has provisional employment for school
librarians. It is not something HR likes to do, but the library supervisor, Ms. Murphy,
had to push for that consideration, as they are experiencing a critical shortage and had
multiple openings for school librarians even as the school year began: “If [applicants]
weren’t all certified, [HR] didn’t want to see them and I said…. But we don’t have
anybody.” If HR is to offer provisional employment to a candidate, it must get a letter
from the candidate’s university ensuring that they are currently enrolled in the
program and that they are no more than six credits away from completing their
certification. In the case of new hires, Ms. Murphy stated that provisional
employment is not offered to individuals when there are certified people in the same
applicant pool.
Red Rock has a formal process for conducting screening interviews with
applicants. Ms. Grant said, “Anytime an applicant applies to Red Rock, school
principals are not allowed to see [the applications] right away. They’re screened
through us first.” Once applications are in the district’s system, they are reviewed by
both Ms. Grant and Ms. Murphy. Ms. Grant said that this is typical of any position for
which there is a certain area of expertise. Teachers applying for positions in music or
special education in Red Rock also have to go through a screening interview with

140

both HR and a content supervisor at the same level as Ms. Murphy. While she has
sometimes conducted these interviews in tandem with other content supervisors, Ms.
Grant said that she has never conducted a joint screening interview with Ms. Murphy.
Once an application is complete, Ms. Grant typically coordinates with Ms. Murphy to
make sure both the HR and school library interviews are conducted on the same day.
When HR screens candidates, they use the same interview questions for all
teachers, from high school math teachers to elementary teachers. Ms. Grant noted,
however, that Ms. Murphy has provided HR with a different set of questions specific
to librarians, which should be used for the HR screening interview. The only other
screening interviews with different screening questions are speech language
pathologists, physical therapists, and guidance counselors.
A candidate pool is created after screening interviews are complete. Both HR
and the Office of Library Services have to approve of an applicant before they are
sent out as candidates to schools as a possible hire. Mr. Dodgson, a principal in Red
Rock, had the following to say about the process:
The supervisor of library sciences, when they know we have a vacancy, she’s
the one who goes through and identifies candidates for the school to interview
and she sends the names to us. We interview and either select a candidate or
ask for more names. She’s kind of the buffer between us having to go into a
database and look, look, look. She interviews them, screens them, so she’s
interviewing her top candidates to send out to schools.
When asked about whether she suggests candidates for certain schools, Ms. Murphy
made less of a point about making recommendations to principals and instead focused
on making sure positions were filled. She said that she always makes an effort to fill

141

schools with a full-time vacancy first. She then works on filling part-time and
roaming positions that work at more than one school.
With a candidate pool created, the next step in the hiring process is the
building-level interview. Ms. Murphy does sometimes participate in candidate
interviews after her screening interview, if the principal requests it. However,
participation does not happen very often. She is okay with not participating in the
site-based interviews because she has already talked with the candidates, has a good
idea of what their abilities are, and has approved sending them out to interview with
principals.
Principal Dodgson stated that she conducts all interviews with her assistant
principal. This was the case for her most recent hire of a school librarian. Another
principal, Mr. Hammond, conducts all interviews, including those for school
librarians, on his own. He sometimes seeks a list of candidates from content
supervisors such as Ms. Murphy, but this is the only assistance he requests in the
interview process. One librarian in the district, Ms. Sattler, said that she appreciated
the one-on-one interview she had with her principal when she was hired, as it was less
intimidating than a panel interview and seemed more personal.
While Ms. Murphy, the library supervisor, is happy to let principals conduct
interviews on their own since she has screened candidates, she did talk about assisting
with the content of the interview:
I generated my own list for library interview questions with the answers. That
way if principals interview, they know what I’m looking for. When we do
interview someone, [principals] get the questions. They can choose to use

142

them or not; usually they do just so they know. At least I know they’ve gone
through me first so it’s okay if they don’t use my questions.
Principal Dodgson said that she used the questions sent by Ms. Murphy in the last
interviews she conducted for a school librarian. Another principal, Mr. Hammond,
noted that in the interviews he conducts, there is some variation to the interview as
compared with teachers. He said that all interviews begin with pedagogical questions,
and this is no different for the librarian candidates, who must express how they see
their role in the school. Beyond the standard interview, he also chooses to focus on
how the candidate will build relationships with parents and colleagues in the school’s
community.
While the building-level interviews are typically done with just principals at
their school, Ms. Murphy did note an exception. She said that one year, they had so
many library openings they brought in all of the principals to conduct interviews at
once: “We did like a rodeo and all the principals came and I was there at one
time…poor candidates. Then they sat and we interviewed [each candidate] as a group
and then we all talked to decide who would get whom.” Ms. Murphy organized the
group interview and was a part of the panels. She asked the majority of the questions
during the rodeo interviews. Once she was done with a standard set of questions,
principals were given time to ask any specific questions to each candidate.
Ms. Malcolm was one of the librarians who attended this “rodeo interview”
and corroborated Ms. Murphy’s account. Ms. Malcolm stated that it was a group
interview with a panel made up entirely of principals. When she was asked to come in

143

for an interview, she was not aware the position she was applying for would be
working at more than one school; she was just told to come in to interview for a
library position. There were six principals in attendance and she interviewed with
three groups of them, each group made up by the set of schools at which she would
potentially work. Ms. Malcolm said the experience was very stressful and that not
having any warning of the situation beforehand caused her a great deal of anxiety.
The final hiring decisions and selection of a candidate in Red Rock School
District did not always occur at the building level. For instance, Ms. Grant in HR
stated that the superintendent is sometimes involved in selection:
If it comes to a hiring decision where I may not like a candidate, the [library
supervisor] may not like a candidate, the principal likes the candidate, and
they’re pushing for the person, we will take it to the superintendent and let her
make the decision. She’s real hands-on. Also, [we are] a real close-knit,
hands-on [school district].
While not typically involved in building-level interviews, Ms. Murphy said
that principals have consulted her on selection of a candidate. She said there are
occasions where a principal will contact her about candidates, not just about who to
interview, but also for her opinion on the final hire. They are able to do this because
she screens every single person in the candidate pool; principals know she is
knowledgeable about the candidates and can give her an opinion on each of them,
having talked to them herself. When asked why some principals call to consult her
and some do not, she said:
I think it is a personality thing. Principals are used to leading so they are the
ones that make most of the decisions at their building anyway. I always take it

144

as a kudos if they call me, as opposed to not calling me being a bad thing,
because they are used to making all of those decisions every day.
Despite this level of involvement, Ms. Murphy was also the supervisor who stated,
“I’d like to be in charge of everything and just hire who I want when I want, but that
isn’t happening.”
In evaluating the hiring process, Ms. Murphy said that the process has
changed, but she did not indicate there was any current work to evaluate or change
the process currently or in the future. In particular, she worked with HR in the past to
change the job description included in ads for school librarians. Ms. Malcolm, who
went through the “rodeo interview” with multiple principals, said that she would like
to see the district do away with tactics like that, but Ms. Murphy indicated the rodeo
interview was an unusual circumstance and was not likely to be repeated unless the
district had a large number of vacancies again.
4.5.3 Transfers Hires
In Red Rock School District, where staffing currently is a problem and at the
beginning of the school year there were at least five open library positions in the
district, Ms. Grant of HR noted that recruiting internally is something she would like
to do more of, and something she does not think the district does well: “I would like
to, if possible…have a compiled list of employees who are seeking library media
certification, [so] when we have a huge shortage, they would let me put those teachers
in those areas….” Ms. Grant has used the employee newsletter to ask those seeking
school library certification to contact her and keep her updated on their progress. She

145

is able to use the certification department to see who currently has certification in
library services, but they are unable to tell her who is seeking certification. Ms. Grant
stated: “I did get a list of those offers, to see where they are, so we can track those
employees. So before they are ready to go, before we lose them to another county, we
can get our own employees on board with us.”
Ms. Sattler’s principal hired her through internal recruitment. Ms. Sattler was
a classroom teacher working on her MLS when the librarian in her school retired midyear. Her principal called her in, knowing she was working on her library certification,
and informed her that he would like her to take the position. There was some question
of when she would start, because the former librarian left in the middle of the school
year, but Ms. Sattler always knew that the position was reserved for her. “I guess I
knew…it was going to be a definite, but I didn’t sign anything to make it official. But
the principal told me from that first conversation that I was definitely his first choice.”
The reason the principal considered moving her mid-year was because, in Ms.
Sattler’s words, “Human Resources can put somebody in and go above the principal,
and he didn’t want that to happen and me miss out on the position.”
Ms. Nedry, a librarian, was vocal about wanting to transfer to the school
library, but there was not a position at her school, her principal did not want her to
transfer, and the library services office was at first unwilling to work with her until
she had obtained certification. However, when the principal was forced to make cuts
in staffing, the principal was much more willing to let Ms. Nedry go and worked with
library services to help Ms. Nedry get the transfer she wanted.

146

For other districts, there was very little, if any, involvement of district-level
offices in the transfer process. In Red Rock, HR and the library supervisor had some
involvement in the transfer process. As stated earlier, Ms. Sattler, a librarian, said that
when there was a librarian position open at her school, her principal felt rushed to fill
it, in fear that HR would step in and fill the position for him. In no other district did
anyone talk of such intervention by HR.
It is not just HR that is involved from the district level in Red Rock. The
supervisor, Ms. Murphy, also takes part in placing people for transfers. Principal
Hammond described a situation in which he was not a part of the transfer process at
all, but his school librarian was placed solely by Ms. Murphy:
This is only my second year [at this school]. The [school librarian] was placed
by the supervisor. Long story, but the previous [school librarian] resigned
because she moved out of state. My predecessor cut the position. Realizing we
needed two, the supervisor placed [a temporary, part-time librarian at another
school] permanently here for a full time position. That wasn’t something that
was done at the site, it was done at the district level…. I was told what was
happening. It was really the only way to get a second librarian here, since my
predecessor had cut the position. Ms. Murphy had this person who was
available, and she told me I’d like her. I do, she’s great. But it was kind of like,
you take this person or you don’t have a [librarian]…. Normally, principals
have full opportunities to take a voluntary transfer, so librarians from other
schools have an opportunity to transfer here. Or if I wanted to go to open
market or find a new hire, I could do that too. This is just a screwy situation.
While Mr. Hammond made the situation seem completely abnormal, such
interventions have happened before in Red Rock. Ms. Nedry, a librarian, is in her
second library position in the school district. For her first transfer, she was trying to
move to a library position from a teaching position in Red Rock. She had informed

147

Ms. Murphy of her plans and had been persistent in following up on any available
positions. She related the story this way:
My supervisor of library media, she came into my then-school. She came in
and said, “Here’s the deal. I have four schools. I’m going to be here for fifteen
minutes. I need to know in fifteen minutes what school you want to go to, if
you want to be a media specialist.” Pressure! I used my knowledge of what I
[already knew], because I couldn’t just jump on a computer and do research. I
wanted to. In my head, I kind of had an idea of the area and the
populations…so I basically made a snap decision on my own thoughts and
feelings about the place.
Another librarian in the district stated that such transfers are not abnormal in Red
Rock, and she attributed most of it to the supervisor’s tactics:
It really seems like a matter of favorites…. There’s an example of a woman
who left [Red Rock] to go to [another district]. She wasn’t getting what she
was told she would get at her interview there, so she came back to Red Rock
and Ms. Murphy immediately gave her job as an itinerant [a floating librarian
that may be placed at more than one school], which seems fair enough to me.
But between her first and second year, she was moved back to her regular
position at a really sought after job, which really feels like favoritism to me.

4.5.4 Red Rock Case Summary
In Red Rock School District, there was a great deal of involvement of the
district-level offices in the recruiting and hiring of school librarians. HR is heavily
involved in recruiting in numerous different ways, often enlisting the support and
participation of the library supervisor. There seems to be a break in communication
about what the district is currently doing in recruiting and ways in which HR believes
the district and the library supervisor could do more. In the hiring process, the library
supervisor and HR are both very involved, with each one conducting screening

148

interviews of candidates before principals can select them for interviews.
Additionally, both HR and the library supervisor are involved in transfer hires, as
well. In some instances, it is the library supervisor shifting people from one school to
another, rather than relying on the efforts of employees. Overall, the district level
offices are very involved in the recruiting and hiring processes in these districts.

4.6 Sunville School District
Sunville School District is located in the Mountain U.S. Census Division. It is
a city district that incorporates a metropolitan area. The U.S. Census categorizes it as
large urban in population and density. Further demographic details about the district
and its students are in Figures 4.9 and 4.10.
I chose this district for participation in this study as the control site. In this
district, the library supervisor indicated no regular responsibilities in the hiring
process and there are an unknown number of people involved in the hiring process.
The state in which Sunville is located requires that each school in the state to
have a functional school library. The requirements for being a school librarian include
either having a Master of Library Science or having a teaching certificate and passing
an exam to earn an endorsement for library media. There is no graduate level school
library preparation program that is local to Sunville, either in the area or in the state.
The only option for a local individual to earn certification through a degree would be
to attend an online program.

4.6.1 Recruiting
The library supervisor, Ms. Searle, said that in Sunville, recruiting is not very
heavy because of a lack of available positions. Both librarians interviewed, Ms.
Corazon and Ms. Kaneda, attributed this lack of available positions to school
librarians having very low turnover in their district, with many individuals staying in
their positions until retirement.
Principal Cassie found recruiting unnecessary the last time he had an opening
for a school librarian, stating he had a large number of applicants. He attributed this
in part to the high appeal of his school: the building is new and has a “breathtaking,
very well furnished and equipped library, both from a technology standpoint and
book resources.” Coupled with the administration providing funding for both a

152

librarian and a library aide at the school, this makes it a particularly appealing site, so
recruiting is not as needed.
The supervisor, Ms. Searle, described the recruiting process as being very
informal, and a process in which she is not very involved. She indicated that word-ofmouth tactics happen occasionally. In her advisory capacity, she is only able to pass
on information about available candidates if a principal specifically asks for it, and
she is not always aware of available positions.
Though Ms. Searle was only sometimes involved in word-of-mouth recruiting,
the librarians in Sunville indicated heavy importance on getting information from
informal sources, as opposed to official ones. For Ms. Kaneda, it was of particular
importance because she serves more than one school. She received her first part-time
position by applying online. To be full time in the district, however, she needed to
find another complementary part-time position at another school—she and her
principal had to work together to find that position. She said, “It’s a lot of being in the
right place in the right time, the people you know, and a lot of time if you’re in the
system, that’s your best bet for getting a job.”
Ms. Corazon made a similar statement about the recruiting process, indicating
that print and online sources of information about jobs in the district are not always
reliable, because of what a principal may already have in mind for a position. She
said the process of transferring from the classroom to the school library was simple
for her, but she knows that it is not for other individuals. She had the luxury of
waiting for what she considered a desirable position as a librarian to become available

153

while she continued to work as a classroom teacher. She waited for three years until
her current position was open and acknowledged that many applicants do not have
that option.
At Principal Cassie’s school, someone else at his school referred his current
librarian to him. He stated that the previous librarian was well regarded, and so it was
known by many when she decided to leave. One individual in the school referred the
current librarian as a candidate, and she went through the entire process with other
candidates, “coming out on top.”
Though others in Sunville focused on word-of-mouth recruiting, Ms. Capa of
HR outlined a specific process and placement for recruiting through job postings on
the district’s website:
[Principals] fill out a request to advertise…, we verify the vacancy is truly
there, we send it up to budget for approval, it comes back down…. We have
our website, and it has all positions posted. Librarians are by themselves.
They’re not lumped in with elementary teachers or high schools.
When asked for clarification on whether job postings were open or specific, she stated
the applicants apply for positions at specific schools and that each posting is separate.
However, they have some difficulty with actually getting principals to follow this
procedure:
If it’s just a transfer within the school, [principals] don’t always have to
advertise, because they’re going to create a vacancy. You’re going from third
grade to fourth grade, well, it’s still going to create a vacancy and that position
will get posted. When it comes to a librarian position, it’s not the same as
teacher to teacher. We would ask the principal to advertise. What may happen
sometimes is one of the principal’s teachers is wanting to do the library
position, but they still have to go through the process and advertise it. Of

154

course, you can’t stop—people get people, you know, they want them, but
they didn’t advertise, it’s still part of the process. But what if that person
doesn’t even qualify?
In addition to word-of-mouth, the librarian, Ms. Corazon, tried using these individual
job postings to find another part-time position within the school district to bring her to
full-time status. However, she stated that the postings could be frustrating, for the
very reason that HR requires principals to post them:
We have a website that posts any openings that are happening. During the
summertime, I was diligently sending out resumes and cover letters to the
different principals…. Sometimes they have a teacher or somebody that they
are planning to hire, but they still have to put that up on the website, so that is
kind of frustrating, because it’s on the website, but they already have someone
in mind.
While Ms. Capa of HR talked at length about job postings in Sunville, there
was almost no mention of anyone attending job fairs. Ms. Capa said she has been on
recruiting trips, but only to assist the main recruiter, as recruiting is not the focus of
her position in HR. In her attendance at job fairs with the recruiter, the focus was on
special education, and school librarians were never targeted. The library supervisor,
Ms. Searle, did not mention being involved in job fairs in any way. Principal Cassie
stated that there is a unidistrict job fair offered by the district, but that he has not been
to it because he has not had any vacancies to fill.
Beyond word-of-mouth and job postings, there were no other recruitment
efforts specifically mentioned for school librarians. Since there is not a high need to
fill open positions in the district, Ms. Searle noted that no pipeline has been
established for recruiting efforts. There is not a local program for graduate students

155

studying school libraries nearby, and at the time of her interview she did not see any
concerted efforts made to combat this lacking pipeline. Ms. Capa said there are
currently no plans to change or evaluate current recruiting processes. She did not see
this as a need, as school librarian candidates are not at a shortage, in her opinion, and
there are much more critical areas the district needs to focus on, such as special
education.
4.6.2 Hiring
In beginning the discussion on hiring, Ms. Searle noted that buildings with a
certain student population size in Sunville are required to have a full-time school
librarian and not a library aide. She said that principals will sometimes try to get
around this requirement, but HR stops such actions and assists in making sure
libraries are properly staffed with certified individuals.
Ms. Capa of HR mentioned the importance of applicant efforts in looking for
a position in the school district. She strongly encourages people who are applying in
Sunville to reach out to principals during the process. She ensures that they first
complete an application, but she insists that applicants try to contact principals so the
principals can “put a face to the name.” She admitted that not all people might feel
this way about applicants reaching out, but she believes it is important.
While applying for positions in Sunville, Ms. Kaneda reached out to the
library services office and let Ms. Searle know that she was looking for a position.
Unfortunately, Ms. Searle only plays a part in the hiring process if principals

156

specifically ask for her help. Ms. Kaneda said she was never sure if reaching out had
helped any, because she knows Ms. Searle is not officially involved in hiring, but
“people talk….You never know who knows who.”
Ms. Searle does not have any part in the screening of applicants to create a
candidate pool. She did, however, indicate that the district has a process of screening
applicants for instructional coaches (a building-level position responsible for
professional development and instructional design with teachers, but not teaching
responsibility with students). She said that she would very much like to do that sort of
screening interview for school librarians in her school district:
Occasionally, a couple of people slip through, “Oh, I want to be a librarian,
because I’m sick of teaching...!” I think it would be easier for the principals if
they had a pool of qualified people that they could pick from, rather than
worrying about getting someone and ending up with someone who is hopeless
with technology. Alternatively, hire from a vetted pool, because then they
would be making a decision for what’s right for their school. It wouldn’t be
the whole world, it would be these people who could apply. And they could
still hire a teacher from their school. It’s just those people would have to talk
to [the library services department] first.
Though there is no screening of candidates, Ms. Searle does sometimes advise
during the interview process. Most often, she provides content for principals to use
during interviews. However, her work with the principal, Mr. Cassie, was an
exception. Mr. Cassie used a panel to interview candidates the last time he hired a
school librarian. This panel included Ms. Searle, the district library supervisor, for
whom Mr. Cassie says he has great regard and would use again on future panels. The
panel was included both in the selection of candidates for interview and in conducting

157

the interviews. Mr. Cassie said that using a hiring panel is not a policy required by the
district, but a “best practice” he likes to follow.
Ms. Searle only provides questions and advice concerning interviews to
principals when they specifically request it. She tailors the questions to their needs,
such as whether they are looking for a librarian who is more traditional in collection
management and literacy education, or if they are looking for someone who has more
skills and experience with technology integration. Principal Cassie said that his
interviews with librarians have consisted of an even split of questions from the
categories of librarian as teacher, librarian as a resource, and librarian as operator of
the library program. In her experience in interviewing in Sunville, Ms. Kaneda said
that the questions in her interview were very much along the same lines as those
mentioned by Principal Cassie. There were questions that focused on her thoughts on
the librarian as manager of the library program, but also a number of questions that
related to her teaching and classroom management.
Ms. Kaneda went through two interview processes to obtain her part-time
positions. At the first school where she was hired, she was interviewed by the
principal and the instructional coach. Once selected by that school, she was directed
to another school by the referral of her new principal. There was a miscommunication,
and she showed up at the incorrect time for the interview at her second position. She
was unable to find any staff at first, but eventually found the entire school staff in an
all-faculty meeting. The principal spoke with her for a few minutes alone, thought
they had a good rapport, and rather than asking her back for another interview, he

158

asked her to come into the staff meeting and proceeded to have the entire staff
interview her on the spot. Her words: “It was crazy!”
The selection decision of a candidate in Sunville School District is done at the
building level. Ms. Searle stated, “The principal will hire [the librarian] like any other
teacher, and they don’t have to talk to me at all.” She said that some principals would
contact her and ask about the advantages and disadvantages of hiring people with
different credentials. In their state, librarians are considered qualified if they either
complete a graduate program in library science or pass a written exam on being a
school librarian and have a teaching certificate. Whenever she is given the
opportunity to provide input, Ms. Searle explains the advantages of hiring someone
who has completed coursework in school librarianship versus someone who has
simply passed an exam and may have no prior knowledge of teaching in the library or
managing a school library program.
Regarding final selection, Principal Cassie said that he works with a hiring
panel at his school and asks that they make a recommendation to him for hiring a
librarian. He said that, while the decision ultimately rests with him, he could not
recall a time of ever going against the hiring panel’s recommendation.
Ms. Capa indicated that HR is trying to make some changes to the hiring
process. In particular, they want the process to be more transparent for others
involved, like principals. When asked what she thought the district might do
differently, she stated:

159

I think right now that is something the district is actually working on, is a
workflow process, really. It’s something brand new. It’s still in the works. It’ll
be a little bit more electronic. A principal can actually see where it is in the
process. Is it stuck in budget? Is it stuck in HR? Where is it in the process?
Right now, a principal—I know I sent it up to budget and I’m waiting for
budget to get it back to me. Until budget gets it back to me, I can’t do
anything.
The librarian, Ms. Kaneda, agreed that the length and complication of the hiring
process is a problem the district needs to fix. She stated that HR in Sunville is “a huge
bureaucracy” and they are “completely overwhelmed.”
4.6.3 Transfers Hires
As stated in the section on recruiting, Ms. Capa of HR indicated that
recruiting internally for transfers could be a hindrance in the process of getting
qualified people into positions. Principals do not always make the request to advertise
because they already have someone they would like to hire. Ms. Searle confirmed that
internal recruitment is really the only type of recruitment occurring and agreed with
Ms. Kaneda that teacher evaluations are a major factor in internal recruitment:
“Honestly, the teacher evaluation system is our biggest recruiter because people want
(to get) out of the classroom. The librarians, thus far, haven’t been evaluated under
the new system.”
In the same way Ms. Capa of HR encourages new hires to speak directly with
principals about their interest in a position, she encourages those interested in
transfers to speak with their administrators and others in the district about wanting to
switch from the classroom to the school library. Ms. Corazon did just that when the

160

librarian at her school left. The transfer within her school was an easy experience
because she was vocal about her desired change with the principal. She had been
waiting for the right position and when one opened up at her school, she simply went
to the principal and indicated that she had the proper certification and “the principal
was all excited…. It was a matter of filling out some paperwork and moving from
classroom to library.”
As a part of the transfer process, Ms. Kaneda only had paperwork to complete
because her contract was changing. She was moving from a full-time teaching
position to two, part-time library positions. The change to part-time status required a
new contract, which was negotiated differently than the full-time contract. She said
the process was simple, and going from being a teacher to a librarian was not a factor
at all.
4.6.4 Sunville Case Summary
In Sunville School District, the district level offices of HR and the library
supervisor are not very involved in the recruiting and hiring of school librarians.
There are few available positions and so most participants indicated that there was
little need for recruiting. The library supervisor reported that there are very few
recruiting efforts and, with no local LIS program in the state, not many places from
which to recruit. The hiring process is conducted entirely at the building level, though
principals do occasionally ask for the library supervisor to participate and advise on
the process. Transfer hires in Sunville are very common, which more than one

161

individual attributed to teachers leaving the classroom and going to the school library,
where they would no longer have to undergo rigorous teacher evaluations. Overall,
decision-making is largely done at the building level with little involvement from
district offices.
4.7 Summary of the Findings
These five cases demonstrate a number of differences in governance for the
decision-making involved in recruiting and hiring school librarians. Districts place
input and decision rights in differing combinations or extremes of the building and
district levels, with governance sometimes changing at different points in the process
within the same school district. The placement of input and decision rights is typically
guided by being put in a certain place in the district organizational structure, as
opposed to where knowledge-fit might be most applicable. For instance, a school
district is more likely to put selection decision rights with the principal, regardless of
their knowledge, because they are the person in charge of the school.
Recruiting and hiring processes can be formal or informal. In addition to
recruiting and hiring processes, the process of hiring transfers was prominent in each
of the districts and was the most informal of all the processes identified. Participants
were rarely aware of any policies guiding the processes, with districts operating under
a more practice-based model. In most districts, little, if anything, is being done to
evaluate recruiting and hiring processes. In the next chapter, I discuss these findings
and their implications in more detail.

162

Chapter 5: Discussion

In this chapter, I discuss the findings of the study. The structure of the chapter
is organized by the research questions. I first discuss Research Question 1 which asks
how school districts make decisions about recruiting and hiring. I then focus on
Research Sub-question 1a, how organizational structure affects the processes,
particularly in hiring. Sub-Questions 1b and 1c are grouped together in a discussion
of policies, procedures, and the ways districts deviate from set practices. I grouped
together all of Research Question 2 and its sub-questions on knowledge sharing, the
use of specific knowledge sets, and the collaboration (or lack thereof) of all
individuals and groups throughout the recruiting and hiring processes. After
discussing the results of the research questions, I discuss the findings regarding
factors affecting the processes that do not align with the research questions,
particularly the affect school district appeal has on the recruiting process. After, I
discuss unexpected findings, including the recruitment of minorities, the use of
provisional employment, and the frequency and effect of transfer hires. This chapter
concludes with the implications and limitations of the study and possibilities for
future research.

163

5.1 Research Question 1
1. How do school districts make decisions about recruiting and hiring school
librarians?
While examining the findings of this study, one of the first issues I
encountered was the structure and wording of Research Question 1. The wording is
problematic, as school districts do not make decisions about recruiting and hiring; the
groups and individuals working in school districts make those decisions. Additionally,
hiring and recruiting decisions are not singular events, but processes that include
many people, smaller decisions, adherence to policies, and numerous other factors.
After a closer look at the literature, particularly the governance archetypes used by
Weill and Ross (2004), a better wording of this research question might be, “What is
the governance structure used in school districts to make decisions about recruiting
and hiring?” The political archetypes Weill and Ross present in their research on
decision-making in IT governance do prove useful in understanding the process and
governance of decision-making in school districts.
5.1.1 School District Governance Archetypes
In their theoretical framework on IT governance, Weill and Ross (2004) use
political archetypes to describe different types of governance, both for input rights
and decision rights regarding IT. With each archetype, they describe who holds which
rights in monarchies, duopolies, feudal systems, federal systems, and anarchies.
Descriptions of the six types of governance can be found in Figure 2.2.

164

The language and participants in the definitions of archetypes in IT governance can
be adjusted to apply to the participants in the decision-making in the recruiting and
hiring of school librarians.
The individuals and groups involved in IT decision-making—business
executives, mid-level IT executives, and business and unit leaders—can be mirrored
to their respective counterparts in school districts: district executives, mid-level
district administrators, and building principals. In school districts, an executive is
either the superintendent or one of the C-level executives, and the mid-level
administrators are the library supervisor and the HR department. School districts have
a similar overall structure to many enterprises with top-level decision-makers, midlevel, centralized decision-makers, and unit or site-based decision-makers. The
conversion of definitions for the archetypes—from who has input and decision rights
in the IT governance model to the school district governance model—is shown in
Figure 5.2.
The findings of this study indicate that the governance structures for recruiting
and hiring decision-making can be completely different. Additionally, governance for
input rights can be different from the governance used for decision rights. As an
example, consider the decision-making processes for recruiting and hiring in Paris
School District.


Recruiting is done almost entirely at the district level. Both HR and the library
supervisor have input on what might be done to recruit for the school and how
recruiting is then carried out. Those at the building level have almost no

165

166

involvement in the recruiting process. This is an example of library
supervisor/HR centralization.


Governance around input and decisions in hiring school librarians in Paris is
entirely different than recruiting. In some cases, the library supervisor has a
great deal of input toward the final decision, through participation in buildinglevel candidate interviews and conducting informal district-level screening
interviews. This exemplifies collaborative governance for input rights in
hiring, with the library supervisor working with building-level administrators
and their designees.



The final hiring decision, though, and the rights to make it, resides with the
principal. For input rights on hiring, Paris is operating with collaborative
governance, with the library supervisor and HR having opportunities to work
with the building-level. For decision rights in hiring, the governance is
decentralized, with site-based decision-making.



In addition to the differences in input and decision rights for recruiting and
hiring, the district may use a different system of governance for the input and
decision rights of transfer hires.
With districts making different choices in governance throughout the

processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians, I identified six different areas
where the governance structure for input and decision rights could vary within and
between school districts:

167

The findings of this study indicate that districts can use different governance
structures for each of these five decision areas. Based on the findings, Figure 5.3
indicates the type of governance system each district uses for input and decision
rights through recruiting, hiring, and transfer hires.
5.1.1.1 Site-Based Decentralization in Cotesworth and Sunville
Cotesworth School District uses decentralized site-based governance for
decision-making throughout all aspects of recruiting and hiring. This is not surprising,
as the district is committed to site-based decision-making. In Cotesworth’s
decentralization archetype, the rights for both input and decisions rest with the school
administrator or their designees in the use of a hiring panel. In this governance model,
the library supervisor and HR are hardly involved in the process, if at all.

168

169

Like Cotesworth, Sunville School District’s governance structure throughout all input
and decisions is decentralized, but possibly for different reasons. While Cotesworth
has specifically given those individuals and groups at the building level more rights in
decision-making, the comments from participants in Sunville indicate less intention
and more default practice in the presence of less structure at the district level. This is
not to say that the governance structure is anarchical. Sunville’s building-level
administrators and their designees certainly have decision rights, but it may be
possible that no one else has those rights, rather than because they were specifically
assigned to those at the building level.
The site-based decentralization model may be the default in the governance of
K-12 education, unless other structures are implemented. Weill and Ross (2004)
indicate that federal and IT duopolies are more common in IT governance, but that is
because of the business interests of keeping many decisions enterprisewide. In K-12
education, decision-making is typically more localized, so the default use of sitebased decentralized governance is more likely.
5.1.1.2 Mixed Governance in Maine North and Paris
While Cotesworth and Sunville operate entirely under decentralized
governance, governance in other districts fluctuates based on the input or decisions in
the recruiting and hiring processes. Maine North and Paris school districts are similar
in this regard. Both school districts place input and decision rights for recruiting in
HR and library supervisor centralization. In these districts, input and decision rights

170

for recruiting are entirely at the district level. Paris and Maine North are also similar
in that the centralization is split between the library supervisor and HR. Both groups
have input and decision rights in recruiting, but they do not always communicate or
coordinate well with one another (problems in communication will be discussed later
in this chapter). Regardless of the split at the district level, neither district gives any
input or decision rights to anyone at the building level for recruiting.
Maine North and Paris also follow the same pattern for interviewing and
selection input and decision rights during the hiring process. Input rights and decision
rights for screening candidates occurs again with centralized governance, For
instance, HR in Paris is heavily involved in the screening process of candidates. This
function is one of the multiple decisions made in the hiring process. Also in Paris, the
library supervisor is given input rights for screening candidates. She not only
conducts informal screening interviews, but principals sometimes invite her to take
part in building-level interviews. Maine North works in a similar manner. HR and the
library supervisor are both involved in formal and informal screening of candidates to
create a pool, which gives them input rights and decision rights for screening.
In both Maine North and Paris, the decision rights for hiring have a different
governance structure than input rights for hiring. As in Cotesworth and Sunville, the
decentralized system is the means of governance for decision rights on interviewing
and input and decision rights in selection in Maine North and Paris. Though the
library supervisor has input rights during the interviewing process, she is not involved

171

in the final decision of hiring, which is left entirely to principals or their designees in
hiring panels.
5.1.1.3 The Complicated Governance of Red Rock
Red Rock is the school district with the most confusing and variant
governance structure for input and decision rights. Like Paris and Maine North, all
input and decision rights for recruiting in Red Rock have centralized governance with
HR and the library supervisor. Red Rock continues to be similar to Paris and Maine
North in input rights for screening candidates, using centralized governance.
However, when it comes to input and decision rights for interviewing and selection,
Red Rock begins to differ and becomes much more difficult to categorize. In
interviewing, district personnel in Red Rock are more involved than any other district
in the process. For this reason, input and decision rights for interviewing are in
collaborative governance with the library supervisor and HR working with buildinglevel principals. In addition to decisions in interviewing, Red Rock continues to differ
in governance for selecting candidates. On typical hiring practices, Red Rock is like
the other districts, in that decision rights on the hiring of school librarians has sitebased decentralized governance. However, with so many exceptions mentioned by the
participants in Red Rock, governance for decision rights is not always clear. As the
HR representative stated, there are times when the superintendent gets involved in
hiring decisions. And while these seemed like exceptions, the involvement of the
most senior administrator would be indicative of a district administrator and site-

172

based collaborative governance system. The superintendent’s involvement is not the
only exception. The rodeo interview and the instances of HR making hiring decisions
before principals have an opportunity to do so indicates that hiring decision rights
sometimes fall into collaborative governance, in which building principals work with
the mid-level district administrators.
Knowing how these school districts make decisions and the governance they
use for input and decision rights is not sufficient in understanding the process. The
findings for sub-questions to Research Question 1 provide more information about
the factors that affect decision-making, focusing on organizational structure, policy,
and practices that deviate from policy.
5.2 Research Sub-Question 1a
1a. How does the organizational structure of the school district influence the
decision-making process of recruiting and hiring school librarians?
The governance and organizational structure used for input and decisions
rights affects both the recruiting and hiring decision-making processes. However, the
effect is much stronger in hiring decisions than in recruiting decisions. The discussion
of findings for this sub-question begins with a brief mention of organizational
structure and recruiting. The section continues with discussion of the effect
governance structure, site-based decision-making (SBDM), and district-level
decision-making (DLDM) have on the hiring process. I use the SBDM and DLDM

173

terms throughout the discussion in conjunction with the governance archetypes
because of their applicability in the field of education.
5.2.1 Governance and Decision-Making in Recruiting
Recruiting is less affected by the organizational structure and governance of
the school district than is hiring. Maine North, Paris, and Red Rock place recruiting
input and decisions at the district level, with very little participation from buildinglevel individuals. As previously mentioned, the exception to DLDM for recruiting is
the word-of-mouth tactic. In keeping with site-based governance, word-of-mouth is
the primary recruiting effort in Cotesworth and Sunville. Rather than governance and
organizational structure, recruiting is more affected by the availability of candidates
or open positions and is discussed later in “Other Factors Affecting DecisionMaking.”
5.2.2 Governance and Decision-Making in Hiring
In hiring, the tasks that a school district completes in the process, and the
ways in which they complete them, are dictated by the governance structure of the
school district. This governance structure is mostly separated into whether school
districts operate primarily with site-level or district-level decision-making processes.
Cotesworth is guided almost entirely by site-based decision-making (SBDM) with its
decentralized governance, while Red Rock is governed mostly by district-level
decision-making (DLDM) in a mix of library supervisor and HR collaboration and
centralization, depending on the type of input or decision required. Paris is closest to

174

the middle of the spectrum, with formal and informal decisions happening at both the
building and district levels. Maine North and Sunville operate under SBDM, but in a
less extreme manner than does Cotesworth. The following two sections discuss the
differences between using SBDM and DLDM during the hiring process.
5.2.2.1 The Effects of Site-Based Decision-Making on Hiring
5.2.2.1.1 Allotments
The autonomy and SBDM used in Cotesworth affects the hiring process
before it even starts. It begins with principals being able to make alternative staffing
choices with their budgets and to shift allotments away from employing school
librarians, if they choose. This is a textbook example of site-based decentralized
governance, in which both input and decision rights are placed at the building level.
In Cotesworth, where a strong emphasis is placed on technology, some principals
choose to allot their resources toward an instructional technology specialist (ITS),
instead of or in addition to staffing a certified school library position. A number of
principals in Cotesworth have chosen to do away with certified school librarians
altogether and are staffing their libraries with aides. It is then the responsibility of the
library supervisor, Ms. Hayes, to train these aides, who may have no experience in
school libraries and are not certified to teach students.
Continuing to exercise her rights in decentralized governance, when Principal
Cregg of Cotesworth looks at the allotments for her school, she sometimes does not
even specify the types of certification she wants for a position. She leaves the

175

qualifications of a position open in the event that someone valuable, but not
necessarily certified, might be a good hire. In her interview, she specifically indicated
making this decision when hiring school librarians, in the event that someone without
certification might be a better fit for the position.
5.2.2.1.2 Hiring Panels
In site-based centralized governance of decision rights, hiring procedures
become informal, rather than uniformly tied to any set district policy or procedure.
The process is also more likely to vary from school to school. In some districts, a
principal may choose whether they want to use a hiring panel or conduct interviews
on their own. Principal Seaborn in Cotesworth, for instance, uses hiring panels to
conduct most of the hiring processes in her school. She selects candidates and then
passes those candidates along to a committee to determine the final hire. While it is
easy to see the value in using a hiring panel—employing the expertise and ideas of
multiple individuals—it is difficult to see how this process would be beneficial in
hiring school librarians if no experts in school librarianship were involved. In her
interview, Principal Seaborn described using a hiring panel to hire teachers, but she
did not use one when hiring a librarian. And instead of using a panel of teachers or
any experts in librarianship, she had the ITS in her school conduct the interviews for a
new school library position. While the school librarian and ITS often work closely
with one another, such action is in direct contradiction to the benefits that Ms.
Seaborn proclaimed using a hiring panel produces.

176

In Maine North, where hiring panels are required, the supervisor said that he
is usually not a part of those panels, moving from hiring input rights in collaborative
governance to the SBDM of hiring decision rights in decentralized governance. In
Sunville, Mr. Cassie also uses hiring panels and specifically mentioned that he asks
the library supervisor to serve on those panels. He said he greatly respects her as an
expert in her field and that he would invite her to join a panel if he needs to hire a
school librarian again in the future. However, the library supervisor in Sunville
indicated that Principal Cassie is somewhat atypical; most principals do not ask for
her input on hiring decisions. In a similar way, the supervisor in Paris must wait for a
principal to ask her to be a part of a hiring panel, and because hiring panels are, again,
at the discretion of the principal, she has interviewed candidates with just the
principal and no committee.
5.2.2.1.3 Site-Based Decision-Making in Selection
Except in Red Rock, building-level individuals or groups make the final
decision of hiring of a candidate. It is in this way that all districts but Red Rock use
site-based decentralized governance for hiring input and decision rights. When there
is no district-level involvement in the final decision, which is entirely possible given
that the supervisor is not required to be a part of the process in any district, a decision
from the building level can lead to the hiring of unqualified individuals. This result
was noted as an issue in both Cotesworth and Sunville, where both input and decision
rights have site-based, decentralized governance. Ms. Hayes in Cotesworth identified

177

issues with principals who hired uncertified individuals in the school library, and then
Ms. Hayes became responsible for training them to make sure the library was
functioning. These library aides do not often move beyond the role of the librarian as
program administrator. The students in these schools miss out on the opportunity to
have a librarian who fulfills all the roles of leader, teacher, instructional partner, and
information specialist.
If SBDM does occur in Red Rock, it is not as extensive as in a district like
Cotesworth. Since the library supervisor has already screened candidates, there is no
need for a principal to bring in anyone with expertise in school librarianship during a
building-level interview. Most of the interviews discussed in Red Rock were
completed by just one or two administrators. When there is no hiring panel, there are
no other ideas or opinions present in the process. And while the librarian, Ms. Sattler,
appreciated this one-on-one experience and described it as being less stressful, it
relies on the opinions of just the principal to make a final decision.
5.2.2.2 The Effects of District-Level Decision-Making on Hiring
While SBDM governs the hiring decision rights in most school districts,
DLDM plays a part in the governance of input rights and decision rights in screening
and the input rights of interviewing in the hiring process. The amount of input that
library supervisors are allowed in each district changes both with the governance
structure and who is involved. In particular, district-level input in the hiring process is
typically found in the screening process. In this section, I discuss the screening

178

process, candidate pools, and the differences between HR screening, library
supervisor screening, and a combination of the two. The section concludes with other
parts of the hiring process that are affected by DLDM.
5.2.2.2.1 The Screening Process and the Creation Candidate Pools
In the centralized governance for input and decision rights in screening
applicants, HR and possibly the library supervisor must first review the application
materials. This is the case in Maine North and Paris School Districts. Similarly,
before a principal or school can see an application in Red Rock, the applicant must
first go through a screening at the district level to become a candidate. The opposite is
true in Cotesworth and Sunville, where principals have easy access to applications as
soon as they are submitted. In Red Rock, screening is done by HR and the library
supervisor collaboratively. In Paris and Maine North, the screening process is done by
HR, with the library supervisor having some informal involvement.
5.2.2.2.2 Screening by Human Resources
In between the extremes of SBDM in Cotesworth and DLDM in Red Rock is
a school district like Paris, with a mixture where decisions are made at both levels.
Due to DLDM, some of the hiring process in Paris has become fairly structured,
perhaps overly so. The screening process for all certified teachers, including school
librarians, requires the completion of an example lesson plan over the phone and an
online written exercise using sample student data from standardized testing. For the
school librarians, there were a number of complications with this process. While HR

179

indicated that this exercise was a part of the process to screen out unqualified
candidates, the participating librarians stated that they completed the requirement at
different times in the hiring process, some of them noting that they finished the
screening tasks after they had received an informal job offer by a school principal.
However, before being given a formal offer, all candidates had to complete the
screening exercises. In addition to the timing difficulties, the content of the screening
exercises was not tailored to school librarians. While no individuals indicated they
were unable to complete the tasks, the librarians interviewed thought that the
exercises were odd for a school librarian. The library supervisor, Ms. Vosen, said that
HR had reached out to her to adjust the screening exercises for school librarians to be
more applicable for their work, but that change in process had not been completed at
the time of this study.
As mentioned previously, HR in Maine North also has a screening process for
candidates. However, unlike Paris, where they are screening out and candidates are
removed based on their skills, in Maine North it is a screening in. Due to her belief
that Maine North has a shortage of applicants, the HR representative in that district
said that the district is willing to entertain any applicant who is minimally qualified.
Being only interested in including those candidates who have the minimum
qualifications is not surprising, because HR does not formally involve the library
supervisor in the screening process. The involvement of the library supervisor would
likely include a more rigorous screening process.

180

5.2.2.2.3 Screening by Library Supervisors
While Cotesworth is the extreme in SBDM, Red Rock exemplifies the type of
district in which more decision-making is done at the district level. The library
supervisor in Red Rock has as much access to the application materials, as do those in
HR. Red Rock also uses the application system to track the applicants throughout the
entire hiring process. Ms. Murphy was the only supervisor to indicate such easy
access to application materials. Ms. Murphy even advised HR on the questions they
should be asking during their screening interviews and ways that HR might improve
the process for school librarians, as the qualifications are different than for hiring a
classroom teacher.
In this way, Ms. Murphy is unlikely to run into the same difficulties as
Cotesworth’s supervisor, who had to train uncredentialed library aides hired by
principals. In fact, Ms. Murphy specifically mentioned that in screening candidates
for a library position, she ensures that the candidates are prepared to work in the
library in the way that Red Rock finds most suitable, namely that they are ready to
teach and not just staff the library as a circulation assistant. Ms. Murphy screens out
candidates who do not consider the library to be a classroom where learning takes
place. For this same reason, the library supervisor in Sunville mentioned wanting to
be able to screen candidates, though the site-based governance structure in her district
does not allow her to do so. She wishes that she could have the same control of the
candidate pool that Ms. Murphy does, so that she could help principals avoid hiring
individuals who are not fully prepared to work in the school library.

181

In Paris, the library supervisor said that she conducts screening interviews, in
addition to the formal screening processes that HR conducts, as did her predecessor.
However, the HR representative did not mention this step as a part of the hiring
process. While all the participating librarians had gone through that screening
interview, it did not seem to be official and was completed at the discretion of the
library supervisor. The librarians interviewed did indicate their belief that the library
supervisor used the screening interviews to make recommendations to school
principals, but they were uncertain if this was true and to what extent it influenced the
principals’ decisions.
The library supervisor in Maine North, Mr. Reynolds, conducts similarly
informal screening interviews with applicants. However, he does not use these
interviewers to screen candidates in or out; he conducts interviews to better
understand what training an individual might need if they are hired. This process
would be more effective as input if these interviews were formalized so that he could
prevent them from being hired at all, but he does not see it as part of his
responsibilities to tell principals who they should or should not hire.
5.2.2.2.4 District-Level Input Rights Beyond Screening
Though the input rights of district-level individuals and groups for hiring are
mostly limited to the screening process, there are examples in which those from the
district level have had input at other stages in hiring. In Paris, the library supervisor,
Ms. Vosen, and her predecessor, Ms. Zorn, were both involved in an advisory role for

182

some building-level interviews for school librarians. They participated in interviews
as a part of a hiring panel and with the principal in interviewing the applicant. This
seems, in part, to be attributed to the many efforts of Ms. Zorn to become a part of the
process. Following in the culture of participation and advisement Ms. Zorn created,
Ms. Vosen continued with similar efforts in her first year as supervisor.
Taking district-level involvement too far, however, was Ms. Murphy’s
creation of the so-called rodeo interview in Red Rock, in which multiple principals
interviewed candidates simultaneously for positions in different schools. Rather than
the opportunity to witness a school’s atmosphere and possibly meet with some of the
staff, school library candidates in these rodeo interviews were subjected to nervewracking conditions in which they had to take questions from the library supervisor
and multiple principals at once.
5.2.2.2.5 District-Level Decision-Making in Final Selection
In their place at the extreme of DLDM in the hiring process, Red Rock was
unique in decision-making when it came to selecting candidates to hire. Red Rock
was the only district in which the superintendent was ever mentioned as being part of
the process. Multiple participants discussed the hands-on approach that the district
administration takes, but the inclusion of the superintendent in any individual hiring
decision at the building level was a unique revelation.
This idea of finalizing hires at the district level in Red Rock was not just
limited to the superintendent. On more than one occasion, Ms. Murphy had taken it

183

upon herself to make the final decisions for transfers and hiring decisions. In the case
of Ms. Nedry, Ms. Murphy asked her to make an immediate decision about
transferring to one of four schools from her previous position. In essence, Ms.
Murphy had made the decision to transfer Ms. Nedry and was giving her the option to
choose the school where she wanted to be transferred. No one at the site level had any
say in the decision; Ms. Murphy gave Ms. Nedry the decision rights for the school.
Additionally, when one school was between principals, Ms. Murphy took the
liberty of placing a librarian in the school where the position had previously been cut.
While it is better to have someone in the position, in this instance, a district-level
person placed an employee into a school without consulting the administrators of the
school. While achieving the objective of getting a certified librarian into the school,
such decision-making might be considered disrespectful and invasive. Building-level
administrators might consider themselves usurped under such actions, feeling without
much power to run their own school. Exemplifying this issue, Ms. Sattler in Red
Rock said that when the librarian position opened up at her school, her principal felt
rushed to fill it so HR did not place someone before he was able to choose a candidate
on his own. Such a competitive nature between making decisions at the building level
or the district level does not create a collaborative atmosphere.
5.3 Research Sub-Questions 1b and 1c
1b. How do school district policies and procedures influence the decisionmaking processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians?

184

1c. How do the actual processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians
adhere to or differ from school district policies or procedures?
These two sub-questions ask about policies affecting the recruiting and hiring
processes and how actual practice in a district differs in any way from those stated
policies. In this section, I discuss how districts lacked official policies regarding
recruiting and hiring and how this could lead to a failed transfer of institutional
knowledge within the district. In turn, a lack of formal policies does affect the
decision-making process. I also discuss the evaluation process (or lack thereof) in
school districts.
5.3.1 Not Policy, But Practice
There was an assumption at the outset of this study that certain policies would
guide or affect the recruiting and hiring policies in school districts—in particular, that
districts would have put into place some sort of policy, beyond those policies set by
the state, as to how they went about recruiting and hiring. Responses from
participants revealed otherwise. If such policies exist, most participants taking part in
recruiting and hiring could not point to them directly or did not know if they existed
at all.
Typically, I asked questions about policy after discussing the specific tasks
that went into the recruiting or hiring process. For example, after talking about how
someone in HR works with principals in getting credentialed people for interviews, I
would ask, “Are there policies or documentation that guide that process?” The overall

185

response to this question was negative. Some individuals would point to high-level
policies created by an organization like the state Department of Education. For
example, in Cotesworth, the policy that most people spoke about regarding the hiring
process came from the state level. Specifically, this policy gave the principals in
Cotesworth far more autonomy in hiring, allowing them to change their allotments so
they were not required to have a librarian.
Responses were similar throughout the study. In Red Rock, when asked about
the policies or documents that guide the hiring process, Ms. Grant of HR stated, “I
don’t know if it’s written anywhere…. When I took this position, I followed along
with what the other specialists were doing, but I don’t know if there is anything
written down somewhere.” When I asked the library supervisor in Red Rock, Ms.
Murphy, about whether there were policies that guide the hiring process, her singleword response was, “Probably.” She had no further information, other than if some
policy existed, she was not sure where it was. Further questioning on the topic
revealed that she did not follow any policies, but rather identified specific practices,
many of which she had put into place during her long tenure as library supervisor.
The HR representative from Paris, Mr. Parsons, confirmed the notion that
recruiting and hiring is guided more by practice than policy. When asked about the
policies in place requiring that schools hire certified librarians over other staff to run
the library, he said the following:
I think during our training [sessions with principals], we make it really clear to
the principals that this is an expectation. It’s not something that has been
written down that they have to follow. We do message it that this is required.

186

They do have required pieces. We do have a mechanism in place that’s
relatively new to ensure that it’s being followed and followed with fidelity.
Then it requires that my office work closely with the instructional director
leadership team to stress the value of it, rather than make it a compliance issue
that people just have to follow or you get your head banged in.
It is entirely possible that more policies exist. In Sunville, Ms. Capa of HR, who
specifically works on hiring school librarians, was not aware of any specific policies
in her district, but directed me to speak with another person in her office who worked
more with technical issues of compliance, indicating that policies may exist, but she
was not directly aware of them.
These findings indicate that the recruiting and hiring processes in these school
districts follow a practice-based system. Corradi, Gherardi, & Verzelloni (2008)
provide three descriptions for the study of practice. One of those descriptions refers to
studying the way something is done:
Practice is a processual concept able to represent the ‘logic of the situation’ of
a context. The study of practice, or better ‘practising’, yields important
insights into how practitioners recognize, produce, and formulate the scenes
and regulations of everyday affairs. (pg. 3)
Looking at the recruiting and hiring processes in these school districts as a practicebased system is more applicable, as they are not guided by policies and set
procedures, but the practice upon which people agree things should be done.
5.3.2 Institutional Knowledge
Working in a practice-based system can be problematic when someone is new
to his or her position and there is no established way to pass on institutional

187

knowledge. In Paris, for example, the supervisor was new to the position and was still
trying to learn her role in recruiting and hiring. She only had the notes of her
predecessor to guide her in the process, and those were not always helpful. Being new
was particularly problematic in Paris, where some parts of the process have been
highly formalized, such as the screening process performed by HR, with data
exercises and mock lesson plans. To complicate things further, the supervisor was not
the only new person in Paris. Mr. Parsons in HR also was new to his position, and he
said that his office was still trying to figure out exactly where his predecessor had
accounts for advertising about positions, because that information had not been
passed along to him.
Beyond the institutional knowledge of specific individuals involved in the
recruiting and hiring process, there was little discussion of training principals to hire
people with specialized skills. More than one supervisor talked about advising
individual principals about how they might go about the process of hiring school
librarians, but they did not discuss ways to reach out to all principals. Mr. Parsons, of
Paris, mentioned discussing criteria with principals, as mentioned earlier in the
discussion, but it was largely informal.
From one perspective, it is possible to see this flexibility on the district’s part
as not forcing rules or regulations to guide a specific policy. Lacking a specific policy
and instead guided by district practice, a principal or site-based hiring panel could
conduct the hiring process in whatever way they chose. Such informality is sufficient
for those individuals who are aware of what occurs in the school library and the

188

potential impact the school librarian can have on the school; however, what about
those principals whose previous experiences with school library programs have been
negative ones? When there is no policy or procedure in place to help a new or
disenfranchised principal hire a qualified individual who can have a positive effect on
the learning and teaching in the school, how are attitudes and misconceptions about
school librarians going to change?
5.3.3 Evaluation of Recruiting and Hiring Processes
Throughout the interviews, participants revealed numerous things they would
like to change about the recruiting and hiring processes in their school districts.
Often, these statements came as a criticism by a school librarian describing his or her
experience in the process. In a few instances, an HR representative identified a
specific practice or procedure they would like to alter. However, formal evaluation of
recruiting and hiring practices was uncommon. More evaluation is needed regarding
these processes if districts are to understand if and when they are making mistakes or
less than optimal decisions. Ignoring the comments of the librarians who have been
through the process results in a missed opportunity to make adjustments and improve
recruiting and hiring processes.
If an informal or formal evaluation of the processes does occur, it happens at
the district level. While principals and, in particular, school librarians have ideas on
how the processes might be altered, there are not established ways for those ideas or
changes to reach district-level employees. In Red Rock, the school librarians had

189

numerous ideas about how HR and the library supervisor could improve recruiting
and possibly decrease the shortage of applicants in the district, but there was no
means by which they could express their ideas to the administration.
In one example of district evaluation, the HR department in Paris had reached
out to the library supervisor to discuss possible changes to the screening exercises
that seemed so confusing to the school librarians who had participated in them.
However, this request for change had not occurred because of an established protocol
for evaluation. HR had simply received some comments from some librarians and
finally reached out to their expert in school libraries to see if changes could be made.
Additionally, in Paris, Mr. Parsons of HR said that the hiring process was under
evaluation due to the time it takes a person to get from submitting their application to
actually being hired. He hopes to add more metrics to the system to determine ways
that the district can improve, but being new to his position, he did not yet have
specific ideas.
With a single task in recruiting, Red Rock did use a measured evaluation to
assess and make changes in the process. During an interview, the HR representative
in this district mentioned using data collected about the job fairs they attend to adjust
where they will attend fairs in the future. They specifically track factors such as the
number of discussions with job fair attendees that result in interviews of candidates or
actual hires from each job fair. This is an example in which evaluation can positively
affect practice in carrying out the recruiting and hiring processes.

190

Overall, more formal evaluation is needed in these districts to improve the
recruiting and hiring processes. There is too little reflection on the district’s part about
what they are doing. Though some district-level administrators do minor evaluations,
it was the librarians who had the most to say about how the process could be changed
in the future. Districts should be talking to recent hires about what it was like going
through their recruiting and hiring processes. They should be asking new hires where
it went wrong and how things could improve for future hires.
Even districts without shortages could be doing more to evaluate their
recruiting and hiring processes. Though Sunville has no problem hiring, the librarians
interviewed for this study spoke about the many difficulties they experienced in the
hiring process, including not knowing whether a position was actually open or if it
was just being advertised. In Cotesworth, one librarian talked about not knowing what
positions were available, because principals did not bother to advertise and were
relying almost completely on word-of-mouth recruiting.
5.4 Research Question 2 and Sub-Questions 2a, 2b, and 2c
2. How do the specific knowledge sets held by different district-level
departments influence the decision-making of principals regarding recruiting and
hiring school librarians at the building level?
2a. How are school district library supervisors involved in making buildinglevel recruiting and hiring decisions?

191

2b. How are human resource departments involved in making building-level
recruiting and hiring decisions?
2c. In what ways, if any, do principals, supervisors, and human resource
departments coordinate on decisions on recruiting and hiring school librarians?
Research Question 2 is concerned with understanding knowledge-fit and
decision rights as expressed through the theoretical framework of IT governance. I
worded the research questions to seek information about how the knowledge sets of
others at the district level might influence and affect the final decisions made by
principals. The results of this study show that the knowledge sets of specific groups
and individuals are certainly a part of the process of giving input for making decisions
about recruiting and hiring, but as stated earlier, they are not the guiding principles.
The sub-questions for Question 2 delve even more deeply into the use of
different knowledge sets in decision-making. Most of this discussion is best reflected
in the last sub-question, which asks how principals, HR, and library supervisors do or
do not collaborate in making decisions. The intention of this sub-question was to
capture other factors that contribute to the process outside the IT governance
theoretical framework.
5.4.1 Involvement and Knowledge Sharing
While knowledge-fit is not the primary factor in determining governance for
the processes of recruiting and hiring school librarians, it does play a role. However,
participants did not describe knowledge sharing as a part of the process; rather, they

192

involved those with knowledge or expertise as a part of the process, sometimes with
input rights and sometimes with decision rights. Knowledge sharing is the act of
making one’s knowledge available to others in an organization. The act is purposeful
and must be done voluntarily (unlike reporting done out of obligation), and provided
in a way that can be understood and used by others (Ipe, 2003). Knowledge sharing
should not be confused with knowledge transfer (the movement of knowledge from
one location or individual to another in an organization) or shared knowledge
(knowledge that is not exchanged between two or groups, but a state in which both
groups possess the same knowledge).
There were a small number of instances of knowledge sharing in this study.
One example that occurred in more than one district was the library supervisor
providing interview questions to principals when the supervisor would not be
participating in a building-level interview. Ms. Murphy, Mr. Reynolds, and Ms.
Searle all mentioned doing this in their districts. They are not involved, but they
shared their knowledge and provided input to those with decision rights.
Instead of knowledge sharing, districts used the knowledge of library
supervisors through involvement in the processes of recruiting and hiring, if they used
their knowledge at all. For instance, when a library supervisor participates in a hiring
panel for a building-level interview, the hiring panel benefits from the knowledge of
the supervisor through the supervisor’s involvement; however, the knowledge is not
shared or transferred during this process, it is simply used as input.

193

The involvement of the supervisor’s knowledge differs among the districts. In
Red Rock, where DLDM is more prominent, the library supervisor is highly involved
in the screening of applicants to create a candidate pool. She is able to provide
questions to HR and to principals, which make their interviews more targeted to the
work of school librarians. Red Rock’s supervisor has slightly more involvement in
the screening process than does the library supervisor in Maine North. Where Ms.
Murphy in Red Rock can actually make an argument to eliminate candidates, Mr.
Reynolds of Maine North only makes suggestions. Additionally, Mr. Reynolds does
conduct screening interviews, they are more for his own purposes, to get to know the
candidate pool, and do not affect the hiring process. His knowledge of the work of
school librarians is not being used to its fullest advantage.
While there is no place for Ms. Searle of Sunville to share her knowledge at
the beginning of the hiring process, one principal did speak of the definitive value of
having her serve on the hiring panel for the last school librarian he hired. He
specifically pointed to her expertise and noted that he would use her again in the
future if such a need arose. In Paris, Ms. Vosen and her predecessor, Ms. Zorn, had
similar experiences with principals. Their participation in interviews was not
required, but the principals who did ask them to take part used their knowledge as
active participants, not just observers or advisors. In another instance of possible
knowledge sharing, Ms. Vosen pointed out that some interviews became
opportunities to educate principals about how school library program can enrich the
experiences of students and teachers.

194

5.4.1.1 Lack of Knowledge and Supervisor Involvement
There were numerous occasions in which the knowledge and expertise of
others was not used in the process of recruiting and hiring school librarians. In
Cotesworth, the Chief Office of Information and Technology, Mr. Moss, talked about
principals not having enough information to go about recruiting well. In a district
almost entirely run by SBDM, there is a definite need to involve district-level experts
when hiring specialized staff. Mr. Moss pointed out that, though principals know
what they want, they do not know where to find it. The result of not pairing
knowledge and decision rights together is that when, or if, a principal hires an
unqualified individual for the school library, they expect the district library staff to
train them, rather than seeking the supervisor’s assistance in advance to hire qualified
people in the first place.
In Red Rock, HR would like the supervisor to be doing more for recruiting,
but the supervisor seemed uninterested or unaware, which is a missed opportunity.
This problem was evident in how both HR and the library supervisor discussed the
recruiting process, but was even further demonstrated by the school librarians in the
district as they talked about the shortage of applicants. The library supervisor, Ms.
Murphy, explained that she advises on the recruiting process, but considering the
emphasis that HR put on needing her to participate, they are not getting the advice
that they need.
When districts did not use the knowledge of library supervisors, faulty
perceptions of the school librarian’s work also crept into the interview process. For

195

instance, one of the librarians in Cotesworth described an interview that consisted
primarily of questions about whether her work would be a good fit with the ITS
already employed at the school. Although the school librarian could offer a
completely different and more than just complementary set of skills for instruction in
the school, the work of the ITS was considered primary. If the library supervisors
were consulted, the focus might instead have been on what the librarian could add to
the school’s instruction of technology, as opposed to just being there to support the
ITS.
As in Cotesworth, Ms. Searle of Sunville has almost no part in the recruiting
or hiring processes unless specifically asked by a principal. This, again, leads to
principals hiring individuals to work in the library, who are not fully trained and
typically require the assistance of, or further training from, the library supervisor. In
an example of attempted knowledge sharing, when principals do contact Ms. Searle,
she tries to explain the difference between hiring someone who has been trained to be
a librarian and someone who simply has taken a test to receive their school library
endorsement.
There were a number of instances in which individuals recognized their need
of knowledge from others in their district, but none more impactful than principals
who recognized the value of consulting with the library supervisor. Mr. Dodgson of
Red Rock made it clear how valuable he sees the work that Ms. Murphy does in
screening candidates before selecting among them for interviews. Mr. Cassie of
Sunville noted how helpful Ms. Searle was when he brought her in to be a part of

196

hiring panels. Instances such as these demonstrate the power of knowledge sharing in
making a decision, versus the freedom of autonomy principals may have in making
decisions on their own.
5.4.2 Other Factors in Decision-Making
While decision-making around recruiting and hiring in these districts is guided
primarily by governance, the structure of the organization, and the involvement (or
lack of involvement) of the knowledge of others, there are other factors that play a
role. In the recruiting process, the governance of decision-making is determined in
large part by the availability of candidates and positions in the district. Other factors
that affect the recruiting and hiring processes in school districts include recruiting
minorities, provisional employment, and transfer hires.
5.4.2.1 The Effect of Availability of Candidates and Positions on Recruiting
In hiring, the most prominent factor affecting the decision-making process
was the organizational structure of the district. In determining governance for the
recruiting process, the availability of candidates and the number of available positions
plays a much bigger role than the district’s organizational structure. The number of
candidates and positions available was not measured specifically for each district.
Information about the supply and demand of school librarians was reported on by
questions asked of the library supervisor and HR representative. Based on the
findings, and with a better understanding of the factors that contribute to governance,
future research should specifically measure the number of candidates available to a

197

school district and the number of positions open to candidates. For this study, Figure
5.4 describes the availability of candidates and positions in each district, as reported
by participants. Without specific numbers, I labeled the availability of positions and
candidates in each district as high, low, and mixed. A high number of available
candidates were indicated by library supervisors and HR when there were plenty of
people from whom to select to bring in for interviews. A low number of available
candidates occurred when districts struggled to get people to apply for positions. In
Maine North, the categorization of mixed availability is used because of the differing
opinions of the library supervisor and the HR representative as to what is occurring in
the district. In future research, such a designation can be avoided with specific
measures, rather than participant perception.

5.4.2.1.1 The Effects of High Candidate Availability/Low Volume of Open Positions
on the Recruiting Process
Overall, the higher the number of candidates available to a school district, the
less formalized their recruiting practices are. The districts with more candidates have
less need for external recruiting tactics such as attending job fairs. Instead, these
districts rely more on internal recruiting tactics such as word-of-mouth. In these
districts, governance of input and decision rights on recruiting is at the site-based
level. Without the need for district intervention to combat a low supply of applicants,
each individual school can do their own recruiting however they choose.
It is easy to label Cotesworth a district with a high supply of candidates,
because multiple participants described how motivated applicants are to work there.
A district like Maine North, however, is slightly more difficult to categorize, due to
the conflicting remarks by the supervisor and HR representative about the availability
of librarians in the candidate pool. The library supervisor, Mr. Reynolds, discussed
how the district has high number of available candidates due to the competitive salary
the district offers teachers. However, Ms. Clark in HR believes that the district has a
shortage of applicants and is struggling to fill positions. Due to their differing
opinions, Mr. Reynolds’ actions on behalf of Maine North follow the pattern of
Cotesworth as a district of high appeal, while the actions of Ms. Clark are much more
in line with the districts like Red Rock and Paris, which struggle with appeal. For this
reason, Mr. Reynolds’ actions are discussed in this section on high availability and
low number of available positions and Ms. Clark’s actions are discussed in the next

199

section on low availability and high number of open positions and their effect on
recruiting.
In Cotesworth School District, recruiting efforts are the most informal of any
of the school districts in this study. The library supervisors in Cotesworth emphasized
the extreme importance of knowing someone in the district while conducting a job
search there. Word-of-mouth is the most common recruiting tactic used in the district,
a statement confirmed by individuals at all levels in Cotesworth.
When recruiting efforts become less formal due to high availability of
candidates, the effort that goes into job postings also changes, with contradictions
arising between the creation of job postings where positions may not be available and
advertisements applicants see as vague and unhelpful. In Cotesworth, the requirement
of putting up a job posting was put into question by the differing statements of
participants. The library supervisor, Mr. Moss, said that each school is required to put
up a job posting, though he did not indicate where. Ms. Lyman of HR confirmed this,
but stated that the only place the district is required to post jobs is on the state’s
Department of Education website. Principal Seaborn, however, seemed to think that
she was under no obligation to post an opening at her school if she already had
someone available or sought to recruit through her staff. For instance, she said that
while opening a new school, she did not advertise at all. She stated that applicants
simply knew she needed to fill all positions, so there was no purpose in advertising.
While principals lauded their autonomy at not having to make such job postings, both
the library supervisors and librarians lamented their inability to know what positions

200

were available based on public postings. Ms. Ziegler specifically said, “It would be
nice if [the process] were a little more formal so you could see what your options
really are.”
The process of going to job fairs is also unnecessary in districts and schools
with a high availability of candidates. The only job fair mentioned in Cotesworth was
a transfer job fair reserved for employees in the district to transfer from one school to
another; it was not open to the public. Ms. Ziegler, the librarian who mentioned this
job fair, even questioned whether a school librarian would be able to find a position
there.
Attending job fairs was not the only formal recruiting task excluded in
districts with high availability of candidates. No efforts were made in Cotesworth to
establish cohorts or conduct pre-service visits with nearby school library certification
programs. In Maine North, the supervisor visits with students in pre-service
programs, but not specifically for recruitment efforts. Similarly, the HR
representative in Maine North attends job fairs, but not to recruit school librarians.
While Sunville School District does not have a high supply of school library
candidates, it does have a low number of available positions, as mentioned by more
than one participant from this district. This low supply is not due to issues with salary
(as will be discussed in the next section with Paris and Red Rock). Instead, the library
supervisor, Ms. Searle, stated that the school librarians in their district do not
turnover; rather, they stay in their positions often until retirement. Ms. Searle also
feels that Sunville has a large number of teachers moving toward school librarianship

201

to escape the demands of the evaluation system placed on teachers, a system not used
for school librarians. The ability for a teacher to transfer in Sunville school district is
made easier by state regulations that allow any certified teacher to become a school
librarian simply by taking a certification exam. This option was not the case with
other districts, and likely contributed to Sunville not having to formalize their
recruiting efforts. With some teachers choosing to go to the library and leave the
classroom, and the ease with which a teacher can obtain a librarian endorsement
through testing, it calls into questions whether the district has a good supply of
candidates.
As in Cotesworth, where there is high supply, the low demand of Sunville has
left recruiting practices informal. While the HR representative in Sunville described a
specific process to which principals must adhere for creating a job ad when a position
is available, the librarians indicated that using the district’s online postings or job ads
was unreliable. Principals may advertise a position but already have someone in
mind, filling the position before fully vetting applications. And while the district’s
policy seems clear, the actions of principals do not adhere to this policy. This leaves
applicants more reliant on word-of-mouth to hear when a position is actually open
and networking to obtain a position.

5.4.2.1.2 The Effects of Low Candidate Availability/High Volume of Open Positions
on the Recruiting Process
The districts that struggle with filling the applicant pool and have a high
number of open positions have procedures that are more formal for recruiting.
Additionally, the governance for decision rights in these districts is typically in a
library and HR centralized governance. With more effort needed to recruit school
librarians for the entire district, input and decision rights are both placed at the
district-level, giving HR and the library supervisor the opportunity to increase the size
of the applicant pool as much as they can. Whether those district-level specialists take
advantage of all possible tactics varies from district to district.
The most common reason given for a high number of available positions in a
school district was salary. Red Rock struggles with recruiting candidates because of
lower salary for staff than surrounding school districts. While this study was being
conducted, Red Rock had five school library positions that had not been filled by the
time the school year started. With the most significant shortage of applicants, Red
Rock completes the broadest range of recruiting tasks. Ms. Grant of HR spoke of
using nearly every tactic discussed in the study as something she already did or
something of which she wanted to do more.
Like Red Rock, Paris also struggles with low supply of candidates, but to a
lesser extent. Even so, Mr. Parsons of HR stated that the critical shortage of school
library applicants in the district was exceeded only by special education. While Red
Rock must compete with the higher salaries of neighboring districts, Paris pays as

203

well as most of the other districts in the state, but must compete with higher pay in
near-neighboring states. Additionally, the library supervisor in Paris, Ms. Vosen,
indicated that the district has an advantage over other districts in terms of support for
school librarians, due to neighboring districts not having a district library supervisor.
In Red Rock’s state, this is not the case, as many neighboring districts have library
supervisors.
In a district where the number of applicants is low, the process of recruiting is
far more formalized. For instance, informal, word-of-mouth recruiting was hardly
mentioned as a tactic used by the employees in Red Rock. When the library
supervisor, Ms. Murphy, did discuss word-of-mouth recruiting, she said that it was a
rare occurrence for an applicant to come to her purely from being referred by
someone else in the school district. Red Rock was more reliant on more formal
processes for recruiting.
Unlike Red Rock, Paris makes more use of word-of-mouth recruiting, though
its recruiting process is still more formalized. Some librarians in the district indicated
that it is too reliant on word-of-mouth recruiting. However, in keeping with their
problems with a low availability of candidates, they have attempted to formalize the
process of word-of-mouth recruiting. Rather than just rely on word-of-mouth, Mr.
Parsons has turned it into a referral program with small incentives, though the
librarian, Ms. Bourne, felt this was ineffective and that the district should be spending
more time advertising on the district website and other online job sites, a recruiting
tactic discussed later in this section.

204

In Red Rock, HR puts the most effort into placing job advertisements. Ms.
Murphy assists HR in creating the job description for these ads. HR uses a system that
posts ads directly to their website and a national job site, as well. Additionally, Ms.
Grant said that she wants to place ads at universities and other locations. No other
district described using this recruiting tactic as extensively as Red Rock.
In Maine North, Ms. Clark in HR also makes an effort to post job postings on
their website and the state Department of Education’s website, and she is looking for
alternative locations to place job ads. She does this without discussing it with the
library supervisor, Mr. Reynolds, who did not mention a need for such extensive
recruitment.
In addition to job ads, HR’s attendance at job fairs is more prominent in Red
Rock compared to districts that have high availability of candidates. Ms. Grant of HR
talked about attending numerous job fairs, both unidistrict and multidistrict. HR also
tracked evidence of the effectiveness of attending certain job fairs by looking at the
number of applicants and hires that resulted from their attendance. No other district
collects metrics in this way for recruiting. Ms. Grant also talked about visiting preservice librarians at universities not just locally, but in neighboring states as well. The
librarian, Ms. Malcolm, discussed the library supervisor not reaching out to the
students in such programs as a major flaw in the district’s recruiting work.
While Ms. Clark in Maine North attends job fairs for recruiting efforts, school
librarians are not a part of those efforts at this time. She would like to change that in
the future and be in contact with certification programs at the nearby universities to

205

establish better relationships with them and increase the district’s recruiting efforts.
While the library supervisor, Mr. Reynolds, does visit the students at the local
universities’ certification programs. However, he does not do this specifically for
recruiting, but instead visits as an expert and guest lecturer. Regardless of his intent,
his efforts are likely noticed by students in those programs. And though this is not a
formalized tactic for recruiting, it is likely of some benefit to what he sees as an
adequate number of candidates. Ms. Vosen, the library supervisor, takes this tactic in
Paris School District. She believes her relationships and visits with the students at
local universities are essential to her recruiting efforts.
Regarding the creation of cohorts, Ms. Grant of HR in Red Rock wants to do
more to get teachers in the district to get their library certification. However, one of
the district’s librarians, Ms. Nedry, said such efforts were unsuccessful in the past.
Ms. Murphy made no mention of creating such a cohort, so it may have either been in
the very early stages of planning or there may be poor communication occurring
between the district offices.
5.5 Unexpected Findings
5.5.1 Recruiting Minorities
Throughout all of librarianship, there is underrepresentation of minorities. On
average in the United States, school librarians were 90.3 percent white in 2009–2010,
in contrast to the general population of the U.S., which was 63.7 percent white in the
2010 Census. Organizations such as the American Library Association have worked

206

to correct this problem with programs such as the Spectrum Scholars, which provides
scholarships for minorities seeking their MLS. Throughout all the interviews, the only
person to mention issues with recruiting minority librarians was Mr. Reynolds in
Maine North School District.
The lack of emphasis in minority recruiting is indicative of a systemic
problem throughout the field. Even in districts that have no problems in recruiting,
equal opportunity employment should be a concern, particularly given the
demographics in some of these school districts. According to the 2010 U.S. Census,
only Cotesworth and Red Rock have student populations in which the percentage of
minority students is less than that of the national average. Maine North, Paris, and
Sunville all have a higher percentage of minority students than the national average.
Unless the school librarians in their districts are more diverse than the national
average (a demographic not measured in this study), there is a lack of minority
representation on the library staff in those districts.
5.5.2 Transfer Hires
Though the process of recruiting and hiring was informal in some districts, the
process of transferring from one school to another was more informal across all
districts. With transfer hires, principals may hire an individual with a verbal
confirmation and simply submit paperwork to HR later. Ms. Ziegler was an example
of this process in Cotesworth; she had a conversation with her principal and then
knew the position was hers. In the same district, Ms. Young had almost no contact

207

with HR during the course of her transfer process. With actions for transfer hires
happening mostly at the building level, it is not surprising that transfers were more
likely to occur in those districts using decentralized governance and SBDM, such as
Cotesworth and Sunville.
The transfer process relies on word-of-mouth recruiting. This practice was
generally true in Cotesworth; it was how Ms. Abbott found out about the position she
transferred to from her previous school in Paris; and it was how Ms. Johnson
completed her transfer in Maine North. Library supervisors, Mr. Reynolds and Ms.
Searle, both indicated that many potential transfers end up in their office to talk about
moving to the school library position from being a classroom teacher. They use these
conversations as opportunities to find out if the teacher really wants to be a librarian
or is just trying to escape the classroom. With the transfer process being so informal
in most districts, it is likely that a number of potential transferring employees do not
speak to the library supervisor. When the supervisor has not had the opportunity to
screen transfer hires before they move from the classroom to the library, it is more
likely that a person not fully capable of fulfilling the school library program’s mission
will end up there anyway. Nevertheless, as the HR representative in Cotesworth
casually stated, “You just can’t stop people, you know?”
Though provisional employment can have the most structured use of policies
and procedures, transfers are quite the opposite. The use of word-of-mouth and the
informal nature of the process can cause some uncertainty both at the district level
and for potential applicants. At the district level it can be difficult to track which

208

schools will need replacements when principals make changes without immediately
informing HR or the library supervisor. In this instance, it is also difficult to keep job
ads current so that applicants might know the possibilities for employment.
Where the process of transfer hires is more informal, the transfer process is
also more likely to lead to provisional employment. The transfer process relies
heavily on word-of-mouth, internal recruiting in the school district, and the efforts of
employees seeking new positions. These are all informal processes demonstrated in
many districts. With current employees sometimes having first access to news that a
position is becoming available, they might have the opportunity to reach out to a
principal before a job ad is even posted. This situation is true for not only librarians,
but also teachers who might fall under provisional employment.
The informal nature of transfer hires may also cause principals to forgo
necessary steps in hiring a qualified candidate. If a potential transfer approaches a
principal to fill the position before it has even been advertised, the principal may not
have had an opportunity to consider changes, future directions, or possibilities to
improve the school library program. Building-level administrators have very busy
schedules and are juggling numerous tasks and projects at the same time. If there is
no process in place, the easiest thing might be to fill a position with the first person
who comes along and appears at least as competent as the last person to hold the
position. In such a circumstance, when do things improve? When do the students
benefit from more than just what has been the status quo?

209

5.5.3 Provisional Employment
In K-12 education, policy dictates a number of situations in which teachers
who have not quite finished certification can be hired when circumstances require
them, such as the emergency situation of starting a school year without enough
teachers to fill every classroom. This situation can also happen with school librarians
and can cause districts to enact policies on provisional employment. In provisional
employment, an applicant or candidate may not be as fully qualified for employment
as a school librarian, but they are typically on their way to completing certification.
Multiple school districts had situations in which they dealt with provisional
employment.
Unlike other parts of the recruiting and hiring processes, provisional
employment may be highly regulated and dictated by specific policies at both the
district and state levels. Paris exemplified this practice with numerous extra measures
in place to ensure that all provisional employees were working toward certification.
Concerns that districts would disregard qualification requirements made it necessary
for extra paperwork to be filed and for HR to follow up with the state Board of
Education about the progress of individual employees in their school districts.
In Maine North, provisional employment is only considered when there is no
qualified staff available for hire. Though this may be the case in each school district,
HR in Maine North was the only district to point it out specifically. Additionally, the
candidate must have their teaching certificate, be currently enrolled in a library

210

certification program, and already have received at least nine credits toward their
certification.
Whereas the HR representative in Maine North wanted there to be more
opportunities to hire people provisionally, the library supervisor in Red Rock had to
convince HR that hiring school librarians provisionally was a necessity. Due to their
lack of certification, HR was unwilling to consider candidates for positions in the
district who had not yet completed their degree. With Red Rock at such a shortage of
candidates and staff, the library supervisor convinced HR that provisional
employment must be used to ensure staffing in all schools.
5.6 Implications and Contributions
5.6.1 Governance Archetypes
The IT governance framework was successfully used to analyze the decisionmaking processes used in recruiting and hiring school librarians. However, a district’s
choice in governance did not consistently use knowledge-fit in the determination of
input and decision rights. Without the use of knowledge-fit for determining the
structure of the decision-making process, the governance structure of some districts
does impede the ability of library supervisors to share their knowledge and have input
rights on recruiting and hiring. Site-based decentralization is demonstrated in a
district like Cotesworth, which provides no opportunity for the library supervisor to
participate in the hiring of a school librarian . Additionally, in this structure, a

211

principal can choose not to hire a school librarian at all and instead employ a library
aide.
While working in a completely site-based system does not allow for much
inclusion of the expertise of specialists like the library supervisor, a shift to input and
decision rights entirely at the district level with HR and/or library centralization is not
better for recruiting and hiring. Just as the library supervisor is likely more aware of
the specific qualities needed to work in the school library, building-level groups and
individuals provide input about the specific needs of the students in their school and
need to be involved in the decision. HR and the library supervisor should not be given
total decision rights without input from the building level.
Specific to the hiring processes of screening, interviewing, and selecting
candidates, governance was more likely to be based on placing decision rights at a
certain level of the district hierarchy over the location of specific knowledge, most
often resulting in site-based, decentralized governance for decision rights in all
districts. In some school districts, input rights did operate under collaborative
governance, with the library supervisor having the opportunity to contribute his or her
knowledge and expertise in advising on the hiring of school librarians. This
involvement included screening applicants to create a candidate pool, providing
feedback to principals and hiring panels about interview questions and candidate
responses, and partaking in hiring panels during site interviews.
In comparison, in districts that gave principals more autonomy through sitebased governance, principals were able to leave the library supervisor out of the

212

process entirely. Unless state policies required otherwise, complete site-based
governance in hiring allowed principals to change their allotments for school
librarians or hire librarians whose certification comes from passing a test and not
attending an LIS program.
In districts where supervisors did not participate in a screening of candidates,
supervisors noted the need to provide professional development to the new librarians
principals had hired who were not fully qualified or prepared to run a school library
program. Library supervisors who had the opportunity to screen candidates did not
mention the need to provide extra professional development for new hires. However,
even in collaborative governance, if principals were not required to involve someone
with expertise in school libraries, some chose not to do so. Requiring supervisors to
train unqualified individuals is not a valuable use of the library supervisor’s time or
an appropriate allocation of the district’s resources. Allowing principals to hire
individuals that lack experience when qualified librarians are available, is a disservice
to the students who could benefit from having a knowledgeable individual in the
library who is ready to teach about information and technology literacies, digital
citizenship, and a love of reading and learning for personal and professional
enrichment.
Unlike the hiring process, the decision-making process of recruiting is
affected by factors outside the district hierarchy and organizational structure. In the
recruiting process, the choice of governance is affected by a shortage or surplus of
candidates. In school districts where there is a surplus of candidates or a lack of

213

available positions, the governance of recruiting is site-based, allowing schools to
rely on word-of-mouth and job postings for recruiting school librarians. In districts
where there is a shortage of candidates, the governance of recruiting is centralized at
the district level, with input and decisions being split between HR and the library
supervisor. This district-level governance led to more structured recruiting and the
use of more targeted recruiting tactics.
However, even in these districts with centralized governance for recruiting
processes, there were multiple examples of a disconnect between the district-level
offices. Centralizing decision-making on recruiting to explore more options and
tactics was obfuscated by a lack of communication between the offices of HR and
library services. In districts with centralized decision-making, these offices gave
conflicting responses as to what the district was doing with recruiting and the ways in
which the district might improve the recruiting process. Even in situations where the
governance could allow of the library supervisor to provide more input and expertise,
their knowledge was not being used effectively.
5.6.2 Observing Separate Governance for Input and Decision Rights
Observing decision-making in these districts using the IT governance
framework—with a separation of input and decision rights—makes it easier to
understand how a district’s distribution of rights for the key decision events of
allotments; recruiting; screening, interviewing, and selecting candidates; and transfer
hires. With input and decision rights split across the identified key decisions in

214

recruiting and hiring, it is easier to determine where changes might positively affect
hiring practices. The separate observation and analysis of governance in input and
decisions rights allowed for a closer examination of the involvement of the different
parties in each step of the recruiting and hiring processes. As opposed to viewing a
district’s governance archetype unilaterally across the district (e.g., labeling a district
as being governed entirely through centralized decision-making), the theoretical
framework allowed for the school districts in this study to be observed as fluctuating
between archetypes depending on the decision being made.
When a district applies a governance structure that separates input and
decision rights, there is more opportunity to understand how the school district library
supervisor is or could possibly be involved in the decision-making process of
recruiting and hiring school librarians. In taking into account the possibility that
supervisors can assist in multiple stages of the process and provide information, the
possibilities for better decision-making processes is less about moving decision rights
for a final hire away from the principal or the building level, and essentially removing
the principal’s or school’s autonomy, and more about giving supervisors greater input
rights throughout the process. There is no need to argue about who gets to make the
final decision. The archetypes used by Weill and Ross (2004) allow for governance to
be evaluated and possibly altered at each stage, rather than just at the final decision.
For a district like Cotesworth, it is not about removing the autonomy that principals
have in making decisions about their school. Instead, it is about making sure those

215

decisions are informed by including those with the right knowledge-fit to have input
rights.
5.6.3 Policy and Practice
The issue of districts not having policies about recruiting, formal or informal,
is a concern. Policies and procedures, whether formal or informal, were not a part of
the governance of recruiting and hiring school librarians in these districts. In many
cases, participants at both the building and district levels were unaware of whether
policies existed. The exception to such ignorance was an awareness of policies
established by the state or board of education. However, those policies were not about
the recruiting and hiring processes, but about the legal concerns of hiring individuals
with the required certification.
The recruiting and hiring processes in these districts were mostly practicebased, with individuals at all levels functioning around the understanding of “this is
the way things are done.” Such practice results in districts frequently losing
institutional knowledge and new employees at the building and district levels
recreating practice again and again. Certainly there are occasions in which flexibility
in policy or procedure is a benefit, allowing different schools to go about recruiting
and hiring in different ways. However, when few individuals can point to policies or
procedures for recruiting and hiring, the amount of variation within a district can be
counter-productive, further fueled by breakdowns in communication and poor
transfers of institutional knowledge. Informal practices such as word-of-mouth

216

recruiting, informal inquiry about available positions for transfers, the posting of job
ads for positions that have already been filled, and informal screening interviews by
supervisors that are not acknowledge by HR all affect the fluidity of recruiting and
hiring processes and can make things more difficult for both the school district and
the potential applicants. Formal policies or procedures that also provide some
flexibility to schools and give opportunities for district input and site-based decision
making could help alleviate some of these problems and make the process easier for
those candidates trying to apply to a district.
5.6.4 Involvement and Knowledge Sharing
In the governance of recruiting and hiring, the use of knowledge-fit is more
about involvement of those with knowledge than knowledge sharing. There were only
a small number of examples of library supervisors sharing their knowledge with
principals, such as a supervisor providing a principal with interview questions. When
library supervisors were given the opportunity to lend their expertise, it was more
likely to occur in collaborative governance by using someone’s knowledge through
involvement, rather than specifically sharing knowledge between individuals. For
example, in an instance where a supervisor is asked to join a hiring panel, the
supervisor was not sharing knowledge with a principal or with others on the panel,
but their expertise in school libraries was being used and given voice through
involvement.

217

However, due to site-based governance throughout the recruiting and hiring
processes, there was neither knowledge sharing nor involvement of the library
supervisor in many instances. In districts where there was a shortage of candidates
and librarian positions were still open as the school year began, there were
opportunities to use the expertise of the library supervisor to concentrate recruiting
efforts, occasions of which districts were not taking advantage. Again, in districts that
model site-based governance and that place all input and decision rights at the
building level, they are giving principals the opportunity to eliminate the school
library position in the allotment phase or hire librarians that, while certified through
testing, may not have the same level of expertise as those who achieve certification
through LIS programs. The principals in districts who use site-based governance for
decision rights but call on the library supervisor for advisement professed how
valuable they found the supervisor’s expertise in evaluating candidates for hire.
One key part of knowledge sharing that is difficult to measure and observe is
if people understand whether they have enough knowledge to make a decision well
without any input from others. With some principals celebrating their autonomy, they
may think it unnecessary to enlist the assistance of others to provide input on a hiring
decision. However, as previous research in decision-making has shown, it is those
individuals with the least specialized knowledge who are most likely to take control
and make a decision on their own.

218

5.6.5 Evaluation of Processes
There were only a few instances in which districts were making any effort to
evaluate the effectiveness of decision-making and practice in their recruiting and
hiring processes. In particular, districts did not seek the views of the school librarians
who had been through the recruiting and hiring processes. Recently hired librarians
had a great deal to say about how their school districts could improve, but
administrators were not asking for their thoughts.
The lack of evaluation of recruiting and hiring practices in these districts is a
serious issue. There is little way for districts to improve their ability to recruit more
qualified individuals to school library positions if they do not determine what is
ineffective in their current practice. It is necessary for both district- and building-level
individuals to reflect on their recruiting and hiring practices, collect data on their
effectiveness, make alterations, and determine if those alterations make any
difference. Evaluation of practice should be passed on as institutional knowledge. It
should not be the responsibility of each new HR liaison in charge of recruiting school
librarians to rediscover what others have done in the past and determine what has
succeeded or failed. In particular, school districts are not using the evaluation
resource most available to them: the school librarians who have been recently hired in
their school district. In the interviews, these librarians had much to say about possible
improvements for recruiting and hiring as participants of this study, but few indicated
that their districts listened to their problems in going through the process.

219

5.6.6 Transfer Hires and Provisional Employment
While it was the intention of this study to focus on recruiting and hiring new
school librarians, the high frequency of transfer hires and provisional employment
was an unexpected addition to the findings. When a school district has a critical
shortage of applicants and open positions at the beginning of the school year, transfer
hires and provisional employment can be advantageous for ensuring that library
programs are staffed. However, with the exception of one district, the input and
decision rights for transfer hires operated under site-based governance, decentralizing
the process completely. In most cases, employees who made a transfer either within a
school or within the district to the library position went through a very informal
process with little or no contact with anyone at the district level. The high frequency
of transfer hires is in part due to the reliance on word-of-mouth, internal recruiting,
and the individual efforts of employees looking for a position. Rather than make an
effort to seek outside candidates, principals made more use of the suggestions of
others in their schools or current employees seeking out a transfer when they heard
that a position was available. The library supervisor was almost never involved in the
process of hiring transfers, which leaves the process vulnerable to the hiring of
unqualified individuals when a principal does not have any expertise in the needs of
the school library program. More than one human resources representative voiced
concern about how difficult it can be to intervene in the site-based, decentralized
governance of transfer hires when the district does not create or enforce policies that
allow for the involvement of district-level individuals in the process.

220

5.6.7 Hiring Other Specialists in K-12 Education
In the K-12 educational system, school librarians are not entirely unique as
individuals in the district with special skills working alongside teachers. There is
opportunity for the evaluation and application of governance for decision-making to
not only benefit the recruiting and hiring processes for school librarians, but many
types of specialists working in schools. As examples, special education teachers, sitebased social workers or counselors, guidance counselors, physical education teachers,
instructional specialists, and literacy coaches all take part in their own individual
programs that work in collaboration with or as complimentary to classroom
instruction. These specialists typically have additional certification requirements or
specialized skill sets necessary for their position. It is unrealistic for a principal to be
knowledgeable in all of these areas. However, if a district uses entirely site-based
decentralized governance for recruiting and hiring, it becomes the principal’s
responsibility to hire all of these individuals. As with the recruiting and hiring of
school librarians, by establishing a governance structure that allots some input rights
to district specialists with knowledge in those particular areas, there is the possibility
of improving recruiting hiring practices for multiple specialists in the school district.,
not just the school librarians. The library supervisor, Ms. Searle, of Sunville School
District pointed to the hiring of instructional coaches in her district’s schools that
already have collaborative governance in place for decision-making for those hires.

221

5.7 Limitations
The following are limitations for this study:
Availability of Principals: There was low participation in this study for
principals, who are a vital part of the recruiting and hiring processes. With so many
districts having input or decision rights in site-based governance and at the buildinglevel, the findings lack a diversity of insight from principals. In two school districts, I
was unable to interview any principals, leaving out their important perspective on the
recruiting and hiring processes.
Relying on Participant Referrals from Library Supervisors: With no
partnership with these districts beyond being approved to conduct research, I was
dependent on supervisors to suggest other individuals who might participate in the
study. While this situation was not an issue for identifying the HR representatives
typically working on hiring school librarians, it posed an issue for school librarians
and principals. Using the suggestions of the supervisor could have resulted in bias
toward individuals with whom the supervisor has a good professional relationship.
This bias may have been mitigated to some degree by the requirement of including
only recent hires, but it still presents the limitation of not hearing from those
individuals who may not have responded to the supervisors’ requests for
participation.
District Differences: I made attempts to select districts as similar as possible
for the study to eliminate differences in variables beyond the involvement of
supervisors. However, there were still major differences due to the availability of

222

districts to participate in the study. For instance, Maine North has a much larger,
more diverse student population and is in a more urban area than Cotesworth. The
differences among districts likely contribute to some differences in practice. A district
like Maine North is more restrictive in communication between district-level and
building-level administrators than is Cotesworth. These differences could be reflected
in policies or practices that are unrelated to the factors presented in this study.
5.8 Future Research
This study offers a beginning for how future research might look at the
recruiting and hiring practices of school librarians. With a better understanding of the
tasks involved, the effect of district governance on decision-making, and the use of
knowledge to assign input and decision rights, it is possible to look at how all of these
factors affect the librarians being hired. The clear next step in this research process is
to look at the hiring process that school librarians went through and connect those
recruiting and hiring practices with the measurable outcomes of hiring:


school librarian success, retention, and attrition;



the quality of school library program services, outreach, and involvement
in a school;



and the perceptions of the success of the school librarian and the library
program as seen from students, teachers, administrators, parents, and other
community stakeholders.

223

Future research should also look at student achievement in the school and
engagement in the library program.
In particular, more research needs to be done on the effectiveness of recruiting
efforts and the reliance of schools and districts on transfer hires, as opposed to
looking outside of the school district for new talent. There are few established
practices and protocols in recruiting school librarians and almost no efforts in
evaluating current practice to see where changes could be made. With so many
districts across the country facing a shortage of applicants for school library positions,
this issue is critical. With more knowledge now available about the differences in
decision-making in recruiting based on school district appeal, the lack of involvement
of building-level administrators, and the informal nature of most recruiting, future
research could better include such factors in the evaluation of the recruiting process
and suggest adjustments that could be made by districts.
The personality of individuals and the culture of a school district, beyond the
structures for policy and decision-making, must also play a role in decision-making in
school districts. It cannot be forgotten that districts do not make decisions, individuals
and committees make those decisions. While the organizational structure can affect
many things, the individual can also have influence. For example, the library
supervisors Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Murphy, are almost polar opposites in their
approaches to dealing with other district administrators. The way they conduct their
jobs is not entirely structured by the governance of the school district. Their
personalities, and the ways in which their districts’ cultures respond to those

224

personalities, play a role in the decision-making process. The question becomes, what
exactly is it about personality that affects the decision-making process? Are these
differences in personality about character traits or learned skills in leadership and
management? I did not conduct any personality or skills assessments as a part of this
study, so the ramifications of traits and skills in leadership, coercion, manipulation,
inspiration, and numerous other possibilities have not been measured. As in all
organizations, whether autocratic or anarchic, such factors likely play some role.
Future research should also replicate the use of this governance framework in
other areas of decision-making in education. This model can be used to analyze the
hiring practices of other specialists in K-12 education, such as instructional coaches,
guidance counselors, school counselors, and other specialists that work with students
and teachers at the building level. Additionally, the use of an established governance
model that incorporates the knowledge-fit of groups and individuals into decisionmaking processes can be applied in numerous other places in the district, school, and
classroom where specific knowledge is necessary for successful outcomes. These
may include the decision-making processes surrounding curriculum design,
accountability, professional development of staff and faculty, the mental and physical
health of students, STEM programs, and many other areas.
5.9 Conclusion
This study examines the decision-making processes surrounding the recruiting
and hiring of school librarians, using a theoretical framework from IT governance

225

that analyzes the use of knowledge-fit in the assignment of input and decision rights.
While the theoretical framework is applicable, the school districts participating in this
study did not use knowledge-fit to determine governance for where input and decision
rights should be placed. In the hiring process, governance was based on placing the
decision at a certain level of the district hierarchy, namely at the building level for
site-based decision-making and autonomy. In recruiting, governance was established
in relation to a district’s needs based on a surplus or shortage of applicants and the
number of available positions. In instances of governance in both recruiting and
hiring, the knowledge of the library supervisor—the person at the district level with
the most knowledge about the work of the school librarian—was often left out of the
process entirely. With many principals and district employees unaware of how an
effective library program is run, conducting recruiting and hiring without the
expertise of someone like the library supervisor could have serious consequences to
the opportunities available to students for learning information, technology, and
reading literacies. This study indicates a way to look at those decision-making
processes, providing valuable information to conduct future research on changing
those processes to better serve students and K-12 education.
