ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Dr. Rachael Waller inspired this journey. Without her mentorship, guidance, and
encouragement, I would not have started on this path. I owe her immense gratitude.
Throughout my doctoral journey, Dr. Joyce Herbeck, my committee chair, has
mentored, supported, and encouraged me. I would not be where I am or who I am without
her. The words thank you are insufficient to express my deep gratitude to her.
Likewise, the rest of my dissertation committee, Dr. Art Bangert, Dr. Ann
Ewbank, Dr. David Henderson, and Dr. Sarah Schmitt-Wilson, have supported,
encouraged, and mentored me throughout my four years at Montana State University. My
entire committee has my deepest thanks for not only the time they have invested, but also
for inspiring me, challenging me, and helping me to grow into who I am today.
My colleagues at Montana State University-Billings deserve many thanks for
helping me persist and providing me with advice through this challenging but amazing
year; I was a new full-time faculty member while working on my dissertation. I
especially thank Dr. Kari Dahle-Huff, Dr. Cindy Dell, and Dr. Rachael Waller for
feedback, advice, support, and long talks that helped me figure out new insights.
Although I am so grateful to all of my relatives for shaping me, loving me,
guiding me, and supporting me, my mom, Renee Bulatowicz, deserves special thanks.
She helped me look up school websites for potential participants, checked numbers and
calculations for quantitative data, and looked over my entire dissertation.
I am also thankful for the love, support, and encouragement of my friends, as
well as for all of the laughter and fun. I am lucky to have so much love in my life.

GLOSSARY
Bisexual
Some people who are bisexual feel attraction for males and females equally, while
others are more attracted to one sex than another, or more romantically attracted to one,
and more sexually attracted to the other (Bisexuality, 2001; Hocker, 2010).

Cisgender
A cisgender person identifies with the gender assigned to him/her based upon
his/her sex (Catalano & Griffin, 2016).

Critical Literacy
Critical literacy serves as a transformative lens through which to examine texts
more closely in order to explore the power differentials in the text and in society, as well
as other social justice issues (Vasquez & Vasquez, 2012).

Diversity
Diversity refers to race/ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, gender identity
or expression, disabilities, socioeconomic status, and family situation (adoption, married
parents, single parents, divorced parents, foster family, and more).

Gay
A gay man is attracted to members of the same sex romantically, emotionally,
intellectually, and sexually. (Gay, 2005).

xii
GLOSSARY CONTINUED

Gender
Many individuals and organizations conflate sex and gender, though they are
separate constructs. Cultures may base expectations, roles, behaviors, and more upon
specific sexes (male, female, and intersex) that are often assigned at birth based on
genitalia. These expectations form the culture's definition of particular genders
(American Psychological Association, 2012).

Gender Identity
Gender identity refers to the gender with which one self-identifies. It may be
different from or the same as the gender expected based on one’s sex (American
Psychological Association, 2012; Gender Identity, 2009).

Hegemony
Hegemony refers to the processes by which supremacy is maintained and
reinforced. Through hegemonic systems, majoritized identities receive greater power and
privileges and appear “natural” or “default,” while minoritized identities are suppressed
(Davis & Harrison, 2013).

Heterosexual
A heterosexual person is exclusively attracted to people of a different sex
(Heterosexual, 2013).

xiii
GLOSSARY CONTINUED

Interest Convergence
Interest convergence refers to the ways in which the majoritized group allows
gains for minoritized groups when those gains will also benefit the group in power
(Delgado & Stefancic, 2012).

Lesbian
A lesbian woman is attracted exclusively to other women on various levels
including romantic, emotional, intellectual, and sexual (Lesbian, 2011; Serovich &
Smith, 2004).

LGBT
LGBT stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. Some people and
organizations use different terms to refer to this group, such as LGBTQ (which includes
queer and/or questioning) and longer acronyms that include a greater variety of identities.
The researcher chose to use LGBT, though it does not specifically include the variety of
identities in this community; this decision reflects the limited depiction of characters in
children’s books who belong to this community as well as the wording of the survey
questions.

xiv
GLOSSARY CONTINUED

Majoritized
A majoritized identity refers to an identity that has more power and privilege than
others in a particular context. This identity often constitutes the “norm” or “default”
identity (Chappell & Cahnmann-Taylor, 2013).

Minoritized
A minoritized identity has been rendered as such by society; the status as
minoritized depends on the context. Identities typically minoritized in the United States
include LGBT people, people of color, people with disabilities, and more (Chappell &
Cahnmann-Taylor, 2013).

Self-Censorship
Self-censorship occurs when someone chooses not to purchase material due to
fear of challenges, concern about reactions, or personal biases (Rickman, 2010; Sloan,
2012; Whelan, 2009).

Sexual Orientation
Sexual orientation refers to one’s abiding romantic, sexual, emotional, and
intellectual attraction (Finkel-Konigsberg, 2010; Manning, 2011; Sexual Orientation,
2009) and does not necessarily refer to behavior (Finkel-Konigsberg, 2010). It manifests
itself in attraction to only one sex (heterosexual or homosexual) or to more than one sex
(bisexual) (Finkel-Konigsberg, 2010; Manning, 2011; Sexual Orientation, 2009).

xv
GLOSSARY CONTINUED

Transgender
Someone who is transgender identifies with or shows characteristics of a gender
that is different from the gender expectations for the sex assigned at birth (Ruspini, 2011;
Transgender, 2011).

ABSTRACT
Published children’s literature in the United States overrepresents some identities
while underrepresenting others, such as people of color, LGBT people, people with
disabilities, people who live below the poverty line (Crisp et al., 2016), and more. Thus,
some children may not encounter text representative of their identities. As literature can
assist with identity development and provide ways for children to learn about those who
differ from self, the lack of diversity in children’s books disadvantages children with
minoritized and majoritized identities (Bishop, 2012; Koss, 2015; Lifshitz, 2016;
Schachter & Galili-Schachter, 2012).
School librarians function as gatekeepers through the purchase and promotion of
various texts. The decisions made by these gatekeepers may enable greater access to
representative literature or may limit access. This illustrative case study with a
descriptive survey examines the frequency with which librarians promote diverse
literature, their comfort level doing so, and how they describe the factors that impact their
decisions regarding diverse text.
The researcher created an online survey on Qualtrics with both quantitative and
qualitative questions and emailed 1,137 elementary school librarians in Idaho, Montana,
New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming to request participation in the survey. One hundred
and sixteen librarians completed the survey. Eight participants self-selected for
interviews. Librarians felt most uncomfortable promoting books with LGBT characters,
and were most likely to “never” promote these books than any other type of diverse
identity listed in the survey. Two main themes emerged from this study: internal and
external factors impact librarian decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts,
and some librarians may self-censor purchase and/or promotion of diverse texts.
This study offers insight into the factors that impact librarian decision making, as
well as how frequently librarians promote diverse texts and their comfort level promoting
diverse literature. The study concludes with an examination of the implications from this
study, including lack of available texts reflective of LGBT identities, a possible need for
training regarding intellectual freedom and the librarian code of ethics, and the impacts of
budget issues. Finally, recommendations for future studies are explored, which may
further illuminate this under-researched area.

1
CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
“When marginalized groups in society are absent from the stories a nation
tells about itself, or when media images are rooted primarily in stereotype,
inequality is normalized and is more likely to be reinforced over time
through our prejudices and our practices” (Bunche Center, 2014, p. 5).
Language has the power to shape reality; exclusion of groups from texts implies a
devaluation of those groups and sends an implicit message of their inherent inferiority
(Koss, 2015). These ideas are reinforced by socialization, through which individuals
internalize hegemony and unconsciously replicate it via words and actions (Adams &
Zúñiga, 2016). Hegemonies thus appear natural, rather than created to benefit particular
groups (Adams & Zúñiga, 2016). The publishing industry participates in furthering
hegemony when it reproduces socially-constructed hierarchies, overrepresenting some
identities while underrepresenting others (Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Taxel, 2002).
Children’s and young adult literature published in the United States tends to lack
diversity (Crisp, Knezek, Quinn, Bingham, Girardeau, & Starks, 2016). Thus, children
may not find representations of themselves and/or others in books. The Cooperative
Children’s Book Center (CCBC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison receives a
majority of newly published children’s literature each year and provides a breakdown of
the number of books with main or other significant characters of different races, the
number of books written by authors of different races, and the total number of books
received that year. Representation in text has increased in the past few years (see Figure
1.1). For example, in 2013, 7.91% of the books received by the CCBC featured

2
significant characters of color or American Indian characters, but in 2015, 14.88% did,
and in 2016, 21.65% did (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017).

Even though representation of minoritized racial groups has increased, White
characters remain overrepresented in children’s books, particularly considering
demographics (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017; Crisp et al., 2016). Starting in
the 2014-2015 school year, White students comprised slightly fewer than half of the
students in public schools. Although The National Center for Educational Statistics
(2016) does not have actual percentages for any year after 2013, it has projected data for
the 2016-2017 school year. The projected data estimate that 48.8% of students in public
schools identify as White, 15.5% as Black, 26.4% as Hispanic, 5.4% as Asian/Pacific
Islander, 1% as American Indian/Alaska Native, and 2.9% as two or more races.

3
Comparison of these demographics with the representation in literature received
by the CCBC in the past three years shows disparities for most categories (see Figure
1.2). Although two categories show a higher percentage of books received by the CCBC
representative of those identities, that does not mean that children have access to those
texts. When, for example, 1.6% percent of the books received by the CCBC have
American Indian characters (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017), that percentage
remains low and may mean that librarians, teachers, or children have difficulty locating
inclusive texts that do not contain stereotypes.
The demographic categories do not precisely match between the CCBC and The
National Center for Educational Statistics, as the former does not have a category for two
or more races, and uses Latino instead of Hispanic. Even though they are often used
interchangeably (Naidoo, 2007), these terms differ. Latino refers to someone from Latin
America, while Hispanic means someone from a Spanish-speaking country. Thus, the
categories might not completely align, and neither resource included both terms.

In addition to overrepresentation of White main characters in children’s literature,
other majoritized identities likewise experience greater representation, such as
heterosexual and/or cisgender identities. Few books with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or
transgender (LGBT) characters are published each year. Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan
(2014) found an average of one book with LGBT characters published per year for
intermediate (third through sixth) grades. Lo (2014) found more representation of LGBT
characters in young adult literature, with 47 books published by mainstream (including
small, independent) publishers in 2014, an increase over the 29 published in 2013. Lo
(2013) also states

5
Looking into the numbers of LGBT YA being published by major
commercial publishers in the US today, I can only conclude that yes,
major commercial publishers do publish LGBT YA — but not very much
of it. An average of 15 LGBT YA titles per year from the US’s nine
biggest publishers is very low. (para. 31)
Unfortunately, publication statistics do not exist for some minoritized groups, though
researchers have noted a lack of representation for various identities (Crisp et al., 2016).

Publishing Industry
The paucity of diverse children’s literature has become more well-known
recently, due to various authors and other individuals and organizations discussing this
topic. For instance, The We Need Diverse Books movement and organization advocates
for greater diversity in published children’s books and in the publishing industry (We
Need Diverse Books, 2017). To facilitate this, organizations such as We Need Diverse
Books and Lee and Low Books support scholarships for internships in the publishing
industry as well as contests for diverse stories and authors and more, in an effort to
diversify the publishing industry (Low, 2016; We Need Diverse Books, 2016). The
American Library Association’s Banned Books Week focused on diverse books in 2016,
which also provided a spotlight on the lack of diversity in published literature as well as
the frequency with which diverse literature faces challenges (Jacoby, 2016).
The publishing industry, like many corporations, exists to make money (Taxel,
2002; Yenika-Agbaw, 2014). Thus, publishers tend to focus on those books which they
believe will sell (Koss 2015; Taxel, 2002). This may exclude diverse books, due to the
perceptions of not only the publishing industry but also booksellers. Lo (2013) mentioned

6
hearing a pervasive belief that books with LGBT characters will not sell. Other authors
have noted hearing a perception that only people who belong to a particular racial/ethnic
group will purchase books about that group (Low, 2013). As the director of the CCBC
states, “[a]nd more than one publisher has told me that they’ve heard Barnes & Noble
buyers say that Black books don’t sell. And then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy:
How can the books sell if they are not on the shelves?” (Horning, 2014, para. 15).
Most people in the publishing industry, including book reviewers, are White,
heterosexual, cisgender, women, and/or do not have a disability (Low, 2016). “…[I]n
publishing’s case, what is at work is the tendency—conscious or unconscious—for
executives, editors, marketers, sales people, and reviewers to work with, develop, and
recommend books by and about people who are like them” (Low, 2016, para. 29). The
publishing industry has added additional imprints focusing upon particular minoritized
groups, as well as hiring executives from minoritized groups to head the imprints
(Domonoske, 2015; Gibbs, 2016). This may help change the landscape of children’s
literature, albeit slowly.

Importance of Diverse Literature

Children need to encounter texts that reflect their identities as well as texts that
provide views of others’ identities (Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Turner, 2016). Literature
affords a vehicle for identity validation and development (Schachter & Galili-Schachter,
2012), and can provide a way for children to learn about others, promoting empathy
(Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Campbell, 2010; Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan, 2013; Koss,

7
2015; Lifshitz, 2016). Depending on the way in which the reader positions him or
herself, any text may provide a mirror, window, and/or door for the reader.

Mirrors, Windows, and Doors
Literature helps readers understand themselves and others. Botelho and Rudman
(2009) state, “literature can authentically mirror or reflect one’s life; look through a
window to view someone else’s world; and open doors offering access both to and out of
one’s everyday condition” (p. xiii). Books that are mirrors reflect aspects of self and can
promote greater self-esteem and a sense of belonging (Agosto, 2007; Anderson, 2013;
Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Campbell, 2010; Gray, 2009; Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan,
2013; Hope, 2008; Smolkin & Young, 2011). Mirror books provide opportunities to
connect to texts, which allow readers to better engage with literature. This may lead to
greater enjoyment of literature, contribute to identity-validation, and enhance reading
comprehension (Delpit, 2006; Hefflin & Barksdale-Ladd, 2001; Rich, 2012; Tschida,
Ryan, & Ticknor, 2014). Moreover, having diverse literature available in a classroom or
school library provides a more welcoming, safer atmosphere for students (Agosto, 2007;
Lifshitz, 2016).
Unfortunately, not all readers encounter literature that authentically reflects their
identities (Tschida, Ryan, & Ticknor, 2014; Turner, 2016). Those who do not encounter
mirrors in texts may disengage or may feel as though their identities have less value or
that they are different, insignificant, or invisible (Gray, 2009; Hermann-Wilmarth &
Ryan, 2013; Naidoo, 2012; Rich, 2012). “Kids who are regarded by their peers and even
by themselves as being somehow ‘other’ need to see themselves in books to know they

8
are not alone” (Cart, 2012, para. 11). The lack of diversity in children’s literature
(Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017; Hehrlich, 2015) makes it challenging for
minoritized groups to find books that mirror aspects of their identities. This affects their
views of who belongs in text; when they do not see their identities in text, they may feel
that people like themselves have no place in literature.
The lack of diversity likewise impacts the ability of some children to see identities
that differ from their own. As Zetta Elliot said, “If a child grows up seeing themselves
over and over and over again and they never see anyone else, they almost begin to think
of themselves as the center of the universe” (Ushery, 2014). However, when readers
encounter texts that portray the lives of others (windows), they have the opportunity to
view other identities and worlds. This may encourage empathy and mitigate prejudice.
People may fear or devalue the unfamiliar; however, when they recognize similarities in
experiences, they may start feeling more comfortable with—and appreciative of—
differences. Additionally, readers may start forming connections with characters that
differ from self, and recognize common experiences in the human condition (Anderson,
2013; Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Campbell, 2010; Gardner, 2008; Glazier & Seo, 2005;
Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan, 2013; Lifshitz, 2016; Smolkin & Young, 2011; Wolf, 2004).

Identity Development through Literature
“[A]s they engage texts, readers are engaging in processes of personal identity
development” (Schachter & Galili-Schachter, 2012, p.3). Therefore, one way to facilitate
identity development is through the use of diverse literature in the classroom or school
library so that all students have the opportunity to engage with literature that functions as

9
mirrors, windows, and doors (Blackburn & Buckley, 2005; Glazier & Seo, 2005; Gray,
2009; Koss, 2015; Tschida, Ryan, & Ticknor, 2014; We Need Diverse Books, n.d.). As
the majority of children’s books published in the United States have White, heterosexual,
able-bodied, neurotypical, cisgender main characters, many children do not find aspects
of themselves reflected in literature (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017; Crisp et
al., 2016; Hehrlich, 2015; Lo, 2014; Lo, 2015; We Need Diverse Books, n.d.). Texts have
power to convey what is important as well as what is not; this includes which identities
are valued and valuable, and conversely which are marginalized and unimportant. For
example, “[o]ne key way that schools condone homophobia, discrimination, or
devaluation of individuals who identify as LGBTQ is by failing to include LGBTQ
literature in the curriculum” (Van Horn, 2015, p.4).
Children who feel marginalized or excluded from text may find joy when finally
encountering a text that reflects an aspect of their identities. KaaVonia Hinton (2004)
stated, “For the first time in my life, I realized I was not alone in the world…This one
simple act—handing me a book written by and about Blacks—changed my life” (Hinton
& Berry, 2004, p. 285). Thus, teachers who select books that reflect a variety of identities
and provide mirrors, windows, and doors for all of their students provide a space for textengaged identity recognition, validation, and development.

Problem
Published children’s literature in the United States lacks diversity (Cooperative
Children’s Book Center, 2017; Crisp et al., 2016; Hehrlich, 2015). This leads to

10
circumstances in which some children rarely (if ever) see their identities reflected in text,
which negatively impacts them (Gray, 2009; Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan, 2013; Koss,
2015; Naidoo, 2012; Rich, 2012). Likewise, those who constantly find representation
may remain unaware of perspectives and identities that differ from their own (Elliot in
Ushery, 2014).
The production and dissemination of text does not occur within a vacuum.
Cultural and personal ideologies infuse text, consciously or unconsciously (Botelho &
Rudman, 2009). Publishing decisions likewise occur within and are influenced by
broader social and political ideologies, as well as hegemony (Botelho & Rudman, 2009;
Taxel, 2002). Inclusion in literature normalizes some identities and presents them as
desirable. Likewise, identities that infrequently (if at all) find representation in text are
positioned by their absence as having less value than others. Children notice when their
lived experiences and identities are excluded from text; this sends a message that these
identities and experiences are not important enough to warrant inclusion (Jones, 2008;
Koss, 2015; Shimanoff, Elia, & Yep, 2012).
Children’s books can reinforce multiple systems of oppression (Taylor, 2012).
The ways in which texts represent characters can validate some identities while
reinforcing the oppression of others (Taylor, 2012). When the books encountered by
children feature negative messages and/or stereotypes about identities, readers who do
not engage in critical literacy may passively accept those messages (Botelho & Rudman,
2009). Encountering negative messages about one’s own identity can lead to internalized
prejudice (Wilmarth & Ryan, 2013; Naidoo, 2012; Rich, 2012). Thus, educators and

11
librarians must find positive representations of multiple identities so that students can
access texts that function as mirrors, windows, and doors. “All children deserve to see
themselves and the people they love represented (in multiple ways) in the books we bring
into our classrooms” (Crisp et al., 2016, p. 40).

Purpose and Significance of the Study

School librarians may value inclusion of diverse literature in elementary school
libraries. However, barriers may exist, including a lack of awareness regarding specific
types of diversity included in or excluded from available texts (Wollman-Bonilla, 1998).
Those who have privileged identities and thus constantly find representation may accept
it as normal and not realize that some identities lack representation (Crisp, 2014;
Franklin, Boyd-Franklin, & Kelly, 2006; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998). Completion of this
survey may spark reflection upon the inclusion and/or exclusion of groups from books
within a school library, as noted by some participants in the pilot studies.
Decisions made by teachers and school librarians affect the availability of diverse
texts (Wollman-Bonilla, 1998). Many factors influence these decisions; some may
engage in the selective tradition for a variety of reasons (Jacobson, 2016), including
comfort level with diverse groups (Ringel, 2016). Sometimes decisions result in few
inclusive books. “Unfortunately, the types of multicultural books where children see
these cultural differences and similarities are not always incorporated into our literacy
curricula in elementary schools, and some teachers think they cannot or should not
include diverse stories in their literacy instruction” (Turner, 2016, p. 126). While some

12
people consciously choose to exclude diverse books, others may do so unconsciously.
Additionally, even those who deliberately exclude representative texts may not consider
the roots of decisions or ramifications of these choices (Wollman-Bonilla, 1998).
However, few published studies have examined the numerous factors that influence
teachers’ and school librarians’ decisions regarding inclusion of diverse literature,
especially in the past few decades (Friese, Alvermann, Parkes, & Rezak, 2008; Watkins
& Ostenson, 2015). The current political climate, the increase in book challenges to
diverse texts (Ringel, 2016), and the national education landscape—including Common
Core State Standards and increased focus on standardized tests scores—may impact
teachers’ and librarians’ decisions regarding literature selection (Friese et al., 2008;
Watkins & Ostenson, 2015), though this remains relatively unexplored in published
research.
Children need literature that provides mirrors to reflect self, windows through
which to view others, and doors to promote engagement with those who differ from self
(Botelho & Rudman, 2009). Literature that functions as mirrors, windows, or doors can
promote greater connection to and engagement with text, as well as mitigate prejudice
(Anderson, 2013; Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Campbell, 2010; Hermann-Wilmarth &
Ryan, 2013; Koss, 2015; Smolkin & Young, 2011; Turner, 2016). Therefore, the types of
books available or not available greatly impact children. Though comparatively few
diverse books are published each year (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017),
school librarians may seek out books inclusive of diversity to better represent their
students and the world. However, few published studies have investigated the diversity of

13
main characters in books used in classrooms or in school libraries or comfort level with
diversity in texts. The published studies that have examined these topics tend to focus on
one aspect of diversity; currently no published studies exist that examine all the types of
diversity included in this study, nor do published studies exist that examine these issues
in elementary school libraries in the mountain region of the United States. This
illustrative case study (GAO, 1990) with a descriptive survey examines the frequency
with which librarians promote diverse literature, their comfort level doing so, and the
factors that impact their decisions regarding diverse text, and aims to provide some
insight into this understudied area.

Research Questions

1. How frequently do elementary school librarians promote books with diverse main
characters in terms of race, disability, family structure, socio-economic status,
sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion?
2. How do elementary school librarians describe the factors that influence their
decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts?

Limitations and Delimitations

Every research study has limitations and delimitations that impact the study and
influence methodology, results, and interpretations. While researchers have little control
over limitations (Gay, Mills, & Airasian, 2009), delimitations occur due to researcher

14
choice. The survey instrument itself has both limitations and delimitations, as do other
aspects of the study.

Limitations
Survey research has various limitations. First, survey respondents may select
answers that they deem socially acceptable, rather than ones that reflect their actual
beliefs or practices. Since respondents voluntarily answer the survey, can stop at any
time, and have anonymity, this might help them feel more comfortable answering in ways
that reflect beliefs and practices. However, those who were willing to complete the
survey may have different views and/or experiences than those who were not willing to
complete the survey. Some items on the survey are similar, which may cause respondents
to fall into a routine when answering the items or to become fatigued. Respondents can
stop the survey at any time, and may come back to finish the survey later if they feel
fatigued. Additionally, when a scale is presented, some people tend to choose something
at the end of the scale rather than in the middle. Furthermore, a survey conducted within a
specific timeframe provides information dependent upon that specific time period (Alreck
& Settle, 2004; Gay, Mills, & Airasian, 2009).
Likewise, answers to interview questions refer to that specific time period in
which the interview occurs. Some individuals chose not to participate in interviews; those
who did may have different experiences and/or opinions than those who did not. The
wording of questions, the interactions between the interviewer and the interviewee, and
the level of trust can impact the ways in which interviewees respond. Likewise,
interviewees may have a desire to answer in a way that they deem more socially

15
acceptable or that they feel the researcher wants them to answer. Researcher bias may
impact the way the researcher asks questions and/or reacts to answers given by the
interviewee (Alshenqeeti 2014).
Some of the terms are ones with which the respondents may be unfamiliar. For
example, some people are unfamiliar with the terms heterosexual and cisgender (defined
on the survey) and may not realize that characters are assumed to be heterosexual or
cisgender unless explicitly mentioned otherwise. Additionally, majoritized identities are
typically positioned as the default identities and not explicitly named (Crisp, 2014;
Jiménez, 2015). For instance, most books do not indicate the skin color or sexual
orientation of a character unless that character has a minoritized identity (Jiménez, 2015).
Therefore, respondents who may frequently include texts representative of majoritized
identities may not realize that they include these, such as when some respondents in the
pilot studies indicated that they never included books with heterosexual or cisgender
characters, despite most books having heterosexual and cisgender characters.
Another limitation concerns the number of respondents. This study only has 116
participants, which represents only a 10.20% response rate. Thus, the data in this study
cannot be generalized.

Delimitations
This study does not include all types of diverse identities. Although myriad other
forms of diversity exist—such as language/dialect, immigration, etc.—this study focused
on family diversity, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, socioeconomic
status, and religion. The researcher selected these types of diversity because children’s

16
literature awards exist for the majority of these types of diversity, as well as the
suggestions from experts who reviewed the survey. Survey length also factored into the
selection of types of diversity to include in this survey, as the researcher felt concerned
about possible survey fatigue. Other types of diversity can be included in future studies
done by this researcher or others.
The researcher sent this survey to elementary school librarians in the mountain
region of the United States. This region was selected due to time constraints, feasibility,
and familiarity to the researcher who resides in one of the states. The mountain region
consists of eight states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah,
and Wyoming. These states may have different characteristics from the general
population of the United States, and thus the population of elementary school librarians
who completed the survey may differ from the general population.
Some of these states maintain directories of schools, while others do not. Some
directories are more detailed than others. These factors may inadvertently lead to some
elementary school librarians not receiving an email invitation to participate in the survey.
Although Montana has a general directory of school librarians, the other seven states do
not. Wyoming and New Mexico have a list of schools from which one can search for
elementary schools and find contact information. However, for these three states, the
research may have unintentionally missed some schools through the search option. Thus,
not all elementary school librarians in these states may have received an email invitation
to complete the survey.

17
Nevada has a list from 2010, but personal correspondence with the assistant
administrator in the Nevada State Library directed the researcher to contact people for
each of the seventeen school districts in Nevada (T. Westergard, personal
communication, December 20, 2016). Since the school librarians in each district would
not be directly emailed by the researcher, there would be no way of knowing whether all
elementary school librarians received an emailed invitation to participate in the survey.
Thus, the researcher chose to not contact librarians in this state.
Utah and Idaho had a database of elementary school librarians, though this
database did not include email addresses. Utah had some school websites listed, though
not all of the links worked. A Google search was conducted to attempt to find
information for all of the schools; sometimes no information was located beyond a
physical address and/or phone number. As this is an online survey, the decision was
made to contact librarians through email. However, this resulted in the researcher not
contacting some elementary school librarians for participation in this survey. Likewise,
some schools do not have librarians listed, which means no one from those schools
received an invitation to participate in the survey.
Colorado has a database of schools, but it was not clear whether this information
is current, and the researcher did not get a response from the state departments contacted
regarding the database. Thus, Colorado was excluded from the study. Likewise, Arizona
had no database of schools. The researcher did not receive a response from the state
departments contacted either, and Arizona was excluded from the study.

18
Four states—Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming—had individuals who
agreed to email the survey link to school librarians on a listserv for the state. As Idaho
indicated there was no list, the researcher did not contact Idaho to ask whether they
would email the survey. However, this means that individuals beyond elementary school
librarians may have received a link to the survey. It also means that the numbers of
individuals invited to participate may not be completely accurate for the study; not all
librarians choose to participate in listservs, and not all of the librarians on the listservs
received an invitation from the researcher, as the listservs include middle and high school
librarians.
Based on the ease of gathering information, Montana, New Mexico, and
Wyoming were contacted first. When few responded to the survey, the researcher chose
to include Idaho and Utah, but the emails went out almost two weeks after the emails to
the first three states; the survey was left open longer to provide more time for respondents
from Idaho and Utah. However, this means that the school librarians in the first three
states had more time to respond to the survey.

Summary
Published children’s literature reinforces hegemony through the
overrepresentation of majoritized identities and underrepresentation of minoritized
identities (Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Taxel, 2002). Although this lack of diversity has
become more widely-discussed in the past several years, few studies have examined
librarians’ promotion of diverse literature. A gap also exists in the research literature

19
regarding comfort level with various types of minoritized identities, as well as decision
making regarding diverse texts. This study aims to provide insight into how elementary
school librarians decide which books to promote in their libraries.

CHAPTER TWO

LITERATURE REVIEW
“Invisibility is about disconnection and powerlessness. When we don’t
see ourselves reflected back in our culture, we feel reduced to something
so small and insignificant that we’re easily erased from the world of
important things. Both the process of being reduced and the final product
of that process—invisibility—can be incredibly shaming” (Brown, 2007,
p.217).

Introduction
Published children’s literature in the United States lacks diversity (Cooperative
Children’s Book Center, 2017; Crisp et al., 2016; Hehrlich, 2015). This leads to
circumstances in which some children rarely (if ever) see their identities reflected in
texts. The paucity of representation negatively impacts them (Gray, 2009; HermannWilmarth & Ryan, 2013; Naidoo, 2012; Rich, 2012). Likewise, those who constantly find
representation may remain unaware of perspectives and identities that differ from their
own (Elliot in Ushery, 2014). Thus, educators and librarians must find positive
representations of multiple identities so that all children can access texts that function as
mirrors, windows, and doors. This illustrative case study (GAO, 1990) with a descriptive
survey examines the use of diverse literature in elementary school libraries. It also
explores the comfort levels of elementary school librarians with various types of diverse
literature, as well as the factors that impact their decision making regarding the
purchasing and promotion of diverse texts.

21
This chapter first examines the theoretical framework and the conceptual
framework for this study, which focuses on factors that impact the availability of diverse
texts in classroom and school libraries. Next, the importance of diverse literature as a
form of social learning and identity development is explored, followed by representation
in text, and examination of studies regarding diversity in school and classroom libraries.

Theoretical Framework

Critical race theory (CRT) examines the ways in which racism remains deeply
embedded in the cultural fabric of the United States, resulting in privileges for the
majoritized groups based on the oppression of minoritized groups (Delgado & Stefancic,
2012). One can also apply the tenets of CRT to additional forms of oppression, such as
those based on ability, sexual orientation, gender, and more. The origins of the
multidisciplinary CRT formed during the 1970s, when numerous individuals noticed the
ways in which progress for racial equality and equity had slowed (Delgado & Stefancic,
2012). This theory, drawn from critical legal studies and radical feminism, gained ground
in the following decades. Numerous branches sprang from it, including (but not limited
to): LatCrit, TribalCrit, AsianCrit, WhiteCrit, FemCrit, and QueerCrit (Delgado &
Stefancic, 2012; Solorzano & Yosso, 2001). Social justice forms an essential component
of CRT (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012; Solorzano & Yosso, 2001). “Unlike some academic
disciplines, critical race theory contains an activist dimension. It tries not only to
understand our social situation but to change it…” (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012, p. 7).

22
CRT includes several tenets. Those that apply to this study are: racism as
ubiquitous, counter-storytelling, and interest convergence (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012).
These tenets provide a framework for examination of the importance of diverse literature
and the lack thereof.

Racism is Ubiquitous
Critical race theory postulates that racism remains embedded in the institutional
and social structures in this country, often operating covertly (Delgado & Stefancic,
2012); this also applies to heterosexism, sexism, classism, and additional modes of
oppression (Chadderton, 2013; Solorzano & Bernal, 2001). “In a CRT analytical
framework, white supremacy is a given. The question is not whether white supremacy
can be identified, but how it is manifested” (Chadderton, 2013, p. 44). Likewise, other
forms of supremacy, such as heterosupremacy, remain entrenched in societal and
institutional structures. Supremacy renders the majoritized groups as default, othering
minoritized groups (Chadderton, 2013). The groups that have been deemed default
receives greater—and often unacknowledged—representation in texts, as well as more
social capital and other privileges (Chaudhri & Teale, 2013; Love, 2004; Solorzano &
Yasso, 2002). Those in power often take their privileges for granted, participating—
consciously or unconsciously—in the continued subjugation of minoritized groups (Love,
2004).

23
Counter-Storytelling
The majoritized group values itself and its stories, creating a hegemony that
silences alternate voices. Privilege and supremacy help determine which stories have
value, which stories dominate, and which stories are positioned as the default narratives
(Love, 2004; Solorzano & Yosso, 2002). “In other words, a majoritarian story is one that
privileges Whites, men, the middle and/or upper class, and heterosexuals by naming these
social locations as natural or normative points of reference” (Solorzano & Yasso, 2002, p.
28). Counter-stories provide a way for minoritized people to name and describe their
experiences and realities, challenging the majoritized perspective (Chaudhri & Teale,
2013; Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, & Koehler, 2009; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995; Love,
2004).
Counter-storytelling highlights the importance of diverse literature for children
and young adults. Having majoritized perspectives repeatedly (and sometimes
exclusively) represented maintains oppression as normal and devalues minoritized
perspectives (Koss, 2015; Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, & Koehler, 2009; Hughes-Hassell &
Cox, 2010). “[B]eginning in infancy children of color not only get the message from
books that their lives and their stories are not important but also that to be white is better”
(Hughes-Hassell & Cox, 2010, p. 225). Likewise, readers of all minoritized groups
receive similar messages regarding their identities when literature excludes their stories.
Counter-stories in diverse literature provide ways for all children to hear multiple
versions of reality and serve to combat oppression (Koss, 2015; Hughes-Hassell, Barkley,
& Koehler, 2009; Hughes-Hassell & Cox, 2010).

24
Interest convergence
Interest convergence refers to the ways in which the majoritized group allows
gains for minoritized groups when those gains will also benefit the group in power
(Delgado & Stefancic, 2012). For instance, Derrick Bell (1980) examined the ways in
which Brown v. the Board of Education (1954) met the needs of those in power by
furthering the United States’ narrative of equality both nationally and internationally
(Bell, 1980; Delgado & Stefancic, 2012). Likewise, the diversity in published children’s
literature will likely increase when those in power see benefits for themselves, such as
when the publishing industry sees profit in publishing counter-stories (Koss, 2015;
Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, & Koehler, 2009; Hughes-Hassell & Cox, 2010; YenikaAgbaw, 2014).

Summary
These tenets of critical race theory—racism as ubiquitous, counter-storytelling,
and interest convergence—help explain not only the reasons for the lack of diverse
literature, but also the importance of it. Racism and other methods of oppression,
whether enacted consciously or unconsciously, provide privileges for the majoritized
groups, as reflected in the publication of literature. Majoritized groups easily and
constantly find representation since most books feature these groups and most published
authors/illustrators belong to these groups (Koss, 2015; Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, &
Koehler, 2009; Hughes-Hassell & Cox, 2010; Yenika-Agbaw, 2014). This theoretical
framework provides a method for examination of the lack of diversity in published
literature, as well as a way to examine elementary school librarians’ promotion of diverse

25
literature, their comfort level using diverse literature, and the ways in which they select
books for purchase and promotion in their libraries.

Conceptual Framework

Decision making rests at the core of the study. The decisions that teachers and
librarians make impact the literature used in classrooms or promoted in libraries.
Shoenfeld’s (2011) theory of teacher decision making encapsulates various influences
that can be extrapolated to include decisions regarding types of literature to include in the
classroom or promote in the library. Schoenfeld (2011) describes three main influences
on teacher decision making: resources, goals, and orientations (see Figure 2.1). Resources
include material (e.g. books) and cognitive (e.g. knowledge) resources, as well as
constraints upon these resources (e.g. educational mandates). Schoenfeld’s (2011) model
acknowledges many types of knowledge, but focuses upon facts, procedures, concepts,
and ways to solve mathematical problems. Teachers tend to have numerous long-term
and short-term goals that have different priorities. These goals affect the decisions that a
teacher makes. Orientations, or a teacher’s beliefs, dispositions, and values, inform
perceptions and interpretations as well as influence decisions (Schoenfeld, 2011).

Schoenfeld’s (2011) model focused on the decisions that teachers make in
mathematics education. Although it provides an excellent model for this study, it does not
completely apply to the factors involved when elementary school librarians select books
for purchase and promotion. Thus, the conceptual framework for this study borrows from
and adds to Schoenfeld’s model (see Figure 2.2).

Decision Making

Text Availability
Both internal and external influences affect decision making, which in turn
directly impacts the availability of literature in the school library. Internal factors include
the librarian’s personal beliefs, biases, fears, experiences, knowledge, and identities; all
impact an individual’s comfort level with diversity, which affects the availability of
diverse literature in a classroom or school library. External factors that influence the
inclusion of diverse texts include the availability of inclusive literature, financial
considerations, curricular mandates, hegemony, censorship, and the community. These
factors intertwine and impact the decisions made by school librarians.

28
Internal Influences
When teachers select books for classroom use, there may be various conscious
and unconscious influences upon those decisions, including: familiarity with the text, the
theme(s), and the identity group(s) in the text (Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; WollmanBonilla, 1998). Personal beliefs impact the literature available in the classroom or school
library. Teachers or librarians may exclude certain books based on their own beliefs,
biases, and/or fears. Beliefs about the importance of diverse literature, if considered at all,
impact selection. Biases—implicit or explicit—may also affect book selection (Garry,
2015; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998). When teachers and/or librarians have a bias against a
minoritized group or they perceive that other stakeholders—administrators, community
members, parents, students—do, they may choose not to purchase books inclusive of that
group (Garry, 2015; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; School Library Journal, 2016;
Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006). Those who have experienced challenges to texts
may feel more fearful or hesitant about including identities or experiences perceived as
controversial (Garry, 2015; School Library Journal, 2016).
In addition to deliberate exclusion based on preconceived ideas, teachers or
librarians may wish to include diverse literature, but hesitate to purchase or promote
books inclusive of an identity with which they have little familiarity, as they may be
concerned about unintentionally selecting books with stereotypes (Lehman, 2015).
Although numerous resources exist that can assist teachers and librarians with selecting
literature that authentically portrays various groups of individuals, teachers or librarians
may not know about these resources. Teachers and librarians need to familiarize

29
themselves with multiple representations of diversity, as this can provide more of an
insight into particular cultures/groups (Lehman, 2015).
Unintentional exclusion of diverse literature does occur. Sometimes teachers may
be unaware of the lack of diversity in their classroom libraries and/or the importance of
representation in the classroom. Likewise, teachers whose identities typically find
representation may not notice that other identities do not (Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber,
2006; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998). They may also not understand the importance of
literature as mirrors, windows, and doors, and thus select texts that mostly (or only)
represent majoritized identities (Garry, 2015; Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006).
Sometimes teachers may feel uncertain about how to select quality, diverse texts, and not
have the resources to assist them in this endeavor (Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006).
Librarians may face similar challenges (Adams & Magi, 2015; Garry, 2015).

External Influences
External factors also impact teachers’ and librarians’ decisions about which texts
to include. Some crossover between the categories of internal and external factors does
exist, as some external factors impact teacher or librarian biases, fears, and experiences.
Financial considerations play a role in the availability of books in the classroom and
school library. For instance, the financial resources available may limit not only how
many books a teacher or librarian purchases, but from where he/she purchases them
(Friese et al., 2008; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006). If
a teacher has limited funds, he/she may elect to purchase used books or books from an
organization such as Scholastic, where a teacher can often earn free books. These can

30
limit the diversity in books (McNair, 2008). Likewise, librarians may face budget
restrictions, and may need to weigh factors such as student requests and/or teacher
requests for specific books, books that align with particular curricular goals for individual
grade levels, and more.
In addition to financial considerations, curricular mandates may affect book
purchasing. Some schools or districts may recommend certain texts for various grade
levels, and teachers may need to select materials from those recommendations (Friese et
al., 2008; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015). Schools or individuals may also look to the
Common Core text exemplars for materials (Watkins & Ostenson, 2015). Unfortunately,
the Common Core text exemplars lack diversity due to the fact that the group developing
the list needed to use materials that could be excerpted for insertion in the guide “without
paying large permission fees” (Short, 2013, para. 2). Schieble (2014) notes that in the
high school text exemplars, most authors are white males and all are heterosexual;
Strauss (2014) noted that almost 90% of the books for elementary students were written
by white authors. Thus, teachers and librarians who use these lists as a basis for
purchasing decisions will likely purchase more texts by majoritized writers.
The community of the school and the surrounding area influence the decisions
made by teachers and librarians regarding text selection (Bertin & Davis, 2016; Watkins
& Ostenson, 2015). “[T]eachers remarked that finding texts that contain ‘appropriate’
content, especially when teaching in a more conservative community, is challenging”
(Watkins & Ortenson, 2015, p. 260). Librarians likewise are impacted by the community
(Garry, 2015; School Library Journal, 2016). Due to politicization of LGBT identities,

31
some teachers and/or librarians choose to avoid books with LGBT characters, citing
concern about community reactions (Garry, 2015; School Library Journal, 2016; Whelan,
2009).
The aforementioned internal and external factors impact the decision made by
teachers and librarians, and thus the literature available in a classroom or school library.
This study examines the types of diversity in literature used in school libraries, comfort
level with using literature with diverse identities, and how school librarians make
decisions regarding text selection.

Identity Development

As noted previously, teachers and librarians decide which books children can
access in classrooms or school libraries. The availability (or lack) of inclusive literature
impacts children. Children learn through not just their own actions but through those of
others, including characters in text (Schunk, 2012). Thus, diverse literature provides the
opportunities to learn from characters similar to and different from themselves; this can
allow children to explore different outcomes based on social capital, prejudices, and other
social justice issues. Diverse, inclusive literature also provides a vehicle for identity
exploration, validation, and development (Schachter & Galili-Schachter, 2012).
Although many people use the term identity, it often has different meanings for
different people (Moje, Luke, Davies, & Street, 2009). Most seem to agree that
individuals have a core identity (or identities) with other identities that are specific to
situation and context (Moje et al., 2009). Although individuals construct self-identities

32
and live out those identities, this is typically not done in isolation (Jones-Walker, 2015;
Moje et al., 2009). Thus, social construction of identity occurs; individuals are recognized
by others as having particular identities based on the socially-constructed definitions of
those identities, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and more (Moje et al., 2009;
Smith, 2008). Individuals may choose or may be assigned identities based on
characteristics (Moje et al., 2009).
People often treat others in certain ways based on their understandings or
constructions of those identities, which can reinforce a specific identity (Moje et al, 2009;
Jones-Walker, 2015). Individuals may also enact different identities in particular
contexts, and may place more importance on specific identities (Corenblum &
Armstrong, 2012; Ghavami, Peplau, Fingerhut, Grant, & Wittig, 2011; Moje et al., 2009).
Inclusive, diverse literature can assist with identity development (mirrors) and with
learning about others’ identities (windows or doors).

Social Identity
Individuals develop numerous social identities over a lifetime, starting in
childhood. Children tend to show preference for people in their group over those in
another group if the groups have similar status (Abrams & Killen, 2014; Nesdale &
Flesser, 2001; Robnett & Susskind, 2010). Children who place higher value and have
more emotional attachment to a particular identity or group tend to hold it in higher
esteem (Corenblum & Armstrong, 2012; Ghavami et al., 2011). However, if one group
has higher social standing, children may prefer that group, even if they do not belong to it
(Abrams & Killen, 2014; Nesdale & Flesser, 2001; Nesdale, et al., 2005).

33
Racial Identity
Children typically learn at a young age to which racial (skin color) group they
belong, as well as which racial groups have more privilege and social acclaim (Nesdale,
et al., 2005). They also may develop a preference for people who belong to the same
group as they (Nesdale, et al., 2005). This includes learning preferences as well; children
show an inclination to prefer learning from those whose racial identity is similar to their
own (Gaither, Corriveau, Ambady, Chen, Harris, & Sommers, 2014). However, this
varies somewhat by race; White children tend to show stronger in-group bias (Corenblum
& Armstrong, 2012; Gaither, et al., 2014). Additionally, children often pick up—through
literature, social interactions, and more—stereotypes about race (Gaither, et al., 2014).
These stereotypes can influence who children play with, sometimes resulting in children
from groups who experience oppression wanting to play more with those from groups
who have greater privilege (Gaither, et al., 2014).
As children’s conceptualization of racial identity is different from adults’,
children tend to mirror the attitudes in those around them, such as parents/caregivers or
attitudes from groups to which they belong. Children also tend to reflect attitudes
depicted in various media (Corenblum & Armstrong, 2012). As children’s cognitive
maturity increases, it affects their racial identity development (Corenblum & Armstrong,
2012). Additionally, the ways in which ideas about race are framed impact racial identity
development in different environments. For instance, “in a typical U.S. school, White
children progress through school strengthening their identities from the preferred status
identity, not a racial deficit model, whereas children of color must work through White

34
preference” (Earick, 2010, p. 132). As literature overwhelmingly portrays White
characters (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017), White remains the default
identity, and those who are not White may see their racial identity rarely represented, if at
all.
Earick (2010) describes a situation in a kindergarten classroom where language
use and a lack of representation combined to cause a child to withdraw from participation
in class. This child loved to read and entered the school year excited to learn, and would
often play with another child acting out stories. However, he soon became moody and
withdrawn. When classmates showed concern for him, he replied, “‘I am sad, and the
sadness makes me not want to play or work with anyone; look, look at our classroom;
nothing here looks like me! All those books in our library and the only pictures of kids
like me are bad, are Black Knights!’” (Earick, 2010, p. 135).
This child had looked in vain for pictures of people with similar skin color as he,
and found only negative representations in books in the room (Earick, 2010). The other
children in the class and the teacher worked to counteract the negative messages; the
children suggested buying more books with diverse characters, putting up pictures of
people with a variety of skin colors, and borrowing books from the library with positive
representations (Earick, 2010). The teacher purposely included more authentic
representations and the child started engaging more in class, finishing the year in the top
of the class (Earick, 2010). This anecdote demonstrates the importance of diverse,
inclusive literature in the classroom; many other children likely feel the same way as the
child Earick (2010) discussed.

35
Gender Identity
Gender identity encompasses not just self-identification with a gender, but also
perceived fit within a gender, others’ expectations of that gender, and how they feel about
different genders (Brinkman, Rabenstein, Rosén, & Zimmerman, 2014; Egan & Perry,
2001). Children frequently identify themselves with a gender at a very early age (Egan &
Perry, 2001; Halim, Ruble, & Amodio, 2011), typically based on a binary view of gender
(Wiseman & Davidson, 2011). Children usually start receiving messages at a very early
age regarding expectations for different genders. The messages come from media, books,
adults, and peers. They observe models of expected behavior, and may adjust behavior to
conform (Brinkman, et al., 2014). Children may perform gender one way when alone and
another way around particular individuals (Brinkman, et al., 2014). In other words,
children’s gender performance may not indicate how they self-identify; it may be a
function of conforming to societal expectations.
Although children tend to have more rigid ideas of gender roles at younger ages,
they often take on more flexible views of gender as they grow (Egan & Perry, 2001;
Halim, Ruble, & Amodio, 2011). This may include more leniency towards gendernoncompliance (Brinkman, et al., 2014). However, those who hold hyper-masculine or
hyper-feminine stereotypes of gender (whether these fit their identity or not) tend to hold
negative views of those who do not conform to rigid gender roles (Pauletti, Cooper, &
Perry, 2014).
Inclusive, diverse literature may help children explore their own and others’
gender identities. Literature that shows a variety of genders (not just the binary) may

36
allow children to feel more comfortable performing outside of socially constructed
gender norms.

Sexual Orientation Identity
Sexual orientation identity development often starts in childhood (Calzo,
Antonucci, Mays, & Cochran, 2011). However, unlike heterosexual children, those who
are gay, lesbian, or bisexual may receive negative messages about their sexual orientation
which impact their identity development (Gordon & Silva, 2015; Julian, Duys, & Wood,
2014; Zoeterman & Wright, 2014). Typically, children have had assumed heterosexuality
inscribed upon them from a young age and have internalized this (Zoeterman & Wright,
2014); sometimes their identity development starts with the realization of difference
(Gordon & Silva, 2015; Julian, Duys, & Wood, 2014).
Heterosexual children typically do not need to work through prejudice,
discrimination, and negative messaging to develop their sexual orientation identity;
society has already positioned their sexual orientation as normal and desirable (Gordon &
Silva, 2015; Julian, Duys, & Wood, 2014). Furthermore, sexual orientation identity
development is often presumed to be only something with which nonheterosexual people
deal (Gordon & Silva, 2015), meaning that those individuals may have fewer resources
and/or role models. This can cause unique challenges for gay, lesbian, and bisexual
children. Likewise, heterosexual children find representation in almost every book they
read; gay, lesbian, and bisexual children may rarely (if ever) encounter books
representative of their sexual orientation, which might further negatively impact identity
development.

37
Faith/Religious Identity
Religious imagery is prevalent in United States culture; thus, most children in the
United States develop some understanding of faith (Newman, 2011). Much of the
research on faith or religious identity development focuses on adolescents and adults
(Neuman, 2011). However, Fowler’s theory of faith development does include stages in
childhood (Evans, Forney, Guido, Patton, & Renn, 2010; Neuman, 2011). Young
children form their first conceptions of faith through family members’ stories and
teachings as well as through the general culture (Evans, et al., 2010; Neuman, 2011).
They typically do not question the teachings of their faith. When they become
adolescents or young adults, they may examine their faith more critically, though others
may still have a strong influence. Some people remain in a stage of unquestioning faith
throughout their lives (Evans et al., 2010; Neuman, 2011). Text with religious characters
may assist with faith or religious identity development.

Intersectionality
Individuals have multiple social identities, each of which may have particular
privileges or oppressions associated with it. The interaction of these identities is called
intersectionality (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012). The complexities and interactions of
various identities exert influences on individual identity development as well as the ways
in which individuals negotiate the world. When different identity values conflict, that can
result in stress. Intersectionality provides a caution against essentializing an individual
based on one identity; the interactions of identities produce specific effects upon an

38
individual (Ecklund, 2012). Intersectionality, or inclusive diversity, occurs infrequently in
published literature (Harris in Turner, 2016).

Literature and Identity Development
Through inclusion and exclusion, implicit messages convey who and what has
value (Jones, 2008). Silence about issues or identities implies that they are unimportant,
negative, and/or taboo (Earick, 2010). When educators consciously or unconsciously
exclude certain identities from the classroom, these choices marginalize those identities
as being unworthy of conversation or acknowledgement (Earick, 2010; Flores, 2016;
Gartley, 2015; Koss, 2015; Logan, Watson, Hood, & Lasswell, 2016; Page, 2016b).
When curricula, conversations, and literature in a classroom reflect only specific
identities and identity expressions, individuals with those identities may receive a
message that their identities are normal, valued, and good; individuals with other
identities may receive the opposite message.
Likewise, the ways in which published literature depicts diverse identities creates
impressions of those identities; if these representations tend towards stereotypes, people
with majoritized and minoritized identities tend to believe the stereotypes (Gaither,
Corriveau, Ambady, Chen, Harris, & Sommers, 2014). “A child’s experience with
literature is part of that child’s moral development, serving to cultivate either compassion
for others or racial biases and stereotypes; either can have lasting effects for both the
child and those around the child” (Welch, 2016, p. 373). Messages sent through various
means reinforce expected roles or stereotypes, often positioning certain identities and/or
expressions as lacking something valuable that the privileged identities and/or

39
expressions possess (Brinkman, et al., 2014; Earick, 2010; Gaither, et al., 2014). This
also results in casting those who step outside of the expected identity expressions as
transgressing, being abnormal, and/or being less than (Brinkman, et. al, 2014).
Additionally, a binary view of identity essentializes it (Wiseman & Davidson, 2011),
obstructing the myriad expressions of identity and making it more challenging for
children to encounter mirrors in text.
“[A]s they engage texts, readers are engaging in processes of personal identity
development” (Schachter & Galili-Schachter, 2012, p.3). Therefore, readers need to
encounter authentic representations of themselves in literature as well as representations
of others (Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Koss, 2015). Children (and adults) may have ingroup biases that influence how they interact with or what they think about people who
belong to a different group (Corenblum & Armstrong, 2012; Gaither, et al., 2014;
Nesdale, et al., 2005; Verkuyten & De Wolf, 2007). Literature can play a role in identity
development, helping readers to see others like them (mirror), as well as those who differ
(window) (Anderson, 2013; Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Campbell, 2010; Koss, 2015;
Naidoo, 2012; Rich, 2012; Smolkin & Young, 2011).
Children need to read books reflective of self and books that show identities that
differ from self, which can encourage empathy and reduce bias (Anderson, 2013; Botelho
& Rudman, 2009; Campbell, 2010; Gardner, 2008; Glazier & Seo, 2005; HermannWilmarth & Ryan, 2013; Smolkin & Young, 2011; Wolf, 2004). “Reading enables us to
try on, identify with, and ultimately enter for a brief time the wholly different perspective
of another person’s consciousness” (Wolf, 2007, pp. 7-8). This provides readers with not

40
only a potential mirror, but also a window and a door in text. This may or may not cause
some disequilibrium. If it does, children may assimilate or accommodate the information,
which has the potential to impact self-realization and thus identity (Schachter & GaliliSchachter, 2012). For instance, when one child read about a book with characters who
were refugees, she stated, ‘‘I think I have got a stereotype of refugees who struggle to get
here’’ (Hope, 2008, p.300). This child recognized that her schema about refugees fit a
certain perspective, and through exposure to other perspectives in literature, she
recognized her own bias and thus will likely adjust her schema about refugees (Hope,
2008). In turn, this child may feel more empathy for refugees and/or may adjust her
concept of refugee as “other.”
When children can see another’s perspective, they can also learn from the
consequences that person experiences (Bandura, 1971). A child who tries on a character’s
point of view may also find that the character experiences different social
consequences/outcomes due to an identity characteristic. This can expand a child’s
perspective as well as engage the child in examination of social justice and equity issues.
“[T]he best books…change our view of ourselves; they extend that phrase ‘like me’ to
include what we thought was foreign and strange” (Rochmann as quoted in Norton, 2013,
p.1). However, much depends on the positioning of readers and texts.
Authors position readers in specific ways when they write texts, readers position
themselves in specific ways when they approach text, and teachers or librarians position
students in specific ways when they introduce texts. Text positioning can result from
power and privilege, as well as societal norms, such as when texts reflect majoritized

41
identities and position readers as familiar with these. However, this may leave those with
minoritized identities feeling marginalized (Williams, 2003). Additionally, if teachers or
librarians introduce books with minoritized identities by saying that the books might
make some people feel uncomfortable or allowing readers to opt out of reading books
with certain minoritized identities (and only those books), it others those perspectives,
implying that they are inherently discomforting and inferior (Blackburn, 2012; Clark &
Blackburn, 2009; Glazier & Seo, 2005; Lo, 2015). Teachers can mitigate this through
positioning texts as potential mirrors, windows, and doors for all readers (Clark &
Blackburn, 2009; Schachter & Galili-Schachter, 2012).
When texts are positioned in this manner, teachers can use literature to support
children’s identity development as well as empower and enfranchise students. Thus,
readers examine text for aspects of identity and/or something to which they can feel a
connection (Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Campbell, 2010; Gray, 2009; Schachter & GaliliSchachter, 2012). The ways in which adults use language (in spoken or text form) impact
children’s identity development, as well as their perceptions of identities that differ from
themselves. Literature impacts children’s identity development and perceptions about
groups of people; thus, children need to see people with minoritized identities in multiple
roles, not just in the same roles (e.g. stories about the Holocaust being the only depictions
of Jews) (Strauss, 2016; We Need Diverse Books, 2016). Therefore, teachers and
librarians need to carefully select (and position) texts to show a multiplicity of identities
and identity performances. However, that might be challenging due to a lack of diversity
in published literature.

42
Representation Studies

Multiple studies have examined representation of various identities in literature.
The ones selected here describe only a few aspects of identity, such as race, gender,
disability, and sexual orientation, but are characteristic of other studies regarding a lack
of diversity in literature. The first study examines representation of African American
characters in children’s books from 1937-1993 (Pescosolido, Graurholz, & Milkie, 1997).
The second explores binary gender representation in children’s books during the 1900s
(McCabe, Fairchild, Grauerholz, Pescosolido, & Tope, 2011). The third study
investigates representation of gender, race, and disability in picture books published in
2012 (Koss, 2015). The final study explores the representation of sexual orientation in ten
books published from 2004-2014 with LGBT main or secondary characters (HermannWilmarth & Ryan, 2014).
Pescosolido, Grauerholz, and Milkie (1997) conducted a study in which they
examined picture books (n=2,448) for representations of African American/Black
characters from 1937-1993 that had won Caldecott awards or honors, were Little Golden
Books (popular during the 1900s and ubiquitous), or were included in The Children’s
Catalogue, from which they drew a stratified random sample. The researchers coded the
books for whether they contained representations of Black characters (in text and/or
illustrations), and found that 14.8% had at least one representation, while 1.8% had only
Black characters. They also discovered that from 1958-1964, depiction of Black
characters in books sharply declined, though it rose again in the late 60s through the early
90s and presented fewer stereotypes. These researchers also examined racial conflicts as

43
described by the New York Times, and found that in times of more racial conflicts,
representation of Black characters in children’s books declined, while the inverse also
occurred; in times of fewer racial conflicts, Black characters appeared more frequently in
children’s books (Pescosolido, Grauerholz, & Milkie, 1997). Many factors likely played a
role in the increasing representation in children’s books, including studies about the lack
of representation (i.e. Larrick, 1965), more people wanting inclusive books, and other
forms of interest convergence—where those who make publishing decisions recognized
that they would get something out of publishing more diverse books, such as a profit or
recognition.
In addition to published children’s literature likely being affected by racial
conflicts in society (i.e. the Civil Rights Movement), it may also be influenced by societal
constructs about gender. “[C]hildren’s books reinforce, legitimate, and reproduce a
patriarchal gender system” (McCabe et al., 2011, p. 198). McCabe, et al. (2011)
examined gender representation for boys and girls in preschool to third grade children’s
books (n=5,618) published throughout the 1900s; the books selected were published as
Little Golden Books, won Caldecott Awards during the 1900s, and/or were included in
The Children’s Catalogue, a reference for librarians during the 1900s. For books in
which the main characters identified as a boy/man or girl/woman (not the case for all
books), more characters were boys/men than girls/women. For books with animal
characters, far more animal characters were described as boys than girls, with a ratio of
almost two to one. The 1930s-1960s had the greatest inequity regarding gender
representation, perhaps due to social pressures during this time period. Both before and

44
after this time span, there was more equal representation, though boy/men characters still
had greater representation than girl/women characters (McCabe, et al., 2011).
When one gender (boys/men) receives disparate representation in books, it
marginalizes the other gender (girls/women), thus sending a message that gender has less
value. Additionally, cultural messages about the supremacy of boys/men as well as
reinforcements in the media and text can lead to children preferring boy/men characters
in stories, which may then reinforce preference for those characters (McCabe, et al.,
2011). The subtle—and not so subtle—messages about gender roles, expectations, and
abilities influence the types of stories told, and in turn, reinforce schemas children have
about those genders. However, the focus solely on the gender binary (boy/girl or
man/woman) reinforces schemas/frames of reference regarding gender and renders those
who do not fit into a binary as invisible or nonexistent. McCabe et al.’s (2011) study
only examined the gender binary.
Koss (2015) examined original, hard-copy picture books (n=455) published in
2012 by mainstream publishers in the United States for representations of race, gender,
and disability in main and secondary characters. Not all picture books have human main
characters; for those that did, White main characters comprised the vast majority (75%).
Likewise, most culturally-specific books (59%) focused on White culture. The author
also examined binary gender—recognizing the limitations therein—but used labels that
refer to sex (male and female) instead of gender. Males were the most frequently
represented main characters (60%). The author also examined gender roles in the texts
and found evidence of gender role stereotyping in a majority of books (62% for women,

45
92% for men). Depictions of main characters with disabilities occurred in a low
percentage of books (3%). More books did include peripheral characters with disabilities,
though the depictions tended towards tokenism (Koss, 2015).
Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan (2014) identified only ten books published between
2004 and 2014 with an intended audience of 3rd-6th graders that included an LGBT main
character or an LGBT character who had a significant role in the story. In half of these
books, the LGBT characters were parents to the main character. However, even in these
books, certain identities remain privileged—white, middle-class, able-bodied—and the
LGBT characters often had little or no interaction with a broader LGBT community,
implying isolation from that community and reinforcing heteronormativity with LGBT
people as an anomaly. In three other books, the LGBT characters are other adults, which
means that in only two of these books, LGBT characters are represented as children and
as the protagonist (one gay and one as gender nonconforming and possibly transgender).
Furthermore, these books only depicted lesbians as parents (Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan,
2014). In picture books, Epstein (2012) noted that most of the LGBT characters are
adults and/or parents. This may make it challenging for LGBT children to find books
that act as mirrors and assist with LGBT identity development.
Children may notice and internalize these implicit messages coded in children’s
literature. “Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it
the definitive story of that person” (Adichie, 2009). Therefore, librarians have a
responsibility to ensure that students have access to more than a single story, and that

46
they find mirrors, windows, and doors in text. However, sometimes people who find
representation of their identities everywhere have difficulty with inclusive literature.

Reactions to Diverse Literature

Numerous examples currently exist of individuals protesting inclusion of
literature with diverse characters; despite limited representations of diversity in books,
most recently challenged books include diversity (Davis, 2016). LGBT-inclusive picture
books have been highly censored, and sometimes burned (Esposito, 2009; NCAC, 2015;
Shimanoff, Elia, & Yep, 2012). Visible protests have likely negatively affected the
inclusion of books in schools.
One library in Texas included two picture books with LGBT characters, and
dozens of people challenged the books’ inclusion in the library, some of whom wanted
the books burned (NCAC, 2015). Some suggested that these picture books be moved
from the children’s section to the adult section (NCAC, 2015). Of course, this would
limit children’s access to these books. The characters in the books in the children’s
section are already overwhelmingly heterosexual and cisgender.
A teacher in North Carolina read a fairy tale to his class where a prince falls in
love with a prince (Ring, 2015). The teacher chose to read this book after some of his
students bullied another for not conforming to gender stereotypes. The picture book
shows less affection between the two princes than most fairy tales show between
heterosexual couples. However, numerous parents complained, many of whom did not
have a child in that classroom. Some parents used religious reasons for protesting, some

47
claimed that by reading the book, the teacher bullied the students and their families, and
some said that books about gay people had no place in schools (Ring, 2015; Schaub,
2015). Some parents also supported this teacher and the inclusion of diverse books.
However, the teacher eventually resigned after receiving e-mails accusing him of
“psycho-emotional rape” and feeling as though he had little support from the
administration (Biesecker, 2015). These examples represent a small fraction of examples
of people protesting books with LGBT characters/content.
Some people react negatively to books with other diverse content as well. A
school district in Florida recently added new books to the curriculum that include
characters from the Middle East (Thompson, 2015). Some people protested these books
due to references to war and to Islam, and some claim having these books promotes
Islam. Some people support the inclusion of these books, however (Thompson, 2015).
The people who challenge these books seem concerned about children reading about
people who differ from themselves.

Possible Reasons for Challenges
Many of the reactions mentioned above are negative. In a culture where
majoritized identities wield so much power, expressions of other identities can seem like
a threat to that power. Some people who have social and political privileges and power
view equality as a loss of rights and privileges for themselves, rather than as others
gaining some of the exact same rights and privileges; equality may feel like a threat to
their status (Gilead & Liberman, 2014). Other people lack awareness of the privileges
granted to majoritized identities (Ignite, n.d.). Constant representation is normal for them;

48
they may not realize that other identities do not have those same experiences (Stallworth,
Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998). Thus, protests may occur because
those individuals may feel as though their (or their children’s) identities would be
marginalized.
Additionally, some religious groups/institutions turn certain identities into moral
issues, which leads to some participants in those groups framing the identities as
inherently immoral and wrong. Individuals who express negative opinions about lesbian,
gay, and bisexual individuals often cite religion as the reason (Adamczyk & Pitt, 2009;
Schulte & Battle, 2004; Whitehead, 2012). Therefore, holding negative beliefs about
certain identities—such as LGBT— may be framed as part of a religion, implying that
individuals who live that faith should have those beliefs or act in those ways. Thus, it
becomes a matter of one’s identity, and accepting LGBT individuals may seem like a
betrayal of that identity.
The politicization of some identities also influences how people view those
identities, and affects people who have these identities. The fact that majoritized groups
have voted on whether to grant equal rights for minoritized populations implicitly
positions that majoritized group as more powerful than and superior to the minority
populations. The more frequent negative rhetoric that typically surrounds majority votes
on minority rights—as well as state and national legislation that would serve to further
oppress certain groups—can influence public opinion as well (Donovan & Tolbert,
2013). Additionally, media outlets that legitimatize the views of hate group leaders

49
position these views as reasonable, which also affects people’s frames of reference about
specific identities.
All of these have impacts on ways in which certain identities are viewed, and thus
affect the publication and use of literature representative of those identities. When
identities are rendered controversial, teachers and school librarians can worry about
including literature with those identities in the classroom or school library. Some teachers
fear negative reactions from students, some fear reprisals, some equate books that
mention lesbian, gay, or bisexual characters (including same-sex parents) with teaching
about sex, and some fear that talking about LGBT people will result in children suddenly
changing their sexual orientation or gender identity (DeWitt, 2015; Flores, 2012, 2014;
Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan, 2015; Naidoo, 2012; Rowell, 2007; Thein, 2013).
Heteronormativity—as well as other forms of oppression—can result in “…adults being
too afraid or hostile to share such literature with children” (Shimanoff, Elia, & Yep,
2012, p. 1006).

School and Classroom Library Book Selections

As noted, myriad reactions exist to the inclusion of diverse literature in
classrooms and in school libraries. Teachers and librarians can work to mitigate adverse
reactions, though the fear of negative reactions may keep some from having inclusive
libraries (DeWitt, 2015; Flores, 2012, 2014; Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan, 2015; Rowell,
2007; Thein, 2013). The studies below focus on representation of identities in school and
classroom libraries.

50
School Libraries
Few published research studies have examined diversity in school libraries; only
four were located, and three focused on inclusion of LGBT literature, while the other
focused on controversial books, including books with LGBT characters. Hughes-Hassell,
Overberg, and Harris (2013) examined 125 high school libraries in a southern state, and
found few books with LGBT characters; an average of 0.4% of a library’s books (35.7
books) had LGBT characters. Some libraries had a handful of LGBT-inclusive texts, if
any, while others had dozens or more (Hughes-Hassell, Overberg, & Harris, 2013).
Oltmann (2015) conducted a study of 137 high school libraries in one
northeastern state and one southern state. Oltmann (2015) reported an average of 22
books with LGBT characters in the northeastern state, and 22.5 in the southern state, with
some libraries having few if any books. It is not clear what percentage of the library
collections these numbers represent.
Page (2016a) surveyed middle and high school library media specialists in a
midwestern state, with 117 respondents. Although most respondents in urban (84%) and
suburban (88%) areas felt comfortable including literature with LGBT characters in the
library, about half (49%) of the rural librarians felt similarly. However, comfort level
with inclusion does not necessarily correlate to comfort promoting these texts: 61% of
urban, 66% of suburban, and 35% of rural library media specialists felt comfortable
promoting LGBT-inclusive books (Page, 2016).
School Library Journal conducted a survey of school librarians in the United
States that focused on controversial books (School Library Journal, 2016). Five hundred

51
and seventy-four school librarians responded to the survey. Many (42%) had experience
with book challenges, most of which originated from parents: 92% at the elementary
level, 86% at the middle school level, and 80% at the high school level. A super majority
(75%) said that challenges did not affect future book purchasing decisions.
However, some school librarians showed that they made choices to exclude some
identities from the books in their libraries, which means that the children in those schools
would not find inclusive texts in the school library. Slightly more than half (52%) of
elementary librarians chose not to purchase a book because it had LGBT characters, with
47% of junior high librarians and 32% of high school librarians saying that they decline
to purchase LGBT-inclusive books. Interestingly, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight
Education Network (GLSEN)’s 2015 school climate survey showed that 57.6% of the
middle and high school students who responded were unable to locate LGBT-inclusive
texts in their school libraries (Kosciw, Greytak, Giga, Villenas, Danischewski,2016). The
discrepancy could be due to several factors, including different populations taking the
survey, different time periods, and more.

Classroom Libraries
As noted with school libraries, locating studies regarding diversity in classroom
libraries posed a challenge. Three articles, one dissertation, and two blog posts were
located that included examinations of classroom libraries or surveys; most focused on
only one type of diversity (skin color or sexual orientation), like the school library
studies.

52
Gray (2009) surveyed seven third-fifth grade teachers to examine how the
teachers used and promoted books with African American characters. Although most
children in this school identified as African American, only about 10% of the books in
these classrooms had African American characters. Additionally, several teachers
indicated that they use these texts only during February, which sends a message of value
only during one month (Gray, 2009).
Blackburn and Buckley (2005) conducted a survey that examined the use of
literature inclusive of lesbians, gays, or bisexuals (LGB) in high school Language Arts
classrooms. Thirty-five percent (n=212) of those surveys were returned. Fewer than nine
percent of the respondents indicated using what they considered LGB-inclusive books,
most of which did not include LGB characters; however, the authors may have been
LGB. Unfortunately, some texts used by these respondents contained negative
stereotypes. More than 91% of the respondents declared a desire to avoid LGB-inclusive
texts (Blackburn & Buckley, 2005).
Hulan (2010) surveyed second-grade classroom teachers regarding the racial
diversity in their classroom libraries. Twenty-one teachers responded to the survey, and
the results show that most books had White characters (Hulan, 2010). Likewise, Manger
(2016) and his third-grade students examined the racial diversity in their classroom
library and found more books representing White characters than other races. Lifshitz
(2016) had her students examine the diversity of her classroom library. Each student
grabbed a random sample of 25 books from the classroom library and looked at the race
of the characters depicted on the cover. Lifshitz (2016) acknowledges the problems with

53
this approach, but felt it provided a way for the students to easily examine diversity in
books. Lifshitz (2016) noted that although she had tried to diversify her classroom
library, most of the books that the students examined had presumably White characters
on the covers.

Preschool Classroom Library. Crisp et al. (2016) examined 21 libraries in
preschool classrooms in Atlanta, Georgia. They coded 1,169 books (m=79.1, sd=56.74)
for various aspects of diversity: race, socioeconomic status, disability, sexual orientation,
gender, religion, and language. Their findings showed a lack of diversity in the books in
these classroom libraries (Crisp et al., 2016).
These libraries did not contain many books (5.7%) that explicitly mentioned the
race of the main character(s). Given that most published children’s books are written by
White authors (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2016; Hehrlich, 2015) and White
tends to be the default race unless specifically mentioned otherwise (Crisp et al., 2016;
Smith, 2016), one can assume that most (if not all) of the books that remained silent
about race focused on White characters.
Most books did not specifically mention socioeconomic status. Of the few books
(2.7%) that did mention socioeconomic status, a majority (87.5%) depicted low
socioeconomic status (Crisp et. al, 2016). Perhaps this demonstrates another aspect of
default assumptions where the majoritized identity does not need explicit mentioning.
Likewise, relatively few texts (2.7%) had main characters with “dis/abilities,
developmental differences and/or chronic illnesses” (Crisp et al, 2016, p. 34). Even fewer
texts depicted nonheterosexual sexual orientation. Of the books (18.6%) that indicated a

54
specific sexual orientation as noted with gendered pronouns or other language, almost all
focused exclusively on heterosexuality. One (0.09%) showcased different types of
families, and included a page each for male same-sex parents and female same-sex
parents (Crisp et al., 2016). As most texts tend not to explicitly mention sexual
orientation, this likely provides another case of a majoritized identity (heterosexual)
becoming the default lens, and thus not explicitly mentioned.
Gender depiction in the texts showed a favor towards cisgender boys/men
(53.5%), with 28.2% featuring cisgender girls/women; 18.2% of books did not mention a
gender. None of the texts had transgender characters (Crisp et. al., 2016).
Language provided another area for examination. Most books had text entirely in
English (91.1%). However, some books (7.1%) featured more than one language, and
1.9% did not include any English. Additionally, religion was only mentioned in 4.9% of
texts, a majority (80.7%) focused on Christianity (Crisp et.al., 2016).
Each of these studies provides information on the diversity of school and
classroom libraries, though most studies focused only on one aspect of diversity, such as
race or sexual orientation, or on a specific grade level. Although this researcher found
one study focused on early childhood classroom libraries, she was unable to find
published studies surveying school librarians regarding multiple diverse identities or
comfort level with various aspects of diversity. Thus, this study provides a perspective
on an under-researched area.

55
Summary

Through experience with text that provides mirrors and windows, children learn
about themselves and others. They engage in identity development, experience
perspectives and identities that differ from themselves, and may develop empathy
(Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Earick, 2010; Koss, 2015; Schachter & Galili-Schachter,
2012). Teachers and librarians play a role in helping students discover books that provide
mirrors and windows. However, studies have shown that some identities may not be
reflected in books in the classroom or school library or there may be few books reflective
of these identities (Blackburn & Buckley, 2005; Crisp et al., 2016; Gray, 2009; HughesHassell, Overberg, & Harris, 2013; Hulan, 2010; Kosciw et al., 2016; Oltmann, 2015;
Page, 2016; School Library Journal, 2016). Most of these studies focused on one type of
diverse identity; one study focused on multiple diverse identities in preschool classroom
libraries (Crisp et al., 2016), and one study focused on controversial books in K-12
school libraries (School Library Journal, 2016). Currently no published studies exist that
examine multiple types of identity representation in elementary school libraries or school
librarian comfort level and decision making regarding texts with these types of identities.

CHAPTER THREE

METHODOLOGY
“Every word that people use in telling their stories is a microcosm of their
consciousness” (Seidman, 2013, p.7).

Introduction
Published children’s literature in the United States lacks diversity (Cooperative
Children’s Book Center, 2017; Crisp et al., 2016; Hehrlich, 2015). This leads to
circumstances in which some children rarely (if ever) see their identities reflected in text,
and this lack of representation negatively impacts them, sending a message of
devaluation (Gray, 2009; Hermann-Wilmarth & Ryan, 2013; Koss, 2015; Naidoo, 2012;
Rich, 2012). Children who find their identities frequently (or constantly) represented in
books may remain ignorant of those who differ from themselves. All children need books
that function as mirrors, windows, and doors (Bishop, 2012; Botelho & Rudman, 2009).
However, elementary school librarians may not promote inclusive, diverse
literature for a variety of reasons, including lack of awareness, resources, and availability.
Comfort level with different types of diversity may also impact the types of literature
promoted in the school library, as might additional internal and external factors, including
conscious or unconscious biases, fear of reactions, censorship, personal experiences,
community, and more (Garry, 2015; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; School Library Journal,
2016; Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006). The availability or nonavailability of
diverse literature impacts children.

57
“Multicultural literature helps all children see the possibility and the
promise. Few White children in this country have difficulty finding books
that feature who they are, but it is quite common to find African
American, Latino, Native American, and Asian American youth, as well
as multiracial and biracial children, who have never read a book that
highlights their cultural identities. In my classes, I have had countless
adult students who are from diverse ethnic groups, and they have tears in
their eyes when I show them books that emphasize their experiences”
(Harris in Turner, 2016, p. 128).

The purpose of this illustrative case study (GAO, 1990) with a descriptive survey is to
examine the frequency with which librarians promote diverse literature, their comfort
level doing so, and the factors that impact their decisions regarding diverse text.

Research Questions

1. How frequently do elementary school librarians promote books with diverse main
characters in terms of race, disability, family structure, socio-economic status,
sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion?
2. How do elementary school librarians describe the factors that influence their
decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts?

Research Design

This illustrative case study (GAO, 1990) with a descriptive survey examines
librarian decision making regarding diverse literature. “Illustrative case studies primarily
describe what is happening and why,” (GAO, 1990, p. 37). As little published research
exists examining the factors impacting librarian decision making, and no published
studies posit a theory of decision making regarding diverse texts, this study provides an

58
insight into an understudied area and helps “make the unfamiliar familiar,” (GAO, 1990,
p. 38), which exemplifies an illustrative case study. This case study is bounded by
geographic region (five states in the mountain region) as well as elementary school
librarians.
The quantitative data in this study provides information about the types of
diversity in books school librarians promote in their libraries and feel comfortable
promoting, but does not provide insight into the reasons. Many factors impact which
types of diversity school librarians include and feel comfortable including in school
libraries. A survey with strictly quantitative aspects would not address this complexity.
Qualitative data, in the form of comments, open-ended questions, and eight interviews,
provide more detailed insight into the quantitative data for those participants who chose
to complete both aspects of this study. This study’s qualitative data do not fully address
the trends in inclusion of particular types of diversity. Thus, examining both types of data
provides for more in-depth examination and richer understanding of the data, as well as
greater triangulation than using one form alone for this research (Creswell, 2015; Gay,
Mills, & Airasian, 2009; Ponce & Pagán-Maldonado, 2015). Given the amount of
qualitative data collected, this illustrative case study has more of a qualitative focus.

Instruments

This section describes the different parts of the survey and the interview
questions. The survey has five main parts, and the semi-structured interview has 16

59
questions. One hundred and sixteen people completed the survey, while eight people selfselected for interviews.

Survey Description, Reliability, and Validity
This survey (see appendix A) includes structured items as well as unstructured
items in the form of open-ended comments and questions (Gay, Mills, & Airasian, 2009).
The survey has five main parts. The first part of the survey collects demographic
information with a total of eight questions. The items for gender, race, sexual orientation,
grade level, and years of experience are left open-ended to be inclusive of a range of
possible identifications and to avoid unintentional exclusion or marginalization of any
identity. The rest of the items in the demographic section have choices: school type
(grade levels served and public, private, or charter) size (number of students), and
location (state and reservation, rural, suburban, or urban). The rationale behind providing
choices for these items was to provide a guide for participants and create a way to more
easily use this for quantitative analysis. The demographics questions are similar to other
surveys (Fehr & Argello, 2012; Jordan, 2014; School Library Journal, 2016) with the
exception of sexual orientation. That was included based on feedback from some of the
expert review panel, as well as the researcher wondering whether any correlations would
exist between minoritized sexual orientation identities and frequency of promotion or
comfort level.
The second part of the survey examines how frequently school librarians promote
books inclusive of different types of diversity, with 26 identities (see appendix A). This
part uses a scale that has four items resembling a Likert scale and one that does not:

60
zero=“I don’t know,” one=“never,” two=“rarely,” three=“sometimes,” four=“often.” A
comment box located at the end of this part allows the respondent to provide any
clarification he/she desires.
Internal consistency (reliability) was examined through Cronbach’s alpha (Gay,
Mills, & Airasian, 2009). Cronbach’s alpha “uses the mean of all the interitem
correlations…to assess the stability or consistency of measurement” (Warner, 2013, p.
931). For the question regarding frequency of book promotion, the overall internal
consistency for all 26 items on this survey was high (α=.91). However, most individual
subsections did not have similarly high consistency. Therefore, the researcher chose to
look at different subscales for the items that could be grouped together. The five items for
religion had the highest internal consistency (α=.94), which means that respondents
tended to provide similar answers to the items related to religion. The seven items for
race had lower internal consistency (α=.70), as did the eight items for family
configuration (α=.87), the two items for gender (α=.61) and the two items for sexual
orientation (α=.59). However, when the two items for minoritized sexual orientation and
gender (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) were grouped together, the internal
consistency rose (α=.80), but that did not hold true for heterosexual and cisgender
(α=.59). Generally, an acceptable Chronbach’s alpha is .70 or higher (Field, 2013).
The third part of the survey explores school librarian comfort level with
promotion of diverse identities. This section is closed-ended, in order to include the
specific types (n=26) of diversities mentioned in the previous section. The respondent

61
checks any that he/she feels comfortable promoting in the library. A comment section at
the end provides room for participants to further explain their responses.
Chronbach’s alpha for internal consistency is good for the question regarding
comfort level (α=.84), though it is lower than for frequency of promotion (α=.91).
Religion had higher consistency (α=.95), just as with frequency of promotion. However,
other groups had lower reliability: race (α=.70), family configuration (α=.33), gender
(.70), and sexual orientation (α=.63). Just as with frequency of promotion, combining
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender resulted in a higher Cronbach’s alpha (α=.88), and
heterosexual and cisgender had a lower alpha (α=.61).
The fourth part of the survey asks respondents to list one or more books per
diverse category that they promote in the school library. The reasoning behind asking
school librarians to list titles of diverse books is that sometimes people choose an answer
that appears more socially acceptable on a survey (Alreck & Settle, 2004). However, if
they “often” promote certain diverse identities in the library, they will likely remember a
title and/or author of a book they have promoted that have characters with those
identities. This open-ended part of the survey allows internal validity checks if the
participants choose to participate in this part of the survey. It also provides additional
data to examine.
The last part of the survey consists of four open-ended questions. These questions
further probe respondents’ beliefs regarding diverse literature, as well as examine
whether respondents have dealt with any challenges regarding diverse literature. The

62
respondents also have the option to participate in a follow-up interview if they wish, and
may leave their email addresses at the end of the survey.
The sensitivity of the measures on the survey provides a measure of validity
(Warner, 2013). If the scores tend to pile up at one extreme or the other, this can show a
lack of sensitivity of the scale, and provide an indication it may need revision (Warner,
2013). However, it can also show that specific types of diversity are overrepresented or
the teacher/librarian is not aware of representation for those types of diversity. In the case
of this survey, a pile up of answers likely indicated the overrepresentation of some types
of diversity rather than a lack of sensitivity of the scale, though that remains a possibility
as well. For example, all librarians indicated that they “sometimes” or “often” promote
books with Caucasian characters, the characters most frequently represented in children’s
literature (Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017; Crisp et al., 2016).

Pilot Studies
The researcher developed this survey to study a greater variety of diversity in
literature used by elementary school librarians. Currently, no published study exists like
this one. K-12 classroom teachers and education professors who specialize in literacy
reviewed this survey and provided suggestions that resulted in refinements to the survey.
The researcher piloted this survey twice, once with K-12 teachers (n=23) and once with
K-12 school librarians (n=20), and further refined it.
The first version included a section on diverse children’s literature awards and
had no questions at the end of the survey. Prior to the first pilot study, two literacy
professors at two state university education programs and several K-12 classroom

63
teachers examined the survey and provided feedback. After collecting and analyzing the
data, the researcher removed the awards questions after the data showed few teachers had
familiarity with the majority of the diverse literature awards listed. More demographic
information was added to the survey after the first pilot study in order to examine
frequencies for the demographic factors and responses. Four questions were added to the
end of the survey to gain additional information regarding the respondents.
Prior to the second pilot study, additional literacy professors and classroom
teachers, including the board members of a state affiliate of the National Council of
Teachers of English, reviewed the revised survey. The researcher further modified the
survey based on feedback, and then asked a Library Media professor to review the survey
prior to piloting it with school librarians. These expert reviews provide face validity.

Interviews
The researcher conducted semi-structured interviews (see appendix B) with eight
participants who self-selected for the interviews. Semi-structured interviews include preplanned questions, while also allowing for researcher follow-up and questions that arise
during the course of an interview (Glesne, 2011). Educational professionals, including
literacy professors and classroom teachers, examined the questions and provided
suggestions for modification of questions. This provides face validity for this study. The
researcher implemented the suggestions from the reviewers.

64
Data Collection

This survey of elementary school librarians included five states in the mountain
region as noted in the section on delimitations in chapter one: Idaho, Montana, New
Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Each state has different information available regarding
contact information for elementary school librarians, school websites, or a directory of
schools and/or school librarians. Some states had more accessible information than
others. Table 3.1 shows the numbers of possible elementary school librarians in each
state (not every school has a librarian), the number of email addresses available, how
many emails were returned, and the response rate. As each state provided different
information and some schools had no websites and/or no librarian listed in the directory
and/or no contact information for the librarian, the number of possible elementary
librarians refers to the number of librarians or the number of schools that appeared on
directories provided by the state, and some directories had not been updated in a while.
The total number of librarians likely contacted by the researcher refers to those whose
emails did not bounce back, and includes the contact forms found on some school
websites in lieu of email addresses. Some school emails have strong filters and there is no
guarantee how many emails made it into the librarians’ email inboxes, nor does the
researcher know how many librarians opened the emails if they did receive them.

Montana has a directory that includes names, schools, and e-mail addresses for all
school librarians in the state. There are many rural schools in this state that include more
than elementary grades; these may be excluded if only searching for those schools
identified as just elementary schools. Therefore, the researcher sent e-mails to those
schools identified as elementary, K-8, K-12, or simply listed as the name of the town and
public school (N=385). Unfortunately, some schools had no contact information other
than a physical address and phone number. Forty-four emails bounced back as
undeliverable. Some of the schools had websites, some of which included email
addresses for librarians and/or contact forms. Some schools had closed since the state last
updated the directory.
Wyoming and New Mexico each have directories that list schools. Wyoming’s list
is not searchable by elementary school, and the same concern about excluding rural
schools as noted previously applies here. Thus all elementary, K-8, and K-12 schools
were included (N=182). New Mexico’s directory provides a searchable list that allows
one to narrow it to only elementary schools (N=405). In each state, some schools did not
have email addresses for librarians; this was much more prevalent in New Mexico than in

66
Wyoming. Emails bounced back as undeliverable from each state, with more from New
Mexico (n=104) than Wyoming (n=5); attempts were made to locate updated information
on the school websites, if the websites existed. Some no longer listed email addresses but
had contact forms on the school website for all faculty. Additionally, some schools on the
list in New Mexico had closed since the last update of the list.
As the researcher more easily located information for school librarians in
Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming, she contacted these librarians first, on January 12,
2017. When emails bounced back, more research was conducted to attempt to find
updated email addresses for school librarians and/or contact forms on the school
websites. When few responded to the survey in a little over a week, the researcher
included Idaho and Utah, but as they had 1,222 schools to search for, the emails went out
almost two weeks after the emails to the first three states. She emailed librarians in Idaho
on January 24, 2017, and in Utah on January 25, 2017.
Idaho (N=485) and Utah (N=737) each have a list of elementary schools; none
had contact information beyond a phone number and/or physical address and possible a
link to a website. As this was an online survey, the decision was made to contact
librarians through email. Idaho’s department of education does not maintain a directory
of elementary school librarians (K. Everitt, personal communication, December 20,
2016), and the organization that lists schools noted that they cannot provide an e-mail list
(P. Bradshaw, personal communication, December 20, 2016). Some schools did not have
websites; those that did have websites did not always list a librarian or email address or
contact form for a librarian.

67
Reminder emails were sent on January 22, 2017 and February 5, 2017 for
Montana, Wyoming, and New Mexico, and on February 5, 2017 and February 17, 2017
for Idaho and Utah. In an attempt to improve participation, the researcher located
individuals who were willing to email the survey invitation to school librarians who
participate in listservs for Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Montana and
Wyoming librarians on a listserv received an email about the survey on January 30, 2017.
Utah librarians on a listserv received an email about the survey on January 31, 2017. New
Mexico librarians on a listserv also received an email about the survey in January, though
the exact date is unknown. The researcher closed the survey on February 25, 2017. This
gave all participants at least a month in which to respond to the first email from the
researcher.
The researcher contacted individuals who left contact information (N=22) for an
interview within a few days to arrange an interview. Most (n=13) did not respond, even
with a second email. One responded to decline an interview, while eight agreed to
participate. The researcher sent a consent form and offered interested participants the
option of conducting the interview by phone, e-mail, Skype, or another method that
worked for them. Interviews conducted through Skype (n=2) or by phone (n=2) were
recorded, and the interviews transcribed and sent to the interviewees to review. Four
participants chose to answer interview questions through email.

68
Participants

One hundred and sixteen elementary school librarians completed this survey. One
hundred and fifty-one people started the survey. Nineteen people chose to stop the survey
after completing the demographic section. Fifteen people were not elementary school
librarians, and thus the researcher excluded their data. One person who lived in Georgia
completed the survey. Since this survey focused on five states in the mountain region of
the United States, the researcher excluded her data.
A majority of the participants identified as female (n=106), White (n=102), and
heterosexual (n=74). Some participants chose not to answer in each of the categories,
including 38 who did not respond to the question about sexual orientation or gave an
answer other than sexual orientation, such as asking a question (n=3) or writing
“married,” (n=2), “male,” (n=1) or “female” (n=3). They have served for librarians for as
little as half a year to more than 40 years (M=9.93, SD=8.14). Half work in K-5 or K-6
schools, while the others work in K-8 (n=16), K-12 (n=25), or other (e.g. 3-6, PK-2, etc.)
schools. The majority work in public schools (n=106), and a slight majority work in rural
areas (n=64, including the five who work in schools on reservations).

Interview Participants
Eight librarians chose to participate in the interviews. All eight librarians identify
as female. One identifies as more than one race, and seven identify as White. One is
bisexual, while seven are heterosexual. They have between three and forty years’
experience as librarians (M=12, SD=12.78). Four work in rural areas, one in a suburban

69
area, and three in urban areas. Four live in Montana, one in Utah, and three in Wyoming.
Two work in K-5 schools, one in K-6, two in K-8, and three in K-12. This section briefly
describes each interview participant. Pseudonyms are used for all participants.
Jana. Jana works in a K-5 school and has over 20 years’ experience as a librarian.
She has over 10,000 books in her library. She stated that she values diverse literature,
though she mentioned that some students may not find books that mirror all of their
identities. She pointed out some challenges in finding books that accurately match her
students’ identities, especially when she may not know all of the identities a student has.
Amber. Amber works in a K-5 school and has over ten years’ experience. Her
library has over 14,500 items, including technology. She indicated valuing diverse
literature and displaying it, though she promotes some types of diverse identities
individually rather than to a group of students.

Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn works in a K-6 school, and is in her first year at this school,
though she has prior experience as a librarian. She does not know exactly how many
books she has, as she has been weeding the collection of outdated and damaged books;
she had 9,600 books at the start of the year. Kaitlyn showed enthusiasm for diverse
literature and plans to build a more diverse collection of books in her library.

Stephanie. Stephanie works in a K-8 school, and this is her first year at this
school. She explained that her school is relatively new, and the library was built mainly
on donations, and she still receives many book donations each year. She mentioned

70
weeding through the library collection, and has a high regard for diverse literature, which
supports her school’s mission statement.

Sarah. Sarah works in a K-8 school, and has around 8,000 books in her library.
She also values diverse books, and weighs the values of her community regarding
promotion of texts. She selects books on the basis of student interest and award winners.

Kristin. Kristin works in a K-12 school, and has over 12,000 books in her library.
She stated valuing diverse literature, but feels somewhat unsure about possible pushback
due to the political climate lately regarding some types of diversity. She mentioned that
she would discuss some diverse texts with the staff prior to deciding whether to include
them in the library.

Carolyn. Carolyn works in a K-12 school and has over 20,000 books in her
library, even after weeding through her collection. She mentioned concern about a future
budget for libraries, as the legislature in her state is cutting funding. She strongly values
diverse literature, and has encouraged the students in her school to participate in Yang’s
Reading Without Walls Challenge (Yang, 2016).

Melissa. Melissa works in a K-12 school with over 38,000 books in her library.
She expressed enthusiasm for diverse literature. She searches for diverse books, and does
her best to find books that reflect her students’ identities and the identities of others. She
has community support, and her school has a policy in place for book challenges.

Data Analysis

This illustrative case study (GAO, 1990) with a descriptive survey provides
opportunities for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of data. Both methods of data
analysis provide a richer picture than one method alone. The quantitative results were
used to guide the qualitative interviews to better understand librarian survey responses.

Quantitative Analysis
The researcher used SPSS, a software tool, to conduct quantitative analyses.
Given the nature of the data, the researcher focused on descriptive statistics to examine
the results. She created frequency tables that show the number and percentage of
responses in each category for the quantitative sections of the study. Descriptive statistics
also allowed the researcher to compare the responses for different states, types of school,
and other demographic information (Field, 2013; Warner, 2013). She conducted
crosstabulations to examine whether relationships exist among different factors, such as
promotion of books in a school library and comfort level, as well as whether there are
relationships among different demographics and comfort level or usage in a classroom.
However, given the low expected count in multiple cells, the chi square statistic proved
less reliable (Michael, 2001). Thus, she created frequency tables for the demographics
instead of relying on crosstabulations.

Qualitative Analysis
The researcher used qualitative data analysis software, NVivo, to analyze the
qualitative data with the exception of the book titles provided by participants. Although

72
this software provides many data analysis tools, those available for the basic package are
limited. The tools used for coding include word cloud, coding, and coding stripes. The
word cloud provided information about the frequency of words used by participants, as
well as some initial codes.
Through the initial read-through as well as the coding cycles that followed, the
researcher engaged in analytic memoing in order to examine her thinking about the
process and capture thoughts about the data. These memos provided a source of data as
well as helped the researcher explore possible bias. Through coding memos, a researcher
may uncover additional codes, better codes, and/or insights (Saldaña, 2013).
The first coding cycle included attribute coding, magnitude coding, and
descriptive coding. Attribute coding involves determining significant attributes to include
with the qualitative data. Demographic information (attributes) was linked to the
qualitative responses, though this provided few insights with these data. Magnitude
coding explores the intensity or frequency of specific phenomena, and the researcher
used magnitude codes such as “yes” and “no” when coding whether participants had
experienced book challenges. Descriptive coding allows for a one- or two-word summary
of the main topic. The descriptive codes initially used came from word clouds as well as
phrases from participants’ words. Some initial descriptive codes included “students,”
“parents,” and “community.” After initial coding, the researcher examined and coded
memos, as well as engaged in additional analytic memoing. She then recoded the data
with the new codes. Next, she engaged in code mapping to develop categories. The

73
researcher recoded the data using the categories as a form of pattern coding (Saldaña,
2013). Two main themes emerged from this process.
Although the survey included a question asking respondents to list book titles
with diverse main characters, not all participants did so. The list of titles, however,
comprises 43 pages (see appendix G). Some participants listed authors only, some listed
book titles only, and some listed famous people. The researcher could not locate author
information for every title listed. Sometimes more than one book had the same title, and
sometimes nothing came up with a search for the title. Given this, as well as the vast
number of book titles, the researcher chose not to pursue analysis of these titles at this
time. She has not read all of the books listed, but has read enough to notice that some
librarians listed books in categories where only a minor (or no) character has that diverse
identity. She also realized that some of the books listed contain stereotypes.

Trustworthiness

In order to develop trustworthiness within a qualitative study, the researcher
should demonstrate credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability
(Shenton, 2004). One way to show credibility is to use data collection and analysis
methods that others have used. The data collection methods are fairly common for
surveys and interviews. The data analysis methods came from Saldaña (2013), and thus
have been employed by other researchers previously. The use of multiple data sources
and/or methods—triangulation—assists with credibility (Shenton, 2004). The data
sources in this study include quantitative and qualitative questions that provide different

74
types of data. Interviews provide another data source that assists with triangulation. In
addition, rich description also helps with credibility in qualitative research studies
(Shenton, 2004). Another way to assist with credibility is having confidentiality and
letting participants know they can choose to answer or not answer questions as they wish,
and can withdraw from participation at any time. Additionally, peer reviews can assist
with credibility, and the committee thoroughly reviewed this study and provided
suggestions for improvement (Shenton, 2004).
Transferability refers to whether results apply to other populations outside of the
participants in the study, while dependability shares similarities with reliability in that
enough detail should be given for others to be able to replicate the methods used in the
study. The researcher explained the limitations, what types of data she collected, how
she collected and analyzed the data, and how many people participated in the survey and
interviews. Confirmability also refers to whether a researcher has explained her biases
and strove for objectivity (Shenton, 2004).
Researcher bias impacts a study, as worldviews color the lenses through which
one views the world and thus influences perceptions and interpretations (Creswell, 2013;
Kovach 2009, 2013). In order to thoughtfully conduct research with full awareness and
disclosure of biases, one must locate oneself in the research landscape and explore the
lenses through which the one views the world (Dana-Sacco, 2010; Kovach, 2009, 2013).
Through this self-location, a researcher can examine underlying motivations for research
choices and clarify for self and others the worldview of the researcher and how it may
impact the research (Dana-Sacco, 2010; Kovach, 2009, 2013). Thus, information about a

75
researcher’s background provides necessary self-location and allows for greater
credibility.

Researcher Background and Positionality
As a member of both majoritized (e.g. White) and minoritized (e.g. lesbian)
groups, I have had experiences with being both overrepresented for an identity and
underrepresented for an identity. While I was immersed in literature with White
characters from birth and read voraciously, I did not encounter any text with a lesbian
character until I was 21.
I grew up in a conservative community and did not hear anything positive about
lesbians. I consider myself more feminine, a decent person, and have always had close
friends of different genders; I did not fit the stereotypes of lesbians (evil, man-hating,
masculine women) that I had heard my entire life. I hid my identity, even from myself,
believing that I was defective; I preferred defectiveness to thinking of myself as evil.
When I finally encountered a positive portrayal of a lesbian in text, it changed my world.
Until that moment, I had no idea that any lesbian existed who did not fit the negative
stereotypes. I had only heard a single—derogatory—story of lesbians. Reading about
someone like me opened possibilities that I never knew existed and provided a route to
self-acceptance. It also challenged the pre-conceived ideas and internalized bigotry I had
absorbed from growing up in a heterocentric, heterosupremacist culture. I finally had a
place in the world, as well as vehicles for identity development.
Due to this, when I became an elementary educator, I knew the power of books to
shape lives, shatter prejudices, and promote growth and acceptance. I understood the

76
thirst for representation and the pain of invisibility. I wanted to have books representative
of my students’ identities, and of identities that they did not possess. However, locating
quality literature that would provide mirrors, windows, and doors for all my students
proved a challenge and, in some cases, an impossibility. I did not, however, understand
the scope of the problem for many years.
In my master’s program, my professors introduced me to research regarding the
lack of diversity in children’s literature. This became a passion of mine, and I conducted
my master’s thesis analyzing the diversity (race, sexual orientation, and gender) of the
fiction books in a middle school library. What I learned on that journey created a drive to
examine this topic further and advocate for more diversity in children’s literature.
Although many seem to agree on the value of diverse literature in the classroom, I could
not find a published study that looked at a range of diverse identities represented in
literature used in a classroom or promoted in a library, nor one that examined teacher and
librarian comfort level with various types of diversity.
My passion for this topic may provide an area of bias, as might the various
identity groups to which I belong or have belonged that are present in this study. I
identify as a White, cisgender, lower socioeconomic status lesbian with an eclectic
spiritual worldview. I have no diagnosed disabilities, and I grew up with two oppositesex parents who have been married for over 40 years. All of these identities impact the
lenses through which I view the world.
As a way to help mitigate the effects of bias and my worldview on this study, I
examined my identities and motivations and how these may impact my study (Creswell,

77
2013; Glesne, 2011; Maxwell, 2013). Research is not neutral; the experiences, beliefs,
and identities of the researcher all influence the choices made at every stage of the
research process (Glesne, 2011; Maxwell, 2013). Journaling through this process and
examining and re-examining choices and interpretations made provided a check on
researcher bias, as did having professors examine my interpretations (Glesne, 2011;
Maxwell, 2013).

Summary

This illustrative case study (GAO, 1990) with a descriptive survey examined
elementary school librarians’ use of diverse literature, their comfort level with different
types of diversity, and factors that influence their decision making regarding diverse
literature. The survey included quantitative and qualitative questions, and participants
could self-select for interviews. The researcher created the survey and did two pilot
studies: one with teachers and one with librarians. The researcher then modified the
survey to its current form (see appendix A) based on data and on suggestions from
reviewers.

78
CHAPTER FOUR

RESULTS

Data analysis is a complex process that involves moving back and forth
between concrete bits of data and abstract concepts, between inductive and
deductive reasoning, between description and interpretation. (Merriam,
1998, p. 178)
Published children’s literature in the United States overrepresents some identities
while underrepresenting others, such as people of color, LGBT people, people with
disabilities, people who live below the poverty line (Crisp et al., 2016), and more. Thus,
some children may not encounter text representative of their identities. As literature can
assist with identity development and provide ways for children to learn about those who
differ from self, the lack of diversity in children’s books disadvantages both children with
minoritized and those with majoritized identities (Bishop, 2012; Koss, 2015; Lifshitz,
2016; Schachter & Galili-Schachter, 2012).
School librarians function as gatekeepers through the purchase and promotion of
various texts. The decisions made by these gatekeepers may enable greater access to
representative literature or may limit access. Few published research studies have
explored diversity in school libraries: three focused on LGBT-inclusive literature in
middle or high school libraries (Hughes-Hassell, Overberg, & Harris, 2013; Page, 2016;
Oltmann, 2015), and one examined controversial books in elementary, middle, and high
school libraries (School Library Journal, 2016). One study examined comfort level with
LGBT literature (Page, 2016). No published study has examined elementary school
librarians’ promotion of or comfort level with all types of diversity featured in this survey

79
or the factors that influence decision making regarding diverse text. This illustrative case
study (GAO, 1990) with a descriptive survey examines the promotion of diverse
literature in elementary school libraries through two main research questions:
1. How frequently do elementary school librarians promote books with diverse main
characters in terms of race, disability, family structure, socio-economic status,
sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion?
2. How do elementary school librarians describe the factors that influence their
decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts?
This study included a survey with both quantitative and qualitative questions, as
well as eight interviews with respondents who self-selected for interviews. Results are
grouped according to: 1) quantitative results, 2) qualitative results, and 3) synthesis of
quantitative and qualitative data.

Quantitative Results

The survey (see appendix A) had both quantitative and qualitative questions. This
section focuses on the quantitative parts of the survey. The first part consisted of
demographic information for librarians and their schools. Next, the survey asked
respondents to select the frequency with which they promote the listed types of diversity.
The third part of the survey asked respondents to select the types of diversity that they
feel comfortable promoting.

80
Librarian Demographics
This section of the survey included eight questions. Four questions focused on
demographic information about the individual librarians, while four asked information
about the school. The demographic questions about the librarians (race, gender, sexual
orientation, and years as a librarian) were left open-ended. Each person who chose to
answer the question about gender listed sex (male, female) instead of gender. For the
purposes of more brevity in the table (see Table 4.1), the researcher grouped the
responses for years as a librarian in five-year increments.
For school demographics, the survey listed options for grade level and state (see
appendix A) and provided an option for “other.” School type and school location
included selected responses, though individuals could check more than one location (e.g.
reservation and rural). Each librarian at a reservation school indicated he/she worked in a
rural location as well. In the table, the numbers for those working in rural schools do not
include the five individuals who work in reservation schools.
One hundred and sixteen elementary school librarians completed this survey. One
hundred and fifty-one people started the survey. Nineteen people chose to stop the survey
after completing the demographic section. Fifteen people were not elementary school
librarians, and thus the researcher excluded their data. One person lives in Georgia. Since
this survey focused on five states in the mountain region of the United States, the
researcher chose to exclude her data.

Frequency of Promotion
The first research question for this study asks, “How frequently do elementary
school librarians promote books with diverse main characters in terms of race, disability,
family structure, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and

82
religion?” This research question is answered by the first question in the survey. The
directions for this question read, “For this first group of questions, please mark the
number that corresponds most to how frequently you promote books in your library that
include main characters belonging to different groups/family situations. The books that I
promote in my library include main characters who…” The list down the side included 26
types of diversity. For each type, respondents had the opportunity to select from the
following five options: “I don’t know,” “never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” and “often.”
Some respondents (n=14) did not answer in all categories, and one respondent chose not
to answer any parts of this question.
The following table (see Table 4.2) shows the number of responses in each
category. Most individuals knew whether they promoted books with characters of
different races in their libraries. Sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and
grandparents raising grandkids all had double-digit numbers of people who did not know
whether they promote books with those characters. All respondents who knew whether
they promoted books with Caucasian main characters, single parents, or divorced parents
indicated that they promoted books with these characters. Every other type of diversity
had at least one respondent who indicated “never” promoting books with that type of
diversity. Fifty-five respondents (49.10%) replied that they “never” promote books with
transgender characters, which is eighteen more respondents more than the next highest
(lesbian, gay, or bisexual characters).

Table 4.3 shows the percentages of people responding in each of the categories.
A low percentage of respondents indicated promoting books with transgender (0.89%),
gay, lesbian, bisexual (1.79%), or Hindu characters (1.82%) “often.” However, these
categories had double-digit percentages of people who did not know whether they
promoted books featuring these characters. A high percentage of respondents (75.89%)
indicated promoting books with Caucasian characters “often.” All respondents indicated
promoting books with Caucasian characters “sometimes” or “often,” which is not the
case for any other identity in this survey. As most children’s books feature Caucasian
characters (CCBC, 2017), that provides an explanation for these frequencies.
Participants noted promoting books with Caucasian (75.89%) characters, twodifferent sex parents (47.27%), and heterosexual characters (40.00%) “often.” In the
category for “sometimes,” the top three are characters who have a disability (66.67%),
Latino/a characters (62.83%), and African American characters (61.74%). Librarians
“rarely” promoted books with Arab American characters (52.73%), Hindu characters
(37.27%), and Muslim characters (36.94%). The highest percentages in the “never”
category include transgender characters (49.11%), lesbian, gay, or bisexual characters
(33.04%), and cisgender characters (29.73%).

Since some individuals did not know whether they promoted books with
particular types of diversity in their libraries, Table 4.4 shows the percentages of people
in each category who indicated knowing how frequently they promote books in the
various categories. Of those who indicated knowing the frequency of book promotion for
different categories, a majority (60.44%) indicated “never” promoting books with
transgender characters. Books with Caucasian characters were most likely to be promoted
“often” (75.89%).
The grouping of different factors in the survey provides insights into responses as
well. For each racial category other than Caucasian, at least one person indicated “never”
promoting books with characters of that race, with Arab American being the highest
(13.21%). For most family configurations other than single parents or divorced parents,
at least two respondents stated that they “never” promote books with these characters,
with the highest percentage (28.42%) “never” promoting books with same-sex parents.
Regarding texts with characters of the listed religions, double-digit percentages of
individuals marked “never” promoting these books, except for Christian main characters
(8.79%). Sexual orientation and gender identity had double-digit percentages of people
“never” promoting them. Two respondents each reported “never” promoting books with
characters who have a disability or live below the poverty line.

In addition to examining the frequencies of responses in the various categories,
the researcher ran crosstabulations to examine whether any demographic factors for
librarians or schools showed statistical significance; none did when applying the
Bonferroni correction due to running 26 analyses (Field, 2013). The low expected cell
count for many of the cells posed some challenges regarding the probabilities for the chisquare statistic, given that some cells had expected counts less than one (Michael, 2001).
However, frequency tables were included for the various demographics (see appendix E).
The frequency tables show that a higher percentage of people of color who completed
this survey (n=11) used literature featuring people of color than White people who took
this survey (n=105).

Comfort Level
This part of the survey stated, “I feel comfortable promoting books in my library
that have characters who (please select all that apply).” The 26 types of diversity
followed this statement, and the respondents were given the opportunity to select those
that they felt comfortable promoting. Some respondents (n=7) did not answer this
question, and were excluded from analysis.
Table 4.5 shows the frequency of responses, while Figure 4.6 shows the
percentages of those who feel comfortable promoting books in each category. A majority
of respondents felt uncomfortable promoting books with transgender (n=78) and gay,
lesbian, or bisexual (n=69) characters. No participant felt uncomfortable promoting books
with American Indian, Caucasian, or adopted characters, or books that show divorced
parents. Most respondents indicated feeling comfortable with promoting books with main

89
characters of different races. The only category that had double-digit responses showing
discomfort was Arab American (n=11). For different family configurations, a majority of
respondents indicated feeling comfortable promoting these books. However, books with
same-sex parents had the most people (n=51) reporting discomfort. Books with religious
main characters had double-digit numbers of people indicating discomfort, with Hindu
having the most (n=19), though the majority felt comfortable with books with religious
characters. Two people each felt uncomfortable promoting books that have main
characters with disabilities or who live below the poverty line.

The researcher ran crosstabulations to examine whether any demographic factors
for librarians or schools showed statistical significance; none did when applying the
Bonferroni correction due to running 26 analyses (Field, 2013). The low expected cell
count for many of the cells posed some challenges regarding the reliability of the chi-

92
square statistic. “No expected frequency should be less than 1 and no more than 20% of
the expected frequencies should be less than 5” (Michael, 2001, p. 2). Unfortunately,
several cells had expected counts less than one. However, the researcher created
frequency tables for the various demographics (see appendix F). The frequency tables
show that more librarians in rural areas feel comfortable with some types of diversity
(including LGBT) than people in suburban areas.

Summary
Elementary school librarians indicated promoting books with some majoritized
identities “often,” such as books with Caucasian (n=85), two different-sex parents
(n=52), and heterosexual (n=44) characters, likely because most published children’s
books feature these identities (Crisp et al., 2016). However, cisgender (n=30) and
Christian (n=13) are also majoritized identities in the United States, yet they were
promoted “often” by fewer librarians than some minoritized identities; these identities
also had double-digit numbers of people who did not know whether they promoted books
with these identities. While cisgender (gender aligned with sex assigned at birth)
characters feature in almost all published children’s books, no readily available statistics
exist regarding the percentage of books published each year with Christian main
characters.
All of the respondents felt comfortable promoting books with Caucasian,
American Indian, and adopted characters, as well as books that show divorced parents; of
these, Caucasian is the only majoritized identity. Heterosexual (n=77) and cisgender

93
(n=57) characters had some of the lowest numbers of comfort with promotion, possibly
indicating unfamiliarity with the terms.
The identities that the fewest respondents felt comfortable promoting— gay,
lesbian, or bisexual (n=40) and transgender (n=31)—were the ones more librarians
“never” promoted. Most respondents frequently promoted books with Caucasian main
characters, and all respondents felt comfortable doing so. However, 51 respondents also
indicated promoting books that they did not feel comfortable promoting. For example,
some respondents felt uncomfortable promoting literature with LGBT characters, but
stated that they do promote these books. On the other hand, some respondents did not
promote literature they felt comfortable promoting. For instance, even though two
respondents “never” promoted literature with American Indian main characters, they
indicated that they feel comfortable doing so. Most librarians noted promoting the
majority of diverse identities “sometimes,” or “often,” and indicated that they felt
comfortable doing so.

The researcher used qualitative data analysis software, NVivo, to analyze these
data. Although this software provides many data analysis tools, those available for the
basic package are limited. The tools used for coding include word cloud, coding, and
coding stripes. The word cloud provided information about the frequency of words used
by participants, as well as some initial codes for descriptive coding (e.g. students,
community, parents, important, appropriate). In addition to descriptive coding, initial
coding included magnitude (e.g. yes and no) and attribute coding (Saldaña, 2013).

95
Examples of initial codes are shown in Table 4.8; this table shows some of the codes used
in the tables for the comment sections on the survey. Attribute coding was not included in
the table, as it simply linked comments with demographics. The quotes reported in this
table represent multiple similar comments.

This section follows the organization of the survey. The comments from the first
two quantitative questions are examined first, followed by the other open-ended questions
on the survey. Information from the interviews follows the open-ended questions. The
researcher explores emerging themes at the end of this section.

Frequency of Book Promotion
The survey included an open-ended comment section after the quantitative
question asking how frequently the librarians promote books with each type of diversity.
Forty-four respondents out of 116 (38%) chose to write comments. Most respondents
(n=40) identified as female, White (n=39) and heterosexual (n=34). The number of years

96
working as a librarian ranged from half a year to forty years, with a mean of 9.93,
(SD=8.14). One librarian works at a school on a rural reservation, twenty-two in a rural
area, eleven in a suburban area, eight in an urban area, and the remaining two indicated
both rural and suburban.
Several descriptive codes emerged from analysis of these comments (see Table
4.9) regarding favorability towards diversity, awareness of the value of diverse literature,
challenges with promoting some types of diverse literature, and availability of books. The
numbers of responses appear below the codes. The quotes selected represent the different
viewpoints expressed. The researcher selected quotes that most concisely illustrated the
variety of responses in the different categories, as well as those that represented multiple
responses.

are very important to me. The library environment
should be welcome to all visitors.”
Awareness of the Value of
Diverse Literature
(11)

“As for the whole sexuality issue, I do have those books
and I refer kids individually to them but they are
available to the whole community.”
“Don't usually give much attention to this list's point of
view, but do try to convey that 'families' come in many
forms.”[sic]

Challenges Promoting Some
Types of Diversity
(12)

“We are in a very isolated, conservative community.
Our students will not check out a book where the
protagonist is not someone they understand.”
“These issues are not age appropriate to discuss with
children in elementary school.”

Availability of Diverse
Literature
(13)

“If I typed rarely as my response, it is because I may not
have found a book at the K-5 level that accurately
reflects the question posed in the survey.”
“I struggle to find books, especially for young children
in grades K-6, that show diversity in conjunction with
quality literature.”

Half of the respondents (n=22) mentioned specific types of diversity in their
comments (see Table 4.10). About 36% of the total comments included sexual

98
orientation, while 23% mentioned gender and 23% discussed religion (see table 4.10).
Fifteen (34%) comments included more than one type of diverse identity. The comments
selected for this table provide a sample of quotes regarding that type of diversity. Each
quote represents other respondents.

Table 4.10 Types of Diversity Mentioned Most Frequently

Sexual Orientation
(16)
“Most elementary level books do not have main characters
who are exploring issues of sexuality.”
“I am hoping to get approval to read and offer books that are
more LGBTQ friendly but still at a level that is appropriate
for K through 5th.”
Gender
(10)

“So far, though, most elementary students do not seem to
have much awareness about the transgender issue, so I leave
it off the table for now.”
“I can see preferences for Barbie and Princess books in some
boys-often the families are the ones 'making' them check out
books for 'boys.' I try to show them those 'girl' books all have
princes in them.” [sic]

Religion
(10)

“I would guess that the characters are Christian, but that
doesn't seem transparent in our books. I do know that we
have at least one book when a character is discussing Jewish
traditions.”
“I don't teach religious books because it is a public school.
Characters may have a religion that is used to develop their
character, in which case I can use those books.”

Comfort Level
The survey included an open-ended comment section after the quantitative
question asking about comfort level with each type of diversity. Forty-three people out of

99
116 (37%) chose to respond. Three of the commenters identified as male. Two identified
as American Indian, one as Hispanic, three as more than one race, and one as American.
Regarding sexual orientation, one identified as bisexual, one as homosexual, one as
lesbian, one as married, two as either male or female, two wrote comments, and five did
not respond. The number of years as a librarian ranged from half a year to forty years,
with a mean of 10.57 (SD=8.95). One works in a school on a reservation in a rural area,
twenty-one in a rural area, twelve in a suburban area, six in an urban area, and three
marked combinations of rural, suburban, and/or urban.
Several descriptive codes emerged from analyses of these comments (see Table
4.11) regarding favorability towards diversity, awareness of the value of diverse
literature, challenges with promoting some types of diverse literature, and availability of
books. The numbers of responses appear below the code. Each response represents other
responses in that code. The researcher selected the quotes to provide a representative
sample of responses for each code.

“Diversity and books that accurately reflect all viewpoints
and the stories of all people are important.”
“We encourage our students to read books that promote

Awareness of the Value of
Diverse Literature
(15)
“In all cases, I look at the quality of writing in a book and
do not recommend a book based solely on the inclusion of a
topic. With younger students and books chosen for wholeclass examination or listening, I tend to avoid books with
overt mention of any religion (unless it is a nonfiction book
showing a wide variety of religions) or books that contain
references to sexuality in general.”
“Our communities reflect all of the above-mentioned
groups, and literature should not either highlight or
disregard these characters.”
Challenges
(22)

“I'm just not sure I would feel comfortable promoting
transgender/cisgender books. I don't have a problem making
them available though.”
“Sexual orientation is just not a topic I feel is appropriate
for a 3-6 grade school library.”
“I am a Christian and find the unchecked things wrong and
find if I do have those books on the shelves the older
students like to pull them and use them to have a laugh.”

Availability
(6)

“However, again publishers are not producing or finding
books that help promote a library of diversity because the
books are not geared for younger children ages 3-8.”
“I try to find and recommend these books anyway as
children need to see people from all aspects of the diverse
spectrum, but it is a little more difficult to find elementary
books reflecting those diversities than race or religion
differences.”

101
A majority of respondents (n=28, 65%) mentioned a specific type of diversity in
the comments. Fifteen (35%) of those who commented mentioned more than one type of
diversity. Fifty-one percent of the respondents mentioned sexual orientation, while 26%
mentioned gender, and 14% mentioned religion (see Table 4.12).

Table 4.12 Diverse Identities Listed in Comments After Comfort Level

Sample Quotes
Sexual Orientation
(22)
“With elementary school, I don't think a sexual orientation is
to be focused on. If it comes up in a discussion of a book or
if a student asks about a character, yes, it's a teachable
moment. It's important to have good books that are examples
to positively show examples.”
“I am still trying to figure out a sensitive way to approach
promoting LGBTQ books in my elementary library. I do not
shy away from buying well reviewed books on the subject
but I do not necessarily read them aloud.”
“Talking about same-sex partnerships is just not on the radar
for the elementary school librarian!”
Gender
(11)

“They don't mind characters who are who they are, but they
didn't want discussions about sexual "activities." The
transgender issue landed in this column, and I let it be since
we don't have any students in our school who identify as
transgender.”
“I'm just not sure I would feel comfortable promoting
transgender/cisgender books. I don't have a problem making
them available though.”

Religion
(6)

“I don't see much about families who practice Hindu or
Buddhism for example.
“I would like a recommended reading list for books about
the Muslim culture.”

102
Thoughts on Including Diverse Literature
Sixty-six out of 116 people (57%) wrote comments in response to the fourth
survey question “What are your thoughts on including diverse literature in the school
library?” Most respondents strongly favored diverse literature in the library. Some
individuals had mixed feelings, and two showed some concerns regarding diverse
literature. The concerns were not included in the table (see Table 4.13), due to a low
number of respondents.
The responses strongly favorable to diverse literature stressed the importance of
building empathy and awareness through inclusive texts. Some individuals noted the need
for diverse characters who feature in the stories, rather than simply “as the plucky side
kick.” Though people state they promote diverse literature, this does not ensure that
diverse characters star in the stories. It also does not guarantee that the stories
authentically represent the characters.
For instance, the third survey question asked people to list one or more of their
favorite books that they have promoted in their library with diverse main characters (see
appendix G). Some people recorded titles where the character with that identity played a
secondary and/or minimal role in the story, such as including the book Drama by Raina
Telgemeier in the section for LGBT main characters. This book has gay minor characters
(Telgemeier, 2012). Some individuals also listed books that include stereotypes. For
example, The Sign of the Beaver by Elizabeth George Speare contains negative
stereotypes of American Indians, including portraying them as lazy, barbaric, speaking

103
broken English, and more (Lambert & Lambert, 2014; Students and Teachers Against
Racism, 2007).
Responses that indicated mixed feelings about diverse literature in the classroom
pointed out that including diverse texts “can be difficult.” These difficulties can include
concerns regarding stakeholder reactions, budget, availability, and more. Some librarians
feel that the diversity in an elementary library “should reflect the diversity found in our
communities.” This allows children to find books that function as mirrors and windows.
However, it may also exclude some diversities from the library entirely, rending some
identities invisible. Both responses regarding concerns with diverse literature mentioned
age-appropriateness of specific diverse identities. One named sexual orientation, and the
other referred back to previous comments that had mentioned LGBT identities.

essential
(54)
“I think it is important to include diverse literature in the school
library. It is especially important for our primarily Caucasian rural
student population.”
“I think that a diverse library is essential to building empathy.
Patrons need to be exposed to ideas and topics outside of their
world view. It is also important to make sure that your library
reflects the diversity of the school you are working in. Students
need to see themselves in the main characters, and not just as the
plucky side kick.”
“I can't think of a more important motivation in selection. It is my
hope that showing students a wider range of people and situations
outside what they witness in their own neighborhoods will build
the foundation of empathy in later life.”
mixed feelings
(10)

“Hard to do even with best of intentions.”
“I believe the diversity level in an elementary school should
mostly reflect the diversity of the student and family population.
Elementary school is an introduction to literature, and it's main
draw to it's readers should be familiarity and non-fiction living
things to learn about.” [sic]

Diversity of Library Books Matching Diversity of Student Body
Sixty-seven people (58%) responded to the fifth survey question, “Does the
diversity of the characters in your school/district’s curricular literature match the
diversity of the student body? Please explain why or why not.” Most of the comments
easily classified as yes, somewhat, or no. However, ten comments did not address
whether the diversity of the characters matches the diversity of the student body, but
instead talked about diversity in general. Table 4.14 includes quotes representative of the
comments for each magnitude code.

105
Forty-eight percent of the participants stated that the diversity of books in the
library did match the diversity of the students in the school. Multiple commenters pointed
out that the student body at their school does not have a lot of diversity. However, this
means that their students may have more books that function as mirrors. Some librarians
did note that the student body has diversity, as does their book collection in the library.
Other commenters noted that it somewhat matches, and pointed out some difficulty
finding books representative of particular types of diversity. The lack of availability
factored in many comments that said that the diversities did not match. Some noted that
the library features more diverse identities than student body does, while others
mentioned not finding enough books about specific types of diverse identities and/or
concerns with including books with diversity.

106

(32)
“Our student body is not very diverse, so yes, but that does not
mean that the curricular material is as diverse as it should be.”
“In my school library, I know it does. We have many examples of
literature that show different ways of life and beliefs. If a student/
parent asks me if we have certain types of books I will look. If we
do not have them, I will order them.”
somewhat
(9)

“As much as it is possible to find books. It is very hard to find
books about Polynesians, which make up a significant portion of
our school.”
“Much of it does but more could be done to reflect student body
diversity. In elementary school, some of the topics of fiction books
are not developmentally appropriate. However, I would like to
include books that feature characters of all kinds of backgrounds.
For example, a picture book can feature same-sex parents without
specifically broaching the topic of same-sex relationships.”

no
(16)

“No, we do try to promote tolerance to some degree, but we live in
a very conservative community and do not push. Our student
population is not diverse, being predominately white, and
Christian.”
“No, it does not. The library I am in is filled with books about
white heterosexual characters. We have a diverse school since we
get the kids from the university and that means a lot of international
students. We do not have enough books about Latinos, Asians, and
Muslims. Our stats are pretty strong with our African American
collection. However, it could always be improved.”

Mirrors and Windows
Sixty-two out of 116 people (53%) chose to write comments in response to the
sixth survey question “Should the literature offered students represent the diversities of
their classes or represent different diversities? Please explain the benefits of your

107
answer.” While most answers could be sorted into descriptive codes, a few answers
could not. Some people answered “yes” or “no” for this question. Table 4.15 shows
comments representative of each category.
Some respondents focused on literature reflective of students’ identities, noting
that students need to see themselves in text, which helps with feeling as though one
matters and with making connections to text. “It will help them connect better and have a
better understanding.” Others focused on literature representative of identities that differ
from the students’, noting the potential for mitigating prejudice. “This might help us
overcome much of the intolerance and ignorance when it comes to differences in our
society.” More responses focused on the importance of having texts that function as both
mirrors and windows, as well as inclusive representation of diverse characters. “If we
don't include books that reflect rich families and poor. Or books that tomboys or
effeminate males, then we are doing a disservice to all our students who don't fit into the
accepted picture of what life is supposed to be.” [sic] This comment recognizes the
importance of having nonbinary and non-monolithic representations in text.

“Yes, because we all need to see ourselves in the media that
surrounds us. When we don't see ourselves reflected in books,
magazines, television, movies, etc. it can cause us to think that we
do not matter or that we are, in effect, invisible.”
“Yes, I want my students to be able to see themselves in their
books. If they see their characters making good choices or learning
form their mistakes, then they can do that, too.”

(31)

“Empathy is built on the ability to see the way in which other
people experience the world. In order to understand one another in
real life, we need to understand each other first through a variety of
texts and situations. In order to believe in our ability to do
something, we need to see someone like us complete it in fiction or
nonfiction books.”
“There should be a balance. Kids are going to gravitate to the books
their friends suggest or whatever is on the cover. If bias is not
started at home, it definitely should not be in the books at school.
Kids learn from interactions with kids in class and with kids in
books. They need to have strong characters who display regular
behaviors regardless of race, religion or sexual preference. It gives
kids a positive outlook if the first time they read about a character
of another race or religion if the book's characters are positively
defined in the books.”

(18)

“Our literature should definitely represent diversity, even if we as a
community aren't diverse. We need to encourage children to read
about kids who aren't like them. This would promote more openmindedness and less bigotry in our community.”
“I believe that students should be exposed to different diversities.
They live in a diverse country and world.”

109
Challenges with Providing Diverse Literature
Sixty-six people out of 116 (57%) responded to the last survey question, “What
challenges have you faced with providing diverse literature experiences for your
students? Have you had any questions from the public concerning literature choices?
Please explain.” This question had two parts; most people answered both parts, but some
answered one part. Budget concerns, availability, and stakeholder considerations
comprised the main descriptive codes regarding challenges with providing diverse
literature (Table 4.16).
Some librarians stated that students do not wish to read about particular identities
and/or “outside of their comfort zone.” Readers tend to select books to which they can
feel some connection. However, for some readers, few books represent them, and thus
these children may have few, if any, experiences with books as mirrors unless the
librarian (or other adult) positions the books in such a way as to enable all children to
make connections with text. This could also alleviate some other concerns about children
not relating to books about diverse characters; when texts are positioned as potential
mirrors for all children—especially during read alouds—children more easily make
personal connections to text. Those whose identities constantly find representation may
then feel connections with characters who differ from self, and may be more likely to
select more diverse texts in the future.

(21)

“Lack of understanding on the part of parents and even
administrators in regards to the need and benefits of providing
students access to books that offer views of the many differences
in people they may encounter. There is much work to be done in
order to have more books regarding gender identity, sexual
orientation, religious beliefs and so on. It's a yearly struggle
without much support.”
“I have a hard time justifying purchasing diverse literature for my
library as I am untenured. If I purchase something that will
"ruffle feathers" I could be out of a job. So I am waiting until I
am tenured to purchase the items that I perceive to be normal, but
will be progressive for the area that I live in. I want it to reflect
the school and families I have, which does not always reflect the
values of the people that voice their concerns.”[sic]

111
Not all respondents answered the second part of the question regarding whether
they have faced any questions from the public regarding diverse literature choices (see
Table 4.17). Of those who answered, a majority had no questions or challenges; some
said they would “welcome any such challenge or question.” Some mentioned putting
“notes of permission” on some books, and others noted “sometimes I must try and sneak
some items into the collection.” Of those who faced questions or challenges, most did not
name a book title or type of diversity. Six named a book title and noted reasons for
challenges: one had partial nudity, one contained witchcraft, one may have had a samesex couple in an illustration, two had gay minor characters, and one had two male
penguins raising a chick. Two did not name a title but mentioned the reasons for
challenges: swearing and same-sex parents.
Facing challenges previously and/or fearing a challenge may or may not affect
purchasing decisions. Few commented directly on the impact this had on purchasing
decisions, beyond feeling more cautious and more carefully researching books, or
excluding the types of diversity entirely, though one indicated “I thanked the parent for
bring that to my attention and put the book behind my desk till it blew over, and then put
it back on the shelf.” Other librarians indicated needing to “sneak” items in, implying that
they valued diversity and included it despite facing questions or concerns regarding
stakeholder reactions.

Interviews

The last question on the survey asked respondents whether they would be willing
to participate in a follow-up interview, and to leave their email address if they would like
to do so. Although twenty-two people indicated interest in participating in an interview,
eight people ultimately chose to participate. The researcher contacted all interested
participants. One wrote back that she did not wish to participate, but thirteen did not

113
respond. The researcher sent a second email to those individuals, but received no
response.
Of the eight people who participated, four chose to complete the questions (see
appendix B) through email. Two chose phone interviews, and two chose Skype
interviews. One of the Skype interviews did not work, nor did the phone call, so the
interview was done using the chat feature on Skype. The interviews conducted by phone
or Skype (video) were transcribed and sent to the interviewees for member-checking.
One had no corrections, and two slightly edited their comments to make them a little
more clear and precise.
Those who participated live in Montana (n=4), Utah (n=1), and Wyoming (n=3).
Each of these librarians works in a public school, three of which are located in an urban
area, one in a suburban area, and four in rural areas. One of the rural schools is also on a
reservation. Two schools serve K-5 students, one K-6, two K-8, and three K-12. Seven of
these participants identify as White, and one as more than one race. Seven identify as
heterosexual, and one identifies as bisexual. All identify as female. They have been
librarians for between three and forty years (M=12, SD=12.78), with half working as
librarians for five or fewer years, and the other half working for ten or more years.
The interviews have been organized by school grade level into three groups: K-5
or K-6 librarians, K-8 librarians, and K-12 librarians. The researcher did this to see
whether any common threads existed among the librarians by grade level. Those who
work in K-5 or K-6 elementary schools seemed less likely to promote some types of
diversity than those who worked in K-8 or K-12 schools (overall). It varies by individual

114
librarian, and the numbers of interviewees are too small to draw many conclusions about
this. However, these interviews provide an illustration of the promotion of diverse books
in school libraries.

Librarians in K-5 or K-6 Schools
Jana. Jana has over 20 years’ experience as a librarian. Her library has over
10,000 books, including professional books for educators’ use. She has an annual budget
for her library, and buys around 300-500 books each year. She takes student interest into
account when purchasing books, as well as curricular alignment and cost. She noted, “We
are a K-5 school, so some books I am more likely to leave for middle school libraries to
purchase as the books may contain themes, scenes or language that I feel is more
appropriate for older students.”
On the survey, Jana indicated promoting most types of diversity “sometimes,”
books with single or divorced parents “often,” and books with Asian/Pacific American,
Multi-Ethnic, LGBT, cisgender, same-sex parents, and Hindu characters “rarely.” She did
not mark feeling comfortable with promoting books that have Asian/Pacific American,
LGBT, cisgender, or Hindu characters, which corresponds to the frequency of promotion
for these types of diversity. In her written interview, she stated, “I suppose the main
reason I am more comfortable with some than others is familiarity with those topics in
my own life.”
She listed book titles for all types of diversity except for Asian/Pacific American.
She listed the most titles (n=3) in LGBT, where she included two books for young adults

115
and one geared towards upper elementary students that has a gay character, which she
also listed for same-sex parents. The only category in which she did not list titles was
Asian/Pacific American. Although she indicated on the survey that she does not feel
comfortable promoting certain types of diverse literature, when she typed responses to
the interview questions, she stated, “I actually feel comfortable reading and promoting
about each of those areas. I usually choose ethnic / racial or socioeconomic books more
often. I do not have many books that hint at LGBTQ families that are written for primary
students, so that would probably be the one I don’t read.”
Jana also stated in the survey and the interview that she values diverse literature
for her library, even though she does not focus exclusively or primarily on diversity as a
criterion for book selection or promotion. “Diverse literature is extremely important. It
opens other worlds for kids that they may never have heard of before a book was read to
them or they read it themselves. It also helps to make connections between what they
know and what other kids are like all over the world.” She feels that “[i]t is important that
kids have really good role models of major religions and many ethnic and racial groups
so there is not a bias developed through literature.”
Jana shared that some students may not find books that serve as mirrors in the
library. She also noted in both the survey and interview that sometimes books with
American Indian characters do not match the nation to which a particular child belongs.
She wrote, “But, the book may be about the Ojibwa where the student is Crow. That
doesn’t always work.” [sic] She feels free in her choices involving literature in the

116
library. Although she has had a verbal book challenge, it was resolved without a formal,
written challenge.
Amber. Amber has over ten years’ experience as a librarian. She has about 14,500
items in the library collection, and notes that some of these are technology (such as
iPods) rather than books. She purchased all of the items in her library collection, as her
library is relatively new. She considers numerous factors when purchasing books, such as
student interests, award winners, curricular connections, and more.
On the survey, Amber indicated promoting some types of diversity “sometimes”
or “often,” but “never” promoting others, such as religion, heterosexual, lesbian, gay,
bisexual, same-sex parents, and cisgender. She noted, “Although I may not promote all of
the topics in a library class environment, I do promote them when working individually
with students.” She indicated feeling comfortable promoting all types of diversity with
the exception of cisgender. However, when answering the interview question about
whether she felt more comfortable promoting some types of diversity than others, she
wrote, “I go out of my way to display all of the diverse populations.”
She listed at least one book title (or author) in each of the categories, except for
same-sex parents and different-sex parents. For books with American Indian characters,
she listed three American Indian authors. She listed a book with two gay minor characters
for LGBT books. She listed one book twice in the categories divorced parents and single
parents. Amber stated on the survey that “Literature should reflect what is happening in
our society.”

117
She mentioned valuing diverse literature in her library. “My view is that the
library should be the place where all students feel welcome. With that in mind, I have
been carefully reading all of the picture books in my collection. I make sure to display
books of a variety of cultures and backgrounds, so that everyone will see the cover
images.” She feels fortunate to have the support of her administration regarding her book
selection, and has not faced any challenges.

Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn has been a librarian for fewer than five years, and it is her first
year at her current school. She is weeding through the library collection, as it contains
some outdated books (some with stereotypes), some that have not circulated, and some
that need replacement. At the start of the year, the library held about 9,600 books. The
small budget she has for the library must cover not only book purchases, but supplies to
protect the books, new book shelves, or any other library needs. She subscribed to some
library guilds this year, but mentioned that next year she will focus on filling in gaps in
diversity. She also plans to reorganize the fiction section this summer into genres, to
match a focus of the new literacy program.
Kaitlyn promotes each of the types of diversity listed on the survey “sometimes”
or “often,” though she also noted, “As an elementary school librarian my biggest
challenge is finding books which are not white heterosexual cisgendered protagonists.
When I do, I recommend them frequently, but it's the same book to every child instead of
having a variety of options to choose from.” While she indicated comfort promoting all
types of diversity listed on the survey, she also stated, “However, because of where I live
most families still have issues with books with non-heterosexual characters or

118
transgender characters.” Although she keeps potential parent reactions in mind, she
mentioned a commitment to including books with LGBT characters, though she currently
does not have any in her library.
Despite promoting each of the types of diversity sometimes or often, Kaitlyn
listed titles for only some types of diversity, such as grandparents raising grandkids,
African American, Latino/a, Asian/Pacific American, Caucasian, and American Indian.
However, she noted challenges finding books with American Indian characters as well.
“The publishing world makes it a little difficult to find books that represent especially
Native American books. They are so rarely published.” She mentioned the difficulties
this poses for her American Indian students who want to read books about American
Indians.
Kaitlyn values diverse literature in the library; “It is an absolute necessity to show
our students themselves and others in the texts they read.” She also noted the
transformative power of diverse literature.
Empathy is built on the ability to see the way in which other people
experience the world. In order to understand one another in real life, we
need to understand each other first through a variety of texts and
situations. In order to believe in our ability to do something, we need to
see someone like us complete it in fiction or nonfiction books.
Thus, diversity plays a role in the decisions about which books to purchase; she
mentioned needing to increase various types of diversity related to race, religion, people
with disabilities, and more. Other factors play a role in book selection as well, such as
student interest, replacing worn-out books, filling in gaps in book series, the availability
of books, and budget. She tries to purchase and promote books that students request

119
frequently, such as displaying holiday books close to holidays. She feels free in her
choices about diversity in her school library.

Librarians in K-8 Schools

Stephanie. Stephanie has been a librarian for five years, though this is her first
year at this library. She noted an older average book age for her library, and wants to sort
through the collection, as “many of these items are not relevant to the school community
at this time. They need to be deselected and replaced with more appropriate materials as
time and budget allow. And then there’s some books that are obsolete, which in any
nonfiction collection you have to watch out for.” She has an annual budget for her
library, and believes that between that and book donations, around 1,000 books were
added to the library last year. When selecting books for the library, she considers quality
books, such as those that have won awards and/or received favorable professional
reviews. She also selects books that fit with the community and the curriculum, as well as
expand diversity, but states that she prioritizes student interest. “The library has to be fun
and awesome for the children, or they’re not going to get excited about reading.”
Stephanie promotes most types of diversity “sometimes” or “often,” with the
exception of Arab American, Asian/Pacific American, Buddhist, and Hindu, each of
which she promotes “rarely.” However, she notes, “Reflecting on this, I am noticing that
many of the categories I promote ‘sometimes’ I would promote ‘often’ if I had sufficient
materials in my collection. I buy as much as I can, but we're limited by what's available.”
During the interview, she specifically noted wanting to build the collection of books with

120
Muslim, Latino/a, Asian/Pacific American, Indian, and LGBT characters, as well as
characters who live below the poverty line. She indicated feeling comfortable promoting
each of the types of diversity listed in the survey, and stated that, “It’s also not about me.
It’s about kids, right?” She listed a book title in every diverse category except for
characters who are adopted and characters whose parents are divorced.
She values diversity, stating, “It’s vital, really, because the students have to be
able to see themselves reflected in the collection in the library, and they also have to be
able to see others reflected in the collection in the library.” She incorporates various types
of diversity into her promotion of books, and into any read alouds that she does in the
library. She feels supported by her administration and free in her choices. She has not
experienced a challenge.

Sarah. Sarah has been a librarian for fewer than five years. She has about 8,000
books in her library, and purchases 50-60 new books each year. Her priority in book
selection is student interest, though she also tries to purchase each year’s award winners.
She promotes most types of diversity “sometimes” or “often,” with the exception
of heterosexual (“rarely”) and Christian (“rarely”). She noted, “We make books of as
many different genres and subjects as possible available to our students but rarely
actually promote them or censor them. We do sometimes encourage older students to
read books that address the more sensitive areas in order to expose them to other views.”
She feels comfortable promoting books with each of the types of diversity listed in the
survey. The only category in which she listed a title was foster family.

121
Sarah values diverse literature, and when asked whether diverse literature is
important, she replied, “Absolutely. First our goal is to get kids to read so I want to try
and hit as many interests as possible. Secondly, we encourage our students to explore
new themes/genres etc. to provide them with the opportunity to learn about experiences
that may be outside of their own.” However, she also noted, “We do try to promote
tolerance to some degree, but we live in a very conservative community and do not push.
Our student population is not diverse, being predominately White, and Christian.” She
states that although she has some pushback regarding historical fiction and fantasy, she
feels free in her choices involving diversity. She has not yet experienced a challenge, and
her school does not have a policy to deal with challenges.

Librarians in K-12 Schools

Kristin. Kristin has been a librarian for fewer than five years. Her library has
around 12,000 books, and she has an annual budget that results in the addition of 150-200
books a year to the library. She noted looking at the quality of the books, such as award
winners, when selecting books for purchase. She also prioritizes student interest and
examines the theme(s) of the book and the subject matter.
On the survey, she indicated promoting most diverse books “sometimes” or
“often,” with the exception of cisgender (“I don’t know”) and transgender (“rarely”).
Although she promotes books with gay, lesbian, or bisexual characters sometimes, she
did not mark feeling comfortable with promoting books with lesbian, gay, or bisexual
characters, including same-sex parents. She also did not mark feeling comfortable with

122
promoting books with transgender or cisgender characters. She noted, “I would say I feel
comfortable with the ones I mentioned above, but would hesitate to buy a book, say, on
same-sex parents. Not saying I wouldn’t do it, but I would discuss it with my staff.” She
also stated, “As a librarian, I’m aware that I should not match myself exactly, but going
outside myself is still not going very far where diversity is concerned. Again, I’m in a
very conservative area and I think I need to push students outside their experiences, but
not to the far, far left like other places might.”
She listed a book title and/or an author for each type of racial diversity except for
Multi-Ethnic, as well as for characters with disabilities and characters who live below the
poverty line. The book title she listed for American Indian characters contains negative
stereotypes.
Kristin mentioned a commitment to diverse literature, adding, “I hope to stretch
students, have them read about different perspectives.” She feels mostly free in her
choices to include diversity, though she noted concerns regarding recent political events.
“I don’t feel as free lately with all of the politics going on about immigrants, etc. It feels
like people might feel more safe about speaking out AGAINST me and my diversity.”
She has not experienced any challenges to the books she promotes or includes in the
library.
Carolyn. Carolyn has more than ten years’ experience as a librarian. As she
works in a K-12 school, she has two different libraries: one for the elementary school,
and one for the middle school and high school. Although she has recently completed a
weeding project with her libraries, she still has 20,000 books between the two libraries.

123
She typically purchases between 400-500 books a year. She has a budget this year, and
has had one in the past, but mentioned concern about having a budget moving forward.
Her state legislature will likely enact spending cuts that may reduce or eliminate her
budget. She has located, applied for, and received multiple grants, however, so that she
still has funding for new book purchases and for other library needs.
When purchasing books, Carolyn mentioned multiple factors that influence her
choice of books. She looks for books that will interest her students, ones that are popular,
connect to content areas, and “if one has an AR level that we’ve got less of in our
collection, that may sometimes become a determining factor, but that only happens
rarely.” She also shared that she looked for more diverse books for her library collection,
including diversity in the form (such as graphic novels).
On the survey, Carolyn noted that she promotes most types of diversity
“sometimes,” with the exceptions of Arab American (“rarely”), Muslim (“rarely”), and
Hindu (“rarely”). However, she indicated feeling comfortable promoting all types of
diversity, though perhaps more comfortable promoting at the high school age than
younger with particular types of diversity; “I’m pretty comfortable presenting it all.
Every once in a while, I don’t with the younger kids. I don’t think I’ve got any, really,
same-sex marriage couple.” She did note that due to the conservativism of the
community, she felt some hesitation regarding political diversity, such as purchasing a
new biography of Hillary Clinton that won an award.
I still worry a little bit about whether it will circulate because she’s on the
cover. I can see some kids not wanting to check it out—being interested in
the book, wanting to read the book, but feeling uncomfortable checking it

124
out if somebody saw it in their backpack. I mean, we’re that conservative
that a Clinton biography would be considered taboo.
Carolyn indicated valuing diversity and has encouraged her students to participate
in Yang’s Reading Without Walls Challenge (Yang, 2016). This challenge asks
participants to read the following: “1. Read a book about a character who doesn’t look
like you or live like you. 2. Read a book about a topic you don’t know much about. 3.
Read a book in a format that you don’t normally read for fun” (Yang, 2016, para. 3). She
mentioned that students have found connections to characters, topics, and book formats
that they previously had not read. She also noted one student in particular has been
completing books, where she had not finished books previously.
She mentioned wanting to represent not only the students in her school, but also
to expose her students to people who differ from themselves. She finds it important for
students to see the universality of emotions and experiences, as well as learning to accept
differences. She also noted, “part of who I am as a librarian is just having as much
representation as I can for my students, to, you know, have them understand that there is
a global world and we live in a global society and they need to recognize that not
everybody looks or thinks like you and that’s okay.” She has not experienced a book
challenge.
Melissa. Melissa has more than twenty years’ experience as a librarian. Her
library has over 38,000 books, and she has an annual budget. However, she also applies
for and receives grants that typically double her budget and enable her to purchase 300600 books a year. When selecting books for inclusion in her library, Melissa focuses on

125
student interest, popularity, and award-winners, though she also takes additional factors
into account, such as curricular connections and themes, as well as books that help build
the schools’ collection of American Indian books.
She indicated promoting all types of diversity listed in the survey “sometimes” or
“often,” and feeling comfortable promoting all of these types of diversity. She highly
values diverse literature, noting, “Diverse literature brings the world closer to our hearts.
Most communities are apt to focus on issues or concerns that are evident in the
immediate vicinity, but the bigger global picture is essential. Our credo is that our
students and patrons will feel at home, confident in who they are, anywhere in the
world.” She listed a book title in every diverse category on the survey.
As Melissa has spent time getting to know her students and their families, she
tends to read books with particular students in mind, and helps guide those students to
books that she feels they would enjoy. She noted a high level of community support for
the books she includes in her library, and pointed out, “This is a Native community, with
priorities that differ from the dominant society.” Thus, the objections that she receives
relate to nudity or sexual content, rather than sexual orientation, gender, race, religion, or
other aspects of identity. She wrote, “Criticism is handled by a policy of a form submitted
to review an item in question...page number, specific language or situation that is
offensive, preferred action to be taken. I and my committee review and make a
determination [we have never banned a book here].” [sic]

126
Emerging Themes

Through several iterations of coding and grouping codes into categories, distinct
themes began to emerge from participants’ comments on the survey and data from the
interviews (see figure 4.19). Creswell (2013) suggests that prior to coding, researchers
first read through the data and take notes. One such memo that the researcher wrote when
first reading through the responses to the last four survey questions is, “The participants
talk a lot about texts as mirrors and windows, though they don’t necessarily use those
terms. Some prefer texts as mirrors, and some favor windows. Some believe both are
important. I wonder whether this will emerge as a theme simply because I asked about it
in the survey.” While the researcher did use initial codes of “mirrors,” “windows,” and
“both,” this did not emerge as a theme for the study, though beliefs about the importance
of mirrors and/or windows did influence librarian decision making.
After immersion in the data, the researcher began coding. The initial codes used
included attribute coding for each comment on the survey. The demographics selected for
initial coding included school location (rural, suburban, urban), as well as race and
gender. This coding did not yield many insights, perhaps due to the low number of people
of color and males who participated in this survey. Descriptive and magnitude codes
appear earlier in this chapter, and figure 4.18 shows those that informed the themes.
After initial coding, the researcher examined memos and went through the data
again. One memo from this process reads, “Some mark that they feel uncomfortable
promoting numerous types of diversity, yet talk about the importance of diverse
literature. Huh. Some of those who feel uncomfortable still promote diverse text, but

127
some do not. I wonder about the discrepancy between their stated values and their
actions.” After this memo, the researcher recoded data, looking for discrepancies. This
meant a re-examination of both the quantitative and qualitative data.
The researcher then went back through the codes and noted which ones could be
combined. For example, she combined the codes “parents,” “community,”
“administration,” and “students” into “stakeholder considerations.” Throughout this
process, the researcher engaged in analytic memoing. She then organized the codes into
categories (see Figure 4.18). Multiple categories emerged, but the majority of codes
could be organized into librarian decision making and internal and external factors. Some
fit both decision making and self-censorship, as they are related. The researcher recoded
the data using the categories as a form of pattern coding (Saldaña, 2013). Themes
emerged from this process. Through these qualitative data, the main themes to emerge
centered on librarian decision making and self-censorship (see Table 4.19).

Librarian Decision Making
Both internal and external factors affected decision making for elementary school
librarians who participated in this study. The internal factors (see Table 4.20) noted in
the qualitative data included worldview, emotions, and knowledge; each of these factors

129
may be more or less influential for individual librarians. Worldview included beliefs
about the importance of diverse literature and personal biases. Emotions, such as fear,
could be based on past experiences or anticipation of potential experiences. A person’s
knowledge regarding certain types of diversity as well as how to locate quality inclusive
books impact the purchase and promotion of text. Likewise, knowledge regarding
representation in literature and the default positioning of particular identities may impact
awareness of the types of diversity promoted in text.

the reality of our students and it helps build empathy when
students can understand why someone else might see the
world differently.”

The external factors (see Table 4.21) noted included stakeholder considerations,
availability of literature, budget, and curricular mandates; sometimes these factors had a
connection with the previously mentioned internal factors. The stakeholder
considerations encompassed students, parents, and community. Librarians took student
needs and interests into account, as well as purchasing what they think students will read.
Parent and community considerations also shaped purchasing and promotion decisions;
sometimes this was based on past interactions with these groups, and sometimes it was
based on a librarian’s perception of what might happen. Availability of literature and
budget also impact what a librarian purchases for and promotes in the library (Friese et
al., 2008; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006).

Sample Quotes
stakeholder
considerations
students
“However, it has been my experience that the students don't
choose books that are too far out of their comfort zone,
especially at the elementary level.”
“When I am considering the books for our library I mostly
consider student interest.”
parents
“The challenge with LGTBQIA references in books is that
kids ask their parents, and the parents complain to the
principal.”
“I put a lot of effort into communicating with the parents of
the school and keeping in contact with them about what
their kids are reading. I have made it my policy to tell
parents that they are responsible for letting their kids know
if there are books they are supposed to read, not me.”
community
“I do feel that in some ways I must sometimes try and sneak
some items into the collection, as I do not always know the
response of our very conservative community.”
“You must be aware of the social mores of your
community. In other words, what is acceptable and what is
not.”
availability
“I buy as much as I can, but we're limited by what's
available. There are not as many books about Asian Pacific
Islanders as I would wish, and not enough Arab American
books either.”
“As an elementary school librarian, my biggest challenge is
finding books which are not white heterosexual cisgendered
protagonists.”
“I struggle to find books, especially for young children in
grades K-6, that show diversity in conjunction with quality

132

literature.”
budget
“However, my biggest problem right now is that I can only
afford to get a small chunk of the diverse texts we truly
need. And trying to balance buying the diverse books the
library needs with the (typically) non-diverse books (as
compared to our current collection) that my students want
to read.”
“Funding is an ongoing problem in updating all facets of
our book offerings.”
Many factors affect a librarian’s decision making. These factors are both external
and internal, and interplay between the factors occurs. For instance, stakeholder
considerations can reinforce or influence a librarian’s worldview (or vice versa). Multiple
respondents mentioned an agenda—usually explicitly in connection with sexual
orientation, but not always—and some indicated an external influence by saying, “We
aren’t allowed to promote an agenda,” while others indicated an internal influence, “I
don’t promote a straight agenda either.” The librarians did not explain what they meant
by the word agenda. Many mentioned feeling that sexual orientation and/or gender
identity are not age-appropriate topics for elementary school children, though it is not
clear whether these comments are solely their beliefs or whether external influences (e.g.
stakeholder reactions) shaped these comments. It remains unclear precisely why these
librarians feel LGBT identities are not age-appropriate for elementary school, especially
since there are likely children in the schools (statistically speaking) who have those
identities (Oltmann, 2016).

133
Self-Censorship
Although only one librarian used the term self-censorship, referring to the
decision to not purchase texts due to particular content or themes or identities, the ways
in which other librarians responded indicated this occurred and/or they hoped they did
not self-censor. For instance, five comments indicated an awareness of the possibility of
self-censorship. “I hope I am also not afraid to buy a book that I know would be
beneficial to students and their understanding of the world.” This individual mentioned
fear regarding reactions, but also hoped that fear would not keep her from purchasing a
diverse text. This implies that she has awareness of the risks of self-censorship, and
possibly self-monitors when selecting texts to purchase or promote. Another wrote, “I
hope that I would offer all sides to everything, but I live in a very conservative area. I
think it's my job to respect that too.” This person wants to have inclusive literature, but
indicates some concerns due to the community in which she lives. Self-censorship may
play a role in her choices, though as she wants to offer multiple perspectives, perhaps her
awareness of this leads to minimal or no self-censorship.
Out of sixty comments that indicated self-censorship, thirty-two (53%)
specifically mentioned LGBT identities, and four (7%) referred back to other comments
or what they marked in “comfort level,” each of which included LGBT identities. Three
comments (5%) mentioned religion. The rest of the comments did not indicate any
specific type of diversity. For example, one wrote, “you must be aware of the social
mores of your community. In other words, what is acceptable and what is not.” [sic]
Comments like this indicate that the community values, or the librarian’s perception

134
thereof, influence purchasing and/or promotion decisions, which may limit the types of
diverse books. The librarians may pass over some texts, feeling as though the content,
themes, or identities do not match community views.
Another common comment regarded the age-appropriateness of text. The
individuals who mentioned age-appropriateness did not always mention a particular type
of diversity, though almost half mentioned sexual orientation and/or gender. It is not clear
why age-appropriateness would be linked to any diverse identity, as that implies that
certain identities are not appropriate to acknowledge at some age levels. “As we do not
have any same-sex parent families and as we are an elementary school, I do not have any
books to reflect that type of family.” Thus, this librarian, and those who made similar
comments, excluded these identities from their libraries. While there may be no same-sex
parents at the school, that does not mean that there are no lesbian, gay, or bisexual
children at the school; it is statistically likely that there are. Although stigma against
LGBT individuals may result in a lower population estimate (Coffman, Coffman, &
Ericson, 2013), at least 4.1% of the adult population identifies as LGBT, including 7.3%
of millennials (Gallup, 2017). In another recent survey, 20% of millennials identified as
LGBT (GLAAD, 2017). Therefore, statistically speaking, at least 1 in 25 children at the
school may be LGBT, though the numbers are likely higher, based on the percentages of
millennials who identify as LGBT. Unfortunately, they may not find representation in
texts in their school libraries.
As noted, slightly more than half of the comments that indicated self-censorship
mentioned LGBT identities. Although some comments were linked to age-

135
appropriateness, others mentioned different concerns prompting self-censorship. “Living
in a rural, conservative area, I feel I might get a lot of backlash if I introduced characters
who are transgender or anything other than heterosexual.” Not all librarians indicated
support from the administration, and not all had a policy to deal with book challenges at
their schools. This can make it more challenging for some to purchase or promote texts
that have aspects of diversity that have been politicized or rendered controversial. This
does mean, however, that they may be rendering some identities invisible. Some
librarians also indicated concern regarding employment if they purchase and/or promote
diverse text.
Many factors influence librarians’ tendencies to self-censor (School Library
Journal, 2016). Some of these, like other impacts on decision-making, are internal, and
some external. Librarians’ worldviews, emotions, and knowledge play a role, as do
stakeholder considerations. Each of these may impact decisions regarding self-censorship
more or less than others. Librarians have much to consider when selecting texts for their
libraries. Self-censorship, regardless of the reasons behind it, limits the texts that provide
mirrors and windows for students in the school.

Summary of Qualitative Data

From the qualitative data, two main themes emerged. The major theme concerned
factors influencing decision making for librarians. The majority of the data included
factors that affected the ways librarians decide which books to purchase and/or promote.
The most common internal factors were worldview, emotions, and knowledge. The most

136
common external factors were stakeholder considerations, availability, and budget.
Librarians weigh the various elements of decision making differently.
The other theme focused on self-censorship. Thirty-five percent of those whose
comments implied self-censorship did not mention or refer to a specific identity. Ninetytwo percent of those who noted or referred to an identity self-censored LGBT-inclusive
text. The theme of self-censorship also provides insight into decision making, as
librarians who engage in self-censorship make the decision to do so based on various
factors. Each of these themes has support from not only the qualitative but also the
quantitative data (see Table 4.19).

Synthesis of Quantitative and Qualitative Results

The main themes from this study—librarian decision making and selfcensorship—are supported by both quantitative and qualitative data, which together paint
a more nuanced picture of the participants’ responses. However, careful examination
reveals some discrepancies in individuals’ responses. This section examines qualitative
and quantitative support for the themes, and then explores some discrepancies in
interviewees’ responses and in survey responses.

Librarian Decision Making
The second research question for this study focused on librarian decision making:
“How do elementary school librarians describe the factors that influence their decision
making regarding promotion of diverse texts?” The main aspects of librarian decision
making that emerged from the qualitative data focused on internal factors (worldview,

137
emotions, and knowledge) and external factors (stakeholder considerations, availability,
and budget). These factors interact in ways that impact comfort level as well as
purchasing and promotion decisions. Quantitative results add another dimension to the
internal factors: identity. Although not statistically significant, no person of color (n=11)
who responded to this survey felt uncomfortable with any racial identity other than Arab
American (n=1). People of color who responded to this survey (n=11) also indicated
more frequently promoting books featuring people of color than White people who
responded to this survey (n=105) did. No respondent commented on the influence of
racial identity. However, one librarian did note that when she started at the school, she
noticed the absence of books about Democratic presidents in her library and asked, “But
since I am one, is that why I noticed their absence?” This implies an awareness of the
possible influence of identity on noticing the presence or absence of an identity reflected
in the literature; those who have that identity may more readily notice
underrepresentation.
Numerous factors impact librarian decision making, which may involve a
balancing act when selecting literature for purchase or promotion. Librarians may need to
balance multiple competing elements when choosing whether to purchase or promote
specific texts. Budget issues can play a role in this. With smaller budgets, librarians may
need to more carefully weigh various factors when choosing which texts to purchase.
“Budget issues hold me back from ordering a wide diverse assortment, when my students
want the newest in series and books that are high profile for their age groups.” This
librarian implies that the books that her students request may not include diverse main

138
characters. Thus, when purchasing texts with a limited budget, the librarian may engage
in a balancing act between her views regarding diverse literature and the students’
requests. However, she also indicated feeling uncomfortable with 11 of the 26 types of
diversity listed on the survey. In the comment section after this question, she noted, “I
have had several parents complain on books so I am careful as to what I recommend.”
Perhaps another balancing act that she performs occurs regarding her values and the
responses of parents, which may impact her comfort level.
The social norms (actual or perceived) of the community and school factor into
decision making for at least 31 librarians in this study. For example, one participant
commented, “Living in a rural, conservative area, I feel I might get a lot of backlash if I
introduced characters who are transgender or anything other than heterosexual.” The
librarian’s view of the social norms of her community impact her decision-making
regarding books with LGBT characters. She values diverse literature, noting, “I think it's
important to include diverse literature in the library. It's important for students to see
themselves as well as those who are different reflected in the literature.” Although she
appreciates inclusive literature, her responses regarding frequency of promotion indicate
that she never promotes books with same-sex parents or transgender characters, and does
not know whether she promotes books with lesbian, gay, and bisexual characters. The
balancing act here appears to be between her own value of diverse literature and her
perception of the social norms of her community regarding LGBT people.
Another balancing act appears to occur with another participant who stated, “As a
ranching community, with more ‘outdated’ thinking and tolerances, as well as a strong

139
fundamental Christian community, I expect to one day be called out for providing books
on diversity.” This librarian feels comfortable promoting all types of diversity apart from
transgender and cisgender, which are also the only ones she never promotes. However,
she stated “I don’t have a problem making them available, though.” She participates in a
balancing act between her own stated esteem for diverse literature and the social norms of
her community. She has various books available, even though she does not promote
them, despite her expectation that someone will challenge her. “I am very much in favor
of including diverse literature in the school library. We are very rural and, because of
being in WY, we don't have a lot of diversity in our state. Diverse literature is one way to
help students learn about differences.”
As demonstrated in the examples of balancing acts, quantitative and qualitative
results provide greater insight into librarian decision making, including the whys behind
some of the quantitative results. For example, many respondents (63%) do not feel
comfortable promoting literature with gay, lesbian, or bisexual characters. One
respondent noted, “I would really like to include more sexual-based literature but am
afraid to because of the sensitivity of this topic around my area.” Thus, this individual has
concerns regarding possible reactions from stakeholders, which helps explain why she
does not feel comfortable including (and never includes) literature with lesbian, gay, or
bisexual characters. This also demonstrates a balancing act between what the librarian
desires—including more books featuring one type of diversity—and the social norms or
values of the community regarding that type of diversity.

140
Self-Censorship
Some decisions that librarians make regarding inclusion of diverse literature lead
to exclusion of that literature; the balancing act may weigh, as noted in the last example,
more heavily on the side of not purchasing and/or promoting specific types of diversity.
Slightly more than half (53%) specifically mentioned LGBT identities within the quote
indicating self-censorship. Many participants who knew whether they promoted a
specific type of diversity indicated never promoting books with transgender (61%) or
gay, lesbian, or bisexual characters (39%). More people felt uncomfortable promoting
these books, however, with 71% indicating they felt uncomfortable promoting books with
transgender characters, and 63% with gay, lesbian, or bisexual characters. Thus, some
librarians indicate promoting books with diverse characters despite not feeling
comfortable. As Stephanie said, “It’s also not about me. It’s about kids, right?”
Not all librarians who feel uncomfortable promoting specific diverse identities
still promoted them. Some responses implied self-censorship based on one’s own beliefs
and/or the social norms for the community or school. For example,
However, why would I choose books which bring up the terms
heterosexual, gay, bi, lesbian or transgender? These issues are not age
appropriate to discuss with children in elementary school. If that were the
case then maybe I should be teaching about abortion, drug abuse, animal
abuse, torture, sex trafficking, suicide, child soldiers, genocide and any
other idea that you can possibly think of to introduce to our students
without examining the consequences of talking about these issues that are
clearly above their developmental level and not age-appropriate.
The factors that influence this librarian’s decision making as shown on this survey
include her beliefs, her knowledge regarding particular identities, and possibly her
identities. She shows a desire to protect her students from what she believes is age-

141
inappropriate subject matter, and equates books with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or
heterosexual characters to abortion, drug abuse, sex trafficking, and more. Thus, she
believes that these identities do not have a place in the elementary school library, and
therefore most likely engages in self-censorship, as indicated through her quantitative and
qualitative responses. She feels comfortable promoting and “sometimes” promotes most
types of diversity except for heterosexual, LGBT, cisgender, same-sex parents, and
different-sex parents.
However, she probably chooses not to purchase books with LGBT characters
only, rather than with heterosexual and cisgender characters, as the vast majority of
children’s books contain those characters (Crisp et al., 2016). Given her responses, she
may not realize this. Institutionalized supremacy positions the majoritized groups as the
default identity and may cause them to not think of themselves as having that identity
(Chadderton, 2013; Jones and Abes, 2013). Instead, the majoritized identities are seen as
“…natural or normative points of reference” (Solorzano & Yasso, 2002, p. 28).
Her beliefs and knowledge regarding sexual orientation and gender affect her
decision making regarding the purchase and promotion of diverse texts in her library. She
chooses to include most types of diversity on this survey, though she likely self-censors
LGBT-inclusive texts. As she declined an interview, it remains unknown which other
factors may impact decision making regarding book purchases or promotions.

Discrepancies in Interviewee Responses
Some of the interviewees had discrepancies in their answers. For instance, Jana
noted “never” promoting some types of diversity and not feeling comfortable promoting

142
some types of diversity on the survey, yet stated in her typed interview questions that she
is comfortable promoting all types of diversity. She also listed titles for almost all types
of diversity, including most of those she indicated feeling uncomfortable promoting and
never promoting; she also mentioned the importance of diverse literature.
Amber mentioned feeling comfortable promoting all types of diversity, though
she indicated in the survey she did not feel comfortable promoting books with cisgender
characters. This could be due to her not clicking on the box to check it, as this is
incongruent with the rest of her responses. She made statements that show a value of
diverse literature, and the rest of her survey and interview support that.
Kaitlyn marked promoting every type of diversity “sometimes” or “often,” despite
saying that she does not yet have any books with LGBT characters in her library. She
feels comfortable promoting all types of diversity and mentioned the importance of
diverse literature many times throughout her interview. She also mentioned a
commitment to purchasing more diverse texts for her library. However, a discrepancy
exists between her stated promotion of texts with LGBT characters and what she said in
her interview. She cannot promote those books if she does not have them in her library.
Although Kristen indicated she promoted books with lesbian, gay, and bisexual
characters “sometimes,” she stated that she feels uncomfortable doing so; she would
“hesitate to buy a book, say, on same-sex parents” and would discuss it with other staff
first. She indicated feeling comfortable promoting books with same-sex parents, though
she promotes them rarely. She mentioned valuing diverse literature, though she has
concerns due to the conservative area in which she lives as well as recent political events.

143
Her comment regarding purchasing a book with same-sex parents suggests that she may
not have any in her library. If this is the case, that shows a discrepancy between her stated
promotion of texts and the books in her library.

Discrepancies in Survey Responses
Discrepancies appeared in the responses of individuals on the survey as well.
Some people mentioned not feeling comfortable with some diverse identities, yet they
indicated promoting those types of diversity. These individuals typically mentioned a
commitment to diverse literature, so it appears as though their personal comfort level
does not have much of an effect on the promotion of diverse literature in their libraries.
Numerous individuals who indicated they do not feel comfortable promoting and
never promote books with particular identities in their libraries also wrote about the value
of diverse literature in the library. If a librarian values diverse literature, one would
imagine he/she would promote it; however, some respondents indicated this does not
occur regarding some types of diversity. For example, one respondent stated, “Diverse
literature is an important way for students to better understand their world.” Yet this
individual never promoted books with eight types of diverse identities, rarely promoting
six others, and did not feel comfortable promoting 12. Additional discrepancies exist
between respondents’ answers for frequency of promotion and comfort level. Some
indicating never promoting books with which they feel comfortable promoting.
Some individuals’ responses proved somewhat confusing in other ways,
especially regarding the diverse identities heterosexual (attracted solely to the opposite
sex) and cisgender (gender aligned with sex assigned at birth, such as a woman who was

144
assigned female at birth). The survey included the definitions for these terms in the
questions which used them, though it did not include examples. Most texts, unless
specifically stated otherwise, contain heterosexual, cisgender characters as the default
(Crisp, et al., 2016). However, 13 participants said they never promote texts with
heterosexual characters and 33 said they never promote text with cisgender characters.
Additionally, 33 noted feeling uncomfortable promoting books with heterosexual
characters, and 53 with cisgender characters. As these comprise the vast majority of all
published children’s literature, these responses seem incongruent.
If they “never” promote texts with heterosexual characters, that means the only
texts they promote include lesbian, gay, and bisexual characters, yet these individuals
also indicated “never” promoting texts with lesbian, gay, and bisexual characters. If they
“never” promote books with cisgender characters, that means that they only promote
books with transgender characters, yet all but two indicated “never” promoting books
with transgender characters. Likewise, 32 out of the 33 people who felt uncomfortable
promoting text with heterosexual characters also felt uncomfortable promoting text with
lesbian, gay, and bisexual characters. Fifty-one out of 53 of those who felt
uncomfortable promoting books with cisgender characters also felt uncomfortable
promoting books with transgender characters.

Summary of Results

This chapter examined the quantitative and qualitative results of a survey
investigating elementary school librarians’ promotion of diverse literature. Two main

145
research questions guided this study: 1) How frequently do elementary school librarians
promote books with diverse main characters in terms of race, family structure, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion? and 2) How do
elementary school librarians describe the factors that influence their decision making
regarding promotion of diverse texts? The data for frequency of book promotion showed
that librarians tended to promote books with Caucasian, different-sex parents, and
heterosexual main characters more frequently than others, which is likely due to most
books representing these identities. However, librarians less frequently indicated
promotion of books with cisgender characters; this may be due to confusion regarding the
term, the relative newness of the term, or the positioning of this identity as the “default.”
Librarians in this study tended to promote politicized identities—such as LGBT—less
frequently than others.
The influences upon librarian decision making showed that librarians balance
various internal and external factors when choosing which books to purchase and/or
promote. A librarian’s worldview, emotions, knowledge, and identity may impact
decisions regarding promotion or purchase of texts. Likewise, stakeholder considerations,
availability, and budget played a role as well, with some librarians engaging in a
balancing act when selecting books.

146
CHAPTER FIVE

CONCLUSION
“I argue, however, that for those children who historically had been
ignored—or worse, ridiculed—in children’s books, seeing themselves
portrayed visually and textually as realistically human was essential to
letting them know that they are valued in the social context in which they
are growing up” (Bishop, 2012, p. 9).
In the United States, published children’s literature tends to underrepresent
minoritized groups, such as people of color, LGBT people, and more (CCBC, 2017;
Crisp et al., 2016; Thomas & Stornaiuolo, 2016). This not only provides barriers to
finding reflections of oneself in literature, but also implies a devaluation of those
identities (Koss, 2015). This lack of texts that function as mirrors and windows
disadvantages children with majoritized and minoritized identities (Bishop, 2012;
Tschida, Ryan, & Ticknor, 2014).
Although the lack of published literature representative of some identities
provides challenges for librarians who wish to represent myriad diversities in their
libraries, some librarians choose to self-censor and do not purchase literature inclusive of
particular groups (Sloan, 2012; Whelan, 2009). School librarians function as gatekeepers
through their decisions regarding purchasing and promotion. Their decisions may enable
greater access to representative literature or may limit access. This illustrative case study
with a descriptive survey examines the promotion of diverse literature in elementary
school libraries through two main research questions:

147
1. How frequently do elementary school librarians promote books with diverse main
characters in terms of race, disability, family structure, socio-economic status,
sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion?
2. How do elementary school librarians describe the factors that influence their
decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts?
This chapter reviews the findings of this case study and discusses them in context
with published research. The results are briefly discussed in connection with literature,
and implications are examined. Although this study cannot be generalized due to the low
number of respondents (n=116), it provides additional insight into influences on librarian
decision making regarding the inclusion and promotion of diverse literature, as well as
the types of diversity that elementary school librarians feel comfortable or uncomfortable
promoting. Finally, the researcher provides recommendations for additional studies on
this topic.

Findings

The responding librarians (N=116) indicated that they frequently promote and feel
comfortable promoting many of the types of diversity listed on the survey (see appendix
A). Some individuals noted that the reason they did not promote some types of diversity
more frequently was due to the difficulty finding some types of diverse books, such as
books with Arab American, Polynesian, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, and LGBT characters.
Librarians felt most uncomfortable promoting books with LGBT characters, and were
more likely to “never” promote these books than any other type of diverse identity. Some

148
noted concern about stakeholder reactions, while others noted concerns about the ageappropriateness of books featuring LGBT characters. The main themes emerging from
this study are:
1.

Internal and external factors impact librarian decision making regarding
promotion of diverse texts.

2. Some librarians may self-censor the purchase and/or promotion of diverse texts.

Discussion
This section first examines the results of the first research question, “How
frequently do elementary school librarians promote books with diverse main characters in
terms of race, disability, family structure, socio-economic status, sexual orientation,
gender identity, and religion?” As no published study examines promotion of such a
broad range of diverse identities, the data for this question provides insight into an
understudied area, though further research is necessary.
Next, the researcher discusses the results for the second question, “How do
elementary school librarians describe the factors that influence their decision making
regarding promotion of diverse texts?” which leads into the first theme, “Internal and
external factors impact librarian decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts.”
Again, no published study examines librarian decision making regarding promotion of
diverse text. However, some studies do explore factors impacting teacher and librarian
decision making, and/or provide some information regarding texts deemed controversial.

149
In this part of the discussion, the initial conceptual framework and a revised emerging
conceptual framework will be discussed as well.
The last part of this section explores the second theme for this study, “Some
librarians may self-censor purchase and/or promotion of diverse texts.” Self-censorship,
particularly regarding LGBT identities, does have support in the literature. Although this
study did not ask specifically about self-censorship, comments indicated that some
librarians practice it.

Frequency of Book Promotion
Respondents to this survey indicated most frequently promoting books with
Caucasian main characters, as most published books feature Caucasian main characters
(Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2017). Some respondents did not know whether
they promoted books with main characters of color. However, for those who knew the
frequency of promotion, most librarians indicated promoting them “sometimes” or
“often,” with the exception of Arab American characters; a majority (54%) indicated
promoting books with these characters “rarely.” A few respondents indicated difficulty
finding books with Arab American characters. For example, one librarian wrote “Can
there be more main stream books with Arab characters please.” [sic] Although statistics
do not exist regarding books published in the United States with Arab American
characters, one can presume the number is low when some years no children’s or young
adult books win the Arab American book award (Arab American National Museum,
2017).

150
In regard to books with religious main characters, between19 and 28 respondents
in each category marked that they do not know whether they promote books with
Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, or Christian main characters. Of those who knew
whether they promoted these books, librarians most frequently promoted books with
Christian characters “often” or “sometimes,” followed by Jewish characters. The
Cronbach’s alpha for religion had the highest internal consistency (α=.94), which means
that participants tended to provide similar responses in this category. One respondent
noted, “I don't teach religious books because it is a public school.” Some teachers and
librarians feel that they cannot teach about religion due to legal issues, when in fact they
can teach about different religions as long as they do not proselytize or otherwise
advocate for one religion (Green & Oldendorf, 2011).
Librarians promoted books with many family configurations “sometimes” or
“often.” The family configurations promoted most frequently included divorced parents
and single parents (94%). The family configuration most likely to be “never” (29%) or
“rarely” (34%) promoted was same-sex parents. Some also indicated not feeling
comfortable promoting books with same-sex parents. “I tend to shy away from books that
include controversial marriages (lesbian, gay, etc.) due to the age group I teach (8-11 year
olds).” Some faced challenges for providing these books. “I have had to face up to a
challenge as indicated before over a picture book showing same gender parents.” Others
noted difficulty finding texts with same-sex parents. “Finding appropriate literature for
elementary students when looking for books around LGBT and transgender families.”
[sic] Although statistics do not exist regarding the publication of books with same-sex

151
parents, one can presume the number to be low. Crisp et al. (2016) note the lack of
nonheterosexual characters in children’s books, and the Rainbow List, a bibliography of
LGBT-inclusive children’s and young adult literature, has few children’s books each year
(GLBTRT, 2017).
Due to the lack of availability, personal discomfort, concern about reactions, and
other factors, a majority of librarians reported promoting books with lesbian, gay, or
bisexual characters “never” (39%) or “rarely” (37%) and transgender characters “never”
(61%) or “rarely” (27%). Most librarians felt uncomfortable promoting books with
lesbian, gay, or bisexual characters (63%) and with transgender characters (71%). As
noted, few books contain LGBT characters (Crisp et al., 2016; GLBTRT, 2017). Some
librarians expressed difficulty finding books with LGBT characters. “I'm just beginning
to see books on the market that represent transgender/LGBT populations that are age
appropriate for children 8-11. I bought a couple this year.” Other librarians noted their
personal discomfort with these books. “I am a Christian and find the unchecked things
wrong.” Some noted concerns regarding stakeholder reactions. “The challenge with
LGTBQIA references in books is that kids ask their parents, and the parents complain to
the principal.” However, some librarians indicated promoting LGBT-inclusive books
regardless of their comfort level.
While some respondents did not know whether they promoted books with some
types of diversity, the majority did know. Some librarians indicated “never” promoting
some books, thus rendering it impossible for any students who have those identities to
find books that reflect that identity in the school library. Likewise, students who do not

152
have those identities cannot find books that serve as windows for those identities in the
school library. Thus, students both with and without these identities face disadvantages
due to the lack of representative books in the library, whether that lack is due to
availability or another element outside of the librarian’s control or to choice (Bishop,
2012; PEN America, 2016; Tschida, Ryan, & Ticknor, 2014).

Librarian Decision Making
The second research question “How do elementary school librarians describe the
factors that influence their decision making regarding promotion of diverse texts?” and
the first theme, “Internal and external factors impact librarian decision making regarding
promotion of diverse texts,” focused on librarian decision making. Although literature
exists regarding factors that impact aspects of decision making for teachers and
librarians, currently no published study puts forth a theory of the various factors that
impact elementary school librarian decision making regarding diverse texts. Analysis of
the qualitative and quantitative data provided insights into this process.
Through analysis, the researcher divided the influences on decision making into
internal and external factors. Worldview, emotions, knowledge, and identities may
comprise internal factors that affect decision making, though only one respondent
specifically noted the impact of an identity on choosing diverse texts. Although not
statistically significant, people of color were more likely than White people to promote
text featuring people of color, which provides some additional support for the impact of
identity. Likewise, although most people did not explicitly state they have a bias towards

153
a particular group, some did, such as one who said, “Sexual orientation and religion are
not the main concern or focus of my limited budget. I keep my personal bias to myself.”
Some of these factors find support in the available literature regarding decision
making. When librarians have a bias against a minoritized group or they perceive that
others might, it may impact their decision making regarding texts inclusive of that group
(Garry, 2015; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; School Library Journal, 2016; Stallworth,
Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006). Schoenfeld (2011), for example, examined the influence of
teacher beliefs on decision making, and stressed how one’s worldview creates one’s
reality. What people believe affects how they see the world and how they interpret
experiences (Schoenfeld, 2011). For instance, some of the librarians who were
challenged by parents about certain books in their school libraries did not let that affect
decision making. Each of those librarians indicated strongly valuing diverse literature,
which may or may not have influenced their reactions to the challenges. However, others
who have experienced challenges to texts may feel more fearful or hesitant about
including identities or experiences perceived as controversial (Garry, 2015; School
Library Journal, 2016). Some librarians in this study showed concern about inclusion
after facing a challenge or in anticipation of a challenge. For example, one librarian
wrote, “We live in a very MORMON community and I have had several parents
complain on books so I am careful as to what I recommend and use Novelist a lot to help
me once I know what they like.” [sic] This person’s experiences with parent complaints
led her to be cautious about what she uses in the library.

154
External factors included stakeholder considerations, availability of literature,
budget, and curricular mandates. As noted above, stakeholder considerations can impact
the availability of texts in the library. The communities in which the librarians live might
influence their decision making as well. Watkins and Ostenson (2015) mentioned that
teachers may feel more concern about using some texts in conservative areas. That was
something echoed in this survey, such as when a librarian wrote, “These topics are
difficult to promote in a conservative community.” Additionally, administrative support
may make librarians feel more comfortable including diverse literature (Flores, 2016;
Garry, 2015). Administrative support, or lack thereof, was noted by some librarians in
this study as a reason to include or exclude diverse literature. For instance, one
participant wrote, “I feel comfortable sharing all different types of lifestyles with our
students and I believe our administration would back that decision.”
The budget impacts the number of texts a librarian can purchase, regardless of the
librarians’ beliefs about the importance of diverse literature. The budget may limit not
only the number of books purchased, but also where the books are purchased (Friese et
al., 2008; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006). For
instance, some librarians have book fairs to help raise funds for additional library
purchases. However, book fairs may not have diverse texts. The survey did not ask about
librarian budgets, which may provide a reason why only 17 comments on the survey
mentioned budget. The interviewees had a question about their budgets, so each of them
discussed this more in depth. Some interviewees noted concern about budget cuts. For
example, “We have no budget to fund the purchasing of new library books.” Some

155
interviewees noted that their state legislature and national legislation may significantly
impact library budgets. This will then limit the number of books available, even though
some interviewees noted pursuing grants to supplement their budgets. “I’ve done a
couple successful smaller grants, you know—a thousand here, five hundred there. But
those add up, so that’s been helpful.”
A few librarians mentioned purchasing books based on the curriculum. For
instance, one person wrote, “I only have enough funds to purchase books to fill one area
that is lacking, usually to support the classroom teachers’ lessons.” If a school or district
recommends particular texts for reading in different grade levels, that may impact
purchasing decisions as well (Friese et al., 2008; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015).
Each of these internal and external factors impact the decisions librarians make
regarding the purchasing and promotion of diverse text. Prior to starting this study, the
researcher created a conceptual framework for the factors that impact decision making.
Based on the data collected from this study, the conceptual framework has been revised.

Original Conceptual Framework. The original conceptual framework for this
study built upon Schoenfeld’s (2011) theory of teacher decision making, in which he
posited three main impacts on decisions: resources (material and cognitive), goals (longterm and short-term), and orientations (beliefs, dispositions, and values). In addition to
building upon this framework, the researcher examined the research that exists regarding
teacher and/or librarian decision making (Bertin & Davis, 2016; Friese et al., 2008;
Garry, 2015; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; School Library Journal, 2016; Stallworth,
Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006; Watkins & Ostenson, 2015; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998). This

156
research, along with information from the pilot studies, resulted in the initial conceptual
framework for this study (see Figure 5.1). However, information from this study specific
to elementary school librarians and viewed through a more qualitative lens led to a
revision of the conceptual framework.

Revised Conceptual Framework. After examining the results from this study
through a more qualitative lens, the original conceptual framework did not quite fit. It
provided too neat of a separation between internal and external factors when they may

157
influence each other. Through analysis of the survey and interview data, a more nuanced
picture of librarian decision making regarding the promotion and/or purchase of diverse
texts began to emerge.
Multiple factors impact librarian decision making regarding the purchase and/or
promotion of diverse texts in the library. Through both qualitative and quantitative
analysis, the researcher divided the factors into internal and external based on the original
conceptual framework. However, various factors influence others, and each librarian
weighs them differently when selecting books. The librarian’s worldview, biases,
emotions, knowledge, experiences, and identities may interact with each other, and may
affect decisions. Likewise, the social norms of the school and/or community, the
stakeholders—students, parents, administration, other faculty, and the community—may
impact purchasing or promotion decisions.
In addition to the interaction of these factors, the available budget influences
decision making. When librarians have smaller budgets, some elements may have more
of a priority than others. For example, student interest may have priority over locating
more books representing a specific diverse identity. Regardless of budget, availability of
books with diverse identities has the final impact on purchasing and promotion decisions.
When few published books exist with authentic representations of a specific diverse
identity, that provides a barrier to both purchasing and promotion decisions. When
literature is available and the librarian has a budget for it, the decision the librarian makes
based on the weighing of the previous factors may be to purchase diverse text or to selfcensor diverse text.

This conceptual framework provides an emerging examination of the influences
upon librarian decision making regarding purchasing and/or promotion of diverse texts.
Although the influences may be divided into internal and external factors, that alone does
not show the interaction among different elements, nor the impact of budget and
availability of diverse texts. Each librarian weighs these differently, and some librarians
engage in balancing acts when selecting literature.

159
Self-Censorship
Theme two for this dissertation focused on self-censorship. Some librarians may
self-censor the purchase and/or promotion of diverse texts. Self-censorship occurs when
someone chooses not to purchase material due to fear of challenges, concern about
reactions, or personal biases (Rickman, 2010; Sloan, 2012; Whelan, 2009). School
Library Journal conducted a survey with school librarians (n=574) on controversial books
in 2016 and found that among the elementary school librarians who responded to the
survey, 90% participated in self-censorship through exclusion of books that might be
deemed controversial. When selecting reasons regarding why they did not purchase the
text, 93% noted that they did not feel the content was age-appropriate (School Library
Journal, 2016).
The term age-appropriate also showed up 33 times in the comments sections for
this study; “There needs to be diverse books that are appropriate for the age level of the
students in the school.” A slight minority of comments (n=16, 48%) did not mention a
specific type of diversity in connection with age-appropriateness, while a slight majority
(n=17, 52%) specifically mentioned books with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or transgender
characters in accordance with the words age-appropriate. One person, in response to a
question about challenges with diverse books, noted that a challenge was finding “ageappropriate books for the LGBTQ community.” It remains unclear why depictions of
heterosexual individuals/couples and cisgender people are deemed age-appropriate, yet
books with LGBT characters are singled out as not being age-appropriate.

160
Age-appropriate can be difficult to operationally define, and likely varies
somewhat from person to person, just as recommended ages for children’s books can
vary depending on the source. In this study, it was not clear how librarians determine
age-appropriateness, though some respondents indicated feeling that any books with
LGBT themes/characters may not be age-appropriate, and thus self-censor books with
these characters, such as when a respondent stated, “as we do not have any same-sex
parent families and as we are an elementary school, I do not have any books to reflect
that type of family.” It is not clear why age-appropriateness would be linked to any
diverse identity, as that implies that certain identities should remain unacknowledged in
schools at particular age levels, despite the fact that children have likely heard about
these identities (positively or negatively) outside of school. Those who have concerns
regarding age-appropriateness of lesbian, gay, and bisexual characters in children’s
literature tend not have the same concerns regarding heterosexual characters (Flores,
2016). However one defines age-appropriate, it may influence decision making regarding
texts in the library.
As this study did not specifically ask about self-censorship, it is difficult to say
with any certainty how many practice self-censorship. Simply because a librarian feels
uncomfortable promoting a particular type of diversity, it does not mean that librarian
does not include those books in the library at all. For example, one librarian wrote, “I'm
just not sure I would feel comfortable promoting transgender/cisgender books. I don't
have a problem making them available though.” However, others do engage in selfcensorship, even if they do not label it as such. For example, one librarian wrote, “We

161
had one book, Drama, by Raina Telgemeier, which has homosexual characters in Jr.
High. In October, this principal and I chose to remove it from the shelves in order to
avoid awkward conversations with parents... students are still asking about this title in
January!” [sic] This comment demonstrates the removal of books due to fear of parent
reactions, even though the students showed interest in the text. Another individual noted,
“With younger students and books chosen for whole-class examination or listening, I
tend to avoid books with overt mention of any religion (unless it is a nonfiction book
showing a wide variety of religions).” This was one of three (5%) comments regarding
self-censorship of books with religious characters, which was the only other diverse
identity mentioned outside of LGBT. Out of sixty comments that indicated selfcensorship, thirty-two (53%) specifically mentioned LGBT identities, and four (7%)
referred back to other comments or what they marked in “comfort level,” each of which
included LGBT identities. This supports and expands other research showing selfcensorship in regard to LGBT-inclusive literature (Hughes-Hassell, Overberg, & Harris,
2013; Oltmann, 2015, 2016; Page, 2016a; School Library Journal, 2016).

Limitations

This study has various limitations. The researcher emailed those librarians in five
states (Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) whose email addresses she
could find. Thus, no true random sample was obtained, particularly since participants
self-selected for participation and for interviews. The interviewees do not represent a
random sample of survey participants nor a random sample of the population. Thus, their

162
responses may differ from those who did not self-select. Those who indicated selfcensorship and/or resistance to some diverse texts did not choose to participate in
interviews. As the participants do not represent random samples and the response rate
was low, the results are not generalizable. However, the results illuminate some issues
regarding the promotion of diverse literature in elementary school libraries, as well as the
processes through which librarians make decisions regarding the purchase and promotion
of diverse texts.
Another limitation concerns the wording of questions and unexpected responses.
The researcher expected the percentages for promotion of books with lesbian, gay, and
bisexual characters and books with same-sex parents to be similar. However, while 29%
said they “never” promoted books with same-sex parents, 39% said they “never”
promoted books with lesbian, gay, or bisexual characters. That could be due to the
wording of the question not making it clear that it referred to any lesbian, gay, or bisexual
main characters, including parents, as same-sex parents would likely identify as lesbian,
gay, bisexual, or another nonheterosexual orientation.
Another anomaly on this part of the survey concerned the responses for cisgender
and heterosexual. The researcher provided a brief definition after each term: heterosexual
(exclusively attracted to a different sex) and cisgender (gender identity aligns with sex
assigned at birth). Some respondents did not know whether they promoted books with
these identities, while others indicated that they “never” promoted books with
heterosexual characters (13.98%) and cisgender characters (37.93%). Participants may
not have understood the definitions provided; perhaps an example should be included

163
with each definition in a future rendition of this survey. These terms may be new to them.
Participants may also be so used to seeing these identities reflected that they do not
consider them as identities; they simply see them as “normal” and default (Chaudhri &
Teale, 2013; Love, 2004; Solorzano & Yasso, 2002). Sometimes those who constantly
find representation may not even notice, as it is simply their norm.
Many children’s books show different-sex couples, show crushes on characters of
a different sex, etc. Heterosexuality tends to permeate most texts (Crisp et al., 2016),
even though it tends to remain unnamed and the default identity, and thus tends to be
considered age-appropriate. Likewise, cisgender individuals make up almost all
characters in children’s text (Crisp et al., 2016). Transgender characters must be named
as such; otherwise, characters are presumed cisgender. The naming of identities in text—
or simply rendering certain, usually majoritized, identities as the default—can set up a
situation wherein those who have been taught by society that their identities are the norm
(majoritized) do not recognize the privilege of ubiquity in representation (Chaudhri &
Teale, 2013; Love, 2004; Solorzano & Yasso, 2002). This may help explain why some
librarians may not realize that heterosexual and cisgender characters are omnipresent in
literature. Some individuals with majoritized identities do not see themselves as that
identity; they see themselves as normal (Love, 2004). Given how few books have LGBT
characters, it is unlikely that any librarian does not promote books with heterosexual and
cisgender characters.

164
Implications

This study has several implications which follow from the discussion. Due to the
lack of availability of books including diverse identities (Cooperative Children’s Book
Center, 2017; Crisp et al., 2016) as well as librarian self-censorship (Hughes-Hassell,
Overberg, & Harris, 2013; Oltmann, 2015, 2016; Page, 2016a; School Library Journal,
2016), some students may not be able to find books that serve as mirrors for their
identities, while other students will not be able to find books that function as windows for
those identities. A lack of mirrors and/or windows disadvantages all students in the
school (Bishop, 2012; Tschida, Ryan, & Ticknor, 2014). The identities mentioned most
frequently in the comments regarding self-censorship are LGBT. In addition to selfcensorship regarding these identities, the low frequency of promotion of LGBT-inclusive
texts can be linked to availability.
LGBT children’s literature can be challenging to locate, due to the lack of
inclusive texts published in the United States (GLBTRT, 2017), which provides one
barrier for LGBT youth. However, in addition to an external barrier imposed through
publishing hegemony, the choices made by librarians may limit access as well. GLSEN’s
2015 middle and high school climate survey showed that only 29.8% of the middle
school respondents could locate any LGBT-related topics in the school library (Kosciw et
al., 2016). As the survey did not cover elementary school, it remains unknown how many
elementary students can locate LGBT-inclusive resources in their libraries. However, the
survey in the current study indicated that a majority of librarians felt uncomfortable
promoting books with LGBT characters, and promoted them “never” or “rarely.” Some

165
of the librarians who said that they promoted LGBT-inclusive texts noted that this was
done on an individual level. Thus, LGBT youth in elementary schools may not readily
locate books within their library with characters like them.
Literature provides a vehicle for identity development. A lack of LGBT-inclusive
literature denies this vehicle for these children. Individuals who identify as lesbian, gay,
bisexual, or transgender may not have readily available role models or even know anyone
who is like them. Books, if available, provide a way for these children to know that they
are not alone; other LGBT people exist in this world. Denying LGBT children access to
representative texts renders them invisible and unimportant (Flores, 2016; Gartley, 2015;
Koehler, 2011; Oltmann, 2016; Page, 2016a).
Some librarians find it challenging to locate inclusive materials, as noted
previously. Some choose to self-censor and not purchase these materials due to concern
about stakeholder reactions, personal bias, or a lack of knowledge regarding LGBT
identities. For example, one librarian wrote, “We purchase books according to a policy of
community standards. When it comes to sexual diversity, that subject would not be
tolerated.” Likewise, some fear parent reactions; “I do not feel comfortable with the
remaining choices because I fear parent response to reading material that features LGBT
characters.” Concern about stakeholder reactions shows up in other studies in regard to
self-censorship of LGBT books (Flores, 2016; Garry, 2015; Gartley, 2015; Oltmann,
2016; School Library Journal, 2016; Whelan, 2009).
These concerns are not unfounded. LGBT-inclusive picture books have been
highly censored (Shimanoff, Elia, & Yep, 2012), and sometimes burned (Esposito, 2009;

166
NCAC, 2015). Four of the top ten most frequently banned or challenged books for 2015
include LGBT characters (ALA, 2017). Additionally, librarians have lost their jobs
and/or been harassed on social media due to purchasing or promotion of a text some
stakeholders do not like (PEN America, 2016). This may be part of why more librarians
engage in self-censorship now than eight years ago (Jacobson, 2016). This means that
some libraries do not have LGBT-inclusive texts, to the detriment of their students.
Exclusion of LGBT books devalues LGBT people, sending a message that they are not
important enough to include in the library or curriculum (Flores, 2016; Gartley, 2015;
Koss, 2015; Logan, Watson, Hood, & Lasswell, 2016; Page, 2016b).
One of the greatest traumas that gender- and sexual minority students
experience is not bullying but invisibility and silence. When queer
students are not visible in the curriculum or in the social networks of
school, when the school is silent about their experience, this creates
feelings of disenfranchisement and rejection. It creates “stigmatizing
messages” that these students are not valued. Students’ identities are
erased and invalidated (Page, 2016b, p.2).
This message is picked up and internalized by LGBT students and non-LGBT
students. LGBT-inclusive curricula tend to create safer schools for all students (Gartley,
2015; Kosciw et al., 2016; Lambda Legal, n.d.; Lifshitz, 2016). Unfortunately, some
librarians may choose to exclude these texts or to remove them from the shelves. They
might fear the responses from stakeholders (Flores, 2016; PEN America, 2016). If so, it
can help if schools have a policy in place to deal with book challenges (Jacobson, 2016).
Not all libraries in this study had policies in place to deal with challenges to books. Some
policies include selecting books supported by professional reviews and/or purchasing
book award winners or honors (Gartley, 2015; Jacobson, 2016; NCTE, 2017); this is also

167
a recommendation made specifically by Gartley (2015) regarding LGBT-inclusive texts
in libraries. Supportive administration will help librarians who wish to purchase LGBTinclusive texts for their libraries (Flores, 2016; Garry, 2015). Several librarians in this
study indicated support from administration as part of a reason for their comfort level
with diverse texts. Those who noted little support from administration tended to have
lower comfort levels with particular minoritized identities.
Training that focuses on intellectual freedom and The American Library
Association librarian code of ethics might prove beneficial. Intellectual freedom in
libraries allows patrons to explore various perspectives of different issues, have access to
books featuring myriad diverse identities, and more; it upholds the First Amendment
(ALA, n.d.; Gartley, 2015). The librarian code of ethics includes the following statement:
“We uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist all efforts to censor library
resources” (ALA, 2008, para. 5). Some librarians may not have received training or may
need re-training on these topics, especially in relation to topics or diverse identities that
have been rendered controversial. “As the ‘conduit to equitable access to information,’
school libraries cannot, in good conscience, attempt to avoid controversy by pretending
that one portion of the population doesn’t exist” (Gartley, 2015, para. 11). As Lambda
Legal (n.d.) points out, it is illegal to remove texts simply for depicting LGBT characters.
Since some librarians in this study indicated that they or their administration removed
books for having LGBT characters, they might not be aware of this. Training can help.
In addition to the various implications of many librarians not promoting LGBTinclusive texts frequently (if at all), another implication from this concerns librarian

168
budgets. Although overall library budgets rose in 2015-2016, budgets remain lower than
six years ago, and librarians anticipated lower budgets for 2016-2017 (Barack, 2016).
Some librarians noted that they do not have a budget at all (Barack, 2016). President
Trump has recently proposed a budget that includes $210 million dollars in cuts to two
library programs, one of which provides grants to school libraries (Ewbank, 2017).
Several participants in this study mentioned that they might not have a budget next year,
and some librarians noted that they already have no budget. When budgets are cut or
eliminated, librarians may be able to obtain grants, as some participants in this study did.
However, if the grant program is cut, that will limit this as a source of funding. Budget
cuts lead to fewer texts purchased, which may mean a focus on curricular texts rather
than building up a collection of inclusive diverse texts.

Suggestions for Further Research

Although some studies have examined inclusion of LGBT-inclusive texts in
middle and high school libraries (Hughes-Hassell, Overberg, & Harris, 2013; Oltmann,
2015), much remains to be done regarding a multiplicity of diverse identities. Additional
research can focus on studying inclusion of more types of diverse identities in school
libraries at all levels. Likewise, although a study (Page, 2016a) examined middle and
high school librarian comfort level with LGBT-inclusive texts in one midwestern state,
more research could examine comfort level with other diversities and/or in elementary
school libraries. Whether correlations exist between comfort level and promotion of
diverse text merits research as well.

169
Self-censorship exists, particularly with LGBT-inclusive texts. Several studies
have examined this phenomenon (Hughes-Hassell, Overberg, & Harris, 2013; Oltmann,
2015, 2016; Page, 2016a; School Library Journal, 2016). However, further research could
examine the decision-making process behind self-censorship, as well as ways in which
librarians guard against self-censorship, such as whether correlations exist among selfcensorship, level of perceived stakeholder support, worldview (including bias), training
on intellectual freedom, and existence of a school/district policy to handle challenges.
Some studies have examined various factors that impact teacher and librarian
decision making (Bertin & Davis, 2016; Friese et al., 2008; Garry, 2015; Schoenfeld,
2011; School Library Journal, 2016; Stallworth, Gibbons, & Fauber, 2006; Watkins &
Ostenson, 2015; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998). However, currently no published study has
examined library decision making in relation to the promotion of diverse texts in the
school library. Further research could examine the process by which librarians choose to
promote diverse literature in school libraries.

Researcher Reflection

Research has the power to create change. Those who participate in research
studies may be impacted by their participation. The findings may impact those who read
the research, and may inspire further studies that cause greater change. Additionally,
researchers may be changed by their own research.
This research journey through a dissertation has changed me. My passion for this
topic grew deeper as I became more aware of the systemic issues impacting minoritized

170
students in schools. When librarians exclude books portraying certain identities from
their shelves, they effectively erase that minoritized group. The message this sends to
children—those who belong to that group and those who do not—has devastating
consequences. My heart hurts for these children. I know the pain of being rendered
invisible, and the impact on my self-esteem and identity limited my ability to accept
myself and be myself for years. I do not want to see that damage occur to others. Thus, I
am even more passionate about advocating for inclusive representation.
However, changing the system is never easy. Societal and institutional prejudice
against LGBT people and other minoritized groups remains firmly entrenched. LGBT
identities have been politicized, rendered controversial, and highly sexualized. They have
often been reduced to issues, rather than people. This can lead to consequences for
librarians who choose to include texts with LGBT characters, especially in schools that
have no policy in place to deal with book challenges. Some librarians who want to
provide LGBT-inclusive texts shy away out of fear of these reactions.
Some of the respondents in this survey provided responses that reduced LGBT
people to issues rather than people. As a lesbian, this momentary stung, but it is not
unusual to hear or read, and likely the participants did not intend to dehumanize LGBT
people. Their words need to be acknowledged and interpreted fairly, while also
considering their impact. These perspectives need to be heard. The librarians making
these comments represent others who feel similarly, and understanding their points of
view is essential to learning more about the reasons behind decisions to self-censor.

171
Changes in perspectives rarely occur without listening to what others say and
trying to understand. When someone says something negative about an identity I hold,
that can make it more challenging for me to listen, to try to understand, and to remain fair
to the person making the comments while acknowledging the harm those comments
cause. Analytic memoing provided a vehicle for exploration of my response, as well as
how to maintain proper objectivity—as much as possible—as a researcher. My
committee looked over my interpretations to examine whether the quotes were presented
and interpreted fairly.
As with any research study, particularly one done within a limited timeframe,
challenges arose. My committee guided me through the challenges and went above and
beyond in their mentorship. This study is better because of them, and I learned that I can
persevere through such challenges due to their guidance and support.

Conclusion

Diverse, inclusive literature has the power to change lives. Unfortunately, due to a
combination of factors, some school libraries do not have texts representative of various
identities. Librarians in this study balance multiple internal and external factors when
making decisions regarding purchasing and promotion of diverse texts, and sometimes
this leads to a lack of diversity on the bookshelves. When children see themselves in
text, it can promote great connections, identity-validation and formation, and enhance
self-esteem. When children see others in text, it can promote empathy and mitigate
prejudice (Botelho & Rudman, 2009; Lifshitz, 2016; Smolkin & Young, 2011; Tschida,

172
Ryan, & Ticknor, 2014). Therefore, it is imperative that all children have access to texts
that feature strong characters like themselves as well as those unlike themselves. School
librarians can provide safe, inclusive environments for all children where they can access
texts reflective of their own and others’ identities.

SURVEY CONSENT FORM

205
SUBJECT CONSENT FORM FOR
PARTICIPATION IN HUMAN RESEARCH AT
MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY
Dear Participant,
My name is Donna Bulatowicz and I am a doctoral candidate at Montana State
University. I am inviting you to be a part of a research study. This consent form will
provide the information that you need in order to make an informed decision about
whether you would like to participate in the study. The study will consist of a survey that
should take 10-20 minutes. Once you have obtained sufficient information in order to
provide informed consent, please choose whether or not you wish to participate in this
study.
Project Title: Diverse Literature in School Libraries: Who Chooses and Why?
Purpose of the research study: You are being asked to participate in a research study to
examine the diversity in books used in school libraries. This survey will provide a chance
for you to reflect on the characters in the books you promote in your library. It will
provide information about the types of diversity in books used in school libraries, which
may spark conversations and guide decision-making when purchasing or selecting books
for library use.
Voluntary participation: Your participation in this research is completely voluntary and
you can choose to not answer any questions you do not want to answer and/or you can
stop at any time.
Procedures involved: This study consists of a survey administered online. There are
several different sections in this survey. The first two sections have different choices for
each question and room for comments at the end in case you would like to expand upon
or clarify any responses. The last section allows for short answers. There is
demographic data collected as well. You can choose to not answer any questions you do
not want to answer and/or you can stop at any time.
This information is anonymous, and will be used as part of a dissertation and published
articles, but no identifying information will be collected in this survey.
You may self-select for a follow-up interview as well, to further explore diversity in your
classroom or school library. If you self-select for an interview, you will be interviewed in
a way that you choose, whether that is over the phone, through e-mail, or over the
internet. If you agree, the interview will be audio-taped and transcribed. No identifying
information will be linked to the participant, who will be given a pseudonym. The
interviews will be transcribed (if recorded), and all recordings will be erased by May 1,
2017.
Risks and Benefits: Sometimes discussing diversity in literature, as well as one’s
comfort level with different types of diversity can cause some discomfort. If you feel

206
discomfort about any of the questions, you may choose to leave items blank or to
terminate your participation in the survey. The study is of no benefit to you other than
providing an opportunity to reflect on the diversity in your school library, as well as your
comfort level with various types of diversity.
Right to withdraw from the study: You have the right to withdraw from this study at
any time.
Source of Funding: NA
Cost to Subject: None
Confidentiality: There will be no identifying information collected, as the survey is
anonymous. If you choose to participate in a follow-up interview, you will be given a
pseudonym.
Whom to contact if you have questions about the study
If you have questions about this study, please contact Donna Bulatowicz:
donnabulatowicz@gmail.com, (406) 850-3497.
Additional questions about the rights of human subjects can be answered by the
Chairman of the Institutional Review Board, Mark Quinn, (406) 994-4707.
AUTHORIZATION: I have read the above and understand the discomforts,
inconvenience and risk of this study. I, _____________________________ (printed
name of participant), agree to participate in this research. I understand that I may later
refuse to participate, and that I may withdraw from the study at any time. I have received
a copy of this consent form for my own records.

FREQUENCY TABLES FOR BOOK PROMOTION AND DEMOGRAPHICS

211
FREQUENCY TABLES FOR FREQUENCY OF
BOOK PROMOTION AND DEMOGRAPHICS

The following tables show frequency distributions for frequency of book
promotion and demographics. Sexual orientation was excluded from the librarian
demographics due to the missing responses (n=32), responses based on sex or marital
status (n=2) instead of sexual orientation (n=4), and low number of people who selfidentified as something other than heterosexual (n=4). School type was excluded due to
low numbers in any categories other than public: charter (n=7), private (n=3). Although
male and female are labels for sex rather than gender, the researcher kept these as that is
how the participants identified. Although it is problematic, due to the low number of
people who identified as people of color (n=10), the researcher grouped them together for
the purposes of this analysis. The tables start on the next page.

APPENDIX F

FREQUENCY TABLES FOR COMFORT LEVEL AND DEMOGRAPHICS

235
FREQUENCY TABLES FOR COMFORT LEVEL AND DEMOGRAPHICS

The following tables show frequency distributions for how many librarians in
each demographic feel comfortable promoting each type of diversity. Sexual orientation
was excluded from the librarian demographics due to the missing responses (n=32),
responses based on sex or marital status (n=2) instead of sexual orientation (n=4), and the
low number of people who self-identified as something other than heterosexual (n=4).
School type was excluded due to low numbers in any categories other than public: charter
(n=7), private (n=3). Although male and female are labels for sex rather than gender, the
researcher kept these as that is how the participants identified. Although it is problematic,
due to the low number of people who identified as people of color (n=10), the researcher
grouped them together for the purposes of this analysis. The tables start on the next page.

BOOK TITLES

244
These book titles were listed by the survey participants as being their favorite
titles with main characters of the diverse identity groups. Some librarians listed titles, but
not authors. Some listed authors, but not titles. Some listed the names of famous people
rather than book titles. If an author could be easily linked to a book title, the researcher
listed the author. Otherwise, the information appears exactly as it did on the survey. If a
book title is listed twice, that is because more than one person listed it.
