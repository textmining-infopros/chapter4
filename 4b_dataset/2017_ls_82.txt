ABSTRACT
THE IMPACT OF SCHOOL LIBRARY DESIGN ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF
MULTIPLE LITERACY SKILLS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD STUDENTS

Anna Carello
Amy Stornaiuolo

The role of school libraries in both public and private school systems has changed
dramatically over the last two decades as the Internet and ubiquity of digital devices has
made the world accessible within seconds just by the tap of a finger on a touchscreen or
keyboard. The purpose of the school library as a functional educational space has
traditionally been one that promotes information literacy, reading for information, and
reading for pleasure with paper books. In today’s ever increasingly digital world,
however, well-resourced libraries are exchanging paper books and reference sets for ebooks and subscriptions to online services that store information in virtual clouds rather
than on bookshelves. Moreover, their coveted spaces are sometimes transformed into
tactile learning spaces inspired by the recent Maker Movement.
This qualitative research study examines the functional role of the school libraries
in four independent schools, an inquiry seeking to better understand how young students
use libraries to develop multiple literacies— digital, informational, tactile, and printed—
all of which are necessitated by the growing prevalence of electronic resources and
technology in schools. How should well-resourced school libraries today, historically
bound to paper collections and archives, design learning spaces and allocate resources to
vii

support a generation of students born into the digital age? It is the intersection of these
two points, students born into a world dominated by technology and traditional school
libraries dominated by paper resources, that the current role and purpose of school
libraries is examined.

Keywords: independent school, early childhood, school libraries, technology, new
literacies, digital, educational space and design, librarians, literacy, qualitative

INTRODUCTION, SIGNIFICANCE AND RESEARCH OVERVIEW

Introduction and Background
The role of school libraries in both public and private school systems has changed
dramatically over the last two decades as the Internet and ubiquity of digital devices
means that the world is accessible within seconds just by the tap of a finger on a
touchscreen or keyboard. The purpose of the school library as a functional educational
space has traditionally been one that promotes information literacy, reading for
information, and reading for pleasure with paper books. In today’s ever increasingly
digital world, however, well-resourced libraries are exchanging paper books and
reference sets for e-books and subscriptions to online services that store information in
virtual clouds rather than on bookshelves. Not only is this information available
wirelessly and from virtually anywhere, literally, but it also allows for educators to think
about learning and even research in creative, non-traditional spaces. This transformation
of space and ease in which students can access information today calls into question the
role of school libraries for technology savvy students; today’s students are “digital
natives that need to learn in ways that are meaningful to them” and libraries are
“potentially well placed to take advantage of new technologies in order to extend their
activities and support reading and learning needs of these digital natives” (Rankin, 2012,
p. 163). How many school libraries today, historically bound to paper collections and
archives, are equipped with learning spaces and resources that reflect the burgeoning
1

generation of students born into the digital age? It is the intersection of these two
points— students born into worlds dominated by technology, and school libraries
dominated by paper resources— that the current role and purpose of many of school
libraries should be reimagined.
School libraries as learning spaces are essential to student learning, and a
significant amount of student learning today is happening with the use of digital tools and
resources. The fact that so many digital natives are often learning with paperless devices
highlights a need for educators to consider what the future of library spaces are and could
be for the next generation. A poignant illustration of one school’s bold redesign of a
library space enlivened the front page of the Boston Globe in 2009 with the headline,
“Welcome to the library. Say goodbye to the books: Cushing Academy embraces a digital
future.” The featured story chronicled the headmaster of a prominent New England
school’s first steps in renegotiating the functionality of the school’s library space. The
well-resourced private school replaced cumbersome shelving stocked with over 20,000
books with expansive open areas and ergonomically designed furniture that allowed
students more space to collaborate. While not all 20,000 books were removed from the
collection, a considerable percentage was. Librarians worked with students to develop
informational skills on digital eBooks and laptop computers or tablets. A state of the art
coffee and cappuccino machine was even added to the space in order to promote a
sophisticated lounge atmosphere for high school students.
Abel’s (2009) story in the Boston Globe caused the Massachusetts Library
Association (MLA) to issue a reactive letter of caution to other schools against Cushing
2

Academy’s intrepid redesign. The decision may not have been too bold actually; the
ecological vibrancy of libraries as educational spaces in many independent schools began
to shift away from static quiet places for studying, and into dynamic environments that
reflected engaged school community members most especially of whom were students.
Undoubtedly, the story in the Boston Globe (Abel, 2009) made school leaders across the
country stop to think about the school library spaces that they maintained as well. On the
other side of the debate were organizations like the MLA, American Library Association
(ALA), and even the International Federation of Library Association (IFLA), who used
empirical evidence and decades of research on the benefits of school libraries to argue
that the digital age should not incite a paper book revolution as it seemingly did at
Cushing Academy, but rather it should inspire blended learning environments that keeps
the best of both “old” and “new” worlds.

Statement of the Problem
The replacement of paper books with electronic resources at Cushing Academy is
not the only case study example of a bold, reimagined school library space. In fact,
changes to the physical space of other school libraries can be seen in the recent
educational trend called “maker-spaces.” The Maker Movement:
“consists of a growing culture of hands-on making, creating, designing,
and innovating… and a hallmark of the movement is its ‘do-it-yourself (or
do-it-with-others)’ mindset that brings together individuals around a range
of activities, including textile craft, robotics, electronics, digital
fabrication, mechanical repair” or any other type of creative construction
(Peppler & Bender, p. 23).

3

The Maker Movement also has deep roots in the STEM initiatives supported by President
Obama through his call for students to “see the promise of being the makers of things,
and not just the consumers of things” (Obama, 2009). The President, while still a Senator
from Illinois, also once called libraries the “magic threshold” of a school, indicating that
the library space was a gateway to knowledge and creativity unique from traditional
classroom spaces (Obama, 2005). Such powerful and inspiring words from the country’s
leader may give insight into why a number of public and private schools reconsidered the
use and the general purpose of their library spaces, especially if such libraries were
uncompelling spaces or rarely used. Some school systems financially strapped by budget
cuts and few resources are closing the large and expensive spaces that libraries occupy
because they do not have the money to maintain the collection, nor do they have money
to hire library staff. Based on this history, it does seem logical that the large physical and
open space of a school library could magically become the new milieu for students to
spread out, collaborate, create, and build if the space was previously unused. These new,
non-traditional uses of school libraries engendered by the Maker Movement and the
digital age mean then that the school library today is a dynamic learning environment that
supports multiple literacies: tactile literacy, informational literacy, digital literacy, and of
course printed literacy.
In contrast to Cushing Academy’s bold move to jettison the abundant resources of
its private school library and to adopt digital devices instead are experiences that I have
personally experienced in the public education sphere. As a product of public school
education growing up and two different states and five different schools, the range of
4

public school library services that I had access to were quite broad. I lived in middle
class suburbs that typically had enough resources; that is to say that I had the option to
check out books that seemed to be in good condition and in my mind served the purpose
of research or pleasure reading. However, not every student in public education has the
same privilege that I did growing up. I am a product of public education, I have teaching
experience in a charter school and in independent schools, and I have had leadership
opportunities in the private, public, and federal domains. The problem I focus on in this
dissertation is how different school libraries across these domains are, and why they are,
so diverse.
Two profound professional experiences in public education and on a research trip
for the Department of the Interior and University of Pennsylvania helps to frame this
problem of disparity between school library resources and students’ access to quality
information. The first experience was my yearlong work at the School District of
Philadelphia’s Race to the Top (RTTT) grant. As a steward of the grant and employee
nestled under the Office of Talent and Educator Effectiveness, my daily work involved
looking at student assessment data, teacher evaluation data, and also frequenting schools
to observe teachers alongside principals in order to build their observation and feedback
skills within Danielson Framework for Teaching model (2013), the school’s rubric for
evaluating teacher effectiveness and metric when it came time to determining a teacher’s
overall effectiveness numerical score. Many of the schools I visited in Philadelphia had
closed their school libraries completely. Some had repurposed the rooms into meeting
rooms or student work spaces, but very few libraries were open and functioning. I came
5

to learn through my work and conversations that school libraries were not prioritized for
many principals faced with constricted budgets and growing needs for more teachers or
support staff. School libraries also cost a significant amount of a principal’s budget to
maintain with quality and accurate books and resources, not to mention a librarian to staff
the space. While the impact of closing a school library to me at that time was more of a
personal sadness, my later work researching for a pilot study on graduation rates brought
the role out of my periphery and more into the center line of my focus.
During my tenure at the District working on the RTTT grant, I also began pilot
study research to understand how African American male seniors interpreted their
learning journey towards an on-time graduation, specifically probing into how dynamics
of the school culture they attended influenced their experiences and cultivated what the
District called, “academic tenacity.” According to the District, academic tenacity
referred to specific non-cognitive factors believed to affect student achievement including
motivation, resilience, self-regulation, and grit. Academic tenacity also relates to
students’ ability to work hard and stay focused on their goals (Engelman, Kowalski, &
Wolford, 2014, p. 4). The term had particular significance to District leaders whose
logic was that if district leaders and principals focused on cultivating academic tenacity
in students at-risk of graduating on time, then the graduation rates would increase. The
young men included in my interview were scheduled to graduate on time, and attended
the high school with the highest graduation rate in the District. My task was to research
what their high school was doing to cultivate academic tenacity so that it could then be
potentially replicated in other schools. While my primary finding was that school
6

members like teachers and coaches helped the young men cultivate academic tenacity, a
small but important data point came up in our individual interviews: libraries. Each of
the young men I interviewed mentioned going to the public library or the school library
to check out books, books that served as windows into worlds outside of their local
neighborhoods and community and beyond the scope of imagination presented to them
within the confines of the school classroom. It was the combination of this detail in my
data with the experience of seeing so many school libraries closed in Philadelphia that
first led me to wonder about the power and potential of school libraries in shaping
children’s lives.
Not long after the pilot study research did a second experience at Pine Ridge
Reservation help me narrow my thinking about the role of school libraries in today’s time
even more. Pine Ridge is the Native American reservation of the Oglala Lakota Sioux
Nation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. It encompasses 7.2 million acres and is home to
46,855 natives (Bureau of Indian Affairs website, 2017). Statistically, 97% of the
population at Pine Ridge lives below the federal poverty line making the county the
poorest in the United States. The unemployment rate on the reservation fluctuates
between 85% and 95% with the median household income being a reported $2,600; the
infant mortality rate is the highest in North America and 300% times higher than the
average compared to the rest of the United States; the rate of diabetes and tuberculosis is
800% times higher than the national average; and the youth suicide rate is 150% higher
than the nation average (American Indian Humanitarian Foundation website, 2016). The
research trip to Pine Ridge was a part of a collaborative effort between the University of
7

Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education and the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the
United States Department of Interior to understand the systems, environments and
politics serving native American students. The dropout rates for Native American
students is over 70% and few in the field of education realize that Native American
students have consistently performed lower on achievement tests than their African
American and Hispanic peers, creating an achievement gap within the traditional
achievement gap between African American and Latino students and their white peers
(American Indian Humanitarian Foundation website, 2016). It was on this trip that I
toured schools and took note of their school libraries. One library in particular was in
complete disrepair, decorated with disturbingly outdated posters and maps, and with
scant collection of books that were arranged in a seemingly haphazard matrix on rusty
book shelves. I could not fathom how such a small unkempt space, small collection, and
outdated resources served the needs of children at the school. Hardly did the library
harken inspiration, curiosity, or creativity, but rather reminded me of a storeroom closet
dusty from being unused.
The experience in Philadelphia and at Pine Ridge left me both angry and curious
as an educator and as a lover of books. The combination of the experiences led me to
wonder what literature in the field had to say on the topic of school libraries as critical
spaces for students to engage with and develop literacy skills. The experiences were also
in sharp contrast to the experience I had as teacher and administrator at independent
schools. It was these two experiences coupled with my experience in independent
schools that led me to want better understand the role that school libraries could play in a
8

student’s success not only as a reader, but as a member of our society as well. I
wondered if well-resourced independent schools were utilizing their library spaces and
abundant budgets to make the greatest impact on student learning possible. I also
wondered what made a quality school library program, and if under resourced schools
could build effective programs even without comfortable budgets if I identified important
free or inexpensive phenomena happening in well-resourced school libraries too.
Libraries today are changing. My experiences tell me that they are either
disappearing, neglected, or transforming into places where digital devices and hands-on
learning are more central than browsing for books. How students interact with library
spaces to develop literacy skills is an important area of study in order for schools to
develop global citizens of the future, especially when I consider my own site of practice.
I work at a well-resourced independent school in wealth ward of Northwest
Washington, D.C. Our school serves a very unique population of students and makes us
unique in the area and also in comparison to other independent schools in the United
States as well. Our focus is on the early childhood and early elementary years for
students in grades pre-kindergarten through third grade. A few very percentage of
students that we serve are fully fluent and literate readers before the leave our
classrooms. This is not because they are not capable students or because they are not
being taught, but rather developmentally their reading skill development is still the
emerging phase. What is the purpose of a school library then for students who cannot yet
read?

9

Significance of this Study
There is most certainly a despairingly obvious range of school library programs
accessible to students in the milieus of public and private education. This research study
seeks to better understand what well-resourced school libraries are doing to develop
literacy skills for students in order to in potentially inform the field with actions and
programs that can replicated in any context. While there is no shortage in literature that
proves the importance of school libraries to the literacy achievement of students, there are
two primary constituent groups left out of the current research on literacy achievement
and school libraries: independent schools and young children in early childhood grades.
This frames an interesting context for an inquiry based on understanding how young
students use library spaces to develop multiple literacies— digital, informational, tactile,
and printed— all of which are necessitated by the burgeoning of electronic resources and
technology. If one of the primary purposes of a library space in schools today is to
support the development of multiple literacies in students, then how libraries support
students who are not yet developmentally literate is also a critical point of inquiry for
educational researchers and leaders as well.
A Definition of Multiple Literacies
As library have changed, so has the definition of what it means to be a literate
person in today’s time. However, these two changes have not always happened in
concert with one another. I have defined multiple literacies as a student’s ability to make
meaning of their world through digital, informational, tactile, and printed sources of
information. This definition of multiple literacies is inspired by the seminal work of the
10

New London Group (NLG) (1996) to define and describe multiliteracies. NLG
researched and evaluated how technology changes and globalization were affecting
education and defined multiliteracies as a pedagogical approached that “aims to make
classroom teaching inclusive of cultural, linguistic, communicative, and technological
diversity” (NLG, 1996). Building on this definition, and my slight shift in wording gives
room to specifically address literacy skills relevant to early childhood development.
Children in the early childhood and early elementary grades read the world through
environmental text, images, symbols and shapes, colors, and even facial cues and body
language. Concepts of print are not developed until the later early childhood years and
beginning middle childhood years. Yet children are still able to navigate the world
around them without being able to read, and so thus cultivate multiple literacy skills
before and during multiliteracy skill development as well.
Discussions on how and why society should produce literate students is a central
discussion in educational philosophy and theory, too, as many scholars and theorists posit
that the goal of schooling is to produce students who are capable of succeeding in life
beyond school. Defining literacy as just the ability to read and write falls short in a time
when so much more is required of students in order to be successful beyond school. My
research seeks to define and describe multiple literacies even further and in the specific
context of school libraries serving early childhood and early elementary students. I
explore how students develop multiple literacy skills in the school library space that go
beyond the traditional scope of the term as simply reading and writing skills.
Researching how students make meaning from the printed sources of information alone
11

within a school library would not have captured how students in the digital age truly
make sense of information. My research questions explore the intersection of traditional
literacy skills with these new multiple literacy skills required to produce literate students
equipped with the skills to thrive beyond school and in the 21st century and in school
libraries. My aim is to develop a better understanding of multiple literacy skill
development in the school libraries to inform my own practice and the field, and also to
determine what activities and characteristics to cultivate multiple literacy skills can be
replicated in school libraries regardless of their setting.

Research Questions
The intention of this study was to contribute to the field of literature examining
the power and influence quality have on multiple literacy development in children. I
approached my inquiry with qualitative study of four independent elementary schools in
Massachusetts. The questions guiding my inquiry are:
1. How are four well-resourced independent school libraries
designing learning spaces to support the development of
multiple literacies in students of early childhood grades?
2. How do teachers and students engage with the library space in
order to cultivate multiple literacies?
3. How does technology impact the role of school librarians and
the function of the library?
4. How do school leaders support the school library?
12

As library spaces take on new roles and serve new purposes for students today, new
questions emerge that challenge the traditional identity of these spaces, especially for the
young children. Everall (2012) notes that while this “debate over the direction of library
services is ongoing, children’s and school librarians must deal with ‘what is’ now and be
able to respond proactively, innovatively and imaginatively to the many challenges that
they are facing” (Rankin & Brock, 2012, p. xvi). For these reasons, an inquiry into how
the pre-literate and early childhood students interact with library spaces to develop
multiple literacies can potentially inform school leaders and community stakeholders in
how best to support student learning into the 22nd century.

CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND LITERATURE REVIEW
This literature review consists of four main sections. In the first section I explain
Urie Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory and apply it to the context of
this study in order to build a conceptual framework for my research. I provide a visual
example of how Bronfenbrenner’s theory frames this research around early childhood
students and the various factors within a school library that influence their development
of multiple literacy skills. The second section reviews literature and decades of scholarly
research determining the important influence libraries as an environmental system within
the school have on students. The third section explores the social theories of early
childhood development through the work of theorists Bruner (1957) Bandura (1971) and
Malaguzzi (1984). I then connect Malaguzzi’s study of young school children in diverse
environmental settings and delve into literature exploring design theory in educational
contexts. Finally, I look through lens of Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory with
specific review of literature explaining how the design of the environment impacts the
social and cognitive development of children in the early and middle childhood stages of
growth.

Conceptual Framework
This study takes an ecological approach to understanding how young learners
interact with library spaces innovatively designed to develop multiple literacies
engendered by the digital age. An ecological approach of inquiry aims to discover how
the behavior and development of children are “influenced by the social systems around
14

them,” and is an approach adapted from Bronfenbrenner’s (1979; 1989) social ecological
perspective on how children are influenced by the settings in which they work (Rankin &
Brock, 2015, p. 2). Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) model puts children at the center of a
complex system of environmental factors and theoretically examines the impact of each
factor on the child’s cognitive, social, and psychological development. This perspective
has guided the design of my study as I inquire into the relationship between students at a
developmental age when they are learning literacy skills for the first time and how they
are impacted by the school library environment. For the purposes of this study, students
in the early childhood and early elementary grades who are not yet fluent readers are my
central focus within the system of the school library, and I examine how the physical and
aesthetic elements of the space, teachers, school leaders, and other school community
members influence the students’ multiple literacy skill development. Figure 1 is a
conceptual representation of Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) theory applied to this study.

Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological approach to understanding this transactional
relationship between students and their environments is unique and differs from other
social behaviorists in that it holds that both students and the environment in which they
learn are and should be dynamic; rather than a one directional relationship in which the
environment remains unchanged while the students change through the social learning
process, Bronfenbrenner (1979) instead describes the relationship between student and
environment as mutually beneficial and evolving in relation to one another. I will
elaborate and describe more about social learning theory and young children in the
subsequent section. However, first I will review literature describing how influential the
system of the school library can be on the academic achievement of students. Then I will
weave in more social learning theory as well as design theory to give a fuller picture of
how the student at the center of this conceptual framework is influenced by its
environment.

School Library Programs and Student Achievement
Decades of work by Keith Curry Lance, Ph. D. (1992, 1993, 2000a, 2000b,
2000c, 2003, 2011, 2012), in the field of public school library programs and their impact
on the improved reading achievement scores of students has been the foundation for
school library reform not only in the United States, but around the world as well. Lance’s
longitudinal studies span both decades and states. Lance’s work has consistently found a
correlation between school library programs and improved reading scores for students on
standardized tests in multiple contexts.
16

Lance’s (1994) first study published in the School Library Media Quarterly
journal is the seminal work of the field. The study focused on public school libraries in
Colorado and provided quantitative evidence proving that school library programs have a
positive influence on student achievement in reading. The extensive study included an
analysis of student test scores and school library data statistics for 221 Colorado state
public schools, 134 (60%) of which were elementary schools. The Iowa Test of Basic
Skills (ITBS) and Test of Achievement and Proficiency (TAPS) test scores were used as
the indicators of achievement of the school overall and a multiple regression analysis was
used to exclude variables like community setting (i.e. urban, rural, suburban), race, and
participation rates in subsidized lunch programs as possible factors influencing the
findings. Lance’s (1994) Colorado study inspired commissioned studies in 20 other
states, nine of which Lance is a key author. The findings of these commissioned studies
that inform my conceptual framework include:


In Alaska, students who receive frequent library and information literacy
instruction from librarian practitioners also have higher overall
standardized test scores (Lance, Hamilton-Pennell, & Rodney, 2000)



In Colorado, elementary students who had teachers that frequently
collaborated with librarian practitioners scored 21% higher on reading
tests than those students who had less collaborative teachers and
librarians (Lance, et. al., 1993; 2000)



In Indiana, “more enriching” library environments are those that include
certified library media specialists, teachers willing to collaborate,
17

supportive administrators, and current resources and technology
(Callison, 2004)


In Michigan, elementary schools with the highest reading scores on the
state standardized assessment also had more frequent student visits to the
school’s library when compared to lower performing schools (Rodney,
Lance, and Hamilton-Pennell, 2003)



In Minnesota, elementary school student achievement scores were related
to increases in school library reading program spending (Baxter &
Smalley, 2003)



In New Mexico, overall achievement scores for students on state
standardized tests rose in correlation to the rise of school library programs
(Rodney, Lance, Hamilton-Pennell, 2002).



In Ohio, a survey of 13,123 students in grades 3-12 found that 99.4% selfassessed to perceive that their school library program benefitted their
learning (Todd & Kuhlthua, 2004).



In Wisconsin, what students most appreciated about their library
practitioners was that they taught information and technology skills not
covered in classroom instruction (Smith, 2006).



In an international report by the Ontario Library Association, the presence
of a school library program for students in grades three through six who
experience collaborative instruction by both teachers and librarians was
the strongest predictor of reading enjoyment. Furthermore, reading
18

enjoyment was positively correlated to overall student achievement
(Klinger, 2006).
These studies reveal connections between school library programs and positive school
achievement scores overall, and describe characteristics that are attributed to quality
school library programs. Improved perceptions of reading enjoyment and reading scores
on state standardized tests are also evidence of how important school library programs
can be for young students. In a meta-analysis by Lance and Russell (2004), the authors
review another range of academic studies that were conducted after Lance’s (1994)
formative study in Colorado. In this report, the authors (2004) note that even though
there is compelling evidence that school libraries improve student achievement and
reading scores, educators have too rarely utilized the research to inform their practice
(Lance & Russell, 2004, p. 15).
Lance and Hofschire (2013) call educators to begin using research to inform
current school library practice as the addition of computers, Internet, eReaders, and well
as tablet or laptop computers make an indelible mark on the school library landscape as
we know it today. The authors (2013) assert that in order for research to go further in the
field, the new role of the school library and librarians will have to be defined. That new
measurements of school library outputs and outcomes will also have to be determined,
and so an inquiry into this topic is very much needed to benefit the field. The synthesis
of the multitude of research linking school library programs and student achievement,
successful school libraries are positively impacted by the collaborations between
teachers, librarians, students, and the resources within the space. These research studies
19

inform my research by linking describing what features and aspects of library spaces
impact student learning outcomes positively. Although the research studies are
conducted in the public school setting, the features of the library spaces in these studies
are generalizable to the library spaces of elementary independent schools.
Lance et al.’s (2000) study in Alaska that found that students who had access to
informational literacy instruction also had higher reading achievement scores was also a
seminal piece exploring librarian agency. An examination of Alaskan librarians in this
study showed that librarians in schools that saw improved reading scores also focused on
developing direct relationships with students and staff members (Lance, HamiltonPennell, & Rodney, 2000). In a brochure created by the authors (2000) of the study
based on the findings of their research, librarians who were agents of a successful reading
culture characteristically kept the library open longer hours than the school day,
proactively provided resources to teachers, planned with teachers, delivered library and
informational literacy instruction to students, promoted frequent visits to the library
beyond time designated by teachers for student projects, and finally, were able to build
strong relationships with the local public library system as well (Lance, HamiltonPennell, & Rodney, 2000).

Social Learning Theory in Early Childhood Contexts
Social learning theory from the renowned work of Bruner (1957), Bandura
(1971), and Malaguzzi (1984), who is most well-known as the founding father of the
Reggio Approach to teaching early childhood, also informs my inquiry. Bruner (1957)
20

and Bandura’s (1971) theories help explain how children engaging in school library
spaces socially in order to learn, while Malaguzzi’s (1984) work builds on these theories
to consider the role of physical space in that learning process as well. At the end of this
section I also review a number of studies that connect aspects of physical space that
positively influence student learning outcomes.
Bruner’s (1957a, 1957b) constructivist perspective within social learning theory
contends that young children learn through experience. How children then construct that
experience into learning new knowledge varies by their developmental age; however,
they learn to develop new knowledge beyond the information they are given by a teacher,
once they are able to take that information and interact with it (Bruner, 1957a). Bruner
(1960) developed the theory that the process in which children learn happens in three
different stages of childhood: the “enactive stage” for newborns to one year old, the
“iconic stage” for children between one year and six years of age, and the last “symbolic
stage” of learning which happens at the age of seven and onwards; Bruner’s (1960) work
suggests that learning is a developmental process that begins very early in a person’s life,
and that learning is shaped in new ways as children develop and construct new
knowledge of the world around them. These developmental stages hallmark elementary
education: traditionally the last school year of early childhood education in America is
considered to be third grade, a grade level in which typically developing children are
eight years old. Bandura’s (1971) notion of learning as a social phenomenon also posits
that students have an on-going reciprocal and imitative experience with both people and
their environments throughout the learning process (Bandura, 1971). Similar to Bruner,
21

Bandura’s social learning theory hypothesizes the critical importance of interactive
experiences between students and a facilitator. This facilitator, however, can be a teacher
or can be the environment in which the student is placed. This last insight connects my
framework to one of early childhood education’s most renowned theorists, Loris
Malaguzzi.
It is impossible to consider the role of the classroom environment in early
childhood learning without considering the contributions of Malaguzzi. Hall, Horgan,
Ridgway, Murphy, Cunneen, and Cunnigham (2010) note that “for many in the field of
early childhood education Reggio Emilia is synonymous with ideal practice” despite the
fact that as its founder, Malaguzzi, wrote little about his philosophy of childhood
education (p. 1). Malaguzzi’s contributions to the field of social learning theory is
evident in the popularity of and reverence for a methodology known as the Reggio
Approach. The history behind his approach is also interesting to consider, especially as I
view my research questions through a design-oriented lens: Malaguzzi actually
developed his methodology in Reggio Emilia, Italy, following World War II. He became
distraught over the sight of dilapidated buildings and the generally dreary scenery
haunting the Italian countryside after the War (Murphy, et al., 2010). He guided students
to recreate more vibrant and dynamic learning spaces, a place where they could
constructed their own “beautiful” world in which to learn despite living in an un-beautiful
world (Murphy, et al., 2010). Malaguzzi believed that the learning process for children
was interrupted by spaces that they did not have an active role in constructing
themselves, and moreover that the learning process was in fact threatened by dilapidated
22

surroundings and a teacher facilitating most of the instruction and construction of the
space (Murphy, et al., 2010). Malaguzzi famously claimed that there were in actuality,
three teachers in each classroom: first students, then the teacher, and thirdly, the
classroom. This concept is perpetuated in the early childhood education community, and
the physical space of the early childhood classroom is very often referred to as “the third
teacher” in parlance amongst teachers and school members. For these reasons,
classrooms that embrace the Reggio Approach look in appearance quite different from
traditional early childhood classrooms; the developmental needs and interests of young
children are scrutinized and then meaningfully represented in a Reggio classroom.
The Reggio Approach is a pure form of authentic constructivism for children in
which they have complete control of the learning environment from the decoration of the
space together to the topics of interest that they choose to study. Learning with the
Reggio Approach is a social process between students and teachers, but it is also an
equally valuable interaction between students and their classroom spaces as well. In
many schools, the library is considered the largest classroom— a space where children go
to learn and cultivate new knowledge. In this way, Malaguzzi’s constructivist theory on
education is applicable to library spaces as well. School libraries should be considered a
classroom where children engage in and create an environment in order to learn and
develop new knowledge.
Design Theory in Educational Contexts
Does literature support the notion that the classroom environment affects student
learning? A number of studies reveal that certain aspects in educational spaces have a
23

positive impact on student learning and cognition. Ott’s (1973) study on the increased
levels of serotonin production in students exposed to natural light in schools supports the
notion that environment does indeed have an impact on student learning as this
neurotransmitter is essential to sustained attention levels in all humans, but most
especially developing children. Moreover, Zentall’s (1983) study revealed that
classrooms with novelties, color, soothing noises and sounds, as well as natural light all
positively impacted student attention compared to classrooms without these features
(Zentall, 1983). Architects in school planning and design have taken cues from these
research studies, building buildings that enhance the learning process for students based
on empirical evidence proving that design matters in learning.
A quantitative study by Tanner (2008) also highlights the important relationship
between educational spaces and learning, a study that professional architects and
educators should consider. Tanner (2008) found that “the school’s physical environment,
defined as various classifications of design items, influences student outcomes, especially
behavior and achievement” (p. 383). The study included 71 rural and suburban
elementary schools in Georgia and measured how the learning outcomes of 10,650 fifth
grade students were impacted by three aspects of the schools’ design items: movement
and circulation around furniture arrangements and structures, day lighting, and views.
Data using a ten-point Likert scale was collected and then a reduced regression analysis
was run to define the effect of the school’s physical environment on students’ outcomes
based on results from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS), a standardized assessment.
The study found that the ability to move and circulate in non-crowded spaces, the
24

prevalence of natural day lighting, and views that extended to at least 50 feet outside
classroom windows, indicated significant effects on reading comprehension, reading
vocabulary, language arts, mathematics, and science” test scores (Tanner, 2008, p. 392).
The author’s earlier research with colleagues at the University of Georgia’s School
Design and Planning Laboratory also revealed that “color, light, acoustics, movement,
circulation, views, design, scale, location, learning neighborhoods, and outdoor learning”
have been consistently correlated to student achievement in recent years (Tanner &
Lackney, 2006).
Furthermore, observations by Strong-Wilson and Ellis (2008) point to how
important educational design is for students, but most especially young children. The
authors concluded that the configuration of classroom spaces were important in order to
successfully encourage the movement of students and to facilitate student interaction.
They further note that one of the most “important and desirable human activities for
young children is interaction with others” and therefore a key aspect of the learning
process for children is actually the physical space. How children interact with one
another, a teacher, and the arrangement of their classroom environment has an effect on
their learning experience, and how young children perceive and use space in order to
create meaning is an essential component to the learning process (Strong-Wilson & Ellis,
2009).
In addition to the arrangement of a space, what a child can see in that space is
also important to their learning. Tarr (2004) critically examined the physical walls of
first grade classrooms considering four perspectives: how walls added to the reading the
25

environment, how walls silenced or gave voice to students, how walls displayed learning,
and the overall aesthetics of walls within classrooms. She notes that in one “visually
busy” classroom in particular, the walls were either cluttered with decorative and colorful
scalloped borders, or they were dominated by large bulletin boards covered with word
walls, classroom rules, letters, numbers, shapes and colors. Some classrooms also had a
number of cartoon characters decorating the walls and shiny, swinging objects hanging
from the ceiling. Her observations provoked inquiry into the observable concentration
levels of students in these visually busy classrooms in comparison to students in less
visually classrooms. Her observations concluded with the clear recommendation that
early childhood teachers pay close attention the aesthetics of their classroom walls to
determine whether they actually contribute to learning “or whether they ultimately
silence children in the learning process” (Tarr, 2004, p. 91).
Tarr’s (2004) observations resonated with me as I considered the more than
17,000 books that my own school library currently has shelved on tightly packed
bookshelves. Moreover, my school library has bookshelves lining its walls, perpetuating
a sense of abundance to me as an adult. After reading so many research studies,
however, I have begun to wonder how the cacophony of books crammed into shelves and
displayed by spine rather than cover could potentially appear to a young learner.
Moreover, I am curious as to why students I observe in my library seem to gravitate more
towards the desktop computers that sit idle on a countertop are more entertaining than the
books that can teach them so much. It is precisely these observations of my own library,
coupled the bodies of literature reviewed here, that I approach my research with a lens
26

that looks specifically at the design of a space intended to engage young children born
into the digital age.
Physical Space and Multiple Literacy Skill Development. In order for
children, young children especially, to learn and to make sense of the world around them,
they must feel a sense of safety. Mariale Hardiman, a scholar in the field of educational
neuroscience, makes explicit the connection between effective learning experiences,
emotion, and the physical environment. Learning at the neuronal level happens in the
center most region of the brain known as the limbic system. This system is actually
comprised of “a collection of structures that play an important role in emotional process,
learning and memory” (Hardiman, 2012, p. 21). The interconnection between learning
and emotions is therefore inextricable and is an important connection to understand for
the purposes of this study. Hardiman (2012) suggests positive emotional environments
are the optimal learning conditions for students to attend to tasks. She also suggests that
“setting the emotional climate for learning may be the most important task a teacher
embarks on each day” as how a child’s brain processes negative and positive emotions in
the limbic directly influences his or her “capacity to attend to, perceive, and receive
information” (Hardiman, 2012, p. 35).

Elements in the physical environment also have

an impact on a student’s attention and interaction with learning activities, with Malaguzzi
(1984) arguing that children need to interact with their physical environments socially in
order to be able to make meaning of their world. Hardiman’s (2012) research explores
how novelty in the classroom through design elements, natural lighting, seating
arrangements, scents and patterns of organization allows the developing brain to engage
27

with the space in more “meaningful and enticing” ways (Hardiman, 2012, p. 61). Her
work explains how novelty in a school space can trigger the limbic system’s orienting
and alerting structures, and warns of the cognitive stunt called habituation if what was
once novel becomes rote and familiar. She summarizes research from Ariga and Lleras
(2011) in the cognitive sciences to explain:
The new poster a teacher puts on the wall, for example, may interest
students at first, but if it remains there for a lengthy period of time, it
becomes like wallpaper, blending into the background of the environment
and even cluttering the space rather than enhancing it. Unchanging visual
environments create habituation…If we consider the importance of
novelty to capturing students’ attention, it is worth taking the time to make
even simple changes that help engage students (Hardiman, 2012, p. 61).
Hardiman’s (2012) thoughtful work connecting cognitive neuroscience research with
classroom practice is relevant to this research when considering how the library design
impact students’ development of multiple literacy skills. Her field of study also brings
together the theoretical writing with the empirical research explored in this literature
review. Bronfenbrenner (1979) and other theorized that young students learn best
socially and when they have direct engagement with their environments and empirical
research reveals that the school library environment can potential impact student
achievement in positive ways. Hardiman’s (2012) work then helps explain why and how
school library environments impact students’ learning of multiple literacy skills with a
point of view that highlights how important students feeling safe in a space is, and how
important it is for students to engage in the space personally.
The traditional concept of a school library denotes space where students go to
check out books and to research. Today’s technology on the other hand allows for
students to use school libraries in different ways, and to develop literacies not just in
28

print, but digital, informational, and tactile literacy skills as well. Social learning
theorists posit that learning especially for young children is interactive, involves others
including the physical environment, and develops through play and tactile activities.
Scholars in the field of library science prove that libraries are unique and special places
within school communities that have a positive impact on school culture, and the
importance of feeling safe and engaged in a physical space is proven through the
sciences. These frameworks provide a structure to understand this study as it relates to
pre-literate and emergent readers in four independent schools.

29

CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
Research Context and Setting
Framing my inquiry in the context of independent schools and early childhood
students helps inform school leaders of an important number of schools and students in
the United States. Independent schools are privately funded school entities accredited by
a managing organization known as the National Association of Independent Schools
(NAIS). In 2014, there were 1,098 accredited independent boarding and day schools
enrolling 556,643 students in grades pre-kindergarten through grade 12 (NAIS, 2015).
Independent schools are a different environment from public schools, even
distinguishable from private schools as well. In a research article sponsored by the
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Alt and Peter (2002) explain that
independent schools are characteristically governed by an elected board of trustees, and
are funded through nonpublic sources: primarily through tuition, donor contributions, and
endowments. This is in contrast to public schools that are most typically governed by
elected board members, and are funded through local, state, and even national budgets
(Alt & Peter, 2002). The absence of literature on independent schools and elementary
libraries forces the foundation of my work to be rooted in the theoretical context of public
schools. Selecting independent school to research, however, has taken some careful
consideration.
Independent schools have their own unique culture, and while the public school
studies that have thus far informed my research are absolutely generalizable, there is a
tacit expectation in independent schools that research applied to their practice are
reflective of the school demographic data of independent schools. Curiously, the topic of
30

school library spaces in the independent school setting has not yet been researched.
Selecting school libraries to study in Washington, D.C., the city in which I work, would
challenge the validity of my research; independent schools are incredibly competitive in
the District. Since this is a practitioner inquiry seeking to better understand and inform
the work I do professionally, I felt the need to leave the greater Washington, D.C. area in
order to preserve and sustain the cordial relationships that my school has with other areas
schools marketing to the same families. Thus, I worked with the Head of School from
my current site of practice to identify four independent schools in suburbs outside of the
Boston area that had similar enrollment profiles and school communities in order to
pursue my research.
My overall goal for this study is to have a list of characteristics of compelling
library spaces that include both elements of design, but literacy connections between
student, librarians, and teachers as well. Libraries, in a phenomenon that I also hope to
better understand through this study, hold an incredible amount of emotionally charged
memories for people. This made me even more eager to begin the research so that I
could better understand what makes library spaces so compelling for people.

Research Design and Methodology
I used a matrix to outline the overall design of a research study, a strategy
advocated by Maxwell (2013), to show how each research question is connected to a
study’s conceptual framework (see Appendix A). This matrix also outlines the
components of this research study and it has been an incredibly helpful tool in thinking
31

through not only the overall design of the study, but the sequence of my methods as well.
This study focuses on four independent schools, their librarians, school leaders, and
teachers. I captured a generalizable set of data on independent school libraries similar to
my site of practice, while also offering me the ability to delve deeper to ask questions
about relationships between school community members and to make observational notes
that helped to investigate each school more closely. I relied heavily on Maxwell (2013),
and Miles et al. (2014) to guide the overall design of my study, using their work to
purposefully select four independent schools as research sites.
Site Selection. Since this is true practitioner inquiry that will inform my own
professional work, I wanted to find schools to study that were similar to my own. I
purposefully selected four independent schools in New England that matched my current
site of practice based on the families and students they serve, school culture, and school
values to build my suitable sampling frame. I selected independents schools in the
Boston area because it is a city to which I could draw the closest parallels to Washington,
D.C. More specifically, Boston is also on the east-coast, is considered a small big-city,
boasts a number of colleges and universities within the city, and also has a large ratio of
commuters into the city for work. I was also guided in selecting Boston as a location
because the city is easy for me to access via train or plane. Maxwell (2013), who
describes purposeful selection as deliberately selecting sites in order “to provide
information that is particularly relevant to your questions and goals, and that can’t be
gotten as well from other choices” and I did my best to consider this when selecting the
school sites and city (Maxwell, 2013, p. 97). Maxwell also (2013) mentions that one
32

goal of purposeful selection is to “deliberately select [sites] that are critical for testing the
theories that you began the study with, or that you have subsequently developed” (p. 98),
and so I shared my conceptual framework and the findings of a number of influential
studies (Lance & Hofschire, 2012; Lance & Hofschire, 2011; Francis, Lance, & Lietzau
2010; Lance, 1993) with my current Head of School so that she could help make
thoughtful site recommendations, too.
I also developed a list of criteria that each school library had to meet in order to
be selected. I created the list based on a synthesis of findings from quantitative studies
linking public school library programs with higher student reading scores, most notably
studies from Lance & Hofschire (2012), Lance & Hofschire (2011), Francis, Lance, &
Lietzau (2010), Lance (2000, 1993). Without evidence from private school library
systems in the current body of literature, the characteristics of effective public school
libraries is a valid first step in creating criteria for this study. Hence, each of the selected
school sites for my research shows evidence of:
1. School librarians who teach information literacy skills to
students;
2. Certified (or equivalent) librarians qualified for the position;
3. Collaboration between school librarians and classroom teachers;
4. Extended library hours that are available and open to all school
community stakeholders;

33

5. Having current collections that are weeded on a frequency
consistent with AASL or ALA’s best practices in library
science;
6. Having collections that include a broad range of resources that
address various reading levels, and that include reference
materials, fiction and non-fiction texts, as well as access to
digital databases;
7. Computer systems or digital technology available for students to
use;
8. Frequent visits from students;
9. Frequent visits from classroom teachers;
10. Financial resources that allow for the addition of new resources
and technologies that keep the collections dynamic and current
throughout the school year.
An overview of the four schools that matched profiles similar to my current site of practice
and the list of criteria is included below in Table 1. A short synopsis of each school’s
demographics, enrollments, a library and technology programs provides a general overview of

The New England School. An independent co-education day school for students
in grades pre-kindergarten through eighth grade accredited by the Association of
Independent School in New England (AISNE) and NAIS. The school was established
100 years ago, and is
situated on an 11-acre
campus nestled amid
natural wetlands, treelined paths, and small
village-like cabins that
serve as classrooms for
over 500 students. The
setting of the school
extends learning beyond
the traditional classroom
35

and into outside learning spaces with an established outdoor curriculum. Class sizes are
intentionally kept small at this school in order to facilitate small group learning, and the
student to teacher ratio is 8:1. The school also has a commitment to diversity amongst
students and faculty members, and a commitment to novice teacher preparation through
its well-known teacher training course that was established in partnership with a local
university. The New England School’s (NES) library was awarded the American
Institute of Architects (AIA) Library Building Award in 2003. Three librarians maintain
the library’s collection of over 25,000 books and other learning resources such as
magazines, computers, and online catalogs.
Country Day. Also accredited by AISNE and NAIS, this co-educational day
school serves 270 students in grades pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with an
innovative weekly schedule: students in grades pre-kindergarten through fourth
grade attend school
from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30
p.m. on Mondays
through Thursdays, and
from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30
p.m. on Fridays. The
11-acre campus is
fifteen minutes from
Boston and attracts
students from more
36

than 25 nearby towns and communities. The student to teacher ratio is 6:1, 24% of
the students identify as students of color, and 83% of faculty members hold
advanced degrees. Country Day refers to their library as the “heart” of the school,
and students in every grade level experience skill-based lessons with the librarians to
develop research and informational literacy skills. The technology department at the
school has worked collaboratively with the teachers and the librarians to create a
specific informational literacy program and library curriculum.
William Penn. William Penn is a coeducational day school serving students in
grades pre-kindergarten through eighth grades. As a Quaker school, William Penn’s
students and colleagues follow Quaker educational traditions including Peace
Testimonies and engaging in silent morning worship meetings that are intended to give
all members of the community time to reflect and quiet their minds. The library has two
librarians and has one library serving its nearly 200 students, as well as two
makerspaces: one makerspace for middle school students, and one for lower school
students. A commitment to social justice issue, inclusivity, diversity, and equity have
been central to the school’s
mission and values since its
establishment in 1961 in a
neighborhood nestled deep
within a suburb outside of
Boston, Massachusetts. 40%
of the student body identify
37

as students of color, 4.5% identify as Quaker, and 6% of families identify as LGBTQ.
The library and makerspace programs at William Penn have both won grant awards to
support student activities and professional development for the faculty members leading
each space. The student to teacher ratio is 1:5 and the average class size is thirteen
students.
Crestwood Academy. This all boys day school serves students in grades 4
through 9. Founded in 1929, this school is also accredited by AISNE and NAIS. The
student to teacher ratio is 5:1, with a total of 333 boys attending the school just 15 miles
outside of Boston. School E has a long tradition of volunteerism amongst both its
students and parent community, as well as a commitment to diversity and equity. The
school hosts a Multicultural Educators Forum and a Diversity Committee leads diversity
initiatives that extend beyond the campus and include the greater community. The
school’s library was rebuilt in 2013 to include areas for comfortable reading,
collaborative learning, and group instruction.
Two librarians support faculty and students,
teach research and informational literacy
skills to students, and maintain a collection
of over 10,000 printed books. Students in
grades 4 and 5 experience the Intensive
Literacy Program (ILP) as their reading and
writing curriculum, a rigorous program that
uses a multi-sensory methodology for
38

literacy instruction. Crestwood Academy proudly advocates for technology to be used as
a tool in the classroom for both teaching and learning, and every student is invited to
bring their own device to school each day. A digital citizenship curriculum and Internet
safety program has been designed in collaboration by the school librarians, student
advisors, and a group of invested teachers. Even though this school serves students
outside of the grade levels that are considered “early childhood” grades, I am curious to
discover how fourth graders specifically interact with the library space as they bridge the
developmental stages between childhood and adolescence. It was my hope that the data I
collected at this site could serve as a “look into the future” of what lies ahead of primary
aged students as the grow into the upper elementary grades; data that I collected at this
school was helpful in thinking about what physical and curricular structures should be
established in an early childhood school library so that students can make a successful
transition to fourth grade, too.
Participant Selection
Creswell (2003) notes that “individuals seek understanding of the world in which
they live and work… The goal of research then, is to rely as much as possible on the
participants’ views of the situation being studied” (p.8). While the school librarians and
the leader of each school are straightforwardly chosen as participants for this study,
selecting the best teacher participants to engage in this research has required more
thoughtful selection. I was encouraged by Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014) who
recommend to researchers that careful consideration be placed on who is asked to
participate in the study. The authors (2014) suggest asking questions such as, “Do the
39

people I am studying have full information about what the study will involve?” (p. 94), to
identify which participant out of many may be the best for a study. I asked the librarians
for suggestions on teachers to interview, specifically requesting that early childhood and
early elementary grade teachers who used the library or who had planned a specific
notable collaborative project with the librarian to be suggested as well. I am grateful that
the librarians referred me to such a diverse range of teachers: tone of the teachers taught
third grade, five teachers taught second grade, one teacher interviewed taught first grade,
and five teachers taught kindergarten. In addition to the classroom teachers, I also
engaged specialist area teachers at two of the schools as well including one innovation
lab teacher and one art teacher, both of whom had experience collaborating with school
librarians in roles to either design and create projects related to characters in a book, or to
visually represent their thinking and synthesis of knowledge about something related to
the library program. The school leaders that I interviewed also had a range of leadership
responsibilities. Two lower school division heads were interviewed, one head of school,
and one assistant head of school who had direct supervision of and who worked closely
on the library team as a thought partner. Table 2 provides an overview of the interview
data I collected from the participants in this study.

I asked every participant to review and sign a consent form (see Appendix B) and will
explained my research timeline and methods. I shared my interview protocol questions
ahead of our interviews, and then began the data collection. I de-identfied my notes and
used pseudonyms in my fieldnotes so that my research participants could remain
protected by confidentiality in all of my data. In the next section, I detail the steps taken
during data collection at each of the four sites, including a rationale for how I sequenced
the data collection and the interview protocol for the individual interviews.

Data Collection
The majority of my data was collected over the course of four days in May 2016.
I spent one full school day at each of the four sites and conducted observations, held
individual interviews, and collected archival data to review. Four of the individual
interviews were completed over the telephone when I returned to Washington, D.C. and
were not able to be done at the site because of schedule conflicts and my compressed and
restricted research timeline. This timeline was restricted not because of the participants,
but rather because I work and live in Washington, D.C. In the next sections, I describe
the sequencing of my data collection and how each qualitative method helped me to
gather data helpful in beginning to answer my overall research questions.
Sequence of Data Collection. I used Ravitch and Carl’s (2016) work on
sequencing methods to guide the sequence of my data collection. Ravitch and Carl
(2016) suggest that the sequencing of methods should be strategic, and further propose
41

that the intentional design of a research study is “an important component of validity” (p.
103). Therefore, the data collection plan for my qualitative study began with immersing
myself in the library space itself. I observed library classes with students for a minimum
of 45 minutes, and in between classes either conducted an interview or observed other
students, parents or teachers using the space. I also used the time in between observations
to tour the school with a school librarian so I could see teachers’ classrooms and get a
better sense of the overall teaching and learning culture at each site. These tours proved
to be very helpful, and I spent time after each visit making additional notes and writing
memos to capture my thinking about the tours as well. Before leaving each site, and at
different times throughout my site visit, I collected artifacts and archival data that I could
review and analyze when I returned to Washington, D.C. I elaborate on each method
used during this study to collect data in the next sections.
Observations and Fieldnotes. At each site I observed the library space while it
was in use by students, librarians, parents, and teachers. Typically I arrived at the school
near eight o’clock in the morning, and left before or around the school’s regular dismissal
time. Spending the full day at each site allowed me to research the library dynamics
including how librarians, teachers, parents and student use of the space. I was a
researcher doing fieldwork and observing the library in order to focus in on how the
activities and interactions within the library gave meaning to my overall research
questions and interest in multiple literacy skill development in children just beginning to
learn how to read. I created a template to help organizing my jottings at each school
(Appendix C), as suggested by Creswell (2012) and Emerson et al. (2011) that
42

specifically incorporate description, dialogue, and characterizations that enabled me as
the researcher “to coherently depict an observed moment through striking details”
(Emerson et al., p. 57). I turned my jottings into fieldnotes after each site visit and wrote
memos throughout the week to more descriptively capture what I was thinking and
feeling. Observing each site first hand and writing about the experience proved to be
helpful when I later reviewed the data collected from my individual interviews.
Being present in the library space as a researcher allowed me to later compare my
thinking about what I saw and experienced in myself with what my participants said and
described during my individual interviews and with what archival data I was able to
review. I wanted to capture as much of the school library environment as possible in a
way that was accurate, holistic, and offered a unique perspective of the space from
someone who was not a community stakeholder already. Some of the data that led me to
discover my first set of codes actually came from my fieldnotes and researcher memos.
Photographs. The copious amount of pictures I was able to take of the library
space when it was empty of students and teachers was an important part of my data
collection at each site as well. Photographs capture the essence of large spaces that a
jotting cannot, and they are also rich sources of data that I can reflect back on and analyze
during my coding process. I took pictures of all aspects of the space: the furniture,
shelving, book displays, evidence of technology, window space, seating areas, and
common learning spaces within the library as well. However; I relied on my jottings
only—not photographs—to capture the activities and interactions of children with the
space. Jotting about the interactions between students and the library space protected the
43

identity of the students. Finally, I also sketched and jotted notes to describe and outline
the floorplan of each site from a bird’s eye view of the library. Later in the data analysis
phase I had a graphic artist cross reference my sketches with the photographs I took for
each library space in order to create the library layouts included in the previous chapter.
Individual Interviews. Maxwell (2013) notes that “your research questions
formulate what you want to understand; your interview questions are what you ask people
to gain that understanding” (p. 101). I shared my research questions electronically with
each participant ahead of my visit and also printed copies of the questions again for the
face to face interviews. The interviews were semi-structured so that the interview felt
more like a conversation rather than an interrogation, a distinction that Rubin and Rubin
(2012) make clear is sometimes an unintended consequence for researchers unpracticed
in the art of interviewing. Using my interview protocol and being sensitive to the
interviewee was important to me as a guest at each school, and so I entered each
interview intentionally trying to engage respectfully with each participant. I did not
anticipate every interview to be the same and therefore employed the flexible questioning
strategies also suggested by Rubin and Rubin (2012) to change the interview questions
when the conversation is directed in a valuable but unexpected direction.

Below is a

table that outlines the individual interviews at each of my four research sites based on my
purposeful sampling strategy. I used Creswell’s (2012) Qualitative Inquiry Tools to
identify a sampling group for this study with the goal of interviewing a total of 24
participants, digitally recording each interview using my iPad which was password
protected. The length of the interviews ranged, with the school leader and teacher
44

interviews being the shortest and averaging 30 minutes, and the school librarian
interviews ranging between 45 minutes to one hour. I introduce myself and review the
goals of this study, I will also ask my interviewees to self-select a name for me to use in
the transcripts to replace their real names. I attempted to develop some “easy” questions
and some “tough” questions as Rubin and Rubin (2012) suggest, and have sequenced
similar but not exactly the same questions for each of the participant groups in Appendix
D.
I sought to create positive interview rapport that was not threatening or
interrogative, another suggestion by Rubin and Rubin (2012) in a responsive interviewing
model which encourages the interviewer to adopt a “friendly and supportive tone” (p.
38). For this reason, I conducted semi-structured and responsive interviews so that the
interview felt more like a conversation as Rubin and Rubin (2012) suggest. I followed
the authors’ (2012) recommendation to reconsider my positionality before the interview
begins, as well as their suggestions on ethical responsibilities as a researcher interviewing
participants. I considered my positionality is as an outsider to the school, as a researcher,
and as a colleague in independent school leadership before conducted in interview. I truly
intended to be mindful of each participant’s generosity allowing me to interview them,
and wanted to ensure my participants were comfortable with me and that we had a good
rapport. I did my best to establish a trustworthy and positive rapport with them and to
make sure they were comfortable with my research process since independent schools are
rarely studied; my former colleagues and I in the School District of Philadelphia were
comfortable around researchers and during research interviews because the District
45

frequently engaged in scholarly studies. Moreover, as an independent school leader
myself, I wanted to also be precise and careful when explaining that the purpose of my
research was not to tattle or report on any information they share, but rather to make
independent school libraries as a whole better tailored to meet the needs of the students
that we serve.
After each interview, I had each audio file transcribed by an online transcription
service called Rev. I maintain confidentiality with this third party by only using the
pseudonym of each school and participant during the interview process. I cleaned the
data as much as possible, checking for sections of the data that need to be clarified. Each
participant was interviewed once, however I revisited the transcripts and goals of my
study with each participant during my member checks. I conducted these member checks
over the telephone and sent the cleaned transcript excepts via email in advance of our
call. I used the time together during these member checks to also solicit feedback from
the participant on their transcription or thoughts after the interview. Maxwell (2013)
suggests that these member checks are “the single most important way of ruling out the
possibility of misinterpreting the meaning of what participants say and do, and the
perspectives that they have on what is going on” (p. 126-127).
The positive interview rapport felt easy to create with the kindness and patience
that each participant had with me. I was taken aback that every school librarian thanked
me after each interview, all expressing an appreciation for an educator to take a deep look
at the work they have dedicated their professional lives too. Receiving their heartfelt

46

thanks was humbling, and I too felt as though each interview with the school librarians
changed the way I was thinking about their great work and role in schools as well.
Document and Archival Data. The final method by which I collected data was
through document and archival data. I prepared to “spend considerable time identifying,
collecting, organizing, reviewing, and analyzing all relevant documents that contextualize
and relate” to my study as Ravitch and Carl (2016) suggest (p. 171). I asked each
librarian to provide any material or resources separate from the school’s website that I
could use to better understand the role and function of the school library at each site.
Ravitch and Carl (2016) also highlight an important difference in document and archival
data, dividing it into three separate categories: personal, official, and popular culture
documents (Ravitch & Carl, 2016). I collected official documents that include artifacts
from each school’s website, mission statements, position descriptions, photographs,
school magazines and even one faculty survey that the librarian at Country Day had
administered.
Memos. One of the greatest assets to me during my pilot study (on a completely
unrelated research topic) were the researcher memos that I wrote after each interview and
observation. I was surprised at how helpful the memos were to me when I began the
coding process, and I was grateful to have documentation that captured my lines of
thinking and impressions in those data-filled moments that could have easily been
forgotten had it not been for my memo writing. I anticipated having a much larger data
set to process and analysis for this dissertation, so I was diligent in writing descriptive
memos to chronicle my thinking I collected my data but also so I could remember details
47

and descriptions of events as I moved toward my analysis. Miles et al. (2014) describes
“streams” of thoughts that emerge as researchers look horizontally across data sets.
Maxwell (2013) builds upon this notion of capturing streams to suggest that researchers
write memos in order to facilitate the analysis of data (p. 105). The memos help me to
make sense of my initial emic and etic responses to the data and were helpful in
developing a clearer picture of how school libraries help young learners develop multiple
literacy skills. The memos were also helpful to me in reflecting on my own positionality
and validity as the researcher throughout the research process. Maxwell (2013) notes that
“there is no single or correct way for doing qualitative analysis” but that each strategy
needs to be planned in order to address issues of validity and to consider how my role has
potentially impacted the data collection (p. 105).
Data Analysis
Creswell (2013) describes six phases of qualitative data analysis: data
management and organizing, reading and memoing, describing, classifying, interpreting
and then representing. My analysis began while I was organizing my data and writing
my fieldnotes and researcher memos. Managing the data was difficult at first as I had so
many electronic files and paper resources that classifying and organizing each unit was
tedious but necessary. I stored all of my electronic data using a secure DropBox account
that required my password, including data transcripts, school letters of support, and the
electronically signed consent forms. I then used Atas.ti qualitative data management
software to begin classifying and combining data to refine my codes. In the next

48

sections, I will discuss how I used thematic analysis to develop my initial codes sets, and
will reflect on how I began to interpret the data to develop into this study’s findings.
Thematic Analysis
Miles et al. (2014) note that “findings are more dependable when they can be
buttressed from several independent sources” and that they are valid “when they are
confirmed by more than one data collection instrument measuring the same thing” (p.
307). I triangulated the data collected from the individual interviews, observations and
fieldnotes, my researcher memos, and each school’s document and archival data. I also
returned back to my research question, conceptual framework and literature review at the
beginning of my analysis in order to ensure that I was analyzing my data in relation to my
research questions and focus. I also strategized by reading and re-reading transcripts,
made metaphors in my mind, and worked with the words the participants used to develop
some initial themes. A function in Atlas.ti called Word Cruncher was particularly helpful
in helping to narrow in on frequently used words that I did not note on my own close
reading of the data. This specific function of the Atlas.ti reviews selected written files
and then parses out the most frequently used words. I selected all of the interview
transcript data, but excluded all of my fieldnotes and the faculty survey data. The most
frequently used words in the data once I removed articles, conjunctions, and parts of
speech are represented in Table 3.

This analysis of frequently used words in the interview transcripts was helpful in creating
categories of data and then connecting categories together in order to develop some
themes in the data. However, I had over 100 pictures to analyze as well, and numerous
archival data points too. In the next section, I address how I coded the pictures and
archival data and present my final code set.
Coding. The data sets I collected was larger in scope than even I had imagined,
and so refocusing back to my research questions and conceptual framework was critical
to honing in on important emerging themes. These codes will represent emergent themes
in my data. Ravitch and Carl (2016) note that coding is data analysis actually “begins
when you start organizing and thinking about your data” and so this process started while
I wrote my fieldnotes and memos, was iterative, took time, and required both inductive
and deductive approaches to forming my final code set. Ravitch and Carl (2016) further
clarify that inductive and deductive codes “are not mutually exclusive, and in many
studies, the strategic combination happens through” the iterative process of reading the
triangulated data (Ravitch & Carl, 2016, p. 249). I took both approaches with my data
analysis, and used Atlas.ti to code the interview transcripts, pictures, one short video, and
screenshots of the school websites and pictures taken of school magazine articles related
to each site. I counted the frequency of codes and factored in relationships among and
between the variables to build a logical chain of evidence to support my initial themes

50

(Creswell, 2007, p. 149). Table 4 represents my final code set that I used to ultimately
make contrasts and comparisons across the data to determine my overall findings.

Managing Data Analysis and Coding. The amount of data that I collected felt
overwhelming to analyze and code in its raw and cleaned form. I looked and tried
different ways to organize the data to analyze it by theme, mostly by drawing tables,
pictures and idea maps on the large dry erase wall at my site of practice. This helped me
to visually identify patterns that I could not have identified scrolling through text digitally
through Atlas.ti, however; I did rely on the software program to analyze the photographs.
I uploaded all of the photographs and then reduced the number down by deleting images
that were near duplicates, or that contained the same images of the library space but from
different angles. The Atlas.ti software allowed me to highlight and applied code to parts
of the photographs just as it did for coding parts of the text. This feature allowed me then
to run a report on a specific code with the yielded results being in both text and
photograph format. Reading on to the next chapters that describe my findings and
referring back to Table 4 will likely substantiate the broad range of data that I collected
during this study. There are many codes that I developed and placed into themes that did
not make it into the findings not because they were not important or interesting, but rather
I narrowed the scope of my findings to what answered and explained the phenomena
nestled into my research questions.

Validity
Maxwell (2005) asserts that “validity threats are made implausible by evidence,
not methods; methods are only a way of getting evidence that can help you rule out these
threats” (p. 105). One of the major responsibilities that I have in my current position is to
reimagine the library space, designing it into an innovative library space for students in
grades pre-kindergarten through third grade. My overall goal for this study was to have a
list of characteristics of compelling library spaces that included elements of design, but
literacy connections between student, librarians, and teachers as well. This aspect of my
own professional work was important to consider when I thought about my positionality
as an outside researcher engaged in practitioner research. None of the sites that I selected
are competitor schools to the school in which I work which assuaged some of the
pressure I felt going into the research.
Libraries, in a phenomenon that I hoped to better understand through this study,
hold an incredible amount of emotionally charged memories for people. This made me
even more eager to begin the interview process so that I could better understand just what
makes library spaces so compelling for people. My own researcher bias factors into this
study as well. For example, I often wonder if I have underestimated the amount of joy
that others cull from reading books. Does everyone enjoy reading as much as I do?
Reading is undoubtedly one of my favorite pastimes, and a cozy space with a lot of books
surrounding me sounds like a place I want to be. Perhaps we all have fond memories of
studying in library spaces amid tangible sources of knowledge, memories that some of us
are not quite yet ready to let go of in order to surrender a coveted space’s purpose for the
57

potential of what could be, or what it should be in the twenty-first century. I myself
value the solitude that a quiet library space of paper books brings when I am absorbed in
and completely silent in the space. Thinking about a school “library” in the image that I
have constructed via my own experience brings positive feelings of nostalgia and
comfort. Holding that thought and replacing it with the image of a space overtaken by
robots and speakers, or clacks from keyboards and the hum of students collaborating on
projects certainly adulterates both my senses and my fond memories. I tried to approach
my data collection and analysis from a neutral and truly inquisitive stance.
Critical Friends Inquiry Group. One way I monitored the initial stage of
analysis to ensure validity was engaging with an inquiry group comprised of six critical
friends. We followed the protocols outlined and designed by Harill and Belzer (1998) to
design the inquiry rounds, and used Harrill’s (2001) system of collaborative sharing data
to take some of the data I had already coded and critically review it to help me uncover
any bias I had while also giving me new insights into my data from six completely
different points of view.
First, I provided supporting documents that put my study in context for the
inquiry group. I included my research abstract, research questions, methods of data
collection and also excerpts of my data. Next, the group focused on the data excerpts I
provided and the overall question that I posed of “How do these librarians perceive their
role?” Each inquiry group member then reviewed the data excerpts with the focus
question in mind, and asked any clarifying questions. After I answered all of their
questions, I asked the group to reflect on the word “curator” and to describe or define it in
58

their own words. Finally, the group reviewed the data excerpts with me in five different
rounds, with each group member commenting on the following:


Round 1: What stands out for you in this data?



Round 2: Text rendering. Each group member chose a section of the
excerpted data and read along a segment of the text in which the librarian
was speaking about her or his role.



Round 3: Text rendering again. Each group member chose a section of
the excerpted data and read aloud a segment of the text in which the
librarian was speaking about her or his role in meaning making for the
students.



Round 4: Paraphrase. Each group member chose, read aloud, and then
paraphrased a segment of the text in which the librarian was speaking
about his or her role in meaning-making for the students.



Round 5: Summary. Each group member concluded their inquiry by
suggesting questions or concepts that needed further clarity on my part but
from their point of view. Group members also made recommendations for
me as I continued my analysis.

Overall, this inquiry group was an incredibly helpful in validating what progress I had
made in the data analysis process, and helped me mentally take a step away from the data
to look at it from six trusted peers’ perspectives. The group was an important turning
point for me in my analysis because it propelled me out of the descriptive rut I had been
stuck in, launching me into writing about my findings confidentially.

CHAPTER 4
SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHAPE AND UNITE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES

I entered this study intending to focus on the use of the library spaces by students
in the early childhood grades, and it was impossible to begin my data analysis to better
understand how students use the space to develop multiple literacies before I
acknowledged how and why the design of the space afforded such deep, individualized
experiences for each of the school stakeholders. Each school library in this study was a
coveted place to gather for students, teachers, school administrators, and parents. This
chapter presents the synthesis of data revealing how school libraries build and influence
school culture. First I uncover the transformative influence school librarians have in
positively impacting school culture around teaching and learning, most notably curating
relationships with teachers that are steeped in collaboration and trust, and curating
relationships with students that open the pathways to experiences that shape multiple
literacy skill development and even identity. In further analysis, I explain the balance the
library space serves for early childhood educators charged with teaching students how to
read with the role of school librarians in shaping a young reader’s identity through
imagination and curious exploration. Finally, I examine the aspects of the library space
that identify it as uniquely suited to build and serve community ideals and values, further
attempting to capture the images of safety and even spiritual sanctuary that some school
stakeholders described of their school’s library.

60

School Librarians Serve as “Curators of School Community”
Space value is a concept that I developed from the data to describe how and why
each school library that I visited was such a frequently used place by all school
stakeholders. It is the idea that a space in a school has the ability to attract members of
the school community to use it beyond its original or intended purpose. The concept
applied to this research seeks to capture the allure of what motivates students, teachers,
families, and other community members to seek the library space to enjoy even when
other spaces, sometimes even more accommodating spaces, are available. The school
library at each institution in this study was a busy and bustling place, and certainly a
sharp contrast to the myth of quiet and empty libraries often perpetuated in stories today.
Rather, the libraries in this study were coveted spaces that actually were vibrant centers
of learning and communing together not just for students but for teachers and parents as
well. Indeed, the dominant factor influencing the space value of each library in this study
were the librarians themselves.
The findings emphasize how important of a role school librarians play within the
greater context of the school community, a role through which they became curators of
knowledge, information and ideas for students, teachers and school leaders. Librarians
also capitalized on their unique physical spaces by creating an atmosphere of nonjudgement for students, teachers and parents as well. By ensuring that the diversity of
each school communities’ students and families were represented in the libraries’
collections and by establishing a safe space to explore and expand ideas, school librarians
61

cultivated deep relationships that extended beyond the typical colleague-to-colleague or
teacher-to-student relationship dynamic. The ability to create and establish such
powerful relationships within and beyond the school made the librarians’ role one that
held tremendous power in shaping attitudes about the school’s culture on teaching and
learning, and thus was an undeniably respected position amongst community members.
In addition to constructing strong relational connections with school community
members, librarians also had the unique role of nurturing what some participants referred
to as a student’s “reading identity.” Hall’s (2005, 2012) research on this concept of a
student’s identity as a reader defines the term in the context of classroom teachers but
was interestingly incorporated into the librarians’ self-perceptions. According to Hall
(2012) the term reading identity refers to how capable individuals believe they are in
comprehending texts, the value they place on reading and their understandings of what it
means to be a particular type of reader” in the classroom. In this context, librarians
identified a new perspective on Hall’s (2012) definition of reading identity to include
identifying which stories and characters a student is interested in reading. Both Hall’s
(2005, 2012) scholarship exploring “reading identity” and the librarians’ added insights
on this concept are important to this study because librarians noticed that helping students
to develop their own identities are readers was critical to their overall literacy
development. Research by Duke, Purcell-Gates, Hall, and Tower (2006) confirm this
insight by the librarians in a study that included second grade students engaging in
literacy activities based in children’s literature. Duke et al.’s (2006) findings suggest that
a necessary prerequisite for early elementary students to begin their trajectory into
62

reading and writing pathways was to have a reading identity established. In the context
of this study, the concept of reading identity highlights the unique finding that teachers
relied on librarians to understand each student’s individual profile of reading likes and
dislikes and then to share that information with them in partnership in order to develop
both skillful and avid readers. This finding also revealed that librarians curated books for
children based on their past interests, curiosities, and learning. This is important to
understand within the context of an early childhood classroom teacher’s role as the
teacher of reading skills; while classroom teachers heavily focused on developing the
skills necessary to develop fluency and comprehensions skills in students, librarians
balanced the rigor of reading instruction by opening the pathway for students to
appreciate literature and to develop a love of reading. In this way, librarians held a
unique role as “curators” as opposed to reading instructors, deepening the pathways to
reading for students by making their library spaces intellectually safe playgrounds for the
curious and developing minds of young children.
The etymology of the word “curator” begins in the late fourteenth century with
the verb curare meaning “to take care of” while the noun curatus means “one responsible
for the care of souls” (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2016). In modern day, a curator is a
defined as “one who has the care and superintendence of something” (Online Etymology
Dictionary, 2016). Gabriel’s insight, presented in this chapter, that his school library was
“an almost spiritual place” invokes an image of safety and sanctuary. School librarians in
this study were curators of more than resources, and there were distinguishable aspects of
their craft that enabled them to build meaningful relationships that further opened the
63

doors to collaboration, inquiry, and creativity with their colleagues and students. This
section focuses on the role of school librarians as curators that develop relationships to
shape school culture surrounding teaching and learning

Curating Relationships to Shape Teaching and Learning
The school librarians were the first and the most important factor influencing a
library’s space value in this study. Specifically, the librarians’ affect on the teaching and
learning culture of each school emerged as a distinctly influential role in shaping multiple
literacy skills in individualized learning trajectories for students, and collaborative
relationships that were non-judgmental with colleagues and families. In this way,
librarians curated not just items for the library collection, but relationships with
community stakeholders as well. Teachers and school leaders consistently identified
school librarians as invaluable assets to the school community because of their ability to
build deep and meaningful relationships with students and with colleagues.
Deep relationships in the context of this study were those that were steeped in
trust and respect, but that did not necessarily take years to develop. For example, Dawn,
the Head of School from Country Day, described Shannon’s role as invaluable to the
school community in her ability to relate to students across the school’s pre-kindergarten
through eighth grade classes, but also through her ability to collaborate with teachers in a
meaningful way that supported and enhanced their instruction and that, in Dawn’s view,
consequently benefitted each child’s learning. Dawn described Shannon as “irresistible”
in the sense that she “instantly” appealed to teachers as a desirable and respected resource
64

when it came to researching topics for classroom projects, supporting curricular work by
culling a selection of books to support their teaching and to benefit student learning
(Dawn, Interview, May 11, 2016). From Shannon’s point of view, she intentionally set
forth to begin making trusted relationships with teachers by inquiring about their
classroom curricular work, and by supporting their instructional content with read alouds
and book displays in the library.
Dawn also cited a survey Shannon created as one of the pivotal examples of
outreach to the faculty that made a strong first impression, and also included that
Shannon was one of the first faculty members to also survey the students to ask what
their impressions were of the library as well. The impact on teaching and learning that
Shannon’s approach to collaborating with teachers and including students in her
professional work impressed Dawn, but also other teachers. Dawn fondly recalled an
example of a lower school teacher who sought Shannon out to collaborate on research
projects every year so that “she could up her game” as a teacher, sharing further that the
student engagement that she and Shannon were able to promote together surpassed that
which she could have established alone in the classroom and of which led to deeper
student engagement with the content material. Dawn noted that Shannon’s impact as a
shaper of teaching and learning culture furthermore by remarking that “she is beloved
and respected by everyone” in the school community. By extending invitations to
collaborate with teachers and by serving as “the steward of the shared space” within the
school, Shannon was able to “know every child in the school,” every teacher, and many

65

parents on a personal level that transcended traditional classroom conversations and
engagement (Dawn, Interview, May 11, 2016).
Anne, a first grade teacher from William Penn, shed light on a different aspect of
the school librarians’ influential position as one who curates special and unique
relationships with colleagues. In this example, Anne specifically places William Penn’s
school librarians opposite from that of the role of early childhood educators charged with
teaching students how to read. She noted that in more than one instance, the lead librarian
named Allayna “stuffed” her school mailbox in the faculty room with books that she
knew Anne and her students would enjoy and that related specifically to the topic being
studied in her class. This outreach by Allayna to Anne was at first an unexpected support
but one that she grew to be grateful for as she discovered that the students she was
teaching how to read needed picture books and unlevelled readers to explore for no other
reason than just to enjoy and imagine. This example of curation led to the two colleagues
developing a deep bond steeped in appreciation and trust, but that also inspired Anne to
utilize the library space more frequently so that her students could feel “unconfined”
physically and intellectually in a larger, grander space (Anne, Interview, May 13, 2016).
Bringing students to the larger library space also afforded them an opportunity to browse
titles and books that they did not have access to in the classroom’s levelled library which
is instructionally designed and curated to support the reading ability and “levelled”
ranges of students. In this way, Anne’s saw herself as a reading teacher that taught
students how to read, but saw Allayna’s role as providing the safety, space, and guidance
for students to learn how to love reading. This relationship began because Allayna
66

voluntarily pulled a few books that she believed Anne and her students would enjoy
based on a casual and unstructured conversation, and it led Anne to think more
reflectively about her approach to teaching reading, ultimately coming to the conclusion
that her school librarians were there to help support her instruction and to support her
students’ appetite for reading and imaginations in ways that she herself could not.
Librarians initiating collaboration with teachers as a pathway to building trust and
respect in each school community was a consistent finding across the participant
interviews, and so was the context in which the relationships began: unstructured
conversation and collaboration. Sidney from NES explained this point best when she
described how she and her two librarian colleagues cultivated relationships with teachers
by “reaching out” to them in ways that were “less structural and more relational,” noting
further that she and her librarian colleagues did not wait to attend teacher planning
meetings but rather preferred to “jump” into classrooms to see where they could support,
or to have conversations while teachers assisted them during the library check-out time
with their students (Sidney, Interview, May 9, 2016). She explained:
…Actually getting in the rooms is great, it just changes the relationship.
So I'd like to do more of that and say. "I noticed this. Maybe I could help
with that." I think [the librarian’s work is about] building relationships so
people can trust that we're going to be a help and not somebody who's just
trying to get their own agenda across. (Sidney, Interview, May 9, 2016)
Sidney’s view on developing relationships with teachers based in their classroom
contexts by visiting rather than scheduling a formal planning meeting resonated within
each librarian’s narrative. Being able to access teachers’ classrooms to see what students
are learning inspired the librarians to curate book lists and book stacks to share with
teachers in an overall effort to support instruction. Librarians learning alongside teachers
67

and being willing supporters helped to build trust and also proved to the teachers that
librarians were safe colleagues to lean on for support. In fact, Elaine from Crestwood
Academy illuminated this finding in a different light when she described some of the
most trusted and respected relationships that she has with teachers steeped in the act of
failing together.
Crestwood Academy’s mission is lived out in the library as Elaine works to have
the boys think of themselves as problem solvers and critical thinkers, an intellectual
attribution she noted was contrary to how previous generations of children who are now
teachers were raised. While speaking about what was most rewarding for her in the role
of lower school librarian, she discussed how failing with a colleague made them both
better teachers and impacted the learning of her students that made them more resilient
and which cultivate perseverance. Elaine’s library team collaborates with the
“labrarians” in the school’s new innovation lab, and her role in the innovation process is
to help students research topics in order to inform their imaginative solutions to
problems. Working closely with her colleagues and failing together was not a negative
experience, but rather a positive one that had tremendous power to shape not just her and
her colleagues teaching, but students’ learning as well. She said:
The relationships with other teachers, they are also rewarding ... It’s
incredibly rewarding to work with a teacher and fall flat on our face so
that we can work together to change the learning or change the experience
for boys. Often, the failure that we feel, the boys don't feel at all, they're
still plugging along... I don't like saying that but they're so much more
resilient than we are, that we can really take it to heart in a way. I love
failing with another teacher so that we can figure it out [together]. (Elaine,
Interview, May 10, 2016)

68

Failure is not always a negative experience to Elaine, nor to the other teachers and
students at Crestwood Academy. In this way, Elaine’s security in failing together
reframes the traditional teaching and learning dynamic to one that views failure as
necessary to build resilience, trust and fueled curiosity rather than one to be avoided
because it breeds feelings defeat and disappointment. Elaine’s ability to influence the
boys’ attitude about learning was also evident in her explanation about what she herself
learns from students when she engages them during check-out time towards the end of
the library class. By engaging the boys in discussions about different books and different
genres, she encourages them to take risks and to try something new in order to expand
their ideas outside of what they already know or find comfortable. In this way, she also
extended the invitation to check-out time to the students’ teachers as she realized that
their instruction and relationships with students could also be influenced by simply
observation an unstructured part of the library class routine:
…we talk more about the idea of taking risks and trying something new
[during check-out]. In those conversations, it's pretty fascinating to see
who are the risk-takers and who aren't. Watching during check out ... I sort
of beg the faculty to come during check out because you're learning so
much about risk taking, exploration, initiative and pattern making. I think
check out is incredibly fascinating. I get to have a conversation with
everybody who comes to the desk and say, "Why'd you pick this," and,
"Here it is again, looks like the ..." Because we do talk about what you
find today, and how did you get there? Plus, I'm with them from pre-K to
fourth grade so that helps me know them for very long… (Elaine,
Interview, May 10, 2016)
Taking risks often requires an element of trust, and Elaine’s comments about what
happens during check out time speaks to the influence she has to encourage boys to take
risks as readers, and to explore. However, she also noticed that the check-out time is a
valuable time in her own class to invite teachers in to observe and learn a new side of
69

students that could potentially impact their own relationships with their students and
influence their teaching. Elaine went on to synthesize how she and her librarian team
help to influence a positive teaching and learning culture at the school:
As we talk about the pre-k to nine spectrum and what we have the luxury
of doing in the space with the three of us [librarians]…we just keep
coming back to [supporting] faculty so that they can support the boys in
whatever inquiry or creation they're involved in. (Elaine, Interview, May
10, 2016)
While Elaine is the only lower school librarian working to support lower school faculty,
she collaborates with her team to make a greater impact on the entire school community.
Her library space was not a place where students went to mindlessly wander around the
library, but rather a space that they were encouraged to take risks as learners and readers,
and a space where they saw their own adult teacher try something and fail only to try
again and again. In this way, Elaine was a model for teachers and students and had
tremendous power to influence the teaching and learning culture at Crestwood Academy.
In a similar light, school leaders viewed the ability of librarians to shape school culture
on teaching and learning through the lens of space and emotion. All four school leaders
either explicitly stated or referred to the school library as the “heartbeat of the school” or
the “heart” of the school—an image that conjures an emotional attachment of love,
acceptance, and safety. It is not surprising then that librarians working in the school’s
“heart” have the influence to positively impact the attitudes and dispositions of both
teachers and students.
Librarians in this study influenced teachers and students first by initiating a
connection or collaboration intended to support their teaching or learning, but then by
cultivating that relationship through unstructured or causal conversation unconfined by
70

formal meeting places or strict lesson plans that resulted in trust and respect. These
relationships were not necessarily built over long periods of time as most relationships
are, but rather happened quickly and grew with increased collaboration with teachers and
conversations with students. School stakeholders relied on librarians to provide safe and
non-judgmental spaces where community members could go in order to expand their
minds, to be curious, and to take risks. Teachers collaborated with librarians to enhance
their instruction and curriculum, and students sought libraries as spaces that they could go
to explore ideas and information not confined or limited to their levelled classroom
libraries. Dawn captured the collective magic of these dynamic relationships when she
enthusiastically shared why she believed her faculty and the students enjoyed the library
so much:
“Librarians don’t give grades, they’re not evaluative, they don’t give
tests… I mean think about it— in many ways you go and get to be your
true self in the library. If you decide that you don’t want to read fiction or
that you’re only into war heroes… unapologetically you get to say ‘this is
who I am and this is what I want to read and you know that no one is
going to make a judgement on you. If you want to read a steady diet of
Captain Underpants? Go right ahead! …Sometimes I think that when
towns close down their libraries that it’s like having a heart attack. I think
libraries are the same way. There shouldn’t be a checklist that says a
library has to have these things, but I do believe that there has to be a
center for information and inquiry that is legitimized and celebrated in a
school, and where people feel like the rules are different. In classrooms,
teachers assign things, but in libraries you’re in charge. The librarian is the
person you go to you if you have a question. It’s kind of like the Siri of a
school… I think if you don’t have a library then you’re saying something
about what you believe about the role of curiosity, about independent
choice and research, and about answering questions. I think [libraries] are
essential. (Dawn, Interview, May 11, 2016)
Dawn’s metaphor of libraries as the “Siri” of schools today conjures an image unique to
our digital age, and is a powerful statement connecting the concept of instant access to
71

information with the role of a school librarian. Her words inference the role of the
librarian as one in the school who essentially holds the keys that open the gates of
information and ideas for the learning community, a position that Dawn places in a realm
of respect. Undoubtedly, the member of the school community that functions as this
“curator of information and ideas” holds a position of authority that tacitly breathes life
into the school’s community of teaching a learning, or in Dawn’s words, legitimizes and
celebrates the culture of information and inquiry that schools promote and seek to instill.
Schools value inquiry and curiosity, and the school librarians know how to give access to
ideas and information to members of the community. In this way, librarians had the
shaped the teaching and learning of a school community through the curriculum. Yet
curriculum was just one dimension of the teaching and learning community impacted by
librarians. In the next section, I explain how librarians were able to compliment and
balance the students’ literacy development by helping to foster a love of reading and
reader identity.
Identity Curators to Balance the Rigor of Early Literacy Instruction. While
school librarians collaborated with teachers to enhance their instruction with information
relevant to student learning, teachers also depended on librarians to support the
development of each students’ identity as readers. My time at each school, analysis of
interview transcripts, and personal experiences as a teacher led to me to discover that
librarians serving early childhood students have a unique role that is very different from
their role in serving older students. From my personal experiences as a teacher I can
attest to a tension between wanting to teach literature appreciation to young students and
72

wanting to develop sound fluency skills as readers. This tension does not exist in middle
school or high school classrooms typically, as students reaching that developmental stage
of adolescence and young adulthood have acquired the reading strategies and skills that
make them fluent readers. However; in the early childhood classroom that tension is real,
and it is mitigated by the school librarian.
Early childhood and early literacy instruction focuses on developing the skills
readers need to be able to read functionally and fluently. Richardson (2009) explains that
“reading is more than blending sounds together to make words. It is a complex network
of strategies and behaviors the brain uses to make sense of print.” The complexity of
reading as a task required of the brain is “miraculous,” as cognitive neuroscientist and
reading specialist Maryanne Wolf (2008) in her scholarly work on the science of reading
and reading disabilities (Wolf, 2008). Thus the primary aim of literacy instruction in
early childhood contexts is not to establish a love of reading, but rather to establish the
basic phonological and linguistic principles of our English language so that students will
be able to comprehend what they read (Richardson, 2016). This foundation in literacy
acquisition is necessary in order for students to then engage with the content of books and
the written language, an engagement that leads to the next phase of reading: fluency.
Fluency is the concept in reading instruction that broadly encompasses the ability for
students to understand what they read. Elements of reading fluency include a student’s
ability to self-monitor for meaning, predict, infer, sequence, synthesize, analyze
characters and themes, and also to make connections between what they are reading to
themselves, other texts, and the world around them (Keene & Zimmerman, 2007).
73

Fluency also denotes that a child is able to read aloud with expressive prosody in order to
convey meaning of the text from which he or she is reading. A student’s ability to read
fluently does not engender a love of reading. Rather, cultivating reading habits in
children that incline them to read often and frequently, and that allows the freedom to
engage with the written word in ways that liberates ideas and wonderings in their minds
does engender a love of reading. When I analyzed the interview transcripts from the
teachers first and then the librarians, two very clear yet separate narratives emerged. The
gap between learning to read and learning to love reading identified the librarians as a
critical partner in helping early childhood teachers compliment intense instructions, and
helped schools to balance their overall work to develop a strong community of reading
students.
Teachers in the early childhood grades relied on the school librarian to help give
students access to characters, genres, and books that students were not innately inclined
to choose themselves and that teachers were not positioned to teach based on their
explicit roles as reading skill and strategy instructors. In this way, librarians serving the
early childhood grades approached their work differently compared to their work with
older students. They held a unique role in understanding a student’s emerging reading
profile of likes, dislikes, and in suggesting options to students that they felt could deepen
the pathways to reading in the intellectually safe and accepting space of the library. The
American Association of School Libraries (AASL) identifies this trait of librarianship as
“reader’s advisory” (AASL.org, 2016) however; the school librarians in this study went
beyond just interviewing students about their likes and dislikes. First, the school
74

librarians developed positive relationships with students and then carefully curated book
titles to match the students’ interests and needs as a developing reader. As Elaine
mentioned in the previous section, if she did not connect students with a book that they
were individually and personally interested in, then that disconnection had the
devastating potential to close off a pathway to reading that would have negative impact a
student’s literacy development and acquisition of fluency. Elaine’s insight here leads
into another view by Sidney who suggested that librarians were “matchmakers” between
students and books that enhanced the student’s reading repertoire beyond the classroom
library collection of levelled readers.
The image of the librarian as a matchmaker inspired Sidney from NES so much
that she explained that it is in fact what brought her the greatest delight in her
librarianship. She discussed how important relationships are, and how critical it is to
know students as scholars in the classroom and as young, imaginative wonderers:
I think connecting kids to the right books or the matchmaking piece is one
of my favorite parts of [being a librarian]. Getting to know kids, so you
know what their thing is or what they might like to read next. I think being
a friendly face is also a part of it. We check students out by typing in their
last names to the system so over time you get to know the names of many,
many people. I don't have everybody yet, but I'm working on it. I think
supporting the interests of students is a huge part of it, getting them
excited about books. The best is when you get a kid who hasn't been that
into reading and then they discover their book that is maybe the first
they've been excited about in a long time. I think as far as working with
faculty and staff, it's a really fun challenge to have somebody say, "I need
books that connect with this time period," or, "That will help teach this!"
Gathering a pile of those books is really fulfilling. I love having
conversations with kids about books and showing my love for reading. I'd
say promoting love of reading is probably what [I enjoy most]. (Sidney,
Interview, May 9, 2016)

Sidney’s self-reflection exudes an element of comfort with her confession that being a
“friendly face” is an important factor when developing relationships with students. She
also identified her role as one that helps students connect to books and to know what
“their thing is or what they might like to read next” that can only happen when a positive
relationship is established and conversations about books are happening. Her quest to
know every student in the lower school is admirable, and further emphasizes just how
important she believes knowing students is to her success as a librarian. She also
perceives success as a librarian when she is able to connect teachers with books that
support their instruction or that will bolster students’ understanding of a topic.
“Gathering a pile” of books for students and teachers that introduces them to characters,
genres, and topics that they would have no knowledge of otherwise are fundamentally
rewarding for Sidney in her position as school librarian.
Sidney’s colleague Hannah had similar sentiments about her role as a school
librarian to match students with books that she believed they would enjoy based on her
relationships with students. She too, gathered piles of books to recommend to individual
students based on their known interests and past pleasurable reading experiences.
Hannah also spoke about the process through which student patrons “judge a book by its
cover” sometimes innocently as they are not yet able to read the title or back cover
synopsis, and other times because socially they have heard good or bad things about a
certain book:
The second graders give peer review critiques which is very cool. I think
that's a great way to find out a book. They judge a book by its cover and
they do the series. If I give them a book and firstly if it's not a new book,
they would just look at it. Unless I can really sell it. I can do that with
76

some of the books but not … They won't read them. I was just hoping that
this would be way to get them to read new books. I think my main thing is
to get them engaged in books, and to love them. I don't care what they
read. It's fine if they love this series but don’t love that series... They get
more involved in the story [when they are engaged with it]. It's a way of
becoming a more sophisticated reader. I realize [suggesting books] is hit
or miss…Also if they didn't really open it and read two chapters, they still
don't know whether it was book they would've liked. I don't know whether
they actually read them. I find that a challenge. I try to say, "It's just one
week and it's just a book. It's not like for death. You can read this, start it.
If you don't like it, bring it back. That's the end of that." It becomes very
important to them, what they check out. (Hannah, Interview, May 9,
2016).
Becoming a “more sophisticated reader” in Hannah’s happens when a student is deeply
engaged in a book that they enjoy. She initiates the first steps for students to embark
down that deep pathway of literacy development by suggesting books that students may
dismiss at first based on judgement and peer feedback. Her desire to “sell” a book to
student is benevolently veiled in the greater quest to expose students to new ideas and
genres that they may not ever naturally access themselves. She suggests that a challenge
blocking students from being risk-takers in their reading is sometimes the judgement
other students place on their peers during check out time. Shannon saw something
similar with her students:
I don't even know if [check-out] is competitive, but more of “this is my
identity, this is how I want to express my identity, this is who I want to
be.” Aspirational maybe? In some respects, [students are] their own
custodians. In the morning, they can check out whatever they want, and
there aren't really limits as to how many books they can borrow. If they
come with a stack of 12 books, you might have a little bit of a
conversation like, "I'm going to hold on to some of these, why don't you
take four books instead for today? These titles I know are still going to be
on the shelf in a couple of weeks, so get through those, and these will be
waiting for you, that's fine." There's negotiation there, but I try to make it
as open as possible… My big fear is that I don't want to accidentally start
playing God with their choices… Sometimes it is a book that hasn’t
circulated for a while, and I'm just thinking about it and trying to see if
77

there’s interest because it might not be discovered otherwise. (Shannon,
Interview, May 11, 2016)
Both Hannah and Shannon work to create judgement free space where students can be
intellectually curious and let their imaginations wander, and a threat of soured
relationships with students in the library is the potential judgement by peers at check-out
time. While both librarians worked to select books for students to expand their reading
repertoire, they did not force students to read specific genres or book titles either.
Maintaining positive student relationships and protecting the library as a space that is
judgment-free and safe was therefore more important than forcing a child to read a
certain book. A student’s individual autonomy to develop their own identity as readers
emerges in this excerpt from the data, too. In some ways, a child checking out 12 books
at a time is taking a personal stance on what he or she finds interesting. That stance can
be informed and encouraged by the librarian, but ultimately the Shannon and Hannah
realize that there is a limit to how much they are willing to impact a student’s choice in
reading.
Similarly, Elaine from Crestwood Academy also saw one her roles as getting to
know her students as readers. She specifically hoped that her role inspired boys to know
themselves as “readers and problem solvers” and she too alluded to the aspect of her role
that tries to “sell” books to students and teachers that they would not themselves select.
She also had profound insights into why the library as opposed to a classroom space is an
important element in developing fluency as readers. She said:
The fact that they want to be here is really important. They're not always
here to read, they're not always here to pick books. For some of them, as I
said, it's just a safe place. It's one of the few spaces in their day where they
can make their own choices fully. I think that's really important. Just not
78

be physical because for some boys, that is not a measure of their power
and the playground is definitely about motion and strength, physical
strength. For some boys, just having a space to relax and not have an
agenda other than enjoying if they choose what's on the shelves or just
enjoying their peers is really important. (Elaine, Interview, May 10, 2016)
Elaine’s insight into why her library is a safe space for students implies that there is a
tangible and attractive difference between the school library space and other classroom or
common area spaces in the school. From Elaine’s point of view the library is beloved
because it is a safe place where boys have individual autonomy and where they can
expand their minds without exerting the strength of their bodies. It was undeniable from
my observations or Elaine teaching and helping boys during check-out time that she had
tremendously positive relationships with students that allowed her to get to know their
interests and curiosities, and that also fostered a sense of safety amongst the boys that
made them seek the library over classroom or common areas to imagine and wonder.
School libraries are the intellectual playground of young minds, and librarians
have a key part in developing the intellectual curiosity and multiple literacy skill
development that students need in order to become fluent and avid readers. In this way,
each of the school libraries in this study were aptly given the reputation of being a safe,
inclusive, and inspiring space by all community stakeholders. The libraries in this study
emerged as the true “heart beat” of each school’s mission to foster curiosity and a love of
learning. The libraries position as a seat of inquiry, acceptance, intellectual and
emotional sanctuary coupled with the librarian’s pivotal role in shaping school culture
around teaching and learning are powerful reminders of why schools need libraries today.
Moreover, helping students to curate their own identity as readers outside of the
classroom highlights the important role of librarians serving early childhood students
79

especially; students in the early grades who are just learning to read depended on the
librarians to create and help carve out deeper pathways to explore multiple literacies in
ways that they were not afforded in their traditional classroom settings. In these ways,
librarians themselves were the dominant factor influencing the space value of each library
in this study. Adding to their unmistakable value is their ability to unite diverse school
community as well. Librarians in this study were agents of diversity and inclusivity,
equity advocates, and allies to the cause of helping young students to find their own
identity as readers and as young people; by carefully and thoughtfully curating their
collections to represent the social identity markers of the community, librarians were
critical to each school’s mission pursuit of social justice and equity.
Curating Equity through Critical Literacy: Librarians as Agents of Diversity
and Inclusivity. Shannon referred to the American Association of School Libraries’
stance on the role of the librarian to “help students and teachers to become effective users
of ideas and information” as she explained how she perceived her role while working
with teachers and students. All of the librarians in this study held similar views, and saw
one of their primary roles as curating books and information that supported the
curriculum within each grade level. However, the school librarians did not always
support the formal written curriculum of grade levels. Librarians shaped school culture
by teaching and advocating an unwritten curriculum of diversity and inclusivity, too.
This unwritten curriculum gave students a pathway to engage in children’s literature in a
way that they did not always have in the classroom where levelled readers and reading
skills were dominant; librarians intentionally curated books and designed lessons that
80

represented the culturally and socially diverse aspects of their students’ lives in order to
shape safe and comfortable pathways that young children could then explore themselves.
Educator and equity advocate Emily Style (1982) described why teaching with
text that represents the students in a particular school is important. She wrote that “half
of the curriculum walks in the door with the students in the textbook of their lives”
(Style, 1982, p. 1). A traditional approach to classroom instruction uses scholarship on
the shelves of classroom library to teach knowledge, but teachers must also recognize the
importance of shaping learning with the “scholarship in the selves” of students (Style,
2004). This is to say that some classrooms have an established curriculum introducing
concepts and themes that may or may not represent the “life-texts” of the students, and
that shifting pedagogy away from the text of the shelves to the text of the self is not
always second nature for teachers (Style, 2004). However, this was second nature to the
librarians in this study.
Early childhood classroom teachers tasked with growing fluent readers with direct
reading instruction often forfeit the ability to curate books that intentionally represent
their students’ lives. Yet the librarians in this study all saw this forfeiture as a critical
addition to their own instruction by intentionally curating, displaying, and sharing books
that represented the diversity within the school’s community. Rose explains her
collaborative approach to curating books that represent the “constellation” of families and
social identities of students with her colleague Allayna:
We hope that every child with every particular family constellation can
see themselves here in some way in the books that we read so that when I
am making my choices for what I'm reading to the kids I'm mindful of
that…. I think that things that I'm most proud of about our library is that I
81

do feel that every child can find themselves in a fiction book somewhere
in our library. For example, we just had a family visiting this morning that
was two white men, they clearly have adopted a child, because they asked
"Do you have books about adoptive families?", and we have many, many,
many. I feel that we have worked really hard, and Allayna and I both,
when we're out and about in the world, we look at books with the eye to
"Can we improve our collection by having this book that shows these
kinds of kids?" (Rose, Interview, May 13, 2016)
Rose’s narration of how she and Allayna look for books with a certain “eye” towards
curating a collection that represents the students and families at William Penn is a unique
role that the librarians assume that was starkly different from how teachers explained
they curated their classroom libraries. Classroom teachers were tasked with teaching
reading to early childhood students and therefore curated their classroom libraries based
on the reading levels of their students and the text features of the books, rather than
curating a classroom library collection that represented students’ identities. In this way,
the school librarians were critically important to establishing a pathway for students to
see themselves in literature.
Rose further explained that is important for school librarians to curate book
collections where students see themselves in literature because it establishes a pathway
for students to engage more personally and deeply with the story. She described
intentionally shifting language in a book to represent the social identities of the students
of that class:
I change the language of the books. I don't know if you noticed that I did
change the languages. Several of the books that I read to be inclusive. In
the pre-kindergarten we have several kids who have two moms rather than
a mom or dad. So I always change things... I feel both lucky and entrusted
because these are our littlest of kids and for [some] they're the majority of
[a school’s] population, but for us they're the entry… I feel that really for
the two years that I have the pre-kindergarten and the kindergarten
82

students that I do a lot about social issues and getting along. (Rose,
Interview, May 13, 2016)
Rose’s insight that the youngest students are “the entry” for the librarians to engage
students in personalized reading by intentionally selected books that represent them or
their families emphasizes the critical role that school librarians have in developing an
important pathway towards literacy and literature appreciation for students learning how
to read. While classroom teachers are focused on developing reading skills, the school
librarians partner their efforts to develop both a love of reading and a safety in reading by
using the text of a student’s life in their instruction and curation of books. Elaine from
Crestwood Academy, the all-boys school, highlights an interesting and new dimension of
the role of the librarian to use the school’s community as inspiration while curating the
collection. In a single gendered school, Elaine intentionally worked to give her male
students access to female characters. Elaine’s approach to curating a collection of books
to represent the school Crestwood Academy’s community holds a different perspective
considering that the school serves all boys. Thus, how lower school librarians
successfully partner with classroom teachers to make connections with characters not
represented in the student body was ever more important.
While William Penn’s librarians intentionally curated books that represent their
diverse community, gender diversity at Crestwood Academy was absent as it is an allboys school. Therefore, Elaine viewed one of her primary roles as curating books that
promoted gender diversity. She noted that while she wanted her male students to come to
the library to “feel successful and really engaged and connected” to characters in a book,

83

it was a professionally “heartbreaking” struggle to make female characters accessible to
the boys:
It's a little heartbreaking sometimes because there are some things that I
know will not get checked out by the boys... As a librarian, you have to
make space, I feel, for things that you know the boys will engage with
which means there are some things that they won't. I try to sell them to
classroom libraries and do book talks for teachers and say, "Please, this
would be a terrific read aloud." It's not something that boys generally will
pick up so I try to promote certain characters or stories through the faculty
as read alouds, if I think or fairly confident it won't go off our shelves
through the boy's hands. One of the biggest things we try to do when we're
choosing our collection is to keep it as diverse as possible, that's incredibly
important, in terms of character and author but within the confines of what
we know boys will engage with, especially as they get older…Gender is a
big issue in terms of who checks out what. If we're talking about fiction,
the character's gender makes a big difference to the boys. They really have
a tough time feeling like “I'm going to pick up Judy Moody”, that’s the
book that always comes to mind, because first, she has is a girl although
Stink is next to her so that helps but Junie B. Jones is another one… there
are very few female characters that they will pick up and read. Again, I
will try, all the time when I read aloud to them to find female characters
and promote those to faculty. (Elaine, Interview, May 10, 2016)
Elaine shared that the consequence of promoting female characters too much with her
students has resulted in come boys “closing themselves off as a reader”, a dangerous
threat to her role as a school librarian who sought to establish safe and meaningful
pathways towards literacy development (Elaine, Interview, May 10, 2016). This excerpt
also surfaced a new theme of librarians as identity shapers: librarians saw an aspect of
their role as helping students to make connections to books and characters that they
themselves may not have a natural proclivity towards on their personal “scholarship of
the self” (Style, 1982).
The work of the school librarians in this study to give students access to
characters and themes from minority groups at such a young age is tremendous as
84

socialization in early childhood and identity formation are dependent on a child seeing
his or her image in the world around them. Banks (2013) scholarly work on multicultural
education poignantly explains how critical it is for young students, especially students of
color, to see themselves represented in their school community:
Each of us becomes culturally encapsulated during our socialization in
childhood. We accept the assumption of our own community culture,
internalize its values, views of the universe, misconceptions, and
stereotypes. Although this is as true for the child socialized within a
mainstream culture as it is for the minority child, minority children are
usually forced to examine, confront, and question their cultural
assumptions when they enter school. Students who are born and
socialized with the mainstream culture rarely have an opportunity to
identify, question, and challenge their cultural assumptions, beliefs,
values, and perspectives because the school culture usually reinforces
those that they learn at home and in their communities (Banks, 2013, p.
80)
Banks (2013) insight here that schools are commonly the place for minority students to
examine and confront the stereotypes associated with their cultural identity is accurate
and further emphasizes the critical role that librarians have in helping young students see
their social and cultural identities represented in books. The school librarians in this study
actively worked to free children from a culturally encapsulated school community by
doing more than just displaying book covers with diverse characters; each librarian
worked to ensure that each child in the school felt safe and represented in the library past
the tokenized “hero and holiday” displays that some school communities often relegate
minority groups to (Banks, 2013) by curating a diverse collection and connecting
students with books about diverse topics and with diverse characters. In this way, the
school librarians incorporated culturally responsive pedagogy in their daily work as a
way to give minority students equal representation, consequently illuminating new paths
85

towards literacy development and identity formation inclusive of all students within the
community.
My analysis of librarians in this study as powerful agents of diversity and
inclusivity is appropriate when one considers the collective work these librarians did to
shift one of the dominant paradigms in independent school education: the paradigm that
independent schools are “bastions of privilege and elitism, high tuition schools that enroll
the children of the nation’s power elite” (Doyle, 1981, p. 661). Through intentional and
thoughtful collection curation, reader’s advisory, and relationship building with all
students, these librarians worked to subvert this dominant paradigm so that each child had
equal chance to develop, examine, and confront their own identities in the safety of the
school library. The librarians in this study worked to ensure that the cultural and social
identities of their students were represented in their collections and in the books that they
read aloud to children. By doing so, the librarians became agents of diversity, inclusivity,
and equity. As Banks (2013) suggests, there is an especially important need for young
children in school to be able to see their social identities represented in ways that
challenge stereotypes. Through storytelling, librarians did just that: challenged
stereotypes and introduced images of minority students and different family structures to
students to bring these important identities into what Cruise-Robinson Howe, and Style
(2014) call the “marketplace of ideas” or more literally, the school community.
Chen et al. (2014) examined multicultural education and culturally responsive
pedagogy through the lens of “storytelling.” The concept of storytelling in Chen et. al’s
(2014) focuses on the act as a reflective strategy for educators, however; the authors’
86

(2014) use the function of storytelling to explain how important it is to tell the stories of
minority groups so that their identity and experiences are brought into the “marketplace
of ideas” systemically developed in schools:
… Storytelling empowers us to see our selves as change agents. If a
person who is accustomed to having their experiences and stories taken
seriously and listened to in their marketplace of ideas, their stories are
automatically connected to the systemic. If someone shares an experience
or story in the marketplace of ideas and it is taken seriously for the first
time then it is not merely sentimental it is the beginning of a paradigm
shift (Chen et. al, 2014, p. 5)
Intentionally curating books and a library collection that represents the diversity of a
school community or the ideals of the school’s mission can shift how students see
themselves and others. Librarians were important agents in shifting the paradigm of
independent schools as white elitist institutions by bringing the stories of minority groups
into the “marketplace of ideas” in their spaces. Ideas are important in schools, as they
nurture the inquisitive spirit of students to become sophisticated learners and thinkers.
Curating Ideas and Information in the Digital Age. The librarians in this study
examined their own positionality as agents of change and actively worked to curate
collections that put the social and cultural identities of their students into the
“marketplace of ideas.” As ideas are important to healthy learning communities, I found
that the role of school librarians used technology to mediate the process through which
students developed their ideas and gained access information. Digital devices were used
to quickly access information that helped students find answers to their curiosities and to
give more information to fuel their ideas.
While every librarian had technology present in their library spaces, no library
was dominated by eReaders, projectors, or computers. These libraries were dominated
87

by print resources, and each librarian saw their role differently when it came to the topic
of using technology. Rose and Allayna both felt that children in the early childhood
grades preferred the action of roaming the library to look for books and sorting books in
the bins by cover as opposed to holding an eReader. Digitally searching for books in an
online catalog system was not a skill they taught students at William Penn until the upper
elementary grades and middle school. Similarly, NES used their digital information
catalogs and research tools with older students as well, and focused the time that
librarians had with the elementary school students to allow students to browse books
from the shelf and to “wander and wonder” in the library (Fieldnotes, May 9, 2016). All
of the schools had a printed encyclopedia set, however research was never mentioned as
being done in the library alone or without collaboration from a classroom teacher; while
the school libraries were places to research information and ideas, the research was
connected to the classroom curriculum or a project-based learning opportunity, and the
librarians partnered with teachers to support and expand students’ access to information.
Elaine mentioned that she and her two “labrarian” colleagues collaborate and teach the
boys at Crestwood to research ideas in the library, but then to build and construct
representations of those ideas in the I-Lab. In this way, technology in the library is used
as a tool to access information, not as a vehicle through which to build knowledge about
a topic that was isolated and restricted to a student’s time in the library alone. Rather,
students were presented a problem to solve in a classroom project, they researched the
problem in the library under Elaine supervision and help, and then they moved onto the ILab to tactilely represent their understanding or solutions with material. Jonathan alluded
88

to this the quote mentioned earlier, and his teaching colleague Frank elaborated that the
collaboration between the library and the I-Lab to research ideas happens almost every
day and is necessary to fully implement a project with students. At Crestwood,
technology was a tool used in the service of the learning in the library, in the I-Lab, and
in classrooms.
On a tour of the school by the lower school technology teacher, Holly, we stopped
in to observe a third-grade teacher using iPads to frame their thinking about the location
and plot setting. The boys were mobile and spread around the classroom, walking around
with the iPads to connect and talk with their peers to share what they discovered or what
they struggled with while some students also were sitting on the floor with their backs
propped up bean bags and cushion pillows. Research was clearly not relegated to the
confines of the library space only, and the iPads allowed students to not only access
information quickly, but to move about the room to share and discuss with their peers or
to comfortable situate their bodies to engage in deeper inquiry about their topic and new
ideas. In this way, the school library was not the only space in the school that students
were able to access information and ideas thanks to the mobility of iPads. Holly
explained that every teacher in the school had a set of classroom iPads, and that one of
her primary roles and responsibilities was to help teachers integrate research on the iPads
into their classroom instruction and curriculum in order to enhance and support student
learning (Fieldnotes, May 10, 2016).
Country Day’s second grade co-teachers, technology teacher, and Shannon
collaborated to support a classroom project on gardening and as an extension activity to
89

the students’ summer reading book Up in the Garden and Down in the Dirt by Kate
Messner. The project eventually involved partnering for instructional support from the
visual arts teacher as well. When students arrived back to school in September as new
second graders, they discussed the book and began working on the school garden to
connect what they had read with what they knew through the experience of tending to a
real garden. The project specifically focused on the elements that make up the garden,
and then each student took ownership of researching a plant or animal necessary to grow
a successful garden using articles from the library’s online database. Students did the
research in the library and in their classroom. Once each student had researched their
specific topic, they wrote a short explanation to read aloud on a voice recorder explaining
how their element of the garden helped it to grow. Shannon worked with Sharon and
Connie (the co-teachers) along with the technology teacher to the record students reading
aloud and then included the visual arts teacher to help students construct a bare
conductive soundboard mural. Upon pressing a section of the mural, a student’s voice
narrated how and why that element of the garden was essential to its growth. Sharon and
Connie explained during our interviews that the project took on a tremendous amount of
collaboration, but that it was a meaningful project that they saw impact student
engagement in the learning and researching process. They also each mentioned that the
collaboration with the Shannon and the technology teacher was essential to the project
success since they needed the guidance and assistance to give informational access to the
students and to better understand how electricity on the soundboard worked so that they
could teach the students. The result of this collaborative project was a visually beautiful
90

mural made by students that spanned a large wall leading to Sharon and Connie’s second
grade classroom.
Learning is about making connections and experiences. In fact, our human brains
are plastic and shaped by experiences. The more experiences that we have and the more
connections we can make with information, the stronger the neuronal connections are in
our brains and the greater likelihood we are to retain that information in our long term
memory centers. The learning process for students in the stages of early childhood
development are especially unique because the brain is changing rapidly, is shaped by
experiences, and at night will prune away weak neuronal connections in a process called
“pruning.” Therefore, isolated learning that is static is the least impactful learning on a
child’s brain. On the other hand, learning that is dynamic, engages students in an active
experience, and that is connected to more than a single event or fact is how a child’s brain
is shaped and knowledge is constructed. All of the librarians interviewed in this study
used technology as a vehicle through which to access information and ideas, but in the

Figure 2. The garden mural at Country Day that is also a bar conductive sound
board. Notice the copper wire linking each drawing in the garden to a voice
recorder. In the photograph on the right, Shannon presses a worm on the mural to
hear a student narrate how the worm impacts the growth of the garden.
91

close and connected collaboration with classroom teachers to support their curriculum
and instruction and in order to enhance student learning. Both the collaborations at
Crestwood Academy and Country Day are exemplar examples of project based learning
experiences for children that incorporate multiple literacies: students research
information digitally or in a book, write about their learning and then tactilely construct a
representation of that learning. The library is an important space to develop these
multiple literacy skills and the school librarians were undoubtedly influential
collaborators who positively impacted their colleagues’ instruction and student learning.
By showing teachers and students how to find and use information and books, librarians
gave students the space and knowledge needed to be inquisitive and creative. The
American Library Association (ALA) established guidelines to outline exemplary school
library programs, and the association describes the mission of exemplary library
programs as “to ensure that students and staff are effective users of ideas and
information; students are empowered to be critical thinkers, enthusiastic readers, skillful
researchers, and ethical users of information” (ala.org, 2017). The librarians in this
study fulfilled the ALA’s mission and used technology to empower students to be critical
thinkers. Librarians collaborated with teachers to research and apply information to
tactile classroom projects, and together their students engaged in activities that developed
multiple literacy skills.
The most important component adding to the space value in all of these libraries
was in fact the people within: the school librarians. Moreover, the librarians’ ability to
shape the teaching and learning culture in ways that supported the school’s mission and
92

promoted democratic ideals was apparent but also unique. Librarians, examined from the
interview data from school leaders and teachers, had the unique position of serving the
entire school community while also supporting the development of multiple literacy skills
in students. Librarians in this study were also agents of diversity and inclusivity, equity
advocates, and allies to the cause of helping young students to find their own identity as
readers and as young people; by carefully and thoughtfully curating their collections to
represent the social identity markers of the community, librarians were critical to each
school’s mission pursuit of social justice and equity. Furthermore, librarians nurtured
relationships that were non-judgmental by designing the library space to be safe and
welcoming. In this way, librarians curated not just items for the library collection, but
relationships with community stakeholders as well. In the next section, I explain how the
physical features of each library evoked a sense of safety and acceptance for school
community members. The image of the school library as a “sanctuary” within the school
is examined, and is an image that bespeaks its value as a coveted and attractive space
around the school. Serving as leaders of this coveted space, I explain how librarians were
the primary emotional architects of each library and therefore contributed to the
emotional architecture of the school libraries’ overall space value.

The Emotional Architecture of School Libraries Adds to its Space Value
Another perspective that further defines the concept of space value at each of
these school libraries was the implicit role the school librarians embodied as the
“emotional architect” of the space. Each librarian articulated their desire to create a
93

vibrant, comfortable, and well-curated space during our interviews. They also all
mentioned the intentional addition of playful visual cues and décor elements to capture
students’ attention and to give excitement to the space. What was not explicitly revealed
through the data, however, was each librarian’s responsibility in creating a positive
emotional climate in the library. Establishing a positive learning environment for
students is an imperative condition to set an optimal learning experience, and while the
librarians never communicated this as one of the responsibilities or roles within their
professional work, it was evident in my observations of students engaging the space that
they the librarians are in fact all extremely talented making the library a comfortable and
safe space for all school members.
Each school librarians their intention for the library to feel like a safe and
comfortable space, and their efforts to design an engaging and thoughtful space based on
the age of the students was notable. My observations of each of the librarians teaching
and then guiding students to careful book selections left me feeling inspired by the
masterful ease in which the provided a safe and welcoming space for children to explore
different literacies. Shannon at Country Day was especially poignant in her desire to
emotionally design the library space as well, indicating that her library space was a place
she wanted students to escape judgements or stereotypes that could stunt or stifle a
child’s emotional growth during early childhood and adolescence. Her words evoke the
sense of safety and acceptance that I felt in every library, and my observations of the
student engagement in her space in particular lead me also to conclude that students too

94

felt the same sense of acceptance and safety during their visits. However, Shannon’s
word powerfully captures exactly what I noticed in each space. She said:
I want students to feel welcome, I want them not to feel judged… I want
them to feel like if I have an information need, that this is someplace
where I can come and be accepted, and that what I want is legitimate, and
it's not going to be dismissed or locked up. (Shannon, Interview, May 11,
2016)
Shannon’s words are similar to Elaine’s desire to have her library feel life home for the
students who, “don’t quite fit in” at school, a feeling that many young students
unfortunately are forced to confront and work through during childhood. In this way, the
early childhood libraries in the study can be better understood as an extraordinary space
that all school stakeholders enjoy because of the hard work of school librarians to curate
the learning space and the be chief architects of the library’s emotional environment. I
did not interview students in this study, so to further substantiate my claim that school
libraries hold a space value incomparable to other spaces within the school is Gabriel’s
confession:
When I walk into this library, there’s that sense again of comfort. It's too
small for me because I'm a big man and I walk in and some things are
down here and some books are way down there [motioning low heights in
reference to the short stacks of books for young students]. I still feel a
sense of warmth, welcome, comfort, and communality. There's a real life
there…I get that sense that this is a place that I can go... I remember one
time I needed some place to calm myself and so I walked into the library
and said to myself, “I'm going to sit down in the library and read a book,”
and I got through I think maybe 25 words before some emergency
happened, but it's a place that I want to go to be reflective and calm.
(Gabriel, Interview, May 13, 2016)
The collective essence of the library as a place to be reflective and calm, safe and
comfortable that Gabriel, the school leader, described is the space value I discovered
95

across the data. In design, the careful architectural and decorative design of each library
space was unique, yet the consistent theme was that each library space was sought after,
beloved, coveted, and a desirable place for all school stakeholders. The emotional
climate of the space also had a primary role in mediating the literacy skill development of
children by establishing it as safe place where the freedom to be oneself allowed each
child the cognitive disinhibition to be curious and wonder.
Each library in this study intentionally designed their space to support the
development of multiple literacies in students of early childhood grades by focusing on
specific architectural features and décor that enhanced each space’s aesthetic appeal and
functional use by students, teachers, administrators, and parents. The more centrally
located the libraries were on the school’s campus, the more frequently the study
participants indicated the library was used; the New England School’s library was not
located on or near the center of campus and was still used by school members at times.
Comfortable seating, reading nooks, and niches made into the actual structural
architecture of the space or with soft borders established those locations in the library as
comfortable and cozy places for students to read independently or discuss books with
friends. These unique spaces also make each library’s vast and open-concept design feel
differentiated and accessible to the young students. Window seats were another
consistent and charming feature that supported children while engaging in reading
activities, and the playful, whimsical displays in each space added personality and
creativity to the environment so that it was thoughtfully primed to inspire curiosity and
inquiry. Furthermore, the school librarians themselves were discovered to be emotional
96

architects of each of the school libraries, each critically important to the positive and
welcoming climate of the library space that was so tangibly felt while I was there and
also explicitly captured during my interviews, observations, and analysis of archival data.
All of these unique aspects combined to contribute to each library’s unrivaled space
value.
William Penn’s Library as the Symbolic Center of the School
William Penn School’s library was also designed in such a way that afforded such
deep, individualized experiences for each of the school stakeholders. The school’s
library served students in grades pre-kindergarten through eighth grade, and was centrally
located at the front of the school making it easily accessible to each of the school’s
classrooms and also to parents dropping off or picking up their children. I noticed that a
number of teachers and parents entered the library space during my observations at the
school, and my interviews with the two school librarians also created an understanding of
the library’s prominent role in the school as a welcoming and safe place for all
stakeholders. The emotional climate of was best described by Gabriel, the Assistant
Head of William Penn. Gabriel eloquently described the library from its inception as the
school’s original gymnasium to one of its many purposes now as a community meeting
space. His description of the “spiritual” essence of the space suggests a unique
perspective on library space value not captured in other data. Gabriel reasoned that
William Penn’s school library was an asset to not just school stakeholders but to its local
community as well, a symbol of a relationship building and communal investment:
It's in a central place. It's one of the first buildings that ... Our natural
entrance is the other side, and the first thing to your left is the library. It
97

was the gym, now the library, thank goodness…Long before I was here,
that was the gymnasium maybe 25, 30 years ago. Now it's the library, and
that's really symbolic in many ways. That first place that you can step into
potentially is a library. It builds community. The younger kids from pre-K
all the way up to sixth grade are there in community with [the librarians].
We invite the community outside in when you have Andrea Pinkney
coming, or you have Sy Montgomery [author] coming, or you have a
number of artists and writers coming outside the community to be in the
community, to be a part of our community, to help us build community. In
many ways, I think what we're doing in the library is central to who we
are, what we do, and why we do it. There's a thing called community
which is very important in the Quaker practicing faith. Having a library is
a way to build community. When we are teachers or we are educators, we
are often siloed away in our classrooms, so busy and so deeply invested in
what we're doing in that classroom that day, not our malice but out of real
honest effort to do what we can do to improve that child’s life. We are
almost like independent contractors in our rooms trying to get our stuff
done. How do we build and bring out community? We have assemblies,
we have performances, whether they're artistic or they're athletic, and we
have libraries where we bring in these wonderful authors to talk about
their experiences and to connect to us humanly about the human
experience. The library helps us with building community. It helps the
town, it's a place to go. I belong to a certain religion, you belong to a
different one, so we're going to separate ourselves at churches. There's a
secular community building almost spiritual space, a library, and what a
library can be and do is a fascinating way to build community around
something that's important. What's the idea behind a library? The
collection of some of the best thought and some of the ideas in humanity
so that we can learn and build on what we have and build a foundation.
There's something nice about that. A library helps in a community. If it
helps in a community, a small town, why can’t it help in a school to build
and bridge out to the community? It's beautiful to have a library at the
center and the front of the school... There's that relaxed feel and that
opportunity to hear people speak about things. Very different. A very
different feel to be in a library than it is to be in other public space.
(Gabriel, Interview, May 13, 2016)
Gabriel’s description of the significance of William Penn’s library to the school and to
the local community as a “spiritual space” was a unique description in the data I
collected; however, I appreciate the powerful imagery his words suggested as I tried to
discern what it is about library spaces that draws so many people within a school
98

community to seek it out as a place to just “be.” Moreover, his quote analyzed further
alludes to the concept of the school library as a space were things and actions above and
beyond our physical reality happen; to just “be” in a space while physically doing nothing
suggests a certain spiritual transcendence is happening instead. Clarity of thought,
connection to something greater than himself, and the space to reflect with others on the
“human experience” are all incredible images of the school library that contradicts the
typical image of the library as a place to read books. Gabriel’s choice of words in
referencing the silo-effect that many school and community constituents operate justifies
the need for libraries as a common space where people can go to re-engage with one
another and their communities. He thinks libraries have value because they unite
members of the community and give those members access to the best thoughts and ideas
of all “humanity.” Gabriel suggests that the value of the library is greater than any
physical or tangible item here on earth, but rather invaluable to a communities’ collective
spirit as a place that gives testimony to not just ideas but our existence as humans as well.
Another example for how William Penn’s library space was used by the local
community became evident when Gabriel escorted me back to the library for more
observations. As we entered the room I noticed a placard on the wall depicting a bird’seye view of the library’s layout of tables and chairs. Upon questioning its purpose
hanging on the wall when I suspected the two librarians knew how the room was to be
arranged, Gabriel explained that the space is often used on the weekends by local
organizations and sometimes even a church group for worship on Sundays. The placard
was posted to ensure that all users of the space would reassemble it into the correct
99

format for the school to continue its use with students uninterrupted by an external
organization’s use of the space. Gabriel’s explanation of the school library serving not
just his school community, but the greater local community as well suggests that the
space value of the library was coveted and incredibly valuable to both in school and outof-school stakeholders.
Country Day’s Library as an Evocative Community Space
The physical space of Country Day’s library attracted different community
stakeholders because of its charm and central location on campus, but Shannon, the
school’s one librarian, wanted to know why the space was so valued by the community
on a deeper level. Aside from aesthetics, she wanted to know why so many people
requested to use a space she also thought was beautiful, but who was also trained to view
the space as a community center for inquiry and imagination. Shannon sent a survey to
faculty and staff at the school to uncover why such a range of community stakeholders
used the space— from music teachers to parents, Shannon wanted to know why the
library was the one place that brought so many people together. Admittedly, I wanted to
know the answer to the same questions as I tallied the number of adults who entered the
library to peruse books, sit down in the comfortable chairs, or to just pass through at 13 in
just 45 minutes. Shannon clarified the findings of her own survey which led her to posit
that for some, the space is just aesthetically pleasing and expansive enough to host large
events. In particular, she referenced the monthly social meetings that parents hosted in
the library. Parent volunteers from the school’s Parents’ Association used the space for
social meetings called “Coffees” and Shannon explained:
100

Those monthly coffees are really meant to be a social opportunity for
parents because each grade has different social events, so having one on
campus where they are all being welcomed. We want them here. It's a good
time. They can use the space and it's central and it's beautiful. (Shannon,
Interview, May 11, 2016)
Shannon went on in the interview to explain that because parents in different grade-levels
do not get to see each other frequently, the “coffees” in the library serve as a social
meeting in addition to a meeting to plan and coordinate school-related functions.
Shannon alludes to the fact that parents make the choice to gather in the library space,
and when she said “we want them here” she was referring to the fact that while other
meeting spaces in the school exist, she wants to build relationships with parents when
they come to host events. Her suggestion that the parents use the space because it is
“central” and “beautiful” are important to attracting parents to the space; however, the
meaningful engagement that happens when parents and Shannon connect about what
children are learning makes hosting events in the library a way to build a healthy school
culture with parents. Shannon also invites parents into the library to use the space as
their own reading library as well. Parents are allowed to check out books, and I
witnessed Shannon assist a mother and her young son too young to attend the school but
who had an older sibling in the first grade find pictures books to read together at home.
Shannon commented that she encourages parents and their entire family to use the
library’s resources. In her opinion, Country Day’s library was a benefit that should
extend to all family members, and so sharing its resources with parents was an important
part of her library program.

101

In these ways, it was clear that Country Day’s space value was valued by parents
as a location in the school that they could use to gather socially and to access books and
other media to support both their own and their family’s learning. My experience visiting
Country Day and interviewing Shannon, her teaching colleagues, and her Head of
School, started me thinking about the library space as not just transactional but
transformative as well. Looking more closely at the data, I found that there are themes of
ownership and investment at Country Day that highlights the unique role that the school
library has to unite members of the community in one single space. Parents and teachers
“invested” emotionally into the space and Shannon herself made it feel a welcoming and
like it was a place that parents and families wanted to be. The library at Country Day
was a place that parents valued for his inclusiveness and Shannon’s hospitable nature.
My observations also supported this notion that the school’s library holds space
value with faculty and staff members as well, however Shannon collected data in a
survey of her own design that paints a more colorful picture of how valued and
appreciated the library is to her colleagues. Shannon arrived at Country Day as the new
librarian eager to get to know the faculty and staff of the school. She graduated from
Simmons University in Boston, Massachusetts, where she studied to receive a master’s
degree in Library Science. She joked that the librarianship seemed to be more of a
vocation rather than a profession, and one that also ran in her family. During our
interview, she said in jest, “my mother is a school librarian. My husband is a cataloger.
My parents met in a library. It's a little genetic!” Her love of her role was apparent, and I
sensed that she was a librarian who did not leave her job at Country Day at the end of the
102

day to not think more about it, but rather that library science was a way of thinking and
living; Shannon was the consummate librarian well steeped and trained in all aspects of
the craft to the extent too that her personal and professional lives had coalesced into one
powerful vocation, and the Country Day community was a benefactor. Shannon assumed
her role as the librarian at Country Day in 2012, replacing a school librarian whose long
tenure made him an iconic member of the school faculty yet who had not managed the
school’s large library collection in line with contemporary library standards. Shannon
navigated the transition cautiously in her first two years and intentionally focused her
work on building relationships with all of the school stakeholders. In order to begin
building relationships with faculty and staff members that were rooted in the spirit of
helpfulness and a desire to help make connections between a library program and the
teachers’ curricula, Shannon created a survey and distributed it electronically to all
school staff members. Another motivation to send the survey was to make it known to
her colleagues that she was genuinely interested in getting to know the school community
from different points of view and aspects-- she wanted to establish herself as someone
who was approachable and responsive to feedback. Shannon copied the survey results
during my visit and shared them with me. Together we briefly reviewed how positive the
responses were about the space itself. However, upon further analysis of Shannon’s
survey, it became very clear how well endeared the library space was to the faculty and
staff at Country Day.
Shannon received a high response rate on her survey, and the open-ended
responses paint clear picture of what brings different faculty and staff members to use the
103

school library. Out of the 74 faculty and staff members sent the survey, 55 community
members responded to six questions, one of which was “What do you see as the greatest
strength of the library program?” An impressive 60% of the respondents mentioned the
physical space as the library program’s greatest strength which was also the topic of
responses most frequently mentioned compared to others. More specifically, the
respondents identified the library’s centrality, flexibility, multipurpose use, and positive
emotional climate as strengths. Respondents frequently described the library space as
“cozy,” “comfortable” and “welcoming.” One staff member responded, “In my role as an
administrator, I primarily use the library as a space for events, meetings, etc. It is a
warm, welcoming and comfortable place to be and we always feel like hosting groups
there!” Another respondent, most likely a teacher or staff member who worked closely
with the children responded that the greatest strength of Country Day’s library program
was the space because it “is inviting and the story room provide a cozy place for young
students to engage in literacy activities” (see Figure 3). Still another respondent simply
responded with five words: “Welcoming space. Warm. Inviting. Unique,” while yet
another respondent admitted “I really like the space because it is very cozy and accessible
for everybody.” One respondent referenced the feeling they believed students had in the
space by describing the library as “a peaceful environment for students to read and
imagine beyond the classroom.” Finally, another response described the library’s space
as a wonderful setting for a meeting or to have a “nice quite experience.” That same
respondent continued that:
As a non-teacher, my impression of the library is that it is the most
evocative space in the school. The light, the ceiling height, the design that
104

incorporates past school historic fabric—all combine for a splendid area
for any learning activity, meeting, or event.” (Faculty Survey, May 11,
2016)
The “historic fabric” referenced in this comment refers to a small stone cottage built into
the larger library space. The cottage in Figure 3 was the original front entrance and head
master’s office, until the school underwent renovations to reconfigure the school. The
statement that the library is “the most evocative” space at Country Day is a powerful
phrase to describe the space and its distinctive architectural features that led this
respondent to claim the library as uniquely different from other spaces in the school. This
response also exemplifies and captures a correlation in the survey data linking the
positive emotional climate of the library to an identifiable appreciation of the space’s
design with its centrality and use:
Because the library is “geographically” at the center of the school it serves
as a core space that emanates welcome, warmth, and [a] love of learning
to everyone in the school. It is an important space for research, browsing,
questions and answers, and special events for members of the Country
Day community from current students and parents to alumni. (Faculty
Survey, May 11, 2016)
The library’s central location as one enters the school was noted by 10 respondents, and
this particular response emphasizes the library’s space value in a succinct statement
including all school stakeholders as investors. There are many spaces around a school to
invest one’s time, to celebrate events, or to teach children. Yet, this faculty member
thinks that the emotional architecture of the space as emanating warmth, inquiry, and to
engage in community events makes this one space more valuable than other spaces
available in the school. Country Day’s library has abundant resources, is centrally
located, has a warm and inviting atmosphere, and is a space that past and present school
105

members seek out to use. Another poignant statement shared by one of these respondents
clearly connected the location of the library to the school’s mission, representing a unique
role that the library has as one space among many in the school that can to singly fulfill
the vision Country Day has set for itself. The staff member offered that “the location of
the library is its greatest strength. It makes a statement about our attitude about learning
to have such a visible sign of intellectual pursuit as a person enters the school.” Indeed,
Country Day’s guiding purpose statement published on the school’s website commits the
school to instilling a love of learning within each student, and promises that faculty and
staff members will be role models for the pursuit of knowledge and learning for all
students.
Shannon established relationships with students too by including them in her
survey. She collected the data in class orally with the prompt, “What’s one thing that
you love about the Country Day library?” She documented responses in a notebook and
later typed up the students’ responses and shared them with me during my visit. Together
we reviewed the most frequent responses by grade level and Shannon told me that she
was not surprised by the responses. In kindergarten, the most frequent response was that
students loved the books, with specific mention of books about sharks being a beloved
asset to the library in their opinion. First grade students responded that they loved the
window seats and cushions in the library just as much as they loved the books and
Shannon herself. Finally, the second grade students most frequently responded that they
enjoyed the “story room cottage” and the library’s books. Shannon shared that the
second grade students also made the collective bold request to update the library space by
106

adding hammocks, a “fort with bean bags,” “robots to find books,” and “another story
room for more books” filled with a “bunch of pillows.” These comments are interesting
because Shannon asked students to engage with her about the space, helping students to
feel like they had ownership in the space and could be a part of selecting which objects
are added within it.
The feedback Shannon gathered from the school’s important stakeholders shed
even more light on the notion that the library space brought the school community
together at Country Day. My own observations also substantiated the comments made by
Shannon’s colleagues in the survey and further explain why the library has so much space
value at Country Day. It was obvious that teachers sought the space to use with their own
students in small groups, and the students themselves were drawn to the charming and
cozy cottage also referred to as the story room and depicted in Figure 3. Teachers
frequently used the library at Country Day despite having their own classroom spaces and
common grade level areas. In a
tour of the building, Shannon
shared that each grade level has
collaborative space in addition
to large and open classrooms,
although many teachers
especially in the pre-primary
grades chose to use the library
as a space to work with

Figure 3. The cottage at Country Day School, an
original part of the school building now function as a
reading room in the library space.
107

children in small groups as well. Her reference was quickly confirmed when we returned
to the school library to hear commotion coming from the cottage. When I asked what was
happening in the cottage, Shannon happily answered:
It’s their reading room! So they might be doing any number of readingrelated comprehension activities in there. It is a strategy room and [the
teacher] just uses the space. They have three different breakout groups.
Their [classroom] space isn't really partitionable, they have another room
that they can go to, and so this is just the third room… there's a big shift in
seeing the library as being an academic space…as opposed to a place
where kids just come and hear a story read to them. (Shannon, Interview,
May 11, 2016)
Shannon’s insights here suggested that even with space options at Country Day, teachers
were still inclined to use the library space with students instead of other spaces within the
school, even the comfort of their own classroom. The comment also implies that before
Shannon’s transition the library, the space was not used as a gathering place by teachers
with their students to engage in different literacy activities except for scheduled story
readings. Shannon attributed the value of the space being tied to the separateness of the
strategy room in comparison to a classroom that is unable to be portioned into a closed
and perhaps more quiet learning space for students, but clearly Shannon herself is an
important reason why the school community enjoys coming together in the library.
Shannon’s words suggest that before her, the library was not seen as a center for teaching
and learning, nor was the purpose of the library viewed as one integral to the balanced
development of literacy skills for early childhood and early elementary students. With
Shannon now added to the space, her talents and personality invite teachers to use the
library to foster the academic skill growth of their students in the pursuit of developing
multiple literacy skills.
108

The attraction to Country Day’s library space by teachers as an alternative space
for young children to learn was evident from my observations and conversations with
Shannon and teachers. Aesthetically, Country Day’s library was extremely charming,
filled with natural light, equipped with developmentally appropriate furniture including
chairs and low-level bookshelves— ideal architectural and design features that
distinguished it as an optimal space created for young children to learn within the
library’s larger design. The charm of the cottage was not lost upon the children either,
and I witnessed students in the cottage delighted to be there as was evidenced by their
smiles and eager excitement to enter. Shannon used the house as a reading room for a
small group of kindergarten students during their regularly schedule library time. My
observation of the event described the emotional attachment that the young children had
for the cottage. My fieldnotes captured the first five minutes of Shannon’s reading group
with 8 children and revealed how excited the students were to enter the cottage:
The students line up on a long strip of yellow tape affixed to the carpet of
the library floor. They’ve assembled themselves in an impressively
straight line and it happened remarkably quickly for kindergarten students.
Shannon talks to them about the expected procedures when they enter the
house, but none of them seem to pay her any attention as they all fix their
gaze inside the cottage and onto a window seat within the special house.
As soon Shannon pauses her speaking to make sure the students are
listening to her directions, the line leader makes motion to race inside.
Shannon stops him gently with her arm and kindly says, “Hoodooed on!
I’m not done yet explaining the directions!” in such a way that the
students all turn their heads to look up at her with great anticipation. She
decides, seemingly in that moment and in response to the attempted race
inside, to instead to give each student a numbers that correspond to little
round stickers inside the cottage. The stickers are strategically placed on
the floor of the house, and three numbers correspond to the window seat.
Once every student receives a number, the line leader saunters in with his
classmates to follow. The students are smiling and are excited when they
find their numbers, except for the three students who realize that they will
109

share the window seat—they are ecstatic! They, giggle and jump almost
in unison onto the window seat cushion twisting and turning their bodies
to each find a comfortable seating posture in preparation to listen to
Shannon’s first read aloud. Their smiles linger through the first few
sentences of the story, and then it fades into a complete and utter
captivation by her reading of the story. (Fieldnotes, May 11, 2016)

This observation with kindergarten students at Country Day highlights the excitement
around the actual reading room within the house and the coveted window seats where the
children so eagerly raced to sit. It was also not a unique observation to just that one class.
In fact, every class of students that came to the library during the day I spent at Country
Day had similar and equally endearing reactions to entering that particular space within
the library. Overall, the data collected at Country Day emphasized that while the students
enjoyed the space as the primary patrons, but that parents and teachers enjoyed the space
as well. The results from Shannon’s survey, her welcoming invitations for parents to use
the space for meetings or with children not yet old enough to attend the school, and the
delight that students also gained from the library space, made Country Day’s library a
room in the building whose space value was unrivaled.
Crestwood Academy’s Library as a “Safe Space”
Crestwood Academy’s lower school library was also notable because of its vast
resources, unique architecture, centrality on campus, and overall aesthetic. Together
these elements contributed to its space value at a level that was also not matched by
another space or room on the school’s campus. Students, teachers, parents, and even
board members chose to use the library space after school even when other spaces were
available. During my visit to Crestwood Academy I observed and conversed with Elaine,
110

a talented librarian who has served as the school’s lower school librarian for 17 years.
Crestwood’s lower school library program supports students in grades pre-kindergarten
through fourth grade, while the upper school library serves grades five through eight on
the all-boys day and boarding school campus. The upper and lower school libraries are
attached by a grand foyer and shared circulation desk, and together they are centrally
located on the ground floor of a main building on the school’s sprawling New England
campus. Elaine was asked to teach lower school science four years ago in addition to her
scheduled library classes, a role that she was eager to take on with the hints of a new
innovation lab in the school’s master construction plan. She explained that she was
excited to assume a role that expanded her training in Library Science and to collaborate
with colleagues as a founding faculty member directing the new innovation lab. This
new space was under construction at the time of my visit but opened for the start of the
2016-2017 school year.
Elaine holds a master’s in Library Science, and similar to Shannon, she too
attended Simmons University to earn the degree. In our time together she mentioned that
the library was frequently used by students but that it was also a destination for parents
and faculty members looking for a quiet place to work. She also noted that the lower
school library was a desirable meeting place for the school’s board members and dorm
parents. In her own words, Elaine shared her interpretation of why the lower library
space was used by the school stakeholders in preference over the upper school library and
even other rooms on campus. She also shared the rationale behind the design of the
space of which she collaborated with architects to plan. She discussed how she and the
111

architects aspired for the library to feel and suggested that sentiment was perhaps a
reason why her library space was so frequently used:
From the beginning, because we're a boarding school and because the
boys use the space at night, it was important for us to make it feel as if it
was a home for them. The library is a safe space for a lot of boys that don't
quite fit in… [the school library] is used all the time. It's used by the
Board, it's used by the Parents Association, it's used by administration and
it's used for things like last night, the boarding dorm parents used it to
determine the proctors. It's a meeting space... because it's one of the bigger
spaces for meetings. It has the screen [pointing to an electronic projection
screen tucked into the ceiling] and it is not removed in a basement or way
out from the edges, it's still in the center of this…smack in the middle [of
campus]. (Elaine, Interview, May 10, 2016)
Elaine’s comments highlight the library was a coveted space for the boarding students
living on campus, faculty members supervising the dorms, and members of the school
board even when other spaces in the school were also available. Her description of the
library as “home” and “safe” were her own posits as to why students enjoyed the space.
Elaine also shared similar thoughts on why board members and staff want to use the
space too. During a tour of the library after our interview, Elaine continued to speak
about the library’s use attributing it again to the openness of the room, the presence of
large meeting tables, and the available technology used to deliver and view presentations.
In these ways, the library at Crestwood Academy was undoubtedly abundant in space
value for students and other important school constituents as well.
Elaine was one of the three primary leaders of the school’s brand new innovation
lab, of which she and her colleagues call the I-Lab. The three team members renamed
themselves, “Labrarians” while they work with students on innovation projects. Elaine’s
colleague Jonathan elaborated on why the I-Lab was built directly in the middle of
112

campus and connected to the lower school library. He enthusiastically shared, “We’re
really excited about the proximity— being able to send [students] right over to a part of
what will essentially be the same building, but just a different room within that same
structure, to go and do that research.” Jonathan was referring to the intentional placement
of the I-Lab next to the library so that students could easily walk back and forth from
both structures while constructing a project. He said that students needed to learn
problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and having the I-Lab connected to the library
would afford students the opportunity to research ideas and designs for their inventions
before beginning construction on a project. The library’s central location on campus
inspired the location of the I-lab, and the three “labrarians” were all excited to collaborate
together.
NES’s Library as an Open and Inviting for the Community
NES’s library was not used as frequently as Crestwood Academy or Country Day;
however, this school’s library space was still a valuable and coveted space within the
community. Josephine, the lead librarian at NES, explained that the library was used by
school stakeholders in part because it was “the biggest open space” on campus. She
described the library’s use and suspected reasons for its use when she shared:
[The library] is used less than once a month I'd say on average. Some
months are busier but some months we don't have anything. People email
and say, “can we use it after school?” …Spring is the season where a lot of
things are happening. In June there's a reunion coming up and it's a
backup space if it rains and they need a place to have the cocktail hour that
they can't have outside so they come to the library and do it, that kind of
thing. Occasionally parents have meetings in here early in the mornings, if
they're preparing for the fair or doing some other kind of volunteer work
they'll ask if they can use the space for an early morning meeting… I'd say
[the library] is pretty open and inviting but cozy at the same time, enough
113

nooks and crannies to sort of provide that, but it's a big open space as well,
it's a funny mix, airy. (Josephine, Interview, May 9, 2016)
The “cozy” description and “airy” feeling of the library is an attractive characteristic of
the space that adds to the appeal for its use from various school stakeholders and for a
multitude of purposes. Another librarian at NES, Sidney, noted how frequently the space
was used by teachers even when they were not regularly scheduled to be at the library
with their students. She said:
[Faculty members] come in on their own, they'll often come here during
the week when our [novice] teachers are in the classroom on their own. A
lot of people set up their desk here, their computer, and they just work
quietly in here. Sometimes they have conferences or different meetings,
but it's usually at a table with the computer working quietly. It's hard to
even know that people are in here sometimes. The faculty and staff are
definitely the quieter of the different people in the library. (Sidney,
Interview, May 9, 2016)
Sidney’s description of the faculty members’ use of the space and insight that they are in
fact the quieter of the library users is an interesting but not surprising perception. Early
childhood classrooms are often times very noisy as young students learn through play and
socialization. It is not surprising then, that teachers would flock to a location on campus
that is separate from a traditional classroom and one that affords the quiet space to work
independently. Her insight that teachers actually “set up their desk here” suggests that
the library is not just a place to stop quickly in order to work, but rather a place that
teachers enjoy spending quality time in order to complete their work, hold a conference,
or host a meeting. Josephine and Sidney had a teaching colleague who expressed how
frequently she used the library space personally, and then also how she used the space
with her students. In our conversation together, she described using the library both
114

during regularly scheduled library time, and additional times not built into the academic
schedule:
I come in the regular library time, so that's once every six days. We are on
a six-day schedule and we come in half-groups. It's like an hour or a fortyminute block... We'll bring 11 kids at a time. I bring kids over at various
times of the year if we need a different space to work as well as if we're
going to be looking for books. Like maybe we're doing a study on poetry
and so we might come over and look at the poetry section and then we pull
books that they're interested in…I use [the library] as prep time for
organizing something for my team and to get work ready…If I have work
to do I tend to be here because I need quiet. Because it's a little quieter on
this side but I like the corner right where Sidney teaches, where you can
look over the green [campus lawn]. (Sam, Interview, May 9, 2016)
This teacher’s use of the library space was consistent with what other teachers described
as their professional and personal uses of NES’s library space. Her mention of the
“corner right where Sidney teaches, where you can look over the green [campus lawn]”
referred to a corner of the library that was infiltrated by natural light from the open and
expansive windows and that provided view that overlooked the sprawling campus lawn
below. The openness of that library space, particularly where this teacher preferred to
work, suggests that the openness of the space and views of greenspace add to the space’s
value to faculty. During my visit I observed a dozen teachers entering library for nearly
an hour at a time either doing work or hosting meeting with a teaching colleague. While
the library was located on the outer edge of the campus’s boundaries, it was also
neighboring a brand new innovation lab of which was also under construction during my
visit. While the librarian team at NES were not taking on collaborative roles as
innovation lab specialists, they all expressed interest and support of the new building’s
purpose and promise.

115

Librarians, teachers, school leaders, and even survey respondents from Country
Day all articulated a vibrant energy that fostered deep connections to the space and that
helped to nurture positive relationships amongst school community members. Words
used to describe the spaces such as “comfortable”, “safe”, and “home,” and the multiple
references of the location of the library being central and convenient to school
stakeholders were reasons why the library was often chosen as the meeting space at each
school despite other locations being available. It was impossible to explain how students
in early childhood grades used the library spaces at each school without first
understanding how all school members viewed the space and why, as well as how it
brought the school community together. Each library space was a place in the school that
served a purpose more than just reading, and is a practical representation of
Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory in that people and places as a part of
the microsystem that students come into contact with shape and impact the child’s
development. The school libraries in this study shaped students as readers, as people, as
students and members of a broader community of learners. The librarians and library
space as a system provided students with a safe and welcoming haven to explore ideas
and pathways towards literacy development, and even their own identity development.
Likewise, the library as a system within the school also shaped the teachers, providing
them a space in the school to access new knowledge and resources, to collaborate with
librarians, and to develop as professionals. Reciprocally, how students and teachers
impacted the library as a system within the school is the focus of the next chapter.

CHAPTER 5
LIBRARY DESIGN TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE LITERACY SKILLS
Students in the early primary grades do not enter school libraries alone, and even
if they could electively go to a library as an option during the school day, a teacher would
most likely not send that child alone because of their young age. Therefore,
understanding why and how school libraries function as a space within the school for all
of the community members was an important aspect of the data that I needed to
understand before I explored how students use the space, too. Every school library in this
study revealed a preferential endorsement as a coveted space because of its convenience,
central location, and functionality as a large meeting space. The terms school leaders,
librarians, and teachers most frequently used to describe the physical space of the
libraries were “comfortable”, “safe”, and “home,” all terms that added to the library’s’
attraction as a space all school stakeholders elected to use even when other space options
were available. Indeed, these benefits of the library spaces were discovered by
examining the school library from the point of view of various school stakeholders;
however, my deeper analysis of how the students experienced the space helps to explain
how important school libraries are to the development multiple literacy skills in students.

Supporting Multiple Literacy Skill Development through Library Design
The architectural features of each space add to my definition of “space value” in
libraries, and how librarians then leveraged those architectural features to help support
the multiple literacy skill development in students of early childhood grades was clear in
117

the data as well. Two specific architectural elements used by librarians to engage
children with the physical space while they explored different print, tactile, informational,
and digital resources were vast, open concepts that included natural design elements, and
novel spaces built to differentiate learning experiences within the open concept of the
library. In fact, these two architectural features of the space afforded children unique
opportunities to engage in multiple literacy skill development in ways that were not
afforded to them in their classrooms. Each library’s open concept design and novel
architectural features were used by the librarians to help mediate the students’ literacy
learning experiences. In this way, they used the space value of the library’s architectural
features to support students’ development of multiple literacy skills.

Open Concept Design to Support Multiple Literacies
Each school library had the enormous task of housing books, magazines and other
media sources in one space. The number of items in each school’s collection from this
study ranged from 11,000 to 32,000— an impressive number of resources in proportion
to the number of students enrolled in each institution. In order to catalog and categorize
all of these resources, however, each school library used their spaces strategically. The
open concept designs within each school library were vast, allowing for creative shelving
arrangements and for the construction of distinctive spaces within that open design using
soft borders. “Soft borders” is a term that denotes the use of movable design elements
like rugs and furniture to differentiate fixed spaces. Figure 4 represents how NES used
soft borders to create a comfortable reading area for students. Teachers often create
118

spaces with soft borders in the classrooms; however, the scale to which it was done in
each of the school libraries in this study was incomparable because of the vastness of the
space. Each space also had high, vaulted ceilings that contributed to the open and grand
feel of the space, a sensation that made the library unique to other spaces in the building.
The openness of the space coupled with the intentional creation of smaller distinct spaces
using soft borders allowed students the opportunity to move and spread out in the library
while they engaged in the different literacy activities created by the librarians.
One observation of a kindergarten class at NES highlights how children in a
kindergarten library class used the space during class:
At 9:45 in the morning, kindergarten students are perusing picture books.
I see two girls huddling together and giggling under the shelter of a library
table. It seems they have found a cozy place to “read” their book together.
Another girl student is sprawled underneath an adjacent table on her
stomach flipping through a picture book, intensely looking over the
pictures and using her index finger to trace over the figures on each page.
A group of three boys is loudly going through an Eyewitness Dinosaurs
book that I know to be very popular in my school as well. Books are
strewn across the previously tidy space designated for early readers in this
massive and exciting library space. As I thread myself through the
haystack of students, not a one seems to notice me since they are so
engrossed in their books. (Fieldnotes, May 9, 2016)
Sprawled underneath furniture and across the floor in various places around the library at
NES was actually not a unique scene. In all of my school visits I observed students
making use of the expansive space while exploring how their bodies moved and felt in it
as well. These particular spaces were used creating soft borders with a rug and some
lower shelving built to a height that is friendlier for small children. These are examples
of librarians using their “classroom as the third teacher,” one of the concepts guiding the
theoretical framework in this study. Large spaces that are not closely confined have an
119

important a role within the library’s design as developing children do not have complete
command of their own bodies. As they navigate their individual physicality and personal
space, that have the room to move their bodies in order to engage in the library space on
the stomachs or underneath the safety of a table as my observations noted. The “reading”
that the kindergarteners were doing in the excerpt acknowledges the intention to read but
also the developmental stage that precludes some children from being literate until they
are in an older grade. Tactile learning is evident from this vignette as students moved
themselves and engaged their bodies with the space in developmentally appropriate ways.
Since the children were not able to discern the meaning of the printed words on the page
they were working to infer meaning from the pictures which is a skill indicative of early
literacy.
Moreover, a teacher at NES shared that biophilic design elements also contributed
to the attractiveness of the library space to students. Another theory guiding this study is
research in the field of optimal learning environments and design. Biophilic design is a
method used by designers and architects that brings nature and natural elements into
interior spaces. Examples of biophilic design elements present in the school libraries of
this study were exposed natural wood beams, a wall of live plants, and large expansive
windows that provided a view into greenspace outside. Biophilic designers justify the
aesthetic in the claim that as mammals we are naturally inclined to surround ourselves
with nature, and thus the inclusion of natural elements into the architecture of our space
creates a positive, rich, and meaningful experience in that spaces. All of the school
libraries in this study had biophilic design elements; however, a teacher from NES noted
120

that she believed it was direct contributor to the attractive openness of the library space as
“the openness and the windows are unique, it's a feeling like you're outside even though
you're not outside. It doesn't feel closed in.”
In three other observations at the other schools, students also engaged with the
library space without the librarian’s direct supervision. I noticed that students explored
the open library space and selected a place to sit, lay down, hide, or even gather together
within spaces because they were so large and accommodating to so many bodies, albeit
small ones. At Crestwood Academy I documented a few moments while students were
selecting books to check out for the week. While some students were still perusing the
book stacks, a few other students were engaged with their books independently or in a
small group:
This is a second grade class of 15 boys, and every single one of them is
actively doing something in the library. While some boys are quietly
reading, I am almost mowed down by two running from one room of the
lower school library into another. They don’t stop and apologize, but they
do finally make their way to the drawer of DVDs. They seemed to have
known exactly where to go, and I suspect that they are looking for a
specific movie since they rapidly thumb through the full drawers like they
are on a mission. Some of their classmates are in a cozy room complete
with a mantel and fireplace happily giggling as they look through an
Eyewitness Spy book together around a short round table. One of their
classmates has claimed the tiny rocking chair and seems blissfully
engrossed in his book donning Bill Nye the Science Guy on the cover as
he rocks back and forth in a comfortable rhythm. Still another student is
tucked underneath a table that host an Apple computer for catalog
searches. He seems comfortable and content until he notices me noticing
him, and he squirms to turn in the other direction but does not give away
his hiding space to anyone else. The furniture in the main room is
developmentally appropriate—shorter chairs and tables with lower
profiles that fit the growing bodies of the young men in grades prekindergarten through third grade who use this space. Elaine claps a
rhythm and remarkably the boys drop what they are doing and repeat the
same rhythm. She calls them in to gather around the fireplace, and she
121

herself walks in towards the fireplace she turns to the young boys
sheltering beneath the table and says, “Hi! Can you come out and join us?”
As the group of boys gathers around the fireplace and Elaine, some flop
onto their stomachs and perch their heads on the hands propped up by the
elbows. (Fieldnotes, May 10, 2016)
At Crestwood Academy I was endeared to see so much vibrant energy within the space,
similar to the same energy at NES but different because the students were older, more
advanced readers, and all boys. Still, a consistent theme was students engaged in the
library space in a way that was developmentally appropriate to their age level and their
developing literacy skills. The observations at NES and Crestwood Academy are the
same in the sense that the students’ during each library time used the openness of the
space to find a book or DVD and to select a space of their own within the larger context
of the library itself to engage in literacy development. This type of engagement with
space is not possible within the small confines of a traditional classroom. The library in
all of the schools I visited were large enough for students to truly explore and engage
with the library in a developmentally appropriate way.
Novel Design Elements in the Library to Support Multiple Literacies
The openness of the each of the library spaces was an asset to the learning
experiences of early childhood students, but so too were the addition of novel
architectural features within the spaces as well. Each library had some element of
interest in the design of the space that impacted how students engaged with one another
and their literacy activities. For example, Country Day boasted the charming and quaint
stone cottage also used as a reading room for story time with the pre-primary grades
(Figure 3). This house was actually the original entrance to the school when it was first
122

built in the early 20th century; however, when the school hired an architectural firm to
reconfigure the entrance, the firm decided to keep the structure and convert it into the
reading room that exists today. I previously referenced the students’ anticipation before
entering the reading room, but the first impression of Country Day’s library was also
captured in my fieldnotes. The anteroom of the library was also unique and housed a
number of interesting focal points of its own. A collage of pictures illustrates the space
immediately preceding the library space in Figure 5, while my fieldnotes also captured
the following:
It’s a grand entrance into their library, and you can’t miss it because it is
literally the first thing you see when you enter the front doors and sign in
at the receptionist’s desk. The anteroom to the library is charmingly
decorated with life-size stuffed animal sheep and a cozy stone fireplace.
The two doors open to the library reveal high vaulted ceilings and exposed
beams, and windows that cast the most exceptional light on the entire
space. As I enter the library I see a beautiful and charming stone house
with a glass roof, probably to make the natural light permeate that space as
well. As I walked to the door of the house I think, “this would have been
my dream come true as a kid” because I did in fact dream of a playhouse
just as real and just as beautiful as this. Inside the house are tiny chairs for
elementary school students, wall to wall bookshelves at a friendly height
for the young learners, and a deep window seat and cushion cased in fabric
and that overlooks the interior of the library space (see Figure 3).
(Fieldnotes, May 11, 2016)
The novelty of the house in the space was an asset that Shannon as the librarian valued,
that the students through my observations enjoyed, and also was consistently mentioned
in the faculty and staff survey she sent out as an element in the space that added to its
allure and “beauty.” Novel architectural elements in all of the other school libraries were
also presented. High, vaulted ceilings, fireplaces, and window seats all allowed students
visual interest to explore their books quietly or to engage in a literacy activity. The
vauled ceilings and another view of Country Day’s cottage are shown in Figure 6.
123

Figure 4. Furniture, shelving, and rugs were arranged to create “soft borders” at the
New England School, a design strategy that helps differentiate distinct spaces within
larger open spaces.

Figure 6. The high vaulted ceilings and original cottage at Country Day School
are unique architectural features that contribute to the library’s space value at the
school.
125

Novel architectural features were present in Crestwood Academy as well. The
library space was redesigned in the early 2000s in collaboration with the lower school
librarian. Elaine recalled the process to redesign the space and the creation of the
fireplace which featured real wood logs and a maple wood mantel that matched the
wainscoting adorning the perimeter of the room. The fireplace had a faux flame painted
in a gradient of bright red, orange, and yellow paint on a sheet of thin wood. As my
earlier fieldnotes documented, the fireplace was a popular place to gather for boys from
the two different classes that I observed using the space. Its creation came out of a design
conundrum on what to do with a pillar in the middle of two rooms of the vast library that
could not be relocated because it was in fact the elevator shaft. Elaine recounted the
rationale for the redesign of the library space and explained how the fireplace came to be
a unique architectural feature:
We were lucky enough to have that be a part of our scope because of this
elevator shaft affected the whole building so they had to put some things
in. This became part of the scope and allowed us to expand this room. It
was the only room that was outside the footprint. We were confined by the
space. As I said, it was almost immediately apparent we have to put lower
school in here and upper school out there although we did try to figure out
ways to reverse that but it just wouldn't work. It was really important that
the space to be as flexible as possible… we wanted to be able to move the
furniture around. Even though they're really heavy, we do move them
around a lot to accommodate the different kinds of groupings that we like.
(Elaine, Interview, May 10, 2016)
Her mention of the intention for the space to be flexible is important as well. As a large,
open space the room was the most thoughtfully curated space of all the schools I visited,
and it was impressively flexible in design except for the elevator shaft that was creatively
turned into a cozy faux fireplace. NES was also designed to be flexible, and its novel
architectural features was the panoramic windows depicted and high vaulted ceilings.
126

William Penn’s brick walls and exceptionally high vaulted ceilings were remnants of the
spaces former glory as the school gymnasium. All of these features, however, evoked a
sense of grandeur that was noted by each of the participants and observed by me as well.
That sense of grandeur and the physically open space allowed teachers and students to
engage with literacy differently in the library than they could in their own classrooms:
students could wonder and roam, get comfortable, lose themselves within the stacks of
books, or cozy into a reading nook or next to the fireplace to read books or research
ideas.
Cozy Reading Nooks and Window Seats Create Safe Spaces for Children to
Engage with the Library and Develop Multiple Literacies. During my observations at
each school and interviews with the participants, the frequent mention of “cozying up”
and getting “comfortable” applied to how students interacted with the library space. In
my own practice as a teacher and in my current site of practice, I know that young
children especially actively seek small places within larger spaces to envelop them.
Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory posits that humans develop in
multiple environmental contexts. School, as one place that students interact with every
day, impacts the child’s development at the microsystem level. Following
Bronfenbrenner’s theory, students interact differently with spaces in order to make
meaning of the world and to understand their place in it. Additionally, Bruner’s (1957)
social learning theory suggesting that the environment is a valuable facilitator of the
learning process for young children coupled with Malaguzzi’s (2010) recognition that the
environment is in fact the “third teacher” of a classroom, or in this case the library, are
127

important theoretical frameworks to examine how the library spaces were used by
students each engaged in their own literacy activities. When given the opportunity to
freely wander in the library, students in all of the schools most frequently sought cozy
spaces and reading nooks to enjoy or peruse books. Some students even huddled into the
window seats and reading nooks with peers to engage in literature discussion and to share
ideas.
Three of the four schools possessed window seats, and all libraries had reading
nooks and comfortable seating to facilitate students using and interacting with the space.
The school that did not have any window seats was William Penn because the height of
the windows precluded window seats. However, the library team at William Penn
arranged comfortable seating for students, including a bright red children’s futon sofa
that looked like a couch but was quickly deconstructed into a large, flat cushion by a
group of five kindergarten students using their library time to look at picture books
during one of my observations. NES’s window seats, on the other hand, were so
abundant that they lined the perimeter of the early childhood section of the space as seen
in Figure 8 and 15. These window seats were a popular destination for the students
during their free time to peruse books for check-out. A teacher from NES even noticed
that as she saw the students grow up and develop into adolescents, they still coveted the
“nooks and crannies” present in the early childhood section of the large library. She
shared:
I think there's lots of nooks and crannies, places where kids can settle with
a book and feel comfortable. Pillows and carpets too and it's interesting
because the younger children are only really in one space…as you see
them get older and they feel completely comfortable to be the in the
128

younger spaces that they have already explored when they were younger.
It's really nice to see them as they get older, still creep into the little nooks
and crannies in the young section. (Patti, Interview, 2016)
This recollection of how the older students sought the “nooks and crannies” even in the
later late primary and early secondary grades suggests that those architectural features are
unique to were beloved spaces to students even as they grow out of the early
developmental stages of childhood and grow out of the early childhood. Sidney from
NES also shared that the window seats are a “welcoming” element of the space: “I think
having the places to sit and say ‘Come in, sit down and stay a while!’ I think having these
window seats are an important part of that.” Sidney’s librarian colleague, Hannah,
explained that the students prefer the window seats to the section of the library that just
boasts windows but no seating when she responded to my question about seating with,
“They really like the windows and benches.” From my observations and knowledge of
developing students, window seats are cozy and inviting thus making them ideal places to
huddle together to read.
Crestwood Academy’s one window seat was below a large window responsible
for much of the natural light of the entire space, and had a wide ledge that was used to
display even more books by their covers. An equally popular lounging space for the boys
at Crestwood Academy were two cushioned reading nooks that had no window but
instead had a circus-inspired awning draping over the boys as they huddled in pairs to
read in the space (see Figure 7, 8, and 10). My previously cited fieldnotes illustrated how
popular Country Day’s window seat in the house was amongst the students who were
able to use the house for their reading activities, as well as the reading nooks. Figures 8
129

shows the window seats of each library. Window seats that were frequently mentioned as
positive benefits to the library space in the data Shannon collected in her survey.
Teachers, librarians, and school leaders commented on the benefit of the window seats
and “nooks” within each library, noting that the seating spaces made students want to
come to the library to read instead of staying in their classrooms. Each of the school
stakeholder’s insights revealed that the presence of unique architectural features within
the space added to the attractiveness of the library as a location within the school that
uniquely promoted tactile and early literacy skills. Students were able to move furniture
around, expand into space, and tuck into other spaces or “nooks” in order to find a
comfortable place to talk about or explore the books they had chosen to read.
Furthermore, these distinctive architectural elements allowed students to create their own
deep, individualized engagement with the space. Figure 8 highlights the window seating
in each of the four schools and reveals how the cushioned seats and natural light made the
window seats appealing to students as comfortable reading spaces.

130

Academy built into the wall of the library space. This

students during their independent reading and book
check-out time.

as part of the library design. From top row to bottom row: window seats lining the
perimeter of the New England School also revealing the view onto the campus green

132

While the window seats in three of the school libraries were undoubtedly safe and
comfortable places for children to nestle into while reading and perusing books, William
Penn’s library as the school’s former gymnasium had windows too high to allow for
window seats. Instead, the librarians used a comfortable red futon sofa nestled between
two tall book stacks to reproduce a similar feeling of comfort and cozy. As this red futon
was the only one in William Penn’s library, the librarians may consider adding more
comfortable seating around various parts of the library in order to allow more students an
opportunity to explore the library space and engage with books.
Whimsical Design Elements to Support Multiple Literacy Skills
While novel architectural design elements added charm to each library’s open
concept design, the whimsical décor in each space also mediated the students’ tactile,
printed, and digital learning experiences in the library in ways that was not replicable in
classrooms. The thoughtful attention to the library’s aesthetic décor by the school
librarians also contributed to the development of students’ literacy skills as well. Each
school library created learning spaces that seamlessly blended the cognitive needs of
early childhood students learning how to read with whimsical elements that added to each
library’s open and cozy charm and that were also necessary for students to navigate the
space. From my observations and interviews, the whimsy of aesthetic décor served
multiple purposes: first, to help children feel inspired by the space so that their
imaginations had physical items to wonder about and to think creatively about, and also
to serve as visual markers around the large open library space. For some of the students
133

who were not yet able to read the library signage and genre markers, the whimsical
characters and animals adorning the large spaces helped students locate books or places
in the library easily and quickly. Finally, the whimsical elements tacitly invited students
into the space so that they could see and imagine themselves as readers and users of the
library.
A library, which historically is an extremely print-rich space, could be an
intimidating space for children. Large, open spaces are often overwhelming to young
children and a library raises that intimidation for a child not yet tall enough to peer over
the shelving units. The school librarians in this study were able to leverage the openconcept design of the libraries along with the novel architectural features to create spaces
for children that felt comfortable but were still developmentally appropriate. Children
often have a difficult time navigating around libraries labeled by genres and call
numbers— concepts of which early childhood students have not yet developed an
understanding. The school librarians in this study created different spaces in their library
to help young students navigate and explore their library spaces in comfortable ways,
which ultimately opened new pathways for children engage in tactile, digital, and printed
literacy activities in the space, and for children to use the space itself as a teacher
facilitating their experience in the library. For example, all of the school librarians used
whimsical displays as visual cues, creative labels on book spines, and were thoughtful
about displaying as many books by their covers as possible.
Another clear theme that emerged from the data was that library décor was
intentionally designed to assist students who cannot yet read navigate the large and
134

expansive library spaces. The whimsical displays therefore had dual purposes: to add to
the space value of the library aesthetically, and to help students locate and access books
easily. This is a powerful strategy by librarians. In a typical independent school lower
school library serving students in grades pre-kindergarten through five, only 30% of
students are fluent readers. This statistic is not because the students need remediation but
instead is appropriate instruction for that developmental stage of childhood. Therefore,
how do the majority of students in independent lower schools just learning how to read
access books that are tightly displayed on bookshelves by their spine and in a seemingly
abstract cataloging system of large numbers and decimals? Large, visually
impressionable and whimsical displays of each of the four libraries in this study had a
fundamental and important role developing early literacy skills for students to both
navigate the library space and select books that met their individual interests. Figures 713 show how each library space added fun and whimsical yet also large figures, puppets,
and fictional characters into each space help students locate both books and themselves
within the library. The purpose of the whimsical displays was dual: first to add charm,
whimsy and imagination to the large open space of each library, but also to help students
physically locate books in certain areas around the library or themselves if they were in
an area of the library with tall stacks of bookshelves.
The whimsical displays in NES were memorable design elements intentionally
added to the space to serve as welcoming decoration, but also as visual cues or markers
identifying stacks of books from afar and to children learning the Dewey Decimal
system. The library had a zoo of giant papier mâchéd animals perched high atop stacks
135

of bookshelves, and in some cases the animals were quoted with witty directions or
information about the contents beneath them. Some of the most prominent papier mâché
figures in NES are evident in Figure 9; however, what these corresponding photographs
do not capture is the first impression I had viewing all of the animals together from the
entrance of the library. I chronicled the moment in a section of my fieldnotes:
This library space is incredibly exciting. I enter the space and walk around
the library captivated by the huge papier mâché animals regally guarding
the stacks of bookshelves. They are so large that they draw your eye up to
the vaulted ceilings and one can’t help but notice how open the space feels
despite being full of nearly 27,000 items. I see all different animals- a
panda, a bull, a duck, and dolphin just in one space, and then papier
mâchéd bees hanging from the ceiling. Bees are a theme I guess, as I see a
display of stuffed animal bees and figurines behind one glass enclosure,
and then signage directing students to stacks of books that are also
adorned with bee images. (Fieldnotes, May 9, 2016)
These spectacular figures drew my eyes up to the vaulted ceiling, excited me as I traced
each animal with my eyes, and ignited a childish excitement to explore the space.
Josephine later explained the history of the animals and elaborated one purpose of the
animals: to help students locate and access books within the large and open space. For
example, she shared that if a student asked where a book was located, she could respond
and say, “It’s underneath the bull!” (see Figure 9). Josephine explained that the large
animal figures are actually student creations that every kindergarten class collaborates on
together, and then Josephine and her librarian colleagues select an animal to display on
the library shelves. She remarked how endearing it was to have students enter the space
to see the animal that they helped to create displayed proudly above a stack of books.

school library. The movie prop dinosaur was featured in Jurassic Park and also
served as a visual cue helping students to locate non-fiction texts in the library,
including the school’s abundant number of picture books on dinosaurs.

137

Crestwood Academy’s whimsical displays also made a notable first impression.
When I first entered the library foyer I was greeted by a life-size, and from my
estimation, a very real looking replica of R2-D2 from the famed Star Wars original
trilogy that continued to flash its blue lights as I passed by the front desk. My fieldnotes
also described another impressionable dinosaur figures and other whimsical elements of
Crestwood Academy’s library space as well:
I walk into the library and am greeted by a dinosaur. Literally. He is
about ten feet tall, but situated on top of a four-foot tall book shelf, he
towers over me so that I have the perfect view of his sharp teeth.
Apparently, he is a prop from one of the Jurassic Park films, a collectable
that one of the teachers secured and donated to the school. The dinosaur is
perched next to a large but seemingly dwarfed papier mâché camel
adorned with the Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter series and an untied
bowtie that hangs around its neck. This library has incredible character,
not just from the menagerie of animals and props adorning nearly every
flat surface, but also in design: maple wood wainscoting climbs five feet
up each wall, but the reading nooks are inviting and cozy. In fact, two
boys sit in one of the cushioned nooks covered by a circus-like awning lit
by a stained-glass lamp. They’re flipping through their books and talking.
I see that they are reading different books from the Captain Underpants
series. One boy says, “How many pages is your book?” and as his reading
partner quickly riffles to the end of his book, the first boy boasts, “Mine is
144!” The other boy replies, “Mine is 129! Oh, dude, look at this!”
(Fieldnotes, May 10, 2016)
Figure 9 shows the view as students enter the library. Elaine mentioned later in our
interview that the dinosaur was actually a prop in one of the Jurassic Park films, and that
the science teacher “had a connection” so the dinosaur ended up in the library. It sits
above the non-fiction section where the plethora of dinosaur books live, a huge and
exciting visual cue for students who perhaps cannot yet read the written word to orient
themselves to the section of the large space to find the dinosaur books. Elaine describe
all of the displays in the library as “really engaging” and shared that she looks to add to
138

the spaces aesthetic with student selections as well. She shared too that some of the
stuffed animals on display are donated by the boys who as they grow older and transition
to the upper school library space and seek out the animals that they remembered giving
her to add to the space. Some of the stuffed animals that now sit atop one of the large
stack of books in her library in Figure 11 are some of the beloved stuffed animal
donations guarding some of the bookshelves in the connecting rooms of the lower school
library, as well as a photograph of the library’s faux fireplace and flanking rocking chairs.

and architectural features in the space like the library’s fireplace

shaft.

Students at William Penn
Friends School also had a hand
in creating some of the
whimsical displays within the
space. The two librarians have
an award-winning collaboration
with the art teacher to create
large puppets (see Figure 12)
based on either characters in a
selected work in children’s
literature, or an original play
from a local author. The puppets

School.

serve as a welcoming presence at the entrance of the library, and are also exemplars for
the students currently working on creating puppets—a tedious and laborious project that
takes patience, focus, and collaboration. More whimsy was added to the space by the
student created artwork depicting an interpretation of the admired Very Hungry
Caterpillar and Where the Wild Things Are. Creatively painted chairs made for small
children also add to the allure of William Penn’s library space, and were acquired after
the author from each story painted onto the chair visited the school. Country Day’s
whimsy was clear as well. The “new book nook” is not accessible without passing by
two life-size stuffed sheep that flank the sides of one of the two stone fireplaces greeting
students, teachers, and parents at the entrance of the library. The nook’s carefully

School and Country Day can be seen in Figure 13 and Figure 14.

The whimsical additions to each library space added aesthetic interest to the space
as well as intentional visual cues for students to navigate the large library spaces in a
playful and developmentally friendly way for students in early childhood grades. All of
the school librarians interviewed mentioned the inaccessible nature of the Dewey
Decimal cataloging system to guide students to books, and used alternative visual cues to
assist in the discovery of and access to books within their respective collections. The
visual cues were playful, whimsical, related to the identifiable characters from books or
movies, or like the dinosaur in Crestwood Academy, marked a section of the library
where a collection of books were shelfed. However, while these whimsical displays
helped to direct students to different areas of the library, gaining access to the abundant
number of books in the collection was also identified in the data as a strategic and
intentional aspect of the librarians’ practice that helped students mediate their literacy
experiences in the space.
Engaging Book Displays and Creative Labeling to Support Emerging
Literacy Skills. Whimsical displays added visual interest and were strategically placed
around the four different libraries, yet another more detailed aspects of the displays
emerged in the data as well. Traditionally, library spaces for fully literate students and
adults are sequenced and shelfed using the Dewey Decimal system. Rather, the majority
of books in typical lower school library spaces are displayed on shelves by their spine—a
sliver of visibility to a perusing reader, and a developmentally unfriendly system of
display to students who are not yet able to read. For students who cannot yet read, the
books crammed onto a bookshelf with only their spine displaying is a challenging way to
142

access books, put books back, and even shift through to browse. In fact, lower school
teachers often display books in “book bins” in their classrooms so that students can see
the front cover and large title of each book rather than the slim lettering of the title
printed on its spine. NES’s librarian team was impressively attuned to the needs of
preliterate students in their library space. They had a strategic mission to display as many
books as possible by its cover. At one point in our conversation Sidney candidly reveals
how important book covers are to lower school students, and how a terrible book cover
could result in a complete pass over of the book regardless of the quality and depth of the
story within:
With books, I'll read it and I'll be like, “It's such a good book! If only the
designer had a different approach to the cover because it appeals to the
wrong age group!” or it's just not what I see kids picking up. I think cover
plays a huge part. That's where librarians can also come into play and say,
"Hey, this is a really good book. Ignore this terrible cover. Trust us that it's
a really good story." (Sidney, Interview, May 9, 2016)

Her admittance that students do in fact judge books based on their cover was based on
experience, and her insight was inspiring in the sense that she naturally assumed the role
of someone who could champion a book’s worth even if the cover art was terrible. When
Hannah from NES gave me a short tour of her early childhood space where she teachers
pre-kindergarten through second grade students, she pointed out book bins that were
painted by parents and teachers to depict popular book series or characters. The strategy
of those book bins was simply to have preliterate students notice the characters on the
bins, and to perhaps explore the books within the bins if they were of interest. A yellow
bin containing the Where’s Waldo? series sat atop a cushioned window seat next to other
143

bins, all housing books displayed by their covers so that students could see the front of
the books rather than their spines. The fiction section of the early childhood library was
displayed the same way: bins occupied the bookshelves so that cover art of each book
was displayed prominently. Books atop the bookshelves were also strategically displayed
to help pre-literate and emerging readers make connections to the world around them, and
to the curriculum. Each member of the librarian team at NES referenced their intentional
and strategic design of book displays, but Josephine elaborated the most on the team’s
intention to display as many books as possible:
People don't realize that [displays] are [part of] the job…if there's a
holiday or an event or a month, if it's black history month or if it's poetry
month. In April, we had poetry everywhere and we had pockets with
pocket poems in them that kids could take and kids were making spine
label poems and we were taking pictures and putting them up and that
kind of thing. There were poetry books everywhere. This last display is all
spring, flowers… so it's whatever we feel like kind of or if there's
something going on around the school. How we choose them is very
subjective, although always with certain things in the back of our mind,
sort of a range of kids and levels and different styles…Fiction? Is it nonfiction? A mix of both? That kind of thing. Displaying a range of
diversity so that the covers reflect the diversity of the school and so that
the diversity of opinion and stuff, so that kind of thing is always part of
our thinking when we're grabbing books and putting them up on display.
The key component is trying just to catch people's eye and to want them.
People forget that, “Oh I can take that book and check it out!”, they think
it's sacred if it's on display and so it's a constant training to be like, “No,
actually we want you to take that book, that's why we put it up like that!”
It's not just for pretty, it's actually for use. Classroom teachers will come
in and they'll grab one or two and be like, “I'm so sorry, I'm decimating
your display!” and I'm like “That's okay, we want you to, do it, take them,
use them!” (Josephine, Interview, May 9, 2016)
Josephine’s candidness in explaining the subjective yet intentional decision making that
goes into creating a display within NES’s library space can be analyzed for the
perspective of early childhood, too: pre-primary students experience an intense stage of
144

development when making connections to the world around them and to what they are
learning is the classroom is essential to the long-term learning process. For example, a
student of diverse family background would most likely gravitate to a book on display
depicting a family similar to his or hers as a characteristically inquisitive and ego-centric
stage of development. Sidney also discussed the purpose and her method involved in
selecting which books to display:
We're always working on having books out. Right now, the ones over
there [pointing to a specific area of the lower school library section] in
folk tales, for example, for the first grade, we read around the library. We
read through different sections of the library and talk about them. We're on
folktales and fairytales right now, so I put out a bunch of the books we
read last week in the hopes that they would want to take one. Sometimes
they're new books. Very often they're new books. Sometimes they're just
books with interesting covers. Sometimes they're books that are favorites
of ours. We really try to show a variety of different types of people on
covers, different ethnicities, different races, different genders, different
locations the books take place. (Sidney, Interview, May 9, 2016)
And Hannah added:
Last week it was Women's History so we had a nice display of women's
books. We did poetry month and we had lots of wonderful poetry all
around the library. That's really fun…I think when kids come in, and
adults, to see, to be stimulated visually by what they see and perhaps they
will go look a little farther. (Hannah, Interview, May 9, 2016)
NES’s library team was impressively focused on creating book displays that
related to what students were learning in the classroom, school-themed initiatives
like Women’s History Month, and genre studies like poetry. They also had a
system for labeling books to help students find a just right book to aid and support
their printed literacy development. By using specific colors of tape on the spine
of each book in the library, the librarian team visually catalogs books in a way
that supersedes Dewey’s system, and that is easy for students to navigate. Patti
145

from NES shared her observations of the how the colored tape system, in this
scenario she spoke about “pink tape,” to label books. She noted that labeling the
books in her opinion actually helped her first grade students develop the sound
fluency and comprehension skills indicative of a developing reader:
We don't open [the pink tape section] until the end of first grade. That's the
piece of allowing the children who feel like chapter books to wait until the
end of the year. They’re allowed to explore the picture book section with
more vigor. Because they're not totally drawn to the chapter books but
that's all they want to take out because they perceive that as being what
makes a reader a good reader. It also pushes them to stay in the early
reader section as long as they can because I think we do battle with parents
around what's appropriate content-wise in what kids are reading. [Parents]
shouldn't disregard kids’ reading books multiple times because they’re
working on fluency and comprehension. Some of our kids who come into
first grade and even kindergarten reading already, comprehension is going
to be their sticky spot because they crack the code on their own but never
really learn to think deeply about what they were reading, they just go
through the motions. We try and keep them there as long as we can. (Patti,
Interview, May 9, 2016)
This teacher’s mention of “cracking the code” is common parlance among early
childhood educators and refers to a student’s ability to read and interpret the
pictures of a book to understand the general story. It also refers to the ability of a
child to read just enough of the words of the page to comprehend parts of the
story, hence passing comprehension based questions on assessments and
assumingly “reading” text that in fact may be too challenging. The intentional
labeling of books with pink tape in the section of NES’s library was a strategic
effort by the library team to assist students, teachers, and parents in locating
books that are appropriate for them easily and quickly. As the teacher explained
in her interview, the tape is also helpful in ensuring that students do not read a
book that is too challenging for them, and so that they develop the essential skills
146

such as fluency and comprehension in reading. Figure 15 highlights the library
team’s creative and intentional book displays that were developmentally
appropriate for early childhood students to engage in pre-literacy activities.
Librarians at William Penn Friends School also devised a unique labeling system
to help pre-literate students find books that were relevant to their learning and interests.
The system was also helpful to teachers and parents looking to find a book able to make a
deeper connection to their daily morning meeting of the Quaker tradition. Rebecca, one
of the school librarians, explained the labeling system and how it coordinated to the
beautifully painted and whimsical miniature chairs designed for young students. When
an author visited the school, the librarian team had a chair painted in that author’s honor,
and then created a labeling system to identify books on the shelf that were signed copies
or had been read aloud to students by the author themselves. She recalled:
We have the books that are coordinated with our chair [authors]. If you
have a chair in your honor, you have a rainbow on your spine. And then
we also have books that are meaningful worship books and they have a
special designation on their spine. What it means is that they are very good
books for starting out a meaningful worship or, in the third and fourth
grade year a child will come in and borrow a book to get them in the right
space to have a meaningful worship. Those are all designated. We have
the books that were on the fifty favorite books on that 50th anniversary,
and they have a special designation on their spine.
William Penn’s library space displayed books intentionally to support the students’
learning needs and their labeling system was created to help school stakeholders,
including students, navigate the space. Moreover, the displays in the early childhood
section of William Penn were also arranged in books bins and by their covers, in addition
to a book tree that spun around and was a popular display tool for the pre-kindergarten
students that I observed (see Figure 16).
147

Figure 15. The book displays at the New England School were deliberately
designed to assist students who could not yet read the titles of each book spine to
see the cover of the books instead. Also, large bins housed the books so that they
would more easily be displayed by cover.
The design of each library space and how it was arranged by librarians to
intentionally create an environment that was welcoming and developmentally appropriate
is illustrative of Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory: not only are children
interacting with the library environment, but the library itself as a system is shaped by the
librarians based on the students’ needs as developing children and their interests as
developing readers in a world that necessitates literacy to thrive. How each of the school
librarians fostered this system of interaction between student and the environment was
148

unique, but what they all did do was something different from what traditional library
spaces have historically done: rely on the Dewey Decimal system to catalog and display
books.
Each school in this study deviated from the typical “Dewey Decimal System” to
locate books and used visual cues or other labeling systems on the books spines to help
emergent readers locate and find books in the collection. Each school may also benefit
from rethinking traditional display models to incorporate a display system that is more
similar to what we see in book stores: display tables in strategic locations around the
space that are filled with multiple copies of new releases or books of interest not
displayed by their spines, but rather displayed by their covers and in piles so as to entice
and introduce readers to the story within by the covers, or at the very least the book’s
front cover and back synopsis.

This “book store” method of display allows children to

engage with books in new ways, gives students access to books that they perhaps would
overlook if the book was indeed displayed only by the title on its spine, and invites
students to pick up the book to peruse it. Each school library in this study had the space
to pilot such a display method, and each library also had the abundance of books to curate
a thoughtful table—or two tables—to invite students up to the display to find new books
to pique their interests.
The Dewey Decimal system for cataloging books is an important part of
maintaining a collection, but each of the school libraries’ approach to alternatively label
books for students indicates that we as educators perhaps need to rethink the purpose of
Dewey’s system of cataloging books especially for children emerging in their literacy
149

skills. Moreover, the librarians in this study corroborated what the librarians at my own
site of practice state about Dewey’s system: it is a wonderful system for librarians to
know where and how to locate books for children, but it is not a friendly system that
lends itself to being easily understood of navigated by children in the early elementary
grades.

Figure 16. Different book displays at William Penn School
allowed students the ability to engage with displays at different
height levels and in different formats, displays that ultimately
assisted their journey to find different literacy pathways within
the library space.

CHAPTER 6
IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

In approaching this study through the lens of a research practitioner, I hoped to
inform my own inquiry about the purpose of school libraries in early childhood settings
to better understand what meaning making students engaged in while using the space.
Considering that 100% of the student population at my site of practice is developing
fluency in reading and have not yet reached full literacy, I wondered what and if our
school library assumed another role different from that of a school library serving
students along the pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade continuum. What I discovered
is that the school library for students in the early childhood grades is critical to their
development of multiple literacy skills in today’s digital age, and that the school library
and librarian are teachers who help students create and develop deep pathways to literacy
through both their explicit and implicit word: explicitly the library is identifiably the
structure of the school that maintains and houses curated information; implicitly,
however, it is the symbol of life, intellectual freedom, and judgment free safety.
Explicitly, the school librarian is the curator of library collection and the school
community’s archetype of inspired and informed inquiry; implicitly, they acted as
emotional architects that supported students’ growth as literate persons.
The libraries in this study were not quiet spaces where students were hushed and
forced to stay silent, but rather vibrant centers of discussion and investigation that often
left the architectural confines of the library structure to infuse the same vibrant life and
spirit of inquiry in traditional classrooms. Learning in these library spaces was dynamic,
151

imaginative, and personal to the students. These images contradict the stereotypical
image of a library space dominated by shelves of books stacked in a vast vacuum of
silence, therefore holding new implications for what and how school libraries in today’s
function to support school communities.

Summary of Findings
While I began drafting the initial set of codes during one of the first iterations of
data analysis, I employed the Word Cruncher in the Atlast.ti software out to query the
frequency of words across all sources of my data. After I culled through the common
conjunctions, prepositions, and articles of speech, the words “relationships” and
“comfortable” emerged as two themes that carried significant relevance to what I heard
and saw during my site visits. Why this struck me was because these two words were not
at all in my purview after researching for my literature review on the qualities and aspects
that make a successful library program in schools today. It is true that the school
librarians in this study worked hard to establish collaborative and trusting relationships
with teachers and students in comfortable spaces as a measure of their professional
success. It is also concerning that the AASL standards fail to capture this important role
that relationships with students and teachers have in burgeoning new and creative
learning experiences for students.
Going back through my interview transcripts, I noticed that Shannon mentioned
her frustration with the static and fixed standards as well while she shared how she
designed learning experiences for her students in the library: “[One standard is]: ‘Presents
152

information in a clear format’ Am I creating curriculum around these different things?
Sure. How helpful are they? I don’t know the answer to that.” (Shannon, Interview,
May 11, 2016). While Shannon’s questioning of the ambiguousness of the library
standard is ironically clear, it informs my understanding of very clear and important
aspects of the library program that are completely left out of the standards: the power of
relationships in schools, most especially relationships established and nurtured by the
school librarian.
In the final phase of the study, I examined the archival data and online artifacts
from each school to better understand how school libraries today develop multiple
literacy skills in students within early childhood settings. Together, all of the data
compiled from individual interviews, my observations and fieldnotes from each site visit,
and an examination of artifacts were used to identify the following themes:


School libraries are spaces that have the power to shape and unite
school communities. Librarians helped to shape the schools’ cultures
around teaching and learning, and the physical space united
community members.
o School librarians have an influential role in shaping the
teaching and learning culture within the school community
based on their central location and perceived roles as curators
of information, ideas and resources. Librarians also serve to
influence the teaching and learning community of the school
by:
153



Curating relationships with teachers and collaborating
with them to compliment early literacy instruction



Collaborating with teachers to support and shape
classroom curriculum



Helping students to connect with books that they will
enjoy and love reading, thus developing desirable
reading habits at a young age



Supporting the schools’ missions to be diverse and
inclusive communities; curating equity and becoming
agents of diversity and inclusivity so that all students
can find and identify their social identities in the library
collection and in the stories told by librarians



Curating information using technology as a tool to
mediate the learning experience for students and
teachers



School libraries are invaluable community spaces—they had an
unrivalled value in comparison to other communal spaces within a
school based on central location, mission, and purpose.



School libraries are worthwhile places for school leaders to invest
financial, instructional, and social resources because libraries are:
o Welcoming places that host community events for all school
stakeholders
154

o Safe, judgement free places to imagine and inquire
o

Evocative in design

o Promote the ideals of each school’s mission and values
o Librarians are also the emotional architects of the library space,
a concept that makes the library even more valuable of a space
when considering other spaces around a school. Librarians
promote an emotional climate in the library that exudes safety,
comfort, non-judgement, acceptance, and imagination


School librarians leverage the design elements within the library space
to open and facilitate the development of multiple literacies.
Librarians did this by:
o Creating comfortable and flexible seating arrangements and
areas, including cushioned window seats near natural light and
views of the outdoors
o Integrating whimsical design elements that were aesthetically
appealing additions to the space but that also served the
purpose of visual cues for students looking for books amid the
more expansive library space
o Establishing book displays that represented student learning
inside their traditional classroom spaces

155

o Making labels on books that offered more than text—color and
icons were used to identify books for students emerging in
literacy skill development
Limitations of This Study
The data collected and analyzed for this study is limited by scope and location.
My research proposal included a second tier of research using a case study method to
further investigate themes and ideas that emerged from my analysis of data collected
from the week I spent researching schools in Boston. My research plan for the second
tier’s more in depth case study research included follow-up interviews with all
participants from the first tier, a focus group of teachers, and also engagement with
students so that they took could represent their understanding, interaction, and value
placed on the school library through photo elicitation. Students, especially students in
early childhood, are often unabashedly honest. Students are also a school’s most
important stakeholder, and the central figure in all of the literature guiding my conceptual
framework. For this reason, capturing the students’ perspective was to help me better
understand how they perceived their engagement with the school library and how they
constructed an understanding of the space. Although it was an interesting perspective
absent to and limiting this study, it is an important point to address in future research.
Additionally, my week of intense research in Boston during the first tier of research gave
me a wonderful amount of data to analyze and findings that I have presented in this paper
represent my research questions well; however, my location 450 miles away from the

156

sites selected precluded a convenient time begin the case study research after my analysis
of the first set of data collected.
Another limitation of this study was the focus on librarians’ roles as literacy
developers in isolation from their other roles serving the school library as organizers of
the collection. Curating the collection is no doubt important to the work of a school
library, as this study explains; however maintaining the collection is also a large and
often time consuming task for librarians. My research questions did not explore or probe
the functional and organizational roles that librarians assume as custodians of the
collection. Had I engaged participants during interviews about their roles in this
capacity, it may have given me better insight into how libraries prioritize their own
perceived responsibilities in comparison to my focused questions about their perceived
role in supporting multiple literacy skill development in students.
While the findings of this study celebrates the symbolic and functional purposes
of school libraries, a critical analysis of each of the school libraries engenders an critique
of the libraries of this study as well. Specifically, elements of library science that this
study does not capture is a limitation to fully understanding standard practices in the
librarianship; each of the four schools intentionally and thoughtfully curated their
collections based on the school’s constituents and mission, yet all of the schools
maintained their collections differently and for different reasons. Country Day, for
example, had a large collection of books that had not been maintained for years, thus the
library collection failed to meet American Library Association’s (ALA) standards for
weeding. Librarians from NES, on the other hand, mentioned weeding as a part of their
157

daily routine while reshelving books. Weeding is a term used in library science to
“remove materials from a library collection in a systematic and deliberate way” and it is a
consistent and ongoing part of the collection maintenance that ensure library materials are
current and in a condition of quality (ALA website, 2017). In fact, conditions of quality
are important to a school library and are predicated on whether or not the books are
misleading in information (if information is outdated or obsolete), if books are in unfit
physical appearance to entice students, are superseded by newer copies or too many
copies of one book, if book titles are trivial or inappropriate in interest or reading level,
and if books in the collection are not relevant to the curriculum at the school (ALA
website, 2017). Curating a thoughtful collection was most certainly a characteristic
shared by each of the libraries in this study, yet a standard on weeding a school’s library
collection to maintain its accuracy and quality was not revealed in this study.
No school library in this study was an exemplar in illustrating how technology
and libraries are fused in today’s time; while digital technology is undoubtedly ubiquitous
in schools today, no school’s approach to integrating technology into their library
program was clear from the data I collected. Therefore, data collection and analysis for
my research question on how librarians perceive technology to impact their role and the
function of the library was also limited in this study. Librarians seemed to quickly
answer my questions about technology in the library by identifying it as a tool that helps
them access information and books for students faster and quicker, but not as a central
component essential to their roles as curators and facilitators of multiple literacy skill
development. Three out of the four schools had large makerspaces and none of the
158

schools advocated converting the library space into technology rich spaces to support
project based learning. Therefore, my analysis focuses more on the roles of librarians as
they see themselves, as teachers and school leaders see them, and as I saw them after
triangulating all of the data collected. My focus is also on the design of the library space
and how students in early childhood and early elementary grades use the space to develop
multiple literacies, with the discovery that librarians use digital devices to give students
fast and easy access to information as the connection between the libraries and
technology in today’s digital age.
Libraries take on new roles and serve new purposes for students today, yet the
challenge to the traditional identity to these spaces for young children was determined to
be less controversial than perhaps for older students who are already fluent readers. For
my inquiry into how early childhood students interact with library spaces to develop
multiple literacies could potentially inform school leaders and community stakeholders
on how best to support students learning in a digital age, and could also support the call
to keep early childhood libraries especially well-resourced and curated as important space
for students to develop multiple literacy skills. Yet, this is also a limitation to the study
as well: well-resourced libraries of independent schools are in stark contrast to the school
libraries in some public school districts in the United States, a notion that brings privilege
into the discourse of the findings of this study as well. While the findings of this study
may be generalizable with other independent schools, they may not be so with the
majority of public schools in America today. Moreover, the literature presented earlier in
this study highlights the characterization of independent schools as schools for the
159

nation’s elite—places where the children of the scholarly go to receive an education from
racially and economically privileged backgrounds.
The context in which independent school children live is comparably different to
most children in the United States, especially those who grow up in economically
disadvantaged communities. Neuman and Celano (2001) found that access to printed
book in low income neighborhoods was one book per 300 children compared to middle
income neighborhoods that boasted 13 books per child. The researchers also noted the
absence of school libraries and public libraries in this study, highlighting that “other
avenues of access [to books] were limited or lacking. School libraries in poor
communities were closed and sometimes boarded up, unlike school libraries in middle
income neighborhoods, which were thriving” (Dickinson & Neuman, 2001). The
number of books children have access to is a predictor of reading achievement and
academic success. Research by Evans, Kelley, Sikora, and Treiman (2014) found a
correlation between the number of books in a child’s home with their academic
achievement in 27 different countries in the world: children who grew up with access to
more books in their homes attained higher reading achievement scores but also attained a
higher level of education (Evans, et al., 2014). With these facts in mind, this study’s
findings are narrowed down to be generalizable for a small percentage of students
attending well-resourced schools and from economically privilege schooling and living
contexts.

Implications for Practice and Recommendations for Future Research
Since these four well-resourced independent school libraries proved to be
invaluable community spaces that enriched the teaching and learning community in
unsuspecting ways, the implications of not having a school library in a school are
particularly distressing to me as an educator. My own experiences at the School District
of Philadelphia showed that school libraries were often the first spaces in a school to be
cut when a budget crisis plagues the district. Libraries are usually one of the largest
space within a school’s floorplan and they encumber a large percentage of the academic
budget compared to other classrooms in order to maintain a quality collection. Pressure
to regain academic time in classrooms in order to prepare students for the state
standardized test meant that special classes including library time have been removed
from student schedules completely. Herein lies the threatening future of schools without
libraries: static and rote learning experiences mediated with paper and pencil resources
that give no attention to the personal relevancy of the course content and which
inherently stifles the possibility of creativity and imagination.
In 2015, the School District of Philadelphia had five media specialists serving in
schools within a District of over 135,000 students. Why this also devastates me as an
educator is because we as a country have legislated that every inmate in our prison
system has the right to a certified librarian and a library collection, yet we do not legislate
and expect the same for our nation’s children in school. I am not suggesting that we take
away the freedom of information and the right that incarcerated men and women have to
access a library, but rather highlight the disconnect in our thinking about education when
161

access to information and ideas is not prioritized for young minds. This study illuminates
the power of the school librarian to shape a child’s knowledge of the world by facilitating
access to information and ideas. This study also suggests that libraries can no longer be
viewed as quiet places where silent reading and isolated research happens. On the
contrary, school libraries are places young students especially go to wander, to talk about
books and ideas, and to imagine their place in the world. The implications of the study
therefore have an impact on specific school stakeholders both within and outside the
independent school context.
Implications for School Leaders Considering Closing a School Library. The
ability of librarians to curate relationships with students and teachers impacted the
school’s culture around teaching and learning in this study. Library standards promoted
by AASL were not the forces driving the school library’s purpose as a center for inquiry
and imagination. Moreover, classroom teachers in early childhood centers depend on the
school librarian to curate book selections based on their students likes and dislikes so that
they can balance the rigor of reading instruction with the freedom of thought and
imagination necessary to instill a love of reading and greater fluency in young students.
Closing a school library could have dire consequences for a school if teachers are
relegated to teaching reading with leveled libraries and without the support of a skilled
librarian to supplement the development of traditional literacy skills. How do schools
maintain the life and vibrancy symbolic of a place of learning without a school library to
center and promote that mission? Abundance of resources is not an issue in the digital

162

age of information—at the very least, school libraries could maintain the online catalogs
and resources that printed resources also provide if budgets are restrictive.
Style (1988) wrote that curriculum in schools should serve as a window and as a
mirror into the lives of the students which it serves, noting that there are always plural
ways of seeing and that students connect personally to mirrors but develop as global
citizens when they are given a window into another person’s life experiences (Style,
1988). In this way, school libraries could be a one important way for a student to make
sense of a mirrored life experience within a book, as well as an access point into the
window of another’s life. This resonates specifically with me when I think of students I
interviewed for a pilot study in Philadelphia and in an oral history interview I conducted
with a history professor in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It follows then that if a school
library must close then school leaders should consider advocating and facilitating the use
of the city’s public library in order to keep pathways to literacy open and accessible to
their students because classroom libraries are not sufficient in solely doing so.
My pilot study inquired into how African American male students narrated their
learning experiences at one of the schools in the District that graduated the most students
in their same demographic. My study sought to inform the District on ways they could
replicate student experiences in schools that statistically defied the odds and graduated a
significant percentage of students labelled nationally and by the District as “at risk”
graduates. Two of the students interviewed mentioned that someone in their family took
them to the public library to check out books and implied that they knew learning was
important because of those experiences. Moreover, a history professor from Cambridge,
163

Massachusetts, who grew up in Brooklyn, New York, recalled the power of the Brooklyn
public library to serve as a window into a world outside of his neighborhood. He
recalled:
My mother would come home late Friday night, go to sleep, but then wake
up early Saturday morning to get us all dressed and on the subway so that
we could go to the Brooklyn Public Library. Books are really quite
liberating... On our trips to the library, when I wasn’t old enough to read
yet, my mother would actually show me pictures of colleges and
universities… I think for that kid, and for a lot of kids actually, the power
of books is important. I think for the men and women who are in the
prison college program, books are the gateway to a world beyond those
gates and those fences that they see every day. Books allow them to have
at least some sense of control and influence over their destiny.
(Professor, Oral History Interview, October 2014)
Books are liberating. Literacy opens windows into worlds that are invisible to some
students and adults, and both the history professor’s insights and the references the young
men made during my pilot study affirm that books are the vehicle through which our
imaginations explore new realties and potentials. I consider my own experience with
books and libraries, too. As a young girl, I remember checking out books in the library
about heroines that inspired me to pursue my own deep pathways towards literacy.
Books were a window into the lives of brave and courageous woman whose actions I
hoped to emulate in my own life. Another impressionable memory is going to college
with my adult mother when I was in middle school. I specifically recall visits with her to
the university’s library, and I also remember the first time I saw one of her thick
textbooks and realized that there was so much to learn about the world that books needed
to be thick in order to attempt explaining it all. In this way, books had a spirit of freedom
that allowed me either to explore the real world, or the imaginative world. Bishop (1990)
164

extends Style’s (1988) metaphor directly to books, capturing just how powerful of a tool
books can be in the lives of people of all ages but most especially the impressionable and
imaginative young minds of children:
Books are sometimes windows, offering views of worlds that may be real
or imagined, familiar or strange. These windows are also sliding glass
doors, and readers have only to walk through in imagination to become
part of whatever world has been created or recreated by the author. When
lighting conditions are just right, however, a window can also be a mirror.
Literature transforms human experience and reflects it back to us, and in
that reflection we can see our own lives and experiences as part of the
larger human experience. Reading, then, becomes a means of selfaffirmation, and readers often seek their mirrors in books. (1990, p. ix)

But what if a child is not able to see themselves mirrored in a book, or what if certain
cultural identities are left out of children’s literature all together? I then also implore
educators who are considering closing a school library to revisit Chimamanda Ngozi
Adichie’s (2009) powerful TEDTalk titled, The Danger of a Single Story in which she
recounts her personal struggle as a young Nigerian girl to understand her place in the
world because the literary window made accessible to her was dominated by white,
European characters:
Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside
Nigeria. We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about
the weather, because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot
of ginger beer, because the characters in the British books I read drank
ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. What
this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in
the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were
books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that
books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be
about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things
changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them
available, and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.
165

Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my
imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended
consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in
literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It
saved me from having a single story of what books are.
So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only
one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.
Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess
and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.
Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that
broken dignity.
I would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single story,
when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we
regain a kind of paradise. (Adichie, Speech, October 2009)
Adichie’s (2009) speech poignantly articulates the danger of exposing children to
a single limiting narrative. I believe her speech also illuminates the danger of
restricting access to books with diverse characters that represent, as Rose
suggested, the diverse constellation of the personal and familial identities of a
school’s students and families. Closing a school’s library may seem like a
budgetary gain; however, the implications on student identity formation and the
impact on the school’s culture around teaching and learning could suffer
tremendously. However, if keeping a school library open is an impossibility for a
school facing a severe budget crisis, I see the need to establish connections with
the local public libraries near students at the school a critical component of their
overall literacy development and aspirations as citizens of the world.
Another frame to view closing a school library is through that of the
research on socio-economic class and student reading achievement. Closing
166

school libraries means that students lose access to books, or as this study has
found, students lose access to the essential windows and mirrors that books
provide as personal agency and identity builders for students. Closing school
libraries also then closes students off from access to knowledge and opportunity,
and furthermore as Nueman and Celano (2006) articulate, isolates children and
increases the knowledge gap between low income and middle income children.
The authors (2006) call for policy makers to “level the playing field” in order to
equalize access to resources for students in disadvantaged neighborhoods, citing
findings from a $20 million research project in Philadelphia to increase the public
library programs systems in the hopes of “improving the lives of disadvantaged
children and their families by closing the achievement gap” through increasing
access to printed and electronic knowledge available to the community. Neuman
and Celano (2006) posit from their earlier research in 2001 that the lack of access
to books in low income neighborhoods only isolates members of the community
further, and reduces their opportunities to gain social mobility. School libraries
then are an important factor to consider when policy makers and school leaders
debate how to allocate and prioritize funds to schools, especially Title I funding.
School libraries should not be relegated into the category of “luxury” for a school
especially in low income neighborhoods, but rather should be viewed by school
leaders and policy makers as essential and the one central place in a school that
can provide students with access to knowledge and resources to catapult them into

167

a narrative story of their own rather than isolate them into the single story of their
neighborhood.
Implications for School Leaders of Early Childhood and Early Elementary
Schools in Resourced Schools. The findings in this study can potentially influence the
professional practice of school leaders of early childhood students in well-resourced
school contexts as well. For the same reasons that this study influences leaders who are
prioritizing school budgets and spaces, so too should school leaders not in such a
predicament examine their own library programs to better understand how it impacts the
school’s teaching and learning culture. Specific attention could be made to the school
librarians themselves, and the emotional architecture of the space to determine whether or
not the space is used to its most optimal and capable potential. Examining the library
program at a school and how librarians collaborate with classroom teachers to
complement their reading instruction is something that all school leaders should do if
developing skillful readers who also love to read is one of their primary aims. Moreover,
school leaders in with librarians should consider the positionality of their librarians; the
school librarian’s ability to collaborate and support teachers and students for the entire
school community, and their ability to access information and resources makes the
librarian an important stakeholder and change-maker when it comes to potentially
shifting or shaping school culture around teaching and learning.
Redefining 21st Century Balanced Literacy. I did not anticipate discovering
how powerful a literacy program could be for early learners when the librarians and
classroom teachers collaborate and communicate about student reading goals and
168

development. Balanced literacy as a literacy program that seeks to “balance” reading and
writing literacy skill development in a classroom through a workshop model that engage
students in specific reading and writing strategies like phonics and word study, guided
reading, read alouds, shared reading, interactive writing and shared writing (Fountas and
Pinnell, 2010). Missing from this balanced literacy workshop model for early elementary
students is the joyful engagement of reading for pleasure and fun. This is in fact where
school leaders have an opportunity to redefine our 21st century notion of balanced literacy
to include the dimension that librarians in this study do so well— help students identify
themselves in literature, and help students develop a love of reading that is not easily
nurtured in classroom instruction focused on intense reading skill development.
Literacy development and engagement for students should not truncate with the
end of the school day. Parents of students should use the library space to continue the
engagement students have with books in the library and classroom at home as well,
bringing Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) microsystem of people and places that influence
students into a strong yet balanced frame for developing children; parents are an
important constituent group to engage in literacy initiatives at schools. The librarians in
this study welcomed parents into the library space and saw them as partners in
developing literacy skills for students. I recommend that parents take a proactive role in
contacting librarians and in visiting school libraries so that a child’s literacy development
extends beyond the traditional school milieu and into other places and spaces in the real
world.

169

Recommendations for Teachers and Librarians. Initially I thought to make
separate suggestions for teachers and librarians, but ultimately I believe the findings of
this study speak to the incredible potential to make meaningful and lasting learning
opportunities for students when teachers and librarians collaborate. Many of the
librarians in the study noted that they tend to push into classrooms in order to better
understand what students are learning so that they can curate a list of books to support the
teachers and students. Librarians should continue to push into classrooms, and to support
the teaching and learning happening in traditional classrooms by serving as the
information mediator, and by continuingly offering the library space as a welcoming
environment free from judgement and assessments, and also a place where students have
the space to move around, wander, and explore books and other resources. Similarly,
teachers need to communicate with librarians in more ways than a brief conversation
during book check out time at the end of a class’s library time. This communication
between early childhood teachers and librarians is especially important as students need
an outlet to balance the rigor of learning how to read with a love of reading and the
intellectual freedom to be creative and explore new ideas.
Recommendations for Media Specialists and Maker Space Advocates. This
study suggests that libraries and centers of technology are not synonymous. While
technological tools like Mac computers, iPads, and projectors were present in every
school library that I visited, only one librarian used technology during my research
observations. Libraries used technology as a tool to access information, and librarians
acknowledged the benefits it held in accessing large amounts of information quickly and
170

broadly across topics and themes. What differentiated technology use by early childhood
students in this study was the mobile and dynamic way in which it enabled them develop
a pathway towards informational literacy. This is to say that students used technology to
mediate their experience in researching topics and ideas, and that research was not
confined to fixed bank of desktop computers in a media lab or library. Rather, their
technology was mobile, allowed them to move around to collaborate with peers or to
connect with a teacher for guidance. I recommend that media specialists thoughtfully
consider the digital tools they are giving students to mediate informational literacy skill
development, and to question if access to information and ideas needs to be relegated to
the confines of a room of computers. Furthermore, I encourage media specialists and
technology advocates to initiate collaborative projects with classroom teachers so that
informational and digital literacy skills are not cultivated through isolated learning
experiences in the school library, but are instead connected to meaningful student
learning across disciplines and in various settings.
Considering the argument that the maker space movement is a trend in
independent school education today, and that one of the school’s in the study created a
maker space in order to boost interest in admission to the school, I recommend that
schools define how and what the difference is between maker spaces and libraries. In
fact, I suggest that the purposes and roles of libraries and maker spaces are quite
different; however, they are similar in that they allow students the freedom and space to
cultivate multiple literacy skills: informational literacy, traditional literacy, digital

171

literacy and tactile literacy skills. Crestwood Academy’s I-Lab is one example of how a
school library and a maker space collaboratively work to enhance student learning.
Children at Crestwood Academy research in the library but construct
representations of their knowledge in the I-Lab. In the early childhood context, the
findings in this study warrant a recommendation to keep innovation labs and libraries
separate. Librarians serving early childhood students have the important role of curating a
student’s identity as an avid reader while also providing a safe intellectual playground for
them to grow as inquirers and thinkers. Innovation labs develop a tactile literacy that
school libraries cannot perhaps rival; however, working in tandem a school library and
maker space collaboration could prove rewarding for students as it has at Crestwood
Academy.
Frank from Crestwood Academy is a teacher and department head who explained
how the success of the school library and the I-Lab depend on one another. He, Jonathan,
Elaine, and the technology specialists meet frequently to align expectations and to
collaborate on projects and ideas. He sees the role of the I-Lab as facilitating meaningful
and engaging student projects, but noted that students would not be able to implement
design thinking and create solutions if they did not have the support and resources of the
school library to research ideas and problems.
I think students are learning about creativity [in the Maker Space], and
then collaboration and communication. When I first got here [to
Crestwood Academy] six years ago, our students could not collaborate,
they could not work together and group projects were a disaster. And
now, we can move forward with a group project and it hardly ever runs
into trouble. 90% of the time the groups work very smooth and there is
very rarely a big issued that evolves, and I think part of that is being
[developed] here in the I-Lab. And then I think the critical thinking piece,
172

understanding how to see the problem and understanding how to move
forward to find the solution without quitting and without giving up and
saying, “Do this for me.” Instead, thinking critically about what steps I
need to do next in order to move past this “stuck” point. I think that’s the
piece we’re still in progress in with a lot our students… The “maker
space” title is a misnomer because you don’t need a space. A maker space
is about the framing of the project, the framing of the challenge, and then
who you have facilitating that challenge, what adults you have facilitating
that challenge, and are they trained in doing so and if you have that, if you
have adults who ready to facilitate and the adults who can frame, then you
don’t even need the space.

While the I-Lab at Crestwood Academy is brand new, the concept is thoughtfully
designed to link the literacy development happening in classrooms directly to the library
and I-Lab. I wonder what the impact could be on schools and the culture of teaching and
learning is one space was set aside to accommodate project based learning opportunities
as the I-Lab and lower school library at Crestwood have done. Although, as Frank
suggests, perhaps a space is not actually needed and instead a school that cannot
accommodate a project space first start by shifting teacher mindsets away from paper
assessments and more towards design thinking and alternative assessments forms. Based
on my preliminary findings from this research, I think a case study of a school like
Crestwood Academy would elicit an even greater understanding of how school libraries
and makerspaces work together or in tandem to support tactile and informational literacy
skills in students. I do not believe makerspaces to be a trend as they exemplify the type
of learning that students in early childhood have proven to need: to learn through play. A
study investigating how school libraries today make connections to the makerspace as
they did at Crestwood Academy might inform the field on the overall effectiveness of
makerspaces as spaces for important learning and skill building.
173

Conclusion
I felt a flood of excitement at each site visit and reveled in the experience of
investigating library spaces, spaces that I myself have personally loved since I was a
child myself. Whether it was visiting NES and seeing Hannah pick up her guitar to
entice the students to listen to the story of a new book, or Shannon brilliantly showing me
the potential of teacher and librarian partnership, I walked away from each site
transformed as a school leader. My friends at William Penn welcomed me and reminded
me how important it is to curate a library collection that represents the students and their
families, and they Elaine’s team at Crestwood Academy inspired me to think about new
ways that libraries could link with maker spaces in early childhood settings. I am deeply
committed to ensuring that all children in this country and around the world have access
to a library of quality books and resources. It is clear to me that libraries have the
profound ability to shape a community’s view and value on education and inquiry. More
importantly, school libraries are places where people go to feel safe, to build meaningful
relationships, and to explore the world around them.
At the end of this study I am left in awe and admiration of the important work that
school librarians do with seldom appreciation or acknowledgment from school members.
Their work is multifaceted and complex, and they serve all school community members
not just students. Their impact on school culture, the school community, the local
community, and even the spiritual health of individual impress upon me the leadership
role that librarians have as custodians and curators of information and knowledge. At the
end of this study, I am also also fascinated by the evident intersection of neuroscience
174

with social ecology theory: how we feel when we are in a space that feels inspiring and
what impact that has on our ability to think, feel, act, and engage in any type of skill
development as children and adults is prescient in country with so many school building
failing into disrepair and dysfunction. This weighs especially heavy on me as an
educator working in a well-resourced independent school now, but whose initial interest
and inspiration for this study was born while working in the under-resourced School
District of Philadelphia. I cannot yet reconcile how every child in this country under the
education system today does not have access to a school library when schooling is an
integral and pivotal determinant of his or her success in adulthood.
This study and all that went into the research, analysis, and documentation of it
has left an indelible mark on my identity as a teacher and school leader. Stretching my
mind to organize large amounts of data, analyze and infer meaning, and to synthesize my
thoughts into cogent words and impactful findings to inform the field of education was an
honor and one I would do again. I am now a committed advocate for quality school
libraries and talented school librarians in areas and school districts that are in most need
of increasing literacy skills in both children and adults, a commitment that indisputably
comes as a result of engaging in this research with the context of Philadelphia and Pine
Ridge Native American reservation front in my mind.
The purpose of school libraries has changed in both the public and private school
worlds, especially with the growth of 1:1 digital device programs and rapid access to
information. While the traditional role of a school’s library has been one that promotes
information literacy, reading for information, and reading for pleasure with paper books,
175

these spaces may not suit the needs of today’s twenty-first century digital learner. How
should well-resourced school libraries today, historically bound to paper collections and
archives, design learning spaces and allocate resources to support a generation of students
born into the digital age? My conclusion is that they should continue to do this with
paper books and in warm, safe, and visually exciting school libraries.
There is a current gap in research exploring the role of independent school
libraries in the literacy development of young children in the United States. A
significant body of literature on the topic exists in Australia and the United Kingdom;
however, scholarly work in the area is sparse in the United States, especially for
independent schools. In a national survey of independent school libraries by the
American Association of School Librarians in 2005, 420 independent school responses
were analyzed and compared to public school data. Cahoy and Williamson (2008)
analyzed the data and concluded that in comparison to public school libraries,
independent school libraries typically were open more hours per week, had high per
student library budgets, larger collections, and larger library facilities (Cahoy &
Williamson, 2008). If independent schools have more resources available to support
library spaces, then this study can be used to help school librarians, school leaders, and
teachers navigate how best to allocate those resources.

CHILDHOOD STUDENTS
Anna Carello

INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT
TO PARTICIPANT:
1. Invitation to Participate and Description of the Project. My name is Anna Carello
and I am currently a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation
research is an inquiry into innovative library design, and I am specifically interested in
better understanding how students, librarians, and teachers interact with the school’s
library space in order to develop multiple literacies. I would like to help reimagine school
library spaces so that they better serve students with the informational, digital, tactile, and
traditional literacy skills that are required in the global economy today.
Your participation in the research study is voluntary. Your school’s leader has agreed to
host my study at School X, so you will not face nor will you be at risk for receiving any
consequence from the school for being part of the study. Before agreeing to be part of
