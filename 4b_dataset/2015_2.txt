ABSTRACT
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the perceptions and
experiences of librarians regarding the use of social media applications and social
networking websites to deliver tutoring services in library branches. The focus of the
study was on librarians working in the Queens Library that serves the residents of Queens
Borough, New York City. The study followed the exploratory case study approach to
explore the librarians’ perceptions regarding delivering homework assistance services to
teenage students using HomeworkNYC social applications and social networks in library
branches. The central research question that guided this exploratory case study was How
do librarians’ perceive the use of social media applications such as DialATeacher,
SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver tutoring services to teenagers? Twenty young
adult librarians were selected to participate in the study. Data were collected from the
study participants through answering open-ended questions, semistructured interviews.
The collected data from audio-recorded interviews were transcribed to a textual format
using Microsofet Word computer program application. The collected data were analyzed
using NVivo 10.0 computer software to identify themes and patterns. The study’s data
analysis concluded five core themes that answered the study’s central research question.
The core themes are: (a) capability to communicate and share knowledge, (b) inability to
communicate with teenage patrons, (c) responsibility toward delivering social educational
service, (d) motivation toward educational role, and (e) pressure due to lack in staffing
and in technological support.

Chapter 1:
Introduction
Public libraries participate with an important role in promoting educational
growth and development (Peowski, 2010). Librarians provide users with access to a
variety of academic resources and offer specialized, personal assistance to individuals
seeking specific information (Peowski, 2010). Students who visit local libraries benefit
most from the assistance services offered by librarians. Students can access information
by themselves or with help from librarians in difficult areas, such as locating the most
relevant resources needed to complete homework assignments (Florida Library
Association, 2011).
Queens Public Library serves students in the Queens borough, New York City, by
providing imprint and electronic educational resources. Further, Queens Public Library
provides students aged 6 to 14 with one-to-one homework assistance at all Queens
Library branches (Queens Library Foundation, 2011). New York City’s budget reduction
toward public services is negatively affecting public schools, public libraries, and other
neighborhood programs that assisted school age children with their school homework
(English, 2011; Marritz, 2011; New York Community Trust, 2012; Tankus, 2013).
For students ages 15 to 18, Queens Public Library provides one-to-one free
homework assistance in only two library branches out of the 63 library branches that
serve Queens Borough, New York City. New York Public Libraries, funded by Institute
of Museum and Library Services, developed social applications that allow students to
obtain homework assistance through social networking websites such as Facebook and
Myspace. The developed applications provide students with real-time homework
1

assistance from New York City teachers. Further, the applications allow students to
communicate with librarians to obtain educational materials needed for their homework
assignments (Braun, 2010).
Queens Library expanded the use of the social media applications as a service
approach to deliver homework assistance in all library branches. Librarians participate
with a vital role in the process of implementing the use of social media applications to
deliver homework assistance. The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was
to explore the librarians’ perceptions and lived experiences regarding their role in the
process of delivering homework assistance to teenage students ages 15 to 18 in library
branches using HomeworkNYC Apps and social networks to supplement the lack of free
homework assistance to teens.
Chapter 1 contains the background information about public library services
provided by Queens Library, the scope of the study, the problem statement, and the
purpose of the study. The significance of the current study is underscored in this chapter
as the research is distinguished from past studies, and the use of social media to deliver
homework assistance services to teenagers is discussed. Chapter 1 also includes the
nature of study, the conceptual framework, and the assumptions, limitations, and
delimitations of the study.
Background of the Problem
The five boroughs of New York City (NYC) are served by three public library
systems: New York Public Library, serving the residents of the boroughs of Staten Island,
Manhattan, and Bronx; Brooklyn Public Library, serving the residents of the borough of
Brooklyn; and the Queens Public Library, serving the residents of the borough of Queens.
2

Collectively, the three library systems operate 209 branches with a total collection of 63
million items (Fieldhouse, 2011). Queens Public Library is the largest public library in
the nation (New York Community Trust, 2012) serving a population of 2,278,860 people
in Queens Borough, 6.2% of whom are in the age group 15 to 18, in which this particular
study takes interest (New Americans Program Queens Library, 2012).
New York City’s populations are facing the most devastating affects because of
the recent recession (Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York, 2012). According
to Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York’s analysis in 2012, the number of New
York City residents who are living under the federal poverty level increased significantly
from 120,000 in 2008 to 1.6 million residents in 2010. The rate of children living in
poverty also increased from 25% of all of New York City’s children in 2008, to 33.3% in
2010, with a total number of 522,955 children (Citizens’ Committee for Children of New
York, 2012).
In Queens Borough, New York City, the poverty rate is 15%, with 21.8% of
children (99,291) living under the federal poverty level (Citizens’ Committee for
Children of New York, 2012). Accordingly, with the indicated increased rate of poverty
among Queens Borough’s residents, they become relying on the city’s and libraries’ free
services, especially for their children’s education (New York Community Trust, 2012).
Queens Library serves the Queens Borough’s residents through 63 public libraries
such as the Briarwood, Glendale, Elmhurst, Baisley Park, Flushing, and Hollis
Community Libraries among others (Queens Library, 2012). In addition to offering
services to patrons who frequent the libraries’ widespread branches, Queens Library also
provides over the phone and online services to respond to patrons’ questions (Queens
3

Library, 2011). The library offers services in English and Spanish to diverse groups of
people and operates a website where users can chat and exchange ideas. Queens Public
Library provides access to catalogs, subscription databases, online collections, and
respective library information concerning free events, computer classes, and English
lessons for non-native speakers (New York State Library, 2013).
To fulfill the library mission of providing services meeting the educational needs
(Queens Library, 2014d), Queens Library offers Best Out Of School Time (BOOST)
program to provide students aged 6 to 14 with one-to-one homework assistance every
weekday at Queens Library branches (Calas, 2010). The BOOST program is funded by
New York Life Foundation with $240,500 grants and enabled Queens Library to hire 20
paid high school teens to assist students aged 6 to 14 with their daily homework and
promoted the use of library resources. The grant allowed the Queens Library to provide
free valuable academic support to low-income families who cannot afford paid tutoring to
their children. Initially, the BOOST program served almost 2,000 children in Queens
Library branches after-school each weekday (New York Life Foundation, 2010).
Other neighborhood programs were also providing Queens Borough’s children
and teenagers with free homework help service (New York Community Trust, 2012).
Many of these programs, however, were closed because of the lack of funding, which
increased the demand on Queens Library to provide the homework help service to
children and teenagers (New York Community Trust, 2012). In concert with the
increased quest for educational needs and homework help, Queens Library obtained a
$130,000 grant from New York Community Trust Foundation and expand the BOOST
program by hiring 15 BOOST assistants to serve 226 more children increasing the total of
4

children aged 6 to 14 obtaining homework help to 2,500 children (New York Community
Trust, 2012). For students ages 15 to 18, however, and because of the budget reductions
(Marritz, 2011; Tankus, 2013), Queens Library provides free one-to-one homework
assistance by professional tutors in only two library branches out of the 63 libraries in
Queens Borough, New York City (Queens Library, 2014a; Urban Libraries Council,
2014): the teen centers at the central library in Jamaica, Queens (Queens Library, 2014a)
and Far Rockaway, Queens. The two branches provide students ages 15 to 18 with
homework assistance (Urban Libraries Council, 2014).
In the other 61 Queens Library branches, young adult librarians perform their
duties serving teenage patrons as required by their job description defined by the Young
Adult Library Services Association, a division of the American Library Association
(Young Adult Library Services Association, 2014). The young adult librarians in each
library provide teenage patrons with technology and computer assistance and select
educational materials purchased and added to the library collection. Further, young adult
librarians develop educational activities for teenage patrons such as developing
instruction classes for teens to learn how to search the library resources and obtain the
educational materials needed for their homework assignments (Young Adult Library
Services Association, 2014).
In 2005, administrators in the three public library systems in New York City
(New York, Brooklyn, and Queens), with the lead of the New York Library, developed
the HomeworkNYC.org website (Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2010). The
HomeworkNYC.org website allowed teenage students in the New York City area to
obtain real-time homework assistance from professional teachers. Further, the website
5

allowed teenage students to obtain educational materials needed by accessing the
educational resources of the three libraries of New York, Brooklyn, and Queens (Institute
of Museum and Library Services, 2010).
In 2006, the HomeworkNYC team conducted a usability test to assess the
usefulness of using HomeworkNYC.org to deliver homework assistance to New York
City’s teenage students. The usability test findings indicated that the website was
difficult to use because of (a) the website’s crowded design and (b) complications in
navigating the library catalog to locate educational resources needed for their homework
assignments (Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2010). Further, teachers did not
realize the abilities of the HomeworkNYC.org website to be used as an educational
platform to deliver homework assistance (Institute of Museum and Library Services,
2010).
In 2007, to explore a better approach to deliver homework assistance to teenagers,
the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) provided the three library systems,
New York, Brooklyn, and Queens, with a grant of $30,000 to evaluate the online habits
of young people. The project included a committee from the New York Public Library as
a leader and collaborated with Brooklyn and Queens Public Libraries (Institute of
Museum and Library Services, 2010). The committee members interviewed more than
90 students aged 10 to 18 who participated in focus groups conducted in public libraries
within New York City’s five boroughs.
The project’s findings indicated that teenagers do not think of public libraries as
sources of homework help physically or virtually. Physically, teenagers think of the
public library as a source of books to read and participation in activities. Virtually, they
6

depend on the web resources, such as Google and Wikipedia for their homework
assignments (Braun, 2010; Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2010). Introducing
websites that provide homework assistance to students had no affect on teenagers’
searching behavior. The study findings highlighted that young people spend long periods
on social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace (Braun, 2010).
The focus group indicated that 90% of teenage participants prefer to receive the
homework assistance at their favorite social networking websites such as Facebook and
MySpace (Braun, 2010). To implement the focus group’s idea, New York City public
libraries received a $378,000 grant from IMLS for 3 years to develop homework social
applications (apps) to be implemented within social networks such as Facebook and
MySpace (Braun, 2010). During the 3-year development period, HomeworkNYC.org
developed tools to educate librarians, teachers, and parents about using digital resources
and social media applications to enhance learning (Braun, 2010).
Leaders at HomeworkNYC developed (a) the DialATeacher app that allows
students to communicate with NYC teachers live to obtain homework assistance, (b) the
SearchIt app that allows students to locate information using recommendation engine, (c)
the ListIt app that allows students to share lists of books, games, and music with their
peers and friends on social network websites, and (d) the AttendIt app that allows
students to search public libraries events by topic or by borough via social network
websites (Braun, 2010). In 2010, the New York Library team launched a new
HomeworkNYC.org website and developed the new social media applications:
DialATeacher, SerachIt, ListIt, and AttendIt Apps (Braun, 2010). The New York City’s

7

public libraries including Queens Library were advised to expand the use of the new
social approach of HomeworkNYC (Braun, 2010).
Queens Library staff members are using social media tools and social networking
websites to promote library services including HomeworkNYC Apps and programs,
share ideas with patrons, and create online space for library patrons to communicate with
library staff and other patrons (Queens Library, 2014c). Young adult librarians provide
the teenage patrons with instructional workshops to teach them how to use social network
websites and how to protect their identity online (Houghton-Jan, 2010). Some young
adult librarians use social networking for outreach to teenage patrons by developing book
clubs and library activities using a social networking website as a discussion platform and
to participate in the activities (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). To deliver adequate homework
assistance service to students aged 15 to 18 in Queens Borough, New York City, Queens
Library administrators expanded the use of HomeworkNYC Apps to deliver homework
assistance service at every library branch of the 63 library branches in Queens Borough,
New York City.
Statement of the Problem
The general problem was due to lack of funding, administrators closed many free
neighborhood programs that provided after school homework assistance to teenage
students in Queens Borough, New York City (New York Community Trust, 2012).
Consequently, the demands on receiving free homework assistance services by teenage
students in Queens Library branches increased (New York Community Trust, 2012). The
specific problem was, due to lack of funding, the Queens Library branches offers
insufficient free homework assistance to teenage students ages 15 to 18 for the entire
8

borough of Queens, New York City (Marritz, 2011; Queens Library, 2014a; Tankus,
2013; Urban Libraries Council, 2014).
HomeworkNYC social applications (Apps) were developed by New York Public
libraries including Queens Library to deliver free homework assistance to teens and
tweens who live in New York City area (Braun, 2010). HomeworkNYC apps allow
students to communicate with professional teachers, peers, and librarians to obtain realtime homework assistance and library educational resources needed for their homework
assignments (Braun, 2010). Implementing the HomeworkNYC Apps as an approach to
deliver homework assistance in Queens Library branches entailed the librarians’
involvement in the process (Braun, 2010).
A qualitative study was needed to assess the perceptions of librarians toward
using HomeworkNYC Apps as an educational service approach to deliver homework
assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in all Queens Library branches. The data needed for
the study were collected in the form of verbal responses to interview questions. The
interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Further, more data were collected
through the participant-observation, and documents.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
perceptions of librarians in Queens Library toward using HomeworkNYC apps to deliver
homework assistance to students ages 15 to 18 in all Queens Library branches to
supplement the lack of free homework assistance to teens. A purposeful sample of 20
librarians who currently work in Queens Library branches under the rank of young adult
librarians for at least 5 years participated in the study (Merriam, 2009). The study
9

participants provide teenage patrons with educational assistance through selecting and
locating educational materials needed for their homework assignments as major part of
their daily working experience (Walter & Mediavilla, 2005; Young Adult Library
Services Association, 2014).
The study participants use social networking websites as communication
platforms to promote library services and resources to patrons (Queens Library, 2014c).
Implementing the use of HomeworkNYC Apps as a consistent educational service to
deliver homework assistance to teenage students in Queens Library branches entailed
young adult librarians to be responsible for (a) promoting the use of HomeworkNYC
Apps to teenage patrons, (b) guiding the teenage patrons through the process of installing
the Apps on their favorite social networking website such as Facebook and MySpace, and
(c) educating the teens on how to use the Apps to search the library resources to obtain
educational materials needed for their homework assignments (Agosto & Abbas, 2011;
Braun, 2010; Houghton-Jan, 2010; Michaelson, 2009). Thus, exploring the participants’
thoughts, feelings, and experiences toward delivering educational services to teenage
patrons was needed to determine the effectiveness of using the social media applications
as an educational approach to deliver homework assistance in Queens Library branches
(Mohsenzadeh & Isfandyari-Moghaddam, 2011; Packard, 2010). The participants
answered semistructured open-ended interview questions to provide qualitative data in
the form of verbal responses. The collected data were analyzed using NVivo 10.0
qualitative computer software application to identify themes related to the phenomenon
under study.

Significance of the Problem
Significance of the Study
This study is important to the body of knowledge of the role of social media tools
in education from a different perspective than previous research studies and may bring
about a new understanding. Whereas there is popular and professional interest on the
influence of social networking on academic performance, only a few researchers have
attempted to explore the relationship between social networking and learners’ access to
educational resources, particularly resources that offered by public libraries (Abramson,
2011; Kamenetz, 2011). Thus, the current study is unique, as the focus was on the use of
social media applications, specifically HomeworkNYC apps to connect students with
teachers to obtain homework assistance. Further, the applications connect the students to
the library educational resources needed for their homework assignments using social
network websites such as Facebook and MySpace. The focus of the study was to explore
how librarians in Queens Library perceive their role in the process of using the
HomeworkNYC Apps in the library as an educational service approach.
Significance of the Study to Leadership
The study findings may be particularly relevant to leaders as the main thesis
provides a concrete framework of managing library resources using innovative tools,
such as social media, among other web 2.0 applications (Evans & McKee, 2010). With
the strategy for increasing the involvement of teenagers with public library services,
public library management will thrive and serve the students citywide regardless of
budget reductions. Library management entails a fearless investment in the use of
technology in promoting services, as well as using library resources (Smallwood, 2011).
11

Smallwood (2011) emphasized the importance of technology, particularly social
media tools, such as social media applications and social networking websites, in
disseminating information as a key aspect for any library manager or leader. Further,
Packard (2010) asserted that in human service organizations, investigating staff
perceptions toward human services they deliver is imperative to evaluate the service
effectiveness, and consequently, the overall organization’s performance. Exploring the
librarians’ perceptions toward their role in providing services was essential for the library
leaders to identify their perspectives regarding the services to solve problems
encountered by librarians that disrupt the service. Accordingly, librarians may contribute
more effectively and actively in the process of delivering the service, which will increase
the competence in public services delivered by librarians (Mohsenzadeh & IsfandyariMoghaddam, 2011).
Research Questions
The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the perceptions of
librarians in Queens Library toward using HomeworkNYC apps to deliver homework
assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in all Queens Library branches to supplement the
lack of free homework assistance to teens. The central research question that guided this
exploratory case study was, How do librarians perceive the use of social media
applications such as DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver homework
assistance services to teenagers in Queens Library branches (Braun, 2010)? The research
question guided this case study through the process of gathering the librarians’
experiences, thoughts, feelings, and perspectives. To explore the librarians’ perceptions
further, the data gathered from this study were used to answer two subquestions:
12

1. How do librarians perceive the use of social networking websites such as
Facebook and MySpace as educational platforms?
2.

How do librarians perceive their role in the process of using social media
applications to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in library
branches ?
Exploring the librarians’ perceptions toward the use of HomeowrkNYC Apps as

an educational service approach was based on their experiences as professionals serving
teenage patrons (Young Adult Library Services Association, 2014). The research
questions were designed to explore the librarians’ thoughts and feelings toward the use
of social networking websites as educational platforms in the library based on their
experiences regarding using social networking websites to promote library sources and
activities (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). The research questions were designed to explore
librarians perceptions toward using the social educational service approach. The data
collected from this study were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of using
HomeworkNYC Apps to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in
Queens Library branches through exploring how librarians perceive their role in the
process. Further, explore challenges that librarians face while delivering the social
educational service to teenage patrons in library branches.
Nature of the Study
A qualitative exploratory case study research design was appropriate for this
study to explore the perceptions of the study participants to assess the effectiveness of
using the social media applications as an educational service model to deliver homework
assistance to teenagers in library facilities. In qualitative approaches, the researcher is
13

interested in understanding how the participant makes meaning of a certain phenomenon
(Merriam, 2002). A case study is appropriate research method to focus on contemporary
event and to answer how and why questions (Yin, 2009). A qualitative case study design
was appropriate because the purpose of the study was to explore the librarians’
experiences, thoughts and feelings regarding an educational service approach.
Quantitative research methods focus on examining the relationship between variables and
interpreting the numerical data collected from a statistical analysis of those variables
(Christensen & Johnson, 2008; Neuman, 2006). A quantitative method was not
appropriate for this study because the participants’ feelings are not easily quantifiable as
numeric variables and quantifying the librarians’ perceptions would not have provided indepth textural description of their perceptions toward the social educational approach.
Researchers using a quantitative approach treat study participants as anonymous
objects to be measured (Lichtman, 2006). Thus, a quantitative research approach may
fail to answer vital questions that concern participants’ behaviors, and experiences. In
the qualitative research approach, participants’ involvement in the research process is
vital to explore their perspectives (Willig & Rogers, 2008).
Qualitative research was appropriate for this study to explore the librarians’
thoughts and feelings toward using social media approach to deliver homework
assistance to teenaged students in libraries. Case study is appropriate as a research
method when the researcher seeks "to understand a real-life phenomenon in depth, but
such understanding encompassed important contextual conditions because they were
highly pertinent to the phenomenon of study"(Yin, 2009, p.19). As a primary role of
their daily duties, librarians (a) encourage students to use the new social media approach,
14

and (b) guide and communicate with teens during the process of obtaining homework
assistance and locating library educational materials needed for their homework
assignments (Braun, 2010; Walter & Mediavilla, 2005; Young Adult Library Services
Association, 2014). Thus, exploring the librarians’ perceptions may reveal new
information in assessing the use of social media as an informal educational approach to
deliver homework assistance services in all Queens Library branches. Interviewing 20
young adult librarians who are delivering the educational services including the use of
homeworkNYC Apps to students ages 15 to 18 in library branches was conducted to
achieve credibility of the study. Participant-observations were conducted to achieve the
dependability of the study. For purposes of this study, semistructured open-ended
interviews will allow librarians share their perspectives and experiences to answer the
study research questions (Merriam, 2009).
To assess the accuracy of the interview questions, credibility, and dependability
of the study, a pilot study was conducted with a sample of three participants who were
not part of the main study (Merriam, 2009). The pilot study participants were selected
using same criteria that were used to select participants for the main study. The
researcher scheduled and conducted face-to-face interviews with the pilot study's
participants individually at their respective library branches. Further, the researcher
followed the same confidentiality procedural of conducting interviews to collect data for
the pilot study as was followed in the main study. The interviews were audio-recorded
and transcribed to a textual format using Microsoft Word computer software application.
A focus group of the three pilot study's participants was conducted after the
interviews to validate the study's instrument with a score rating process (Markus &
15

Smith, 2010). The participants were asked to rate each interview question from 1 to 3,
where 1 was the highest match between the interview question and the research questions
and 3 was the least match (Markus & Smith, 2010). The interview questions that were
rated 2 and 3 were reworded for clarity.
The pilot study participants were allowed to suggest questions that may match the
research questions. Once the instrument validity was completed, the interview questions
for the main study were formulated in a systematic format (see Appendix C). The
interview questions were focused on exploring the librarians' perceptions and experiences
toward using the HomeworkNYC Apps and social networks to deliver homework
assistance to teenage students in library branches.
The collected data from the interviews were transcribed to a textual format using
Microsoft Word and analyzed usingNVivo 10.0 qualitative data analysis software
application to (a) analyze the collected data, (b) create and link themes, and (c) locate
evidence (Rubin & Rubin, 2005).
Conceptual Framework
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
perceptions of librarians in Queens Library toward using the HomeworkNYC Apps to
deliver homework assistance to students ages 15 to 18 in all Queens Library branches to
supplement the lack of free homework assistance to teens. The conceptual components
of this qualitative exploratory case study were based on (a) the context of student
engagement (Junco, 2011) and (b) social capital (Heath, Fuller, & Johnston, 2010)
models. The synergistic ability to explain the relevance of social media applications to

16

teenagers and how can be used by librarians to deliver library services including
homework help prompted the choice of both concepts.
Student Engagement
The concept of student engagement was relevant to the study in determining the
relationship between the amount of time that learners commit to academic activities and
their performance (Junco, 2011). The model refers to the degree of physical, mental, and
psychological devotion by students to academic experiences and posits (a) learners invest
physical and psychological energy in academic activities, (b) engagement takes different
levels as some students invest more energy than other, (c) the amount of learning and
educational growth that takes place is directly proportional to the quality of student
engagement, and (d) the success of any educational program is directly proportional to
the capacity of that particular program to improve student engagement (Junco, 2011).
The student engagement model helped to describe the educational potential of
using social networking websites to encourage students’ participation in online academic
activities and events. Thus, the understanding of student engagement is not limited to
participation in activities leading to a desirable academic outcome, but the model also
encompasses interactions with librarians, peers, and teachers as well as active
involvement in co-curricular tasks (Kuh, 2009). Merging educational activities with
learners’ social activities is likely to promote better utilization of library resources
whenever students visit their favorite social websites (Lupa & Howerton, 2009).
Therefore, the ultimate goal of applying student engagement was to explore how
librarians use social media to engage students in educational activities including
homework assistance.
17

Social Capital
Anttiroiko and Savolainen (2011) stated that Web 2.0 or alternatively social
media is a generalized term for services and technologies that enable users to customize
websites and interact with others. Adopting Web 2.0 technologies in public libraries
were found essential for public libraries to develop the library services to cope with the
new elements of social networking and online communities (Anttiroiko & Savolainen,
2011). Heath et al. (2010) offered another perspective by suggesting that the model of
social capital offers a framework within which social networks can serve as a meeting
point for teens to share ideas.
Friends and contacts on social networks are excellent sources for information that
public libraries can align with the teens’ academic needs. Online relations represent a
form of social capital that expands the sphere of the teens’ participation in academic
activities and social networking websites help in the mobilization of this form of social
capital (Heath et al., 2010). Thus, public libraries can promote both the mobilization of
intangible resources, such as shared skills and capabilities, by using social media
applications to encourage interpersonal relations among teenagers. Moreover, social
networking websites promote social mobility by allowing marginalized groups to access
more resources and other forms of social capital provided by their online relations.
While the technology itself has minor effects on improving the teenagers learning,
social networking websites encourage them to engage in learning activities by interacting
with their friends and school communities (Herguner, 2011). The social networking
websites provide convenient platforms for bonding and bridging for social capital to take
place (Herguner, 2011). Through social bonding, teenagers cultivate a sense of
18

solidarity, mutual reciprocation within social groups, as well as mutual support and
reinforcement (Herguner, 2011). Through social bridging, social network websites
promote social inclusion and cementing of relations among teens, which encourage free
exchange of ideas and information (Heath et al., 2010).
Definition of Terms
The following key terms found in the study were defined to increase clarity to the
reader:
Homework: Homework is defined as tasks assigned by schoolteacher to students
and expected to be done during the nonschool hours (Walter & Mediavilla, 2005).
HomeworkNYC Apps: HomeworkNYC Apps are social media applications
developed to allow students to connect live to New York City teachers to obtain
homework assistance through social networking websites such as Facebook and
MySpace. Other social media applications were designed to allow students to search
New York City’s libraries, including Queens Library for educational resources needed for
their homework assignments (Homework NYC, 2010).
Social Media Applications (apps): Social media applications are Web-based
computer software programs designed to share personal data or functionality on
particular social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace (Interactive
Advertising Bureau, 2008).
Student Engagement: Students engagement is defined as the degree of learners’
devotion and commitment to educational activities in terms of time and mental
concentration (Junco, 2011).

19

Teens (Teenagers): Teens or teenagers are terms to define children aged 13 to 18
(National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 2013; National Crime
Prevention Council, 2007). The current study was limited to teenager aged 15 to 18 who
attend high schools (Boston Public Schools, 2013).
Tweens: Tweens is a term used to define children aged 9 to 13 (Smith, 2013).
Tween’s personality characteristics are defined as “feisty, opinionated, honest, sharp, and
cynical” (p. 2). Concerning social networking, King (2009) asserted that tweens favor
the MySpace social networking website because of the website’s page customization
feature that allows them to change the coloring.
Assumptions
Leedy and Ormrod (2010) asserted that to avoid any misunderstanding,
researchers should openly discuss all assumptions that are relevant to the research
problem. To discover assumptions, researchers must question what is taken for granted
related to the research problem (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010). For purposes of this study, the
researcher developed assumptions related to the research problem. The researcher
assumed that Queens Library offers library patrons - including teenagers - free computers
to use and free Internet access (Queens Library, 2013). This assumption was integral to
the research for obtaining homework assistance, teenagers have to access to their favorite
social networking websites to install and to use the HomeworkNYC apps that allow them
to communicate with teachers, librarians, and peers through library computers with
Internet access (Braun, 2010).
Another assumption was the participants’ honesty in sharing their experiences and
perceptions through answering the interview questions in depth. The researcher informed
20

the participants about the focus of the current study in detail and assured them
confidentiality and anonymity to increase their honesty when answering the interview
questions (Gill, Stewart, & Treasure, 2008).
Scope, Limitations, and Delimitations
The focus of the study was in exploring the perceptions and experiences of
librarians working in the Queens Library toward delivering homework assistance to
students aged 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches using HomeworkNYC social
applications (Apps). The assistance is delivered via the students’ favorite social
networking websites, such as Facebook and MySpace. Using the social approach may
enhance library services by expanding the educational services and the use of library
resources. Thus, the focus of this study was only with matters regarding the public
libraries in Queens Borough, New York City.
Other public libraries outside the Queens area were not addressed in this study. In
addition, the researcher only considered Facebook and MySpace as the two primary
social networks that allow the implementation of the social apps. Finally, the study
encompassed a discussion of student engagement and social capital as the main
conceptual pillars of the research.
Given the qualitative exploratory case study approach of the current study, several
limitations were inevitable. Reliance on linguistic data (participants’ verbal responses)
may have weakened the study’s validity as the researcher’s interpretation of the
participants’ responses may lack accuracy and give different meaning from those
intended by the participants. The use of open-ended questions elicited varying responses

21

from the respondents, some of which may contradict the research findings that
consequently may limit the validity of any conclusions drawn from data collection.
Delimitations refer to what the researcher excluded from the research to avoid the
readers’ misunderstanding of the research boundaries (Ellis & Levy, 2009). The study
was delimited to the use of social media applications as a method of delivering
homework assistance service to teenagers in all Queens Library branches. The scope of
the current study was delimited to defining the value of using social media applications
such as HomeworkNYC apps and social networking websites such as Facebook and
MySpace to deliver tutoring services to teenagers in Queens Borough, New York City
from the librarians' perspectives. Further, the study was designed to focus on how the use
of the HomeworkNYC apps could help public libraries in Queens Borough, New York
City promote teens’ utilization of library services and resources.
The participants in the current study were delimited to librarians working in the
Queens Borough library system. HomeworkNYC apps are social media applications that
allow teens to communicate with teachers through social networking websites, such as
Facebook and MySpace to obtain homework assistance using library computers with the
guidance of librarians. Accordingly, the homework assistance process involves teachers,
teens, and librarians (Braun, 2010). Thus, generalization to teens and teachers may not
be warranted in this study.
Summary
Queens Public Library offers on-to-one homework assistance services to school
age children between 6 to 14 (Queens Library Foundation, 2011). However, for students
aged 15 to 18, the Queens Library system offers one-to-one homework assistance in only
22

two library branches out of 63 library branches serving Queens Borough, New York City.
Chapter 1 provided a justification for the need for a qualitative research study to assess
the use of social media applications and social networking websites to deliver homework
assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in all Queens Library branches.
The current study was designed to use a qualitative exploratory case study
approach to explore the librarians’ perceptions toward using HomeworkNYC apps as
social media tools to provide library resources and services to teenagers. Two conceptual
approaches were integrated in the research conceptual framework: social capital and
student engagement (Heath et al., 2010; Junco, 2011).
One assumption was that the Queens Library offers teenagers free computers to
use in the library facilities with free Internet access. The data were collected through
semistructured interviews with the study participants to share their perceptions and
experiences toward the phenomenon under study, participant-observation, and
documents. The data were analyzed through using NVivo 10.0, a qualitative data analysis
computer software application. In Chapter 2, a critical review and analysis of an
extensive body of pertinent literature is provided to examine current views that will
underpin this current study.

23

Chapter 2:
Review of the Literature
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
librarians' perceptions and experiences toward delivering homework assistance to
students ages 15 to 18 using HomeworkNYC Apps and social network sites such as
Facebook and MySpace in library branches. Public librarians have recognized the
potential of information technology in promoting effective delivery of services (Bertot,
2009; Farkas, 2007; Lupa & Howerton, 2009). Chapter 2 provides a review of the
literature relevant to the use of social media applications and social networking websites
to deliver library services by librarians.
The literature review offers a discussion of student engagement and social capital
conceptual framework. The review of related literature provides an in-depth analysis of
teenagers’ engagement with library resources and activities. The review of literature also
includes a discussion of the use of social media in higher education and the gap found in
literature regarding the use of social media to deliver formal and informal educational
services to high school students.
Title Searches, Articles, Research Documents, and Journals
The University of Phoenix Library ProQuest, Thomas Gale, and EBSCOhost were
used to access journal articles, peer-reviewed articles, and research documents for this
study. Fifty-eight peer-reviewed articles, 26 journal articles, and 7 books were used in
the review of literature. Search terms were, sociology, social networking, teens and social
networking, education and social networking, public libraries and social media, student
engagements and libraries, and social capital and libraries.
24

The review included discussions of (a) the study’s conceptual framework, (b)
socialization and social interaction, (c) socialization and the looking glass self-theory, (d)
a historical overview of social networking, (e) socialization and social networking, (f)
social networking and social media applications, (g) public libraries and web 2.0
technologies, (h) social networking and privacy, (i) teens’ and librarians’ use of social
networks in libraries, and (j) social media in education.
Conceptual Framework
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
librarians’ perceptions toward delivering homework assistance to teens using social
media applications and social networks. Accordingly, the student engagement concept
was imperative for the study as the librarians' role is to engage students with educational
activities in libraries and online (Anttiroiko & Savolainen, 2011; Helgren & Lietzau,
2011; Kuh & Gonyea, 2015; Lupa & Howerton, 2009; Naidoo &Vargas, 2011). The
social capital concept was also imperative to the study, as libraries are perceived as a
source for elevating social capital (Bunders, Cummings, Seferiadis, & Zweekhorst, 2015;
Porter & King, 2010; Svendsen, 2013). The extensive use of social networking within
libraries allows a new form of social capital to take place (Bassani, 2009; Chang &
Hsiao, 2014; Choi & Chung, 2013; Guo & Ito, 2014; Okoro, Hausman, &Washington,
2012).
Student Engagement
Kuh and Gonyea (2015) discussed the vital role of librarians in engaging students
in educational activities to enhance their academic experiences. The librarians' role is to
evaluate the educational materials to determine the reliable resources for students'
25

academic needs (Kuh & Gonyea, 2015). The Internet evolution and the appearance of
vast amounts of online electronic resources allow students to use nonscholarly and often
inaccurate or misleading resources for their academic needs (Kuh & Gonyea, 2015).
Accordingly, the students' use of these resources may negatively affect their
academic performance (Kuh & Gonyea, 2015). However, many students insist on relying
on their personal judgment to evaluate the quality and accuracy of online resources for
their academic assignments without librarians' help (Kuh & Gonyea, 2015). Thus, the
librarians' role has grown from determining a collection’s quality and accuracy to
educating students on how to evaluate the legitimacy and accuracy of electronic resources
(Kuh & Gonyea, 2015).
Social media tools (applications) can act as platforms for learning (Lupa &
Howerton, 2009). Similarly, teens spend a considerable amount of time on their favorite
social networking websites (Lupa & Howerton, 2009). Heiberger and Harper (2008)
observed that few researchers have examined the relationship between social networking
and student engagement to determine the effects on student success. Further, Heiberger
and Harper asserted that there is a positive relationship between the use of Facebook.com
and the level of engagement among students.
Social media applications (apps) provide the perfect platform where teenagers can
interact frequently with friends and peers as well as seeking assistance from librarians
and teachers (Lupa & Howerton, 2009). The social networking websites are the most
convenient tools for reaching out to teens compared to traditional mediums like
classroom conversations and e-mails (Murray, 2008). Traditional forums have received
little attention from students, but Facebook.com and other social networking websites are
26

arguably where teenagers live (Murray, 2008). Teenagers log into Facebook.com to
check on their contacts every day, sometimes spending more time than they do on other
aspects of their social lives. Thus, the popularity of social networking websites have the
potential of not only allowing public libraries to reach more teenagers but also to
transform the manner in which learning takes place within this group.
Secker and Price (2007) elaborated on the role of social software such as
Facebook, and other blogging websites in helping distance learners to enhance their
learning experience. Libraries and Social Software in Education (LASSIE) is a group
that was founded to involve technologists and archivists in the advocacy of using social
software toward enhancing the learning experience of distance learners (Secker & Price,
2007). Social software websites such as Facebook contribute to the distance learner’s
experience by providing opportunities for the library to advertise itself to potential
learners (Secker & Price, 2007).
Further, Anttiroiko and Savolainen (2011) elaborated on harnessing the potential
of social network websites among other web 2.0 applications by first describing the
emergence of library 2.0 as a term pertaining to the extension and practical reinvention of
library services to the Internet. Anttiroiko and Savolainen further emphasized the pivotal
role played by web 2.0 applications in enhancing the learning experience of library
resource users as well as increasing library resource users in general. The integration of
library resources among online portals essentially democratizes access to information
because the Internet is a highly accessible portal for any individual to use (Anttiroiko &
Savolainen, 2011).

27

Naidoo and Vargas (2011) discussed the cultural significance of web applications
among the youth of today. Naidoo and Vargas claimed that the utilization of web 2.0
applications for library use practically and virtually bridges the gap between the
underprivileged teens and their counterparts. Further, Naidoo and Vargas argued that the
incorporation of social media tools in libraries allows teens from different racial
backgrounds to operate in a level playing field with Americans since the use of web 2.0
applications, especially when applied in public libraries, is highly democratized.
Library programming is deemed crucial in bridging the gap between teens in the
area of information technology (Naidoo & Vargas, 2011). Helgren and Lietzau (2011)
provided national assessment of public libraries in the United States using web
technology to enhance services citing the Colorado State Library’s Library Research
Service (LRS) as a primary research tool to improve the use of social networking
websites such as Facebook.com and Twitter.com for learning purposes.
O’Dell (2010) outlined the responsibilities of librarians in terms of web
technology usage and its application to library resource enhancement. Griffey (2010)
defended the emergence of web technologies in a potential use for library resource
enhancement. Griffey particularly noted the negative notions on web technology as
diminishing individual privacies. Griffey proposed to use the democratic character of the
Internet to good use through incorporating its capacity to reach teenagers with library
resources.
Social Capital
Bunders et al. (2015) defined social capital as the value of people's social
construction and asserted that social capital distributes information resources among a
28

network of people to achieve common goals. Choi and Chung (2013) asserted that social
networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace are extensively used as a popular
method of communication among people of all ages. Consequently, the vast use of social
networking built a new type of social capital that occurs online through communication,
sharing of content, and discussing general and specific topics. Recent studies indicated
that using social networking websites created a new form of social capital through
providing (a) high levels of interaction between users, (b) ease of use, and (c) a low or no
cost social service.
Guo and Ito (2014) conducted a study to explore the affects of using social
networking on students' perceived social capital and psychological well-being. The study
findings indicated that social networking capability of communication and sharing has
positive effects on people regarding building social capital (Guo & Ito, 2014). Further,
social network websites are engaging people with the external world to socialize and
obtain life satisfaction. The social capital built through online social bonding provides
people with informational support needed to improve the quality of their life (Guo & Ito,
2014).
Chang and Hsiao (2014) investigated the importance of understanding the users'
perceptions toward social networks to the social network site's operator. Chang and
Hsiao indicated that social network sites provided users with the capability of building
friendships and creating a new online social realm. To build a successful social network
site, the site operators have to understand the users' perceptions of social capital (Chang
& Hsiao, 2014).

29

Understanding the users' social behavior enables the site operator to develop
functions that increase the interactivity and maintain the users' attraction to the site
(Chang & Hsiao, 2014). Chang and Hsiao (2014) indicated that for users who spend a
long time using social network sites, the perceptions of online social capital is equal to
their perceptions of real-life. However, the online social capital perception is less
important for users who spend less time using social network sites (Chang & Hsiao,
2014). Accordingly, the social behavior and social capital perceptions are directly
proportional to the time spent using social network sites.
Okoro et al. (2012) discussed the use of social networking as a classroom tool and
asserted that teaching through social media is enriching the students' academic
experience. Using social networking as a classroom allows students to establish
interpersonal relationships with peers. Students interact with peers in discussions to
solve educational problems (Okoro et al., 2012). The use of web 2.0 technologies
increased the engagement level and created social capital not only among students but
also among faculty members, librarians, staff, and administrators and their students
(Okoro et al., 2012). Utilizing social networking as a classroom increased collaboration
in learning as students share ideas and views regarding class assignments and academic
resources used.
Librarians realized the importance of using social media to build a library
community online. Building a library’s online community expanded the use of library
services and developed a form of social capital online (Young & Rossmann, 2015).
Young and Rossmann (2015) conducted a study to evaluate the use of social media as a
tool to build an online community among library users. The study findings indicated that
30

using social media as an online community to deliver information and publication
contents and interact with library users increased the users’ interactions with the library
by 366% (Young & Rossmann, 2015). Accordingly, using social media as a community
building tool expanded the use of the library and allowed librarians to deliver users
online.
Bassani (2009) extended the concept of social capital in teens’ education by
observing that social bridging within groups encourages the generation of new forms of
social capital. The social capital happens because of group dynamics whereby group
membership changes frequently and in the process, joining members bring aboard new
resources (Bassani, 2009). Facebook.com has this quality because users create new
friends daily, and the characteristic of social networking websites can be useful in
injecting dynamism into web-based educational forums for teenagers such as book clubs.
Further, various promotions exist among librarians that aim precisely to engage
teenagers as the engagement that is formed through social networking websites such as
Facebook. According to Porter and King (2010), the Library 101 project serves as an
example of how librarians can engage students in using library resources to form online
social capital. Further, Porter and King featured the efforts of the Topeka & Shawnee
County Public Library through their online collection of library resources amounting up
to 101 hyperlinks to different books and journals that the library has to offer.
Socialization and Social Interaction
Social interaction between people is vital for human development as many
sociologists studied the effects of the social isolation on children and asserted that the
isolation is quite damaging (Stolley, 2005; Thio, 2003). Socially isolated children show
31

lack of basic human behavior and are less responsive than normal children who interact
with others within their social realm (Stolley, 2005). Social interaction helps children
learn social skills and consequently, develop social behaviors that support their
interaction with others (Stolley, 2005). The children’s social development starts in their
early age through interacting with their parents who take major responsibility in
protecting, teaching, and guiding them (Turiel, 2010). Thus, learning cultural values,
roles, norms, and expectations develop a human personality that passes from generation
to another as a lifelong social process to form social organization (Stolley, 2005).
Socialization is a complex process and in communal societies, each member
receives an equal share of socialization (Curry, Jiobu, & Schwirian, 2005). In a
communal society, communication depends on sharing common outlooks on life and
learning depends on the personal ties between members (Curry et al., 2005).
In a traditional society, for example, children learn from parents almost
everything they need for their early age from the parents’ perspectives, which creates
conservative socialization. Parents teach children their generational experiences to
prepare them for the present time only but not for the future (Curry et al., 2005). Social
studies show that children’s social development is associated with the social skills they
learn from parents and family members (Tran & Lee, 2011).
Socialization and the Looking Glass Self-Theory
Charles Horton Cooley (1864-1929) who was an American sociologist and
considered the intellectual founder of the study of communication (Simonson, 2012)
developed the theory of the looking glass of self. Cooley asserted, “Society provides a
sort of mirror, or “looking-glass,” [that reflects to us who we are]. We form an image of
32

ourselves based on how we think others see us” (Stolley, 2005, p. 62). The looking-glass
self-concept consists of (a) the imaginations of self-appearance, including characters,
manners, aims, and friends to other people; (b) the imaginations of people’s judgment
based on that appearance; and (c) the self-feelings toward that judgment (Stolley, 2005;
Yeung & Martin, 2003).
Further, the person’s self-image effects the way that person interacts with others
within their social realm, as the person would act depends on the people's perceptions of
that person. If the people perceive that person as amusing, the person will form a selfimage of himself as an entertainer (Stolley, 2005). Cooley further claimed that people’s
perceptions are influenced by gender as girls have more impressible social
responsiveness than boys as they care for the social image and reflect upon it more
(Yeung & Martin, 2003). An empirical study has tested Cooley’s concept of looking
glass self and concluded that a person’s action although not always influenced by the
people’s perception but by own self-conception through personal consistent acts (Yeung
& Martin, 2003).
Cooley divided human social network to two groups (a) Primary groups, which
are the small groups that communicate with the individual through face-to-face
interaction with an intimate bond and considered the first social group and consist of
peers, close friends, and close neighbors and (b) Secondary groups that the individual is
interacting with indirectly and without intimate bond but share some social norms and
interests such as coworkers, team fans, class students which help in building the personal
identity (Severino & Messina, 2010; Stolley, 2005). Further, communication is defined
by Cooley (1924) as “the mechanism through which human relations exist and develop
33

all symbols of mind, together with the means of conveying them through space and
preserving them in time” (p. 61). Cooley included many aspects of expressions defining
the communication such as attitudes, words, writing, voice tones, and printing, stated that
communication leads to mental growth, and recognizing the external world.
Consequently, when the individual recognize the external world through
communications, society complications grow and the external world becomes larger
society, and the individual will move from communicating with local society to
communicate with a global one (Stolley, 2005).
Social Networking: Historical Overview
The history of online gathering and communicating started with the appearance of
the Bulletin Board System (BBS) in late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bulletin Board
System had created a cyberspace place where users can interact with each other through
posting messages and downloading games and files through communicating with the
central system. The BBS gained popularity in the 1980s and became a new method for
distanced people to socialize (Goble, 2012). CompuServe started as a business
communication solution mainframe in 1970s and expanded in the 1980s to become a
public domain. CompuServe’s public domain allowed users to communicate and access
events and news. Further, CompuServe allowed users to send messages to each other
using public access e-mail systems, which considered a true interaction between users at
the time. In early 1990s, America Online (AOL) was an Internet service provider that
allowed users to create lists of friends with searchable member profiles that created
online communities (Goble, 2012).

34

Social Networking Websites and Web 2.0
The early generation of websites was created through one directional web
technology (Web 1.0) that allowed users to browse the website’s contents from one
direction as viewers but without the ability to interact with the website as participants
(Goodchild, 2007). The second generation of websites was created through bi-directional
web technology (Web 2.0) that allowed collaboration and interaction between websites
and users (Lieberman, Sito, Blake, & Neuendorf, 2010). Farkas (2007) identified the
Web 2.0 technologies as a social software tools that allow people to have “Two-way
conversation” (p. 1) to extend and to add value to the human social behavior.
The communications and collaborations provided through social software allow
people to create communities online and to share knowledge with others (Farkas, 2007).
Web 2.0 technology was used to build collaboration bridges that changed website users
from viewers to participants who can interact and post information on a website and their
post will be available to other users to view and to interact with instantly through secure
communication (Goodchild, 2007). Web 2.0 was appeared first in 1980 as a web
software prototype invented by Tim Berners-Lee and reappeared again in 1994 when
Ward Cunningham created the first wiki that allowed users to add, delete, and modify
web contents (Sodt & Summey, 2009).
The first online social network website was created to connect friends, family
members, schoolmates started in 1995 when classmates.com was founded to reconnect
long-lost schoolmates, employees, and military friends and establish communication
bridges between them despite distances. Currently, Classmates.com is serving 40 million
registered users (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Goble, 2012; Lupa & Howerton, 2009). Social
35

network users started to create and post personal profiles and public web contents in 1997
when SixDegrees.com was launched (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Goble, 2012).
The website allowed users to invite friends, create groups, and browse other
users’ profiles based on the concept of people communicating with others through six
degrees of separation (Kuss & Griffiths, 2011). Further, Goble (2012) asserted that
SixDegree.com encouraged all members to invite others to join the network; however, the
encouragements have become assertive to the users and with many complaints regarding
spam memberships, the website lost the users’ trust and closed in 2000. Boyd and
Ellison (2007), however, claimed that SixDegree.com closed because the website’s idea
of social networking was ahead in time and users did not have many friends online to
invite or with whom to communicate.
Community tools that support creating user profiles, friend lists, create groups,
and invite friends found extensive use from 1997 to 2001. During that period, a
considerable number of social websites was launched such as BlackPlanet.com,
AsianAvenue.com, and MiGente.com and allowed users to create their personal or
professional profiles, browsing friends, and connecting with them despite their approval
for the connections (Boyd & Ellison, 2007). The concept of six degree of separation was
used repeatedly when Friendster.com was launched in 2002.
Friendster.com established communications and cultivated friendships among
social network users by creating a pathway to display the connection between two
members (Goble, 2012). Friendster.com was designed to compete with the dating
website Match.com. The difference was that Match.com was a paid website for dating
services to introduce strangers to each other, but Friendster.com was a free of charge
36

social website that helped friends-of-friends to meet other friends-of-friends to establish
romantic relationship based on the conjecture that meeting with friends-of-friends is
better and more secure than meeting with strangers on Match.com (Boyd & Ellison,
2007; Goble, 2012).
After one year of launching, three million users were registered on Friendster.com
(Goble, 2012). With technical difficulties and social context fold that instigated bad
experiences with users because users had to meet with other previous classmates who
may not be in their favor or had bad experiences with, Friendster.com had to restrict users
from meeting with other friends of more than four degrees (Goble, 2012). The fourdegree restriction upset the users for limiting their ability to widen their network of
friends.
Consequently, active users started to search for more friends by creating different
profiles and few of them known as Fakesters, have created fake profiles for celebrities
and other famous people to attract users to their fake profiles (Goble, 2012). The
Fakesters attracted many users to browse their profiles either to find more friends or as an
entertainment (Goble, 2012). The Fakesters, however, outraged Friendster.com and the
company started to delete their profiles and eliminate many popular social features. This
upset the users, especially Friendster’s early adopters who left the website, which was
considered the fall of Friendster.com in the United States of America (Boyd & Ellison,
2007; Goble, 2012).
Through Using Web 2.0 technology, Tom Anderson and Chris Dewolfe
developed MySpace.com in 2003 as a free social network website that allowed users to
interact with each other using blogs, e-mails, forums, and share content, such as photos,
37

videos, and audio files (Lieberman et al., 2010). MySpace.com was developed to
compete with other social websites, such as AsianAvenue.com, Xanga.com, and
Friendster.com. The founders were concentrating on attracting users who left
Friendster.com and encourage them to join MySpace.com and invite other people to the
website.
MySpace.com was launched initially for non-musicians but welcomed Indie-Rock
bands from Los Angeles who left Friendster.com because of the restrictions and the
technical difficulties. MySpace.com allowed promoters to advertise for popular clubs to
attract more bands and musicians to the website (Boyd & Ellison, 2007). Bands and
musicians did not help MySpace.com grow. The bands and musician fans, however,
started to join MySpace.com and invite other friends to the website (Boyd & Ellison,
2007). To attract more users, in 2004, MySpace.com allowed minors to join the website
(Boyd & Ellison, 2007) and allowed them to customize their pages using different
backgrounds and pictures by adding HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) to their
profile frame (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Lupa & Howerton, 2009). This helped
MySpace.com gain enormous registrations among teenagers and remarkable popularity.
In 2004, Facebook.com social network was launched as a close social network for
Harvard college students only. Thus, to join the Social Network Website (SNW), users
had to have Harvard e-mail address (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Kuss & Griffiths, 2011).
Facebook.com started to expand and support other schools applying same restrictions that
users must join using e-mail addresses related to their institutions to keep the SNW a
private community. In September 2005, Facebook.com continued expanding by

38

including corporate networks, high school students, and the public (Boyd & Ellison,
2007).
The Facebook.com expansion, however, was different from any other SNW as
users could not make their profiles visible to all users and for corporate networks to gain
access, users must have the appropriate corporate e-mail addresses, and for high school
students, a Facebook.com administrator must approve their registrations (Boyd & Ellison,
2007). Further, Facebook.com allowed users to develop and build applications to
perform external tasks – such as creating personal calendars and personalizing their
profiles (Boyd & Ellison, 2007). For more expansion, Facebook.com opened registration
to everyone with no restrictions, including teenagers, which attracted many users
worldwide. In 2011, Facebook.com had almost 600 million users; half of those users
interacting on the SNW every day and has become an addiction for many people (Kuss &
Griffiths, 2011).
The popularity and expansion of social networking websites passed the limitations
of particular SNWs such as MySpace.com or Facebook.com (Boyd & Ellison, 2007).
Today, many private and public SNWs have been established and are actively used for
each function, such as affiliation websites like MyChurch.org, activity websites such as
couch surfing, and identity websites such as Blackplanet.com (Boyd & Ellison, 2007).
Many of SNWs are developed to target certain demographic audiences and some SNWs
such as Ning.com provide hosting services and social network platforms to allow users to
create and host their own SNWs (Boyd & Ellison, 2007).
Social network websites, however, are one of many applications of Web 2.0
technologies that have developed to serve the concept of general social interest
39

(Anttiroiko & Savolainen, 2011). Web 2.0 applications and functionalities have been
adopted to create (a) media communities SNW to share, store, and produce photos,
videos, video chatting, and music, such as EarthCam.com, YouTube.com, Flickr.com,
Woophy.com, and Slide.com; (b) special interest networks (SINS) with a variety of
different interests such as Minti.com, Wayn.com, Hobeze.com, and Dogster.com; (c)
short messaging, alerting, and feedings SNWs to send alerts or short messages to
registered groups, such as Twitter.com or sending web feeds Really Simple Syndication
(RSS) such as Sabifoo.com that combines sending messages and RSS; (d) blogging to
share views and experiences through e-diaries and blogs such as Multiply.com,
WordPress.com, LiveJournal.com, and Blogger.com; and (e) instant messaging and
communication services using global portals such as Google.com, AOL.com, MSN.com,
and Yahoo.com; or using Instant Messaging (IM), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or Voice
Over IP (Internet Protocol), or for real-time communication such as AIM.com,
Skype.com, Yahoo.com, MSN.com, Google.com, and ICQ.com (Anttiroiko &
Savolainen, 2011). Consequently, Web 2.0 technologies and applications have developed
a global human capital in the virtual world (Anttiroiko & Savolainen, 2011).
In 2005, the academic librarians in Jacksonville State University (JSU) noticed
unusual students’ behavior when using the library (Charnigo & Barnett-Ellis, 2007).
Their library computers were frequently occupied with students and others waiting in
lines for turns, as were public scanners students used to scan their personal photos. After
close observations, librarians noticed that new phenomenon stemmed from a new
addiction called Facebook.com (Charnigo & Barnett-Ellis, 2007). To ensemble the new
trend, JSU had officially joined the Facebook.com directory with many other universities.
40

Students started extensively using Facebook.com to post their photos, academic views,
and search for friends and high school classmates to add them to their network of
communication (Charnigo & Barnett-Ellis, 2007).
The librarians’ job description has shifted to receiving many questions from
students asking for help to upload their photos and instructions for how to join and setup
profiles on Facebook.com (Charnigo & Barnett-Ellis, 2007). However, the controversy
started to appear when librarians started to receive many complaints from non-Facebook
interested students who could not use the lab computers for their academic assignments
because of their classmates were occupying the computers for hours using Facebook.com
(Charnigo & Barnett-Ellis, 2007).
Later, JSU decided to block Facebook.com from all lab computers and any other
computer in campus (Charnigo & Barnett-Ellis, 2007). The controversy over
Facebook.com phenomenon rose among librarians as well. Some librarians considered
the website as any other dating website and others viewed it as a new trend of
communication that can be used to communicate with students in academic manners
(Charnigo & Barnett-Ellis, 2007).
Socialization and Social Networking
People interact with each other online using a computer-mediated approach to
share information and engage in social communication, create a new mode of virtual
communities that interact online rather than interacting face-to-face (Xiao, Li, & Tang,
2012). Further, the informational exchange among virtual communities shows that
people trust online information because the members of virtual communities are
culturally and geographically discrete. Boyd and Ellison (2007) differentiated the term
41

social network websites (SNW) from the term social networking websites using scope
emphasis of each term. The social network websites term is defined as web-based
service that allows users to create public profile, choose other users to communicate with,
and establish connections with the users of their choice (Boyd & Ellison, 2007).
Social networking websites is defined as a web-based service that can also
establish connections and initiate relationships between strangers (Boyd & Ellison, 2007).
Boyd and Ellison (2007) further asserted that social network websites (SNW) is
providing the same service for strangers to communicate and establish relationships but
networking is not the primary reason for social network websites. Vitkauskaite (2011)
described social networking as an Internet phenomenon that allows users to share all
activities with others about extending their social network and defined the social network
websites (SNW) as the web websites that make the social networking possible.
People are using the SNWs for many personal reasons such as entertainment,
socialization, connections, and many other reasons (Jang Hyun, Min-Sun, & Yoonjae,
2010). Many studies were conducted to understand the people’s motives behind using
social media and social network websites (Jang Hyun et al., 2010). Few studies related
the use of SNWs to user’s socioeconomic and other social factors from the humancomputer interaction (HCI) perspective and indicated that people use SNWs to fulfill
their social needs (Jang Hyun et al., 2010). Other researchers related the use of SNWs to
the personal identity or understanding the self and found that self-construal is an
important motive for people to use SNWs to communicate with others. This allows
people to express themselves in a real-time interaction with friends and peers sharing

42

their views, ideas, and knowledge (Barker, 2009; Jang Hyun et al., 2010; Kuss &
Griffiths, 2011).
Barker (2009) assessed the motives of using social network websites (SNWs)
with a special focus on gender and social identity. The study findings indicated that
young people are the primary users of social networks to reflect their social identity by
sharing information with individuals and groups. The users’ personality characteristics
appear from their memberships to certain group because users join groups when the
group members act similarly to them. The study findings revealed that young SNW users
are not using social network websites for entertainment and sharing information only but
also for personal interaction with others, and to discover how others react to them.
Barker (2009) further asserted that people with high self-esteem are highly
motivated to communicate with other members within their group. Concerning the
gender differences in SNW use, the study findings indicated that teenage girls are equal
in using SNW as teenage boys. Boys, however, show more interest in entertainment
features but girls show more interest in communications regarding relationships and their
deep feeling and personal emotional secrets (Barker, 2009).
Social Networking and Social Media Applications (Apps)
As web technologies continue to evolve due to the Internet use as a method to
socialize in the virtual world, the meaning of modern society has changed from the
physical socialization to the virtual socialization (Nunes et al., 2012). Social networking
has become a part of the personal daily activities and communications (Sung-Min, 2012).
The number of users following Twitter posts have increased 241% in 2011 compared to
the number of people followed Twitter posts in 2010 (Sung-Min, 2012). The use of
43

Social Networking Services (SNS) did not stop at the personal level, but expanded to
business usage as 84% of the top 100 companies of Fortune 500 use SNS to communicate
with their customers (Sung-Min, 2012). Social Networking Services (SNS) may have a
vital role in learning within the social context in which knowledge is constructed through
active collaborations and engagements among people (Kelm, 2011).
The social media application (app) is one of many people-centric sensing
applications that were developed and used within the social context to detect people
social activities, communications, and interactions (Sung-Min, 2012). Social media
application (app) is a social networking software application that enables the social
network website members to maintain personal profiles (Hasel, 2011). Further, the apps
allow members to manage their connections with other members within a certain social
networking website and provide the members with the updated feeds regarding their
connectivity with other members (Hasel, 2011). In social application context, the social
network website is considered a container that enables the apps to access data, such as
updated feeds and collaborates with other members within the social network website
(Hasel, 2011).
Many social networking websites such as Facebook.com, Twitter.com,
LinkedIn.com, and MySpace.com have developed apps that suit their network platforms
(Hasel, 2011). Each social network website, however, developed the apps that allow
members to access their feeds and contacts within their network only but not to
communicate or to retrieve data from other networks (Hasel, 2011). In November 2007,
Google Corporation developed the OpenSocial Applications standard that connects to
multiple social network websites from a user interface (Hasel, 2011). The user has to
44

install the OpenSocial Application (app) to permit access to the social data in the user’s
personal profile (Hasel, 2011). The app enables the user to access personal social data
from a social network website or from multiple websites to view, post, and communicate
with multiple social network websites at the same time (Hasel, 2011).
Subsequent to a study conducted by the HomeworkNYC committee, including
New York Public Library staff, to evaluate online habits of teenagers, the
HomeworkNYC committee developed social applications (Braun, 2010; Institute of
Museum and Library Services, 2010). HomeworkNYC apps were developed for
teenagers to install on their favorite social networking websites such as Facebook and
MySpace to communicate with teachers to obtain real-time homework assistance and
with New York City’s public libraries to obtain educational resources needed for their
homework assignments (Braun, 2010). HomeworkNYC apps included (a) DialATeacher
app that allows students to communicate with New York City teachers to obtain
homework assistance live, (b) SearchIt app that allows teenagers to search New York
Libraries catalogs to locate educational resources for their school assignments, (c) ListIt
app that allows teenagers to share list of books with peers and friends, and (d) AttenIt app
that allows teenagers to search New York City’s public libraries for events to attend
(Braun, 2010).
Public Libraries and Web 2.0 Technologies
With the appearance of Web 2.0 technologies, library professionals started to
consider the technology implications on the library services, which led to the formulation
of the term Library 2.0. Michael Casey was the first professional that used the concept of
Library 2.0 in his blog Library Crunch in 2005 (Anttiroiko & Savolainen, 2011; Maness,
45

2006). Librarians have recognized the capabilities of Web 2.0 technologies in many
aspects, including reaching the library users and enhancing library services (Maness,
2006). A study was conducted by researchers at the Library Research Service (LRS) of
Colorado State Library, researchers found that 2% of the United States public libraries
have Facebook.com pages, and in 2010, the percentage has increased to 32% (Helgren &
Lietzau, 2011). In September 2011, almost 82% of public libraries in U.S. have deployed
one or more of the Web 2.0 technologies (Helgren & Lietzau, 2011). Some libraries have
experimented with Facebook.com and some web 2.0 interactive tools to identify users’
online behaviors and to communicate with other libraries to enhance services and
outreach users (Helgren & Lietzau, 2011).
The flexibility and scalability of the Web 2.0 technologies provided collaboration
and an interaction environment that allow users to contribute and develop web contents
such as blogs and Wikis (Sodt & Summey, 2009). The user’s ability to contribute, share,
and develop informational web content made Web 2.0 technologies popular and
admirable, especially among teenagers (Sodt & Summey, 2009). Deploying Web 2.0
tools in libraries created a new user-centered environment that enabled users to fulfill
their information needs and facilitate community building (Sodt & Summey, 2009).
Web 2.0 (Library 2.0) technologies changed the library programs and services
consistently according to the users’ feedbacks instead of providing programs and services
that may not meet the users’ needs (Sodt & Summey, 2009). Additionally, the
collaboration environment that was constructed using Web 2.0 technologies allowed
educational institutions to build distance-learning communities and provide educational
services to distance learners (Sodt & Summey, 2009). Similarly, deploying Web 2.0
46

technologies in public libraries’ websites enabled libraries to provide educational
information and resources to distance learners (Sodt & Summey, 2009).
Web 2.0 technologies have been used to build strong connections of
collaborations between schools and public libraries (Squires & Golden, 2009). The
schoolteachers provide students with book lists and assignments and librarians teach
students to navigate and search different Internet resources and databases (Squires &
Golden, 2009). Further, librarians teach students to bookmark their finding of web
sources using online social bookmarking application named Delicious (Squires &
Golden, 2009). The social bookmarking application enables students to save and tag the
bookmarked websites to organize and share them with other members or send them to
other subscribed members (Squires & Golden, 2009). Consequently, using Web 2.0
technologies have increased the students’ academic engagement through the help of
school and public librarians to create new search habits and define good web resources
for their school assignments (Squires & Golden, 2009).
Queens Library administrators, as with many other public library administrators,
recognized the vital role of web 2.0 technologies that provide real-time communication
(Queens Library, 2014c). Queens Library staff developed blogs, public forums, and other
social software tools to establish real-time communication with the library patrons. The
library social platform allows library patrons to comment, review, and rate the library
resources and services (Queens Library, 2014c). The library social platform also allows
the patrons to communicate with library staff and share ideas and opinions regarding to
library services. Finally, the library staff moderates the library’s social platform to

47

review the patrons’ comments and posts and removes any unlawful or violating
submissions (Queens Library, 2014c).
Really Simple Syndication (RSS)
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is another Web 2.0 technology tool that enables
students to subscribe to different blogs and websites using a feed reader application
called Aggregator that allows students to view all updates of websites or blogs they have
subscribed to in one place (Squires & Golden, 2009). Really Simple Syndication is a
social software that creates updated news feeds that displays the most recent updates on
blogs and social networking websites such as Facebook (Miller & Jensen, 2007). Social
software is an important tool for libraries to distribute information and to communicate
with patrons dynamically to inform them with what is new in the library and to receive
their feedback (Farkas, 2007).
Blogs are part of a group of social software tools that have become imperative to
libraries and librarians to provide patrons with events, reader advisories, book clubs, and
promote new programs and databases (Farkas, 2007). Blogs have also proved very useful
tool that allows librarians to communicate and collaborate with others within the
profession to exchange ideas and services (Farkas, 2007). Further, blogs create an
internal community for library staff and management to discuss library matters, including
new ideas, patrons’ feedback regarding services, and posting questions (Farkas, 2007).
With the continual growth of the web, online information has become
overwhelming to follow and searching for updated information regarding news,
education, and professional development have become “time-consuming and frustrating
especially when some websites and blogs are updated frequently” (Farkas, 2007, p. 49).
48

In 2005, a survey conducted among librarians indicated that 30% of participants stated
that regularly, they read more than 100 blogs to keep track of the new information. It is
almost impossible to keep track of all the information posted in 100 blogs (Farkas, 2007).
Thus, web syndication social tool (RSS) has become vital to keep track of new posts in
many web resources together (Farkas, 2007).
The RSS breaks any website in different chunks of information to free the
contents from the web page and post all new posts in a page called RSS feed (Farkas,
2007). Web visitors can subscribe to the web’s RSS feeds and the aggregator will post
every new post within the web website to the RSS feed page (Farkas, 2007). Users will
need to browse only RSS feed page to access the updated posts and information on
websites (Farkas, 2007). Thus, by using a social application tool such as RSS, librarians
will be able to access all updated information from many web resources and blogs in less
time that help them to enrich their knowledge consistently with updated information
(Farkas, 2007).
Queens Library expanded the use of social media to promote library programs and
communicate with library patrons using social software such as social networking
websites, blogs, and public forums (Queens Library, 2014c). Library patrons post
questions regarding library-related issues or services using the library social platform.
RSS feeds allow the Queens Library staff to answer patrons’ questions in a timely
manner, as the RSS software updates the library’s social platform contents
simultaneously.
Librarians participate in a vital role in research process as they connect users,
including researchers with needed information resources despite the information format
49

or the technology used for retrieval (O'Dell, 2010). The rapid changes occurring in
cultures, technologies, and budgets have motivated librarians to adapt faster to those
changes and maintain the library role in education (O'Dell, 2010). Scholarly journals and
databases are library resources provided to researchers (O'Dell, 2010).
The subscription cost, however, increased as the number of published journals
increased as well (O'Dell, 2010). With budget crises, librarians started advocating the
“open access, supporting the Scholar Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition
(SPARC), creating institutional repositories, and educating faculty and researches” (p.
246) through communicating with authors to obtain their permission for others to use
their publications (O'Dell, 2010). Creative Commons Attribution license created
different layers of permissions in which authors may permit library users – as nonprofit
organizations - with full access to some or all publications (O'Dell, 2010). The open
access movement enables libraries to survive budget crises and continue their role in
education and research (O'Dell, 2010).
Libraries use Web 2.0 technologies to communicate with patrons and researchers
to obtain their feedback regarding open access journals (O'Dell, 2010). Further, by
deploying Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, libraries increased the patrons and
researchers’ awareness of new listings constantly and librarians posted a feedback link on
each listing page (O'Dell, 2010). Libraries use other social media and social networks for
professional communication such as Second Life.com for service provision and
conferences, Twitter.com to tweet all news in the library profession and new technologies
to each other, and Facebook.com to outreach patrons, collaboration, and communication
among other social media tools and social network websites (O'Dell, 2010). Many
50

researchers have examined the library and librarians role in developing web 2.0 services
and virtual research environment (VRE) and agreed that librarians have an imperative
role in research by deploying their expertise in providing access and finding research
materials (O'Dell, 2010).
Teenagers and Social Networking
Prior to the rise of social networks, teenagers were spending most of their out of
school times communicating using cell phones either by talking or texting as an
important part of their growing behavior (Lupa & Howerton, 2009). However,
distressing parents about excessive cell phone bills was frustrating to teenagers who want
to communicate with peers and friends to share their daily experiences (Lupa &
Howerton, 2009). The first version of MySpace.com social network appeared in 2003,
targeted music fans, and later became popular among college students (Lupa &
Howerton, 2009). MySpace.com statistics showed that teenagers aged 12 to 17 have
increasingly become MySpace.com users and as of August 2006, MySpace.com has
increased to 12% of unique visitors from teenagers (Lupa & Howerton, 2009).
King (2009) stated that while the studies of college students’ behavior using
social networking software are extensive, tweens and high school teenagers remain
understudied. Therefore, King studied tweens and teenagers’ habits using online social
networks and differentiated their use habits by age group. The study findings
demonstrated that tweens, as beginners in using social networks, prefer using
MySpace.com for highly customizable pages with backgrounds and colors (King, 2009).
A teenager who grows older and has more experience using social networks found
Facebook.com was their favorite social network as they focus on simpler layout with
51

more functionality than the design (King, 2009). Most students have recognized the
social networks in their middle school and 70% of the study participants have created
their accounts on social networks at the age of 12 (King, 2009).
The popularity of social networking services (SNS) among teenagers have
expanded consequently to teenagers’ increasing interest for communications, interaction,
and exchange experiences with their peers and friends within their social circle (Kim,
Shim, & Ahn, 2011). Social media applications (apps) have added significant values to
social networks by incorporating surveys, forums, games, and polls to the social network
websites to increase the interaction among users (Kim et al., 2011). Social network
websites such as MySpace.com has personalized features that allow users to create their
pages with images, backgrounds of their choice with custom layouts that allow users to
choose their style frame, and designs to reflect their personality and define their behavior
(Rapacki, 2007).
Social Networking and Privacy
Timm and Duven (2008) defined privacy as the personal information considered
important and unachievable by the public such as the individual’s name, address, social
security number, phone number, online user name, and e-mail address. Social
networking privacy has two implications: (a) the intention when a user intentionally posts
personal information to share with others and (b) the expectation that the user’s personal
information will be kept private (Timm & Duven, 2008). The public can access
information posted on social network websites unless the owner has modified the privacy
settings to preclude the sensitive personal information from being shared with public
(Timm & Duven, 2008).
52

Individual privacy has become an issue of concern because individuals must
provide personal information as a requirement to join a social networking website
(Agosto & Abbas, 2011). Thus, considering the questioning, the security of personal
information posted on social network websites is important, and an individual must ask
questions, such as “What does privacy mean in a highly networked world? How risky it
is to post personal information online? And who has access to the information that we
put online, and for how long?” (Agosto & Abbas, 2011, p. 60) to analyze, evaluate, and
decide which personal information is acceptable for sharing with the world.
Agosto and Abbas (2011) asserted that for the young people, more questions
should be raised, such as how much control teenagers should have over their own
personal information. In addition, how much privacy restrictions should adults enforce
on teenagers? Many researchers advised that teens should be monitored because they are
willing to post and share most or all their personal information because they are not
concerned about their privacy issues as adults (Agosto & Abbas, 2011).
Other researchers supported the claim that posting personal information is
exposing teenagers to potential online risks (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). A teen Internet
safety study conducted by Cox Communication associated with National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) found that 71% of teenagers aged 13 to 17
have received messages or requests to chat from strangers and 40% among them either
replied to the strangers’ messages or chatted with them (Youn, 2008). Thirty-seven
percent of teenage participants in the study had no qualms regarding the probability of
misusing their personal information by strangers without their authorization (Youn,
2008).
53

Agosto and Abbas (2011), however, claimed that teenagers may post much of
their personal information on social networking websites, but they are also concerned
about their privacy. Further, a study conducted by Pew Internet and American Life in
2007, found that 55% of the teenagers who have online profiles on social network
websites successfully managed their profiles and concealed their sensitive information
from public (Kranich, 2007). Other teenagers used their first name only with pictures but
no address or phone numbers posted on their public profiles (Kranich, 2007).
According to Kranich (2007), school and public librarians have to play their role
in enriching the teenagers’ online experience within safe online environment by (a)
providing users with information to learn how social networks operate and how to protect
their privacy online, (b) explain to users the importance of social networking for
teenagers to create powerful and dynamic information contents, (c) learn about privacy
and engage users in dialogue to know their perception regarding privacy in the digital
age, and (d) involve parents and teachers in a dialogue to educate them about the positive
effects and benefits of social networking in teenagers’ lives. Librarians have to
understand the limits and the expectations of privacy within the cultural shift that is
occurring consequently to social networking (Kranich, 2007).
Public Libraries and Privacy Laws and Regulations
Teenagers’ privacy has prompted parental concern (Youn, 2008). United States
Congress has supported privacy protection by introducing the Children’s Privacy
Protection and Parental Empowerment Act (CPPPEA) in 1999 (Youn, 2008). The
CPPPEA law prohibits any information broker from selling or purchasing children’s
information aged below 16 years without parental consent (Youn, 2008). Further, to
54

protect student’s privacy, Congress passed the Student Privacy Protection Act (SPPA) to
prohibit companies conducting research in schools from collecting any personal
information from students in kindergarten to grade 12 without parental written
permission before collecting any information from students (Youn, 2008).
In 1998, The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) was passed to prohibit minors
from accessing harmful materials (Youn, 2008). The Child Online Protection Act
restricted children aged below 13 from creating accounts on certain websites and required
parental consent for other websites (Youn, 2008). The federal courts, however, have
ruled that COPA violates the free speech right guaranteed under the Constitution (Youn,
2008). Thus, in preventing the implementation of COPA, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed
to consider that COPA violated the free speech constitutional right (Agosto & Abbas,
2011).
To protect the children’s privacy on the Internet, the Federal Communication
Commission (FCC) instituted the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) to prohibit
minors from accessing any inappropriate online contents using school or library
computers (Youn, 2008). The Children’s Internet Protection Act declared that public
schools and libraries must implement technological filters on their computers to prohibit
minors aged below 17 from accessing any inappropriate online materials for schools and
libraries to receive federal funding (Agosto & Abbas, 2011; Jaeger & Zheng, 2009). The
Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) includes several sections to identify the major
strategies to protect children online (Jaeger & Zheng, 2009).
Section 1711 highlights the child protection filtering strategy for public schools
by limiting the funding for elementary and secondary schools depends on the school
55

protection strategy (Jaeger & Zheng, 2009). The section requires schools to implement
filtering technologies that prohibits students from accessing any harmful material online,
including child pornography or any obscene visual depictions under the supervision of
local educational agencies (Jaeger & Zheng, 2009). Similarly, section 1712 highlights
the same enforcement requirement for implementation in all public libraries under the
supervision of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) (Jaeger & Zheng,
2009).
The CIPA includes section 1721 for both public schools and libraries to enforce
the Internet safety policy as a requirement to receive universal service discounts (Jaeger
& Zheng, 2009). The universal service discount program (E-Rate) was inaugurated by
the telecommunication act of 1996 to provide public libraries and schools with 20 to 90%
discounts for Internet services, equipment, and telecommunication services (Jaeger &
Zheng, 2009). The E-Rate fund provides schools with approximately $2.25 billion a
year, which is 90% of the total E-Rate funding (Jaeger & Zheng, 2009). E-Rate funds
public libraries with $250 million a year, which is 4% of the total E-Rate funding (Jaeger
& Zheng, 2009). The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) provide each state
library with funds to use for library programs and services to the state’s public and under
the administration of Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) (Jaeger & Zheng,
2009).
Both E-Rate and LSTA funds have significant effects on public libraries to
expand the online access of library resources to patrons and students and provide free
Internet access to students in almost all school libraries and all public libraries as well
(Jaeger & Zheng, 2009). To receive the E-Rate discounts and LSTA grants, public
56

libraries must comply with the CIPA and implement Internet filters to protect children
from nudity, sexual activities, or any other harmful materials that have no literary values
to minors (Jaeger, Bertot, & McClure, 2004). Internet filters, however, are also blocking
adult patrons from accessing research materials and other vital information regarding
health care, safe sex practice issues, and many other general health informational
websites (Jaeger et al., 2004).
Implementing Internet filters in public libraries to comply with CIPA is blocking
63% of websites that provide general health information and 91% of websites that
promote sexual health, which hinders the role of schools and libraries as sources for
knowledge (Jaeger et al., 2004). Many teachers and school librarians reported that the
Internet filters implemented on school computers and libraries block vital informational
resources for students, such as the social bookmarking Delicious.com, some search
engines, and educational blogs, where students need to view or to participate (Jansen,
2010a). Blocking social networking websites from school and library computers,
however, is in conflict with the first amendment of the United States Constitution of the
Intellectual Freedom (Jansen, 2010a).
The American Library Association (2011) has defined intellectual freedom as the
right to receive information regarding all points of view and subjects without any
restrictions and without judging by others. Consequently, the Neighborhood Children’s
Internet Protection Act (NCIPA) has been proposed as a CIPA subtitle C to address the
local agencies, such as schools or libraries are free to determine the inappropriate online
sources that need to be filtered and blocked. In addition, NCIPA specifies that schools
and libraries not be required to use Internet filters under NCIPA; however, such agencies
57

must conduct policy that covers how minors will be protected from inappropriate
materials in schools and libraries (Jansen, 2010a). When some schools developed new
policies to protect minors from inappropriate online materials, they blocked online
sources more than what was required by CIPA (Jansen, 2010a). Other schools removed
the Internet filters as compliance with NCIPA but required physical monitoring of the
students’ online conduct by staff and teachers (Jansen, 2010a).
In contrast with schools who serve minors, public libraries provide informational
sources to minors and adults. Thus, submitting public libraries to the Internet filters will
block many educational and informational materials, which may lead to patrons’ mistrust
in the libraries as the source for their informational needs (Houghton-Jan, 2010). The
cost of implementing and maintaining Internet filtering technology is another vital factor
that was considered by public libraries (Houghton-Jan, 2010). Public libraries compared
the E-Rate funding that libraries receive to comply with CIPA with the needed cost to
implement and maintain the Internet filtering technology on the library computers
(Houghton-Jan, 2010). The Internet filtering implementation cost for some libraries was
found higher than the E-Rate and LSTA funds that library would receive as compliance
to CIPA (Houghton-Jan, 2010).
Public libraries created workshops for children and teenagers to educate them on
how to protect themselves online as the libraries’ commitment toward protecting children
online (Houghton-Jan, 2010). Further, well-funded libraries with extensive Internet
collections would rather avoid implementing the Internet filters to allow patrons to access
the whole library Internet collection (Houghton-Jan, 2010). Poor community libraries
with small Internet collections, however, would rather comply with CIPA and implement
58

the Internet filters (Houghton-Jan, 2010). The compliance of the small libraries with
CIPA is that they depend on the E-Rate and LSTA funding to maintain their in-house
collection (Houghton-Jan, 2010). In conclusion, teenagers have better chance to access
online informational resources, including social networking websites, and learn how to
protect themselves online in public libraries than schools.
Teens’ and Librarians’ Use of Social Networks in Libraries
In fall of 2007, Lupa conducted a study to investigate how young adult librarians
who serve teenagers in libraries use social networks (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). Librarians
from different geographical areas in United States participated in the survey. The study
findings indicated that 91% of the library teens use the library computers to access social
networks (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). Further, 78% of the teens use library computers to
access the virtual world and games (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). The study results also
indicated that 61% of the librarians who participated in the study had personal pages on
Facebook.com or MySpace.com, but most of them use the social networks for their
personal needs and not communicate with teens regarding library matters (Agosto &
Abbas, 2011). In addition, 62% of the participating librarians complained that their
libraries or schools are not interested to use social networks as outreach revenue to
promote library programs, services, and activities (Agosto & Abbas, 2011).
The aim of Agosto and Abbas’ (2011) study was to examine if librarians use
social networks to communicate with teens. The study findings indicated that only 21%
of the participating librarians used social networks to communicate with teens to promote
book clubs, events, book discussions, and other library activities (Agosto & Abbas,
2011). However, 79% of the participants never used social networks to communicate
59

with teens or to promote library activities (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). The study results
also identified some barriers for librarians when using social networks to communicate
with teens, such as some libraries are blocking social networks as part of the institution’s
policy (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). Other librarians reported that training programs created
to educate parents and caregivers about social networks did not meet their interests and
were not well attended (Agosto & Abbas, 2011).
Another study conducted in 2009 by Agosto and Abbas was to determine the
public libraries’ use of social networking to communicate with teens. The researchers
used MySpace.com and Facebook.com social networks, as they are considered the largest
social networks, to search for pages created by librarians under investigation (Agosto &
Abbas, 2009). Agosto and Abbas (2011) found that “73% of the libraries serving
populations over 100,000 had at least one page on either MySpace.com or
Facebook.com” (p. 5). The study findings indicated that all large libraries that serve
populations of more than 100,000 patrons have library websites and 93% of those
libraries have pages for teens within the library website (Agosto & Abbas, 2011).
However, most of library websites have no hyperlink on the website to link the library
website to the library page on social network websites (Agosto & Abbas, 2011).
The study findings also indicated that only 30% of libraries serving smaller
populations, notably from 5,000 to 10,000 patrons, had a library page on either
Facebook.com or MySpace.com (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). For libraries with a page on
social network websites, the purpose of the page was to provide a link to the library
website, to promote library programs, and to post library’s photos and video clips of
programs and activities (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). Finally, the study findings indicated
60

that most public libraries in the United States provide many services through social
networks (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). However, the library’s center focus is to serve adult
users but little focus appeared on serving teenagers (Agosto & Abbas, 2011).
Social Media in Education
The use of social media technologies, including social networking, has increased
rapidly in the recent years (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011). People usually use social
media as social and entertaining platforms. Social media offer collaboration among
people, which consequently lead to the development of many forms of social capital
(Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011).
Educators have recognized the opportunities to use social media technologies in
education as platforms that allow students to interact with educators and with peers in a
scholarly setting (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011). Researchers conducted a study in
2008-2010 using the Web Service Quality (WeSQu) evaluation tool by Temper
University of Technology Temper, Finland, to identify the social media features that
enhance learning in higher education (Silius, Kailanto, & Tervakari, 2011). The results
indicated that 73% of the students who participated in the study claimed that the ease of
use is the most important reason for using social media (Silius et al., 2011). Further,
Silius et al. (2011) found that features such as (a) create friends lists, (b) share content
with friends, and (c) ability to comment to friends’ posts are the most needed features for
social media to enhance learning.
The multiple functions that social media provide allow people to (a) create
profiles, (b) share videos, (c) post on other people’s walls, and (d) use social
bookmarking (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011). These functions increased the abilities of
61

social media and social networking websites to be used in different fields. Some social
networking websites such as Facebook offer all of the aforementioned functions, thus
increasing the ability of using Facebook as an educational platform (Poellhuber &
Anderson, 2011). The use of the collaboration aspect in learning has enhanced distance
education (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011). Students prefer the social interaction that
social media provide as the number of the students who register for online classes
become significantly larger than the number of students who register to take on-campus
classes (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011).
Chen and Bryer (2012) asserted that the collaboration feature of social media
increases the ability of using it as an educational tool in both a formal and informal
educational environment. Banks (2007) examined learning in both formal and informal
environments. Banks found that informal learning becomes more important to students
as they grow older. The results indicated that the formal learning in a student’s life from
Grade 1 to Grade 12 is 19% (Chen & Bryer, 2012). In collage years, however, the
percentage decreases to 8%, and in graduate years the percentage decreased to 5% (Chen
& Bryer, 2012). By contrast, informal learning becomes more important when students
graduated from high school level (Chen & Bryer, 2012).
Integrating social network features in formal education rarely occurs (Chen &
Bryer, 2012). In an online learning environment, course management systems (CMS)
such as Blackboard are used in higher education (Chen & Bryer, 2012). The social
interaction features are integrated in some CMSs (Chen & Bryer, 2012). However, the
uses of these features are allowed for one class and one semester only due to institutional
security restrictions. Chen and Bryer (2012) further claimed that the use of social media
62

allows educators to bypass the course management system’s limitations by enabling
constructive collaborative interactions between students and peers and between students
and educators. The only concern regarding the use of social networking as a formal
learning platform is the privacy of students and educators (Chen & Bryer, 2012).
Integrating HomeworkNYC social media applications into social networking
websites such as Facebook and MySpace (Braun, 2010) allows students to use every
social feature provided by those social networks while obtaining homework assistance.
In addition, HomeworkNYC social applications added more features by converting the
social network website to a complete educational platform. Students use HomeworkNYC
Apps to (a) obtain real-time homework help, (b) search libraries resources for educational
materials, and (c) reserve a place to attend educational events in libraries (Braun, 2010;
Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2010). Through integrating the social
applications to their social networking accounts, students become able to use all other
features offered by the social network websites such as sharing contents with others,
posting to walls, and comments on posts (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011; Silius et al.,
2011).
Gap in the Research Literature
Previous researchers investigated the role of social media in higher education and
distance learning (Chen & Bryer, 2012; Junco, 2011; Kurkela, 2011; Poellhuber &
Anderson, 2011; Secker & Price, 2007; Silius et al., 2011; Sodt & Summey, 2009).
Previous researchers also discussed the role of social media in higher education from
various perspectives. Junco (2011) assessed the relationship between the use of social
media in higher education and student engagement in the educational process.
63

Secker and Price (2007) evaluated the public libraries’ use of social media as
advertizing platforms for educational resources and library services to distance learners.
Other researchers defined the social collaborative features needed to enhance the distance
learning experience (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011; Sodt & Summey, 2009). Chen and
Bryer (2012) examined the use of social media in formal and informal learning
environments in higher education from the educators’ perspectives. Further, Kurkela
(2011) assessed the use of social media in higher education from the perspective of
technology innovation.
The review of literature revealed a significant gap in knowledge in the area of
using social media as a formal or informal educational environment for high school
students. Many elementary and secondary schools block social networking websites to
comply with CIPA to obtain federal funding (Jansen, 2010a). Public libraries, however,
allow high school students to use social media in library facilities as a compliance with
NCIPA (Jansen, 2010a). In individual cases, some librarians use social media to
communicate with students to engage them in library educational activities and provide
them with educational resources (Agosto & Abbas, 2011).
Most librarians, however, use social media for personal reasons and not for workrelated issues (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). The purpose of the current study was to fill this
gap in the research literature by exploring the librarians' perceptions regarding their role
in delivering homework assistance to teenage students ages 15 to 18 through using social
media in library facilities. The textual description obtained from the librarians'
perceptions assessed the use social media applications and social networking websites as

64

an approach to deliver informal educational services to students aged 15 to 18 in library
facilities.
Conclusion
Human development is dependent upon social interaction among people (Stolley,
2005; Thio, 2003). Social media technology offers socialization through a computermediated approach that allows people to create a new wave of online virtual communities
(Xiao et al., 2012). People use social media mostly for personal reasons such as
entertainment and connecting with others to share contents and ideas (Jang Hyun et al.,
2010). The expanded use of social media and social networking among teenagers allows
them to communicate their daily experiences with their peers (Kim et al., 2011).
Social media applications have added more value to the social networking for
teenagers by adding more features such as games, polls, and forums that increased their
social interaction using social networks (Kim et al., 2011). Administrators and staff of
public libraries and higher educational institutions have recognized the importance and
popularity of social media in communications among people (Agosto & Abbas, 2011;
Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011). Public libraries expanded the use of social media to
communicate with patrons and students to advertize its resources and services to learner
(Secker & Price, 2007).
Leaders of higher educational institutions have recognized the importance of
using social media to increase collaboration between learners and educators, but the
privacy of both students and educators is a concern (Chen & Bryer, 2012). For teenagers,
however, a literature gap was revealed in the area of using social media as an approach to
delivering educational services to high school students. This qualitative exploratory case
65

study may address the gap in literature regarding assessing the use of social media to
deliver educational services through public libraries.
Summary
Chapter 2 provided a literature review that outlines a historical overview of the
development of computer-mediated technologies such as social media and the social
needs they address in the light of socialization theories (Stolley, 2005; Thio, 2003). The
research indicated the importance of using social media technologies as a collaborative
interaction method in higher education (Chen & Bryer, 2012) and in public libraries
(Agosto & Abbas, 2011). The literature review highlights the lack of knowledge
regarding the use of social media in teenagers’ education and laid the groundwork for the
current study. The following chapter includes the research methodology and design that
used for this qualitative exploratory case study to explore the librarians’ perceptions and
lived experiences regarding the use of HomeworkNYC apps to deliver tutoring services
to students aged 15 to 18.

66

Chapter 3:
Method
The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory case study was to explore the
librarians’ perceptions toward using HomeworkNYC social media applications (Apps) as
an educational approach to deliver homework assistance to students ages 15 to18 through
social network websites such as Facebook.com and MySpace.com in Queens Library
branches. Chapter 3 (a) delineates the research methodology and design appropriateness,
(b) presents the research questions, and (c) includes a description of the instruments to
collect and analyze the data. Further, the chapter includes a discussion of research
methodology, data collection technique, population and sample, confidentiality of
participants, instrument validity, credibility, dependability, transferability, data analysis.
Research Questions
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
perceptions of librarians in the Queens Library system toward the use of HomeworkNYC
Apps to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in all Queens Library
branches to supplement the lack of free homework assistance to teens. The central
research question that guided this exploratory case study was, How do librarians perceive
the use of social media applications such as DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt
to deliver homework assistance services to teenagers in Queens Library branches? To
explore the librarians’ perceptions further, two subquestions were used:
R1. How do librarians perceive the use of social networking websites such as
Facebook and MySpace as educational platforms?

67

R2. How do librarians perceive their role in the process of using social media
applications to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in
library branches ?
Research Method and Design Appropriateness
Research Method Appropriateness
Various research methods were considered for this study, such as quantitative,
qualitative, or mixed study. The purpose of a quantitative research paradigm is to assess
objective theories by investigating the relationship between variables that can be
measured numerically (Ingham-Broomfield, 2014). Quantitative researchers measure
variables by using real-world physical measures such as thermometers or psychological
measures such as rating scales (Attali, 2014). The focus of this study was to explore
participant’s perceptions. A quantitative research method was not appropriate for this
study because the focus of the current study was on exploring perceptions, not on testing
theories. Qualitative researchers aim to understand the participants' interpretation and the
meaning of their experience (Merriam, 2009). A qualitative research method was
appropriate because this study focused on exploring the participants' perceptions toward
the phenomenon under study based on their experiences. Qualitative research methods
have common characteristics that distinguish them from quantitative methodology
(Merriam, 2009). The common characteristics include (a) searching for the meaning of
the participants’ experiences to achieve understanding, (b) the researcher is the primary
instrument in the research for data collection and analysis, (c) the research process is
inductive to build theories or concepts and not deductive to test hypotheses, and (d)
providing a rich description of the phenomenon under study (Merriam, 2009). A
68

qualitative research method was appropriate for this study as the aim was to explore the
librarians' perceptions toward the use of the social media approach as an educational
service model in library branches.
Research Design Appropriateness
Various qualitative research designs were considered for this study. In the
phenomenological research design, the researcher desires to present how simple units of
lived experiences can be used to construct deep and complex meanings (Merriam, 2002).
Subjective information is vital for the researcher to understand the participants’ motives
because of what they perceive to be a real influence their actions (Flood, 2010). A
phenomenological design was not appropriate for this study because the focus was to
explore how librarians perceive the use of social media applications as an educational
service approach in the library and not on understanding their motives. The ethnographic
design is used to study cultures and human society where culture defined as attitudes,
values, beliefs that shape the actions and behavior of specific sets of people (Merriam,
2002).
An ethnographic design was not appropriate for this study because the aim of the
current study was to explore human perceptions not correlated with human culture.
Grounded theory researchers hope to understand the phenomenon under study and
develop a theory that is grounded in the collected data (Merriam, 2009). The data
collection in grounded theory research is field-based and mostly collected from
interviews and must include the participants’ perspectives (Lawrence & Tar, 2013).
Grounded theory was not appropriate because the aim of this study was to explore
perceptions not to develop theory.
69

The case study approach aims to "investigate a contemporary phenomenon in
depth and within its real-life context" (Yin, 2009, p. 18). For this research, the case study
approach is appropriate because the focus of this study was on investigating the use of
social media as an informal educational approach in Queens Library branches. Yin
(2009) categorized case studies to explanatory, exploratory, descriptive, and multiplecase studies. An exploratory case study design was appropriate for this study because the
focus was on answering how and why questions (Yin, 2009). The aim of this study was
to investigate the phenomenon of using social media to deliver homework assistance to
teenage students in libraries through exploring the librarians’ perceptions based on their
experiences. Young adult librarians in Queens Library branches provide teenage patrons
with educational services including homework assistance (Walter & Mediavilla, 2005;
Young Adult Library Services Association, 2014). Thus, exploring the librarians'
perceptions was needed to understand their experiences while delivering homework
assistance to teenage patrons in library branches.
Population
Jansen (2010b) defined the research population as individuals who have similar
characteristics. The population for this study includes young adult librarians working in
Queens Borough public libraries. Queens Public Library system is the largest public
library in the United States in circulating library materials (New York Community Trust,
2012). Queens Library serves the residents of Queens Borough, New York City. Queens
Borough is one of the highest diverse boroughs in United States with a population of
2,278,860 people (New Americans Program Queens Library, 2012).

70

The focus of the study was on a public library organization in the process of using
the HomeworkNYC social approach. The HomeworkNYC social applications (Apps)
allow users to (a) connect to the three library systems and search their library catalogs for
educational materials, (b) search the three library systems for activities and educational
events to attend, and (c) create lists of library materials from the three library systems
combined (Braun, 2010). Queens Public Library was chosen for this study because this
library system has the highest circulation in the nation serving a very diverse population
(New Americans Program Queens Library, 2012).
The study population included librarians who were primarily involved in the
process of providing homework assistance in the library. The criterion for the study was
that participants must have worked in the Queens Library system as Young Adult
Librarians for at least 5 years. A list of young adult librarians with at least 5 consecutive
years of service in Queens Library was provided and a sample of 20 librarians was
purposefully selected for the study.
Sampling Frame
To collect data for research, a unit of analysis must be selected (Merriam, 2009).
The researcher selects a sample of sites to visit, people to interview, activities to observe,
or documents to read (Merriam, 2009). Selecting a research sample depends on the
research questions that needs to be answered (Cleary, Horsfall, & Hayter, 2014). The
sample types are (a) probability sampling that allows the researcher to generalize the
research results on the population that the sample is selected from and (b) non-probability
sampling that allows the researcher to address the research problem and to understand the
phenomenon under study (Merriam, 2009). Because generalizing the research results
71

statistically is not the aim of qualitative research, probability sampling is not usually
appropriate for qualitative research (Merriam, 2009). In contrast, non-probability
sampling is appropriate for qualitative research, as the researcher aims to discover and
understand the phenomenon under study to resolve the research problem with no interest
in generalizing the research results (Merriam, 2009).
Purposeful sampling is a common type of non-probability sampling for qualitative
research where the selected sample serves as a source of rich data about the phenomenon
under study (Merriam, 2009). Purposeful sample size is ruled by quality over quantity, as
the researcher might collect rich data from a sample size as small as three participants
(Koerber & McMichael, 2008).
The purposeful sampling selection of people or sites is based on essential criteria
determined by the researcher (Merriam, 2009). The determined purposeful sampling
criteria assist the researcher to identify rich data units. The researcher has to describe the
criteria that are used while choosing the sample and the significance of using such criteria
to choose a sample of rich data units (Merriam, 2009).
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
perceptions of the librarians in Queens Library toward the use of HomeworkNYC apps as
an educational service model to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in
Queens Library branches. Thus, purposeful sampling was appropriate, as the study was
designed to explore the participants’ perceptions with a qualitative exploratory case study
approach. The sample was selected from young adult librarians who serve the teenage
patrons in the library.

72

Selecting a sample of young adult librarians assisted in collecting rich data about
the phenomenon under study, as the librarians under this rank are defined as the skilled
and knowledgeable professionals who provide teenagers with a quality library services
(Young Adult Library Services Association, 2010) and (b) qualified young adult
librarians for the sampling selection must been working under the same rank as young
adult librarians in Queens Library for at least 5 years serving teenage patrons. The work
experience criteria were essential for the study to ensure (a) the librarians’ rich
experience working with and serving teenagers in different communities within Queens
Borough, New York City; and (b) the librarians’ rich knowledge of the library
organizational culture, policies, and procedures that manage the relationship between
librarians and teenage patrons in the library.
For this particular exploratory case study, all young adult librarians in Queens
Library with at least 5 years of working experience were invited to participate in the
study. A purposeful sample of 20 young adult librarians was selected to participate in the
study. Permission to use the library premises to conduct the study using Queens Library
facilities and interview participants was obtained from the Chief Operating Officer
(COO) of Queens Library (see Appendix A).
The researcher used the Queens Library organizational e-mail system to send emails to prospective participants. The e-mail explained the purpose of the study and
requested voluntary participation in the study. The e-mail was sent with the consent form
as an attachment needing to be printed and signed by the participant confirming
agreement to participate in the study at the time of the interview.

73

Further, the e-mail also contained the researcher’s name and contact information
in case the participant wanted to contact the researcher for more details regarding the
study before deciding whether to participate in the study or not. The researcher requested
each participant to reply with a notification of the participant’s decision regarding
participation in the study. After completing the process of selecting the participants, the
researcher contacted the participants using the Queens Library organizational e-mail
system to schedule face-to-face interviews with the participants individually at their
respective library branches.
Informed Consent
Informed consent is a form that participants must sign before the start of data
collection. The form indicated the participants’ willingness to participate in the study.
The participant must be 18 years or older to sign the consent form (Merriam, 2009). The
informed consent form was written in English language (see Appendix B), as all
participants were English speakers and the form contained the following sections and
information: (a) purpose, intention, rationale for the study, and that the study was in
partial fulfillment of a doctoral degree; (b) participation in the study is voluntarily; and
(c) the participant’s name will be kept confidential and hidden from all parties, including
library administration.
Further, the form delineated the participants’ right to withdraw from the research
at any time or at any stage of the study either before, either during, or after completing
the study without risking or stressing themselves greater than the normal stress
encountered from their professional routine work as young adult librarians. The
researcher’s contact information was noted on the informed consent form. If the
74

participant decided to withdraw from the study before collecting data, he or she could
have contacted the researcher through his e-mail address to notify him of such a decision.
The participant received a confirmation e-mail from the researcher to confirm the
request to withdraw from the study. If the participant decided to withdraw from the study
after data collection and e-mailed the researcher with a withdrawal notification, the
researcher would have extracted all data related to the withdrawn participant and deleted
it. The participant could receive a confirmation e-mail from the researcher with the
detailed process of deleting the data. The participant’s withdrawal would be documented
in the study.
Confidentiality
A qualitative researcher has to maintain confidentiality while conducting the
research and protect the participants’ privacy by avoiding others from interfering or
accessing to any information, recorded interviews, or field notes that involve the
participants (Hammersley & Traianou, 2012). To protect the participants’ privacy, a
researcher must not link any collected research data to names to grant the participants
anonymity (Neuman, 2006). All research data, including field notes, documents, audio
recordings, and transcriptions must be kept secure to ensure the research confidentiality
(Hammersley & Traianou, 2012).
To ensure confidentiality and anonymity to participants in this study, the
researcher sent an e-mail to each participant to (a) explain to the participant in details the
procedures that will be taken throughout the study to ensure the participant’s
confidentiality and anonymity, and (b) provide the participant with a clear explanation to
the purpose and the intention of the study. The researcher conducted face-to-face
75

interviews with 20 young adult librarians who agreed to participate in the study
voluntarily. The researcher conducted the interviews at the participants’ working library
branches. The interviews were audio-recorded. The researcher assigned letters from A
to T for each library branch to identify the branch in the study.
The researcher assigned a number from 1 to 20 to each participant to be used as
the participant’s identification number in the study. Further, the participants’ positions in
the library under study were not included in the participants’ demographic information to
ensure participants’ confidentiality. The comprehensive research data were collected
from interviews, audio recordings, and written transcripts were transferred and saved in
computer files using Microsoft Word and labeled under the participant’s number.
Further, the Microsoft word document and the electronic recording file of each
participant were saved in a folder labeled under the facility’s assigned letter.
The researcher transferred all electronic files and folders to a removable storage
media. All hard copies of written papers, including written transcripts were shredded and
destroyed. After transferring the audio-recorded files to the storage media, the recorded
audio files on the recording device were deleted. The storage media that holds all the
data will be stored in a secured locked safe in the researcher’s house and will be kept for
3 years after completing the study. After the 3 year period, the researcher will reformat
the storage media that holds all research information to ensure deleting all traces of the
research data.
Geographic Location
The study was conducted in the Queens Public library that serves the residents of
Queens Borough, New York City area through 62 library branches, and one central
76

library (Queens Library, 2012). Queens Borough, New York City is recognized as the
most diverse county in the United States of America (New Americans Program Queens
Library, 2012). Of the total population of Queens Borough, 27.6% are White nonHispanic, 27.5% are Hispanic, 22.8% are Asian, and 17.7% are African American and
Black non-Hispanic (New Americans Program Queens Library, 2012). Further,
regarding the household income, 332,165 persons (15.0%) are below the poverty level
(New Americans Program Queens Library, 2012).
Instrumentation
In qualitative exploratory case study research, the researcher’s involvement as a
key instrument in a research study may create bias in which the researcher’s influence
affects the research process at any level (Miles & Huberman, 1994). The purpose of this
qualitative exploratory case study was to explore participants' feeling, thoughts, and
experiences toward using social media applications to deliver homework assistant to
students aged 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches. The researcher works as a librarian
and holds opinions and assumptions toward the phenomenon under study. Thus, the
bracketing process that aim to identify the researcher's presumptions and the epoché
process that aims to set aside the researcher's preconceived notions toward the
phenomenon under study were followed throughout this exploratory case study.
Conducting face-to-face interviews, participant-observation, and documents were the
research instruments used in this study to collect evidence (Yin, 2003).
Interviews
Conducting interviews with the study participants was the primary research
instrument used to collect data in this study.
77

Open-ended interviews allow the researcher to capture the experience from the
participants’ perspective without any predetermination to those perspectives while
selecting the interview questions (Patton, 2002). Consequently, a semistructured
interview process was designed for the current study using open-ended questions. The
interview questions were designed to allow the participants to express their thoughts and
feelings regarding their experiences to explore their perceptions of the phenomenon
under study. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.
The aim of the current study was to explore librarians’ perceptions toward using
the HomeworkNYC apps as a social media tool to deliver homework assistance to
students aged 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches. Young adult librarians in the Queens
Library system are primarily involved in promoting the HomeworkNYC Apps to students
ages 15 to 18 that students can use to obtain real-time homework assistance from
professional teachers (Braun, 2010). Thus, the themes collected from the research data
were used to assess the effectiveness of using the social media as an educational service
approach in Queens Library branches from the librarians’ perspectives. Allowing
librarians to express their perceptions as the professionals who deliver educational
services to teenage patrons (Young Adult Library Services Association, 2010) was
essential to assess the effectiveness of using social media as an educational service
approach to deliver homework assistance to teenagers in library branches. The
participants were able to identify challenges they face when using social media as an
educational service model to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18.

78

Pilot Study
Prior to conducting interviews to collect data for the study, a pilot study was
needed to validate the research instrument. The pilot study was conducted through
voluntary interviews with a small sample of participants to test the accuracy of the
interview questions (Merriam, 2009). For the current study, three young adult librarians
in Queens Library who met the same criteria as the participants but were not part of the
study participated voluntarily in the pilot study. The researcher scheduled face-to-face
interviews with each of the three participants at their working library facilities.
At the interview, the researcher explained the purpose of the study to the
participants and assured them anonymity and confidentiality. The researcher followed
the same confidentiality procedural steps of conducting the interviews with the pilot
study’s participants as were followed while conducting the interviews with the
participants in the main study. The interviews were audio-recorded, then the data were
collected and transcribed.
After conducting interviews with the pilot study participants, a focus group of
three participants was conducted outside the library setting to create a comfortable
environment for the participants to allow them express their thoughts freely to validate
the instrument. The aim of the focus group was to examine the accuracy of the interview
questions and reword or revise any question(s) that may cause confusion while
conducting interviews for the main study to ensure instrument validity. During the
process of instrument validity testing, the researcher allowed participants to suggest
questions they may have considered relevant to addressing the research questions. Once
the instrument validity was completed, the interview questions for the main study were
79

formulated in a systematic format (see Appendix C) and focused on exploring the
librarians’ perceptions toward using the HomeworkNYC apps to deliver homework
assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches.
Participant-observation.
Participant-observation is relevant research instrument when (a) the phenomenon
under study is an everyday life situation, (b) the phenomenon occurs in a specific location
and is limited in size to be investigated as a case, (c) the case setting is accessible to the
researcher, and (d) the research questions are appropriate for exploratory case study
design (Jorgensen, 1989). Participant observation was an appropriate research instrument
to collect data in this study because the aim of the study was to explore the participants'
perceptions toward an everyday life situation. The phenomenon under study occurs in
the Queens Public Library and was accessible to the researcher. The study aim was to
explore the librarians' perceptions toward services they deliver every day to teenage
patrons in library branches. Further, the exploratory case study design was appropriate to
conduct this study to answer how and why research questions (Yin, 2009).
DeWalt and DeWalt (2002) defined participant observation as the researcher's
observation to the study participants' activities in a natural setting. Participant observation
enables the researcher to gain deep understanding to the phenomenon under study and to
the context of the study. In this study, the researcher conducted participant observation at
each participant's library branch. Four hours of homework activities were observed and
recorded in detailed written, field notes. The observation process was conducted when
library branches are full to capacity of teenage patrons who come to the library after

80

school time to obtain homework help. The written field notes were transcribed to
Microsoft Word files.
Documentation
Documentation is a relevant research instrument when documents elucidate
meaning and help the researcher to gain understanding of the phenomenon under study
(Bowen, 2009; Yin, 2003). There are a variety of document formats that can be used as
research instruments, such as letters, memoranda, brochures, minutes of meetings,
newspapers, maps, and advertisements (Bowen, 2009; Yin, 2003). In this study,
organizational brochures and advertisements related to the phenomenon under study were
examined and interpreted in writing to obtain meaning.
Data Collection
A qualitative exploratory case study design was appropriate for collecting data on
librarians’ perceptions toward using HomeworkNYC and social networks to deliver
homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches (Yin, 2009).
Six sources of evidence were suggested by Yin (2003) to conduct case studies. The six
sources are (a) interviews, (b) documents, (c) direct observation, (d) participant
observation, (e) archival data, and (f) physical artifacts. To conduct this exploratory case
study, more than one source of evidence needed to be used to collect the appropriate data
for the study (Yin, 2009). The data needed for this exploratory case study were collected
through interviews, participant observation, and documents.
Interviews
Interviews were the primary source of evidence in this particular exploratory case
study. Research data are qualitative when the data consist of rich textural information
81

expressing participants’ feelings, opinions, and everyday life experiences obtained
through interviews (Merriam, 2009). The data needed for this study were collected in the
form of verbal responses to interview questions (Merriam, 2009).
Using semistructured interviews allows the participants to express their feelings
and perceptions toward the phenomenon under study from their perspectives (Merriam,
2009). For this exploratory case study, semistructured, open-ended, face-to-face
interviews were conducted with 20 young adult librarians in different Queens Library
branches in Queens Borough, New York City. A sample size of three young adult
librarians not among the participants in the main study was selected to participate in a
pilot study to validate the research instrument.
The researcher contacted the study participants by sending each participant an email that (a) included the consent form (see Appendix B); (b) explained the intent of the
study; and (c) detailed the process that would be followed throughout the study, including
the data collection process. The researcher contacted each individual who agreed to
participate to schedule an appointment for the interview. The participants were expected
to answer honestly eight interview questions in approximately 30 minutes.
Prior to conducting the interview, the researcher asked each participant for
permission to audio record the interview. If permission was granted, the interview was
audio-recorded, if the permission was denied by the participant, the researcher took
detailed notes of all the participant’s verbal responses to the interview questions. Each
participant signed the informed consent form (see Appendix B) prior to participation in
the interview.

82

To ensure the participants’ confidentiality, the researcher transcribed all audiorecorded interviews without third party involvement. Participants were identified by a
code, such as LAL1, for Library A, Librarian 1, so no information was recorded to allow
anyone to determine the actual identity of the participant. The transcribed data were
analyzed using the NVivo10 computer software application.
Participant-observation
Participant observation was conducted at each participant's perspective library
branch on the same day of the interview. The researcher conducted interviews with the
study participants at their libraries during the library closing time before opening for
public service to provide a comfortable environment for participants while answering the
interview questions. After conducting the interviews, the researcher notified the
participants of the intention to visit the library sites later in the day to conduct participant
observation.
The researcher visited the library sites during busy hours after school time when
teenage patrons are in the library to obtain homework assistance. To conduct participant
observation in an ethical manner, the researcher notified each participant before the start
of the observation process (DeWalt & DeWalt, 2002). During the observation process,
the researcher conducted friendly and informal conversations with participants to collect
more details regarding educational activities in the library.
Focused observational notes were recorded in detail to describe the educational
activities in the library. Information regarding the observation site such as library
location and observation date and time were recorded on each field note to identify the
library branch and the participant in the study. The researcher used two-column field
83

notes to record the observation. The right column was used to record the observation and
the left column was used to record the researcher's comment. The field notes were
transcribed to Microsoft Word textual format and data were analyzed using NVivo 10.0
computer program software.
Documentation
Documentation was another source of evidence in this study. Printed materials
such as advertisements and brochures that are accessible for the public in library branches
and related to the phenomenon under study were chosen for this study . Further,
electronic materials such as schedules for workshops that are related to the phenomenon
under study and accessible online to the public were also chosen for this study. The data
that were obtained from documents that contain text were recorded in a Microsoft Word
file and analyzed using Nvivo 10.0 program software.
Credibility, Dependability, and Transferability
Credibility
According to Lincoln and Guba (1985), credibility is concerned with improving
the probability of the participants' agreement with the research findings (Geelan, 2004).
To improve the credibility in this exploratory case study, the researcher used the
following techniques, as outlined by Lincoln and Guba (1985):
1. The researcher spent time at each library branch used in conducting this study
during library busy hours, as observed and advised by the participants,
recording participants-observations using written field notes and listening the
participants' experiences regarding the use of HomeworkNYC Apps to deliver

84

homework assistance to teenagers to develop a deep understanding of the
phenomenon under study.
2.

The researcher followed the member checking process by (a) allowing the
study participants to review and verify the data collected from interviews,
participant-observations, and documentations to avoid the possibility of
misinterpreting the collected data (Maxwell, 2005, Yin, 2009); and (b) after
data analysis, the researcher met with the study participants to review the
conclusions and asked the participants to express whether they supported the
study conclusions. All participants concurred with the results.

Dependability
Dependability was maintained in this study through ensuring the consistency of
the study findings (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). To maintain consistency of this study
findings, the researcher ensured accurateness during data collection. Further, the
researcher avoided any misinterpretation during data analysis process. For the current
study, the collected data manifested the perceptions of the librarians in Queens Library
toward using social media tools such as HomeworkNYC Apps to deliver homework
assistance to students aged 15 to 18 through social networking websites such as Facebook
and MySpace in the library branches. The dependability of findings of the current study
indicated that an accurate conclusion was achieved from the data collected from
interviews.
Transferability
Transferability is defined as the extent to which the study findings can be applied
to other contexts (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The purpose of the current study was to
85

explore the perceptions of librarians of Queens Library regarding the use of
HomeworkNYC apps and social networking websites, such as Facebook and MySpace to
deliver homework assistance services to students ages 15 to 18 in Queens Library
branches. The HomeworkNYC.org website and HomeworkNYC social media
applications were developed to be available by the three New York City library systems
(Brooklyn, New York, and Queens) (Braun, 2010). Thus, the findings of the current
study may be generalized with limited transferability to other library systems in New
York City.
Data Analysis
Qualitative data analysis is subjective as the researcher examines the body of the
collected data to identify patterns (Irwin, 2013). Analyzing the data that were collected
from transcribed interviews, participant-observations, and documents immediately after
each interview assisted the researcher to avoid the unfocused, repeated, and
overwhelming data that needed to be processed if the analysis begins after collecting the
whole data for the study (Merriam, 2009). Thus, in the current study, the data were
analyzed simultaneously during the data collection process from the interviews.
Qualitative exploratory case study approach was used in this study to understand
the phenomenon under study through exploring the participants' perceptions and
experiences to answer how and why research questions (Yin, 2009). The purpose of data
analysis was to provide exploratory perceptions and experiences to identify themes
related to using social media applications and social network websites to deliver
homework assistance to students ages 15 to 18 in all Queens Public Library branches
(Merriam, 2009).
86

NVivo assists researchers to (a) manage data that is collected from interviews,
field notes, observations, and focus groups; (b) provide researchers with prompt access to
generated conceptual information in the study; (c) provide a data query to retrieve all data
relevant to questions and determine the answers; (d) create graphical models to explain
the relationships between concepts that are built from the research data; and (e) create
reports from the collected data (Bazeley, 2007). In this study, the data were analyzed
using NVivo 10.0 computer software program as follows:
1. Import: Import all Microsoft Word files that contain transcribed interviews,
participant-observation notes, and textual documents to NVivo 10.0 program.
2. Explore: Review the data from the interviews, participant-observation notes,
and textual documents.
3. Code: Initiate nodes and collect references from the data under each node.
4. Query: Search all the data for similar references to each node.
5. Themes: gather all similar references under each respective node
NVivo 10.0 was used to analyze the transcribed data to identify themes related to
the phenomenon of librarians’ perceptions toward the use of HomeworkNYC social
applications (apps) to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 using social
networking websites (Bazeley, 2007). The researcher used NVivo 10.0 qualitative
computer software application to analyze the research data to provide answers to the
research questions.
Summary
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
librarians’ perceptions and experiences regarding their role in using HomeworkNYC apps
87

to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 through social network websites
such as Facebook and MySpace. Chapter 3 includes the methodology and design that
was used in the current study. A qualitative methodology was appropriate because the
study was designed to focus on examining the depth and the breadth of a certain
phenomenon (Christensen & Johnson, 2008).
The research sample consisted of 20 participants who were working in Queens
Library under the rank of young adult librarians for at least 5 years. The research data
were collected from interviewing the participants in the study. Face-to-face interviews
were conducted with participants to answer semistructured, open-ended interview
questions to allow the participants to express their feelings, perceptions, and experience
toward the phenomenon under study from their perspectives in a form of verbal responses
(Merriam, 2009). The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed by the researcher
to ensure participants’ confidentiality. More data were collected through participantobservation and documents.
The data were simultaneously analyzed during the data collection process from
the interviews to avoid unfocused, repeated, and overwhelming data (Merriam, 2009).
NVivo 10.0 qualitative computer software application were used to analyze the research
data to answer the research questions. Chapter 4 is a presentation of the results of the
study.

Chapter 4:
Analysis and Results
This qualitative exploratory case study was conducted to explore the librarians’
perceptions toward using HomeworkNYC social media applications to deliver homework
assistance to students ages 15 to18 through social network websites such as Facebook
and MySpace in Queens Library branches. The study was conducted throughout Queens
Library branches in the borough of Queens, New York City. Chapter 4 includes the data
collection process, data analysis, and core themes found to answer the research questions.
Semistructured, open-ended questions were used to capture the librarians'
perceptions based on their experiences as the professionals who deliver the homework
assistance services to teenage patrons in the library. Twenty Young Adult Librarians
participated in the current study. The central research question that guided this study
was, how do librarians’ perceive the use of social media applications such as
DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver tutoring services to teenagers in
Queens Library branches? Two subquestions were asked to further explore the librarians'
perceptions.
The first subquestion was, how do librarians’ perceive the use of social
networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace as educational platforms? The
second subquestion was how do librarians perceive their role in the process of using
social media applications to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in
library branches?
After achieving the approval from Quality Review Method (QRM) and the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) to collect data for the current study, the researcher sent
89

emails to invite librarians to participate in the study. The participants were selected based
on the study's purposeful sampling criteria: (a) participants must work in Queens Public
Library under the category of Young Adult Librarians, and (b) the participants' working
experience as young adult librarians must be 5 years or more. The invitation's email was
sent to each participant individually to ensure anonymity and confidentiality using the
Queens Public Library's organizational email system. The email explained the purpose of
the study and requested the participant's voluntarily participation in the study. Further,
the email included the consent form (see Appendix B) to be printed and signed by the
participants to confirm their agreement to participate in the study at the time of the
interview.
Pilot Study
A pilot study was conducted to validate the research instrument and examine the
accuracy of interview questions. The researcher followed the same protocol that was used
to invite participants for the main study by inviting participants for the pilot study.
Further, the researcher selected a sample of three participants using same sampling
criteria that were used to select participants for the main study but were not part of the
main study.
The researcher scheduled an interview with each participant individually and
conducted the interview at the participant's respective library where the participant
serves. At the time of the interview, the researcher explained in detail the purpose of the
main study and the purpose of the pilot study. Further, the researcher allowed the
participant to read and sign the consent form (see Appendix B). The data collected from
the pilot study interviews were transcribed in textual format using Microsoft Word.
90

A focus group of the three pilot participants was conducted after transcribing the
data to a textual format to validate the instrument with the score rating to each interview
question. Each participant was asked to rate each interview question from 1 to 3 where 1
was the highest match between the interview question and the research questions and 3
was the least match. The researcher allowed the participants to express their opinions
and suggestions regarding the clarity and the accuracy of the interview questions.
The participants asserted that a few questions were confusing. Consequently,
interview questions were merged and reworded for clarity. The participants rated all new
interview questions with a rating of 1. After conducting the focus group, the researcher
formulated the interview questions in a systematic format (see Appendix C) and started to
schedule appointments with the participants of the main study.
Demographic Data
In the current study, interviewing 20 Young Adult Librarians served to explore
the librarians’ perceptions and lived experience toward using HomeworkNYC social
applications (Apps) and social networking websites to deliver homework assistance to
teenage patrons ages 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches to supplement the lack of free
homework assistance to teens. Of the 20 librarians, 7 (35%) were men and 13 (65%) were
women (see Table 1). The participants' length of employment in their current position
ranged from 7 to18 years. The average length of employment was 10.9 years for all 20
participants (see Table 1). Table 1 illustrates the participants' length of employment as
Young Adult Librarians in Queens Public Library.

Data Collection Procedure
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) granted the researcher the authorization to
collect data for this current study on October 21, 2014. The researcher contacted the
participants individually to schedule meetings for the interviews at their convenience at
the library branches where they serve. The interview with each participant was
conducted before opening the library for public service to allow the participants to
express their perceptions and share their lived experiences free of work-related stress or
interruptions. Before the interview began, the researcher assured each participant of
confidentiality and anonymity.
Further, the researcher explained the procedure used to ensure each participant's
confidentiality and anonymity through coding the transcribed interviews by using random
letters to identify the library branches and using random numbers to identify the
participants in the study. The participants received a copy of the interview questions (see
Appendix C) and were asked to read and sign the informed consent (see Appendix B).
All participants agreed to audio-recording of the interview.
The interview times ranged between 30 minutes and 40 minutes, with an average
of 35 minutes. The participants were asked to answer the interview questions with
complete honesty, as their identity is absolutely confidential throughout and after
completion of the study. The participants were encouraged to answer the questions in
detail to express their thoughts and feelings based on their experiences with the
92

phenomenon. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed to textual format using
Microsoft word software program.
Each textual transcription was coded with a random number from 1 to 20 to
identify the participants and with a random letter from A to T to identify the library
branches in the study to ensure participants' confidentiality. To ensure the credibility of
the current study, the member checking process was followed during the data collection
process: (a) after transcribing the audio-recorded interviews to textual format, the
researcher provided each participant with a copy of the transcribed interview to ensure
accuracy, and (b) the researcher agreed to provide each participant with a copy of the
study's final conclusions after completion.
Further, the researcher spent 4 hours, from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., at each
participant's perspective library during the library's busy hours and conducted participant
observation during activities that were related to obtaining homework assistance in the
library. All library branches are full to capacity with teenage patrons every weekday
after school time. The libraries' busiest time period every day is from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00
p.m. During the observation time, the researcher conducted informal conversations with
participants to discuss issues that are related to the phenomenon under study. The
participant observations were recorded in written notes. Documents such as printed
advertisements, brochures, and workshops schedules that related to the phenomenon
under study and available to the public in library branches and online were used as source
of data as well. The collected data from the participant observation and documents were
categorized, coded, and analyzed using Nvivo 10.0 computer program software.

93

Research Questions
The central research question that guided this qualitative exploratory case study
was, how do librarians perceive the use of social media applications such as
DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver tutoring services to teenagers in
Queens Library branches? Two subquestions were used to explore the librarians'
perceptions further.
RQ1. How do librarians perceive the use of social networking websites such as
Facebook and MySpace as educational platforms?
RQ1 focused on the effectiveness of using social networking websites as
educational platforms from the librarians' perspectives. To address this question,
participants responded to four interview questions:
1. What do you know about social networks such as Facebook and MySpace?
Which site you are mostly use?
2. What do you like most about social networking? Why?
3. What are your personal concerns related to the use of social networks? Why?
4. From your experience, please explain in detail how you use social networks to
promote library educational activities to teenage patrons? Why?
The questions were designed to collect data related to the participants' knowledge
about social networking, personal usage frequency, benefits and concerns, and their usage
of social networking platforms to deliver educational activities to teenage patrons in the
library.

94

RQ2. How do librarians perceive their role in the process of using social media
applications to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in library
branches?
RQ2 focused on exploring the librarians, feelings, thoughts, and perspectives
regarding their involvement in the process of using HomeworkNYC Apps and social
networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace as permanent educational service to
deliver homework assistance to students ages 15 to 18 in library branches. To address
this question, participants responded to four interview questions:
1. Please describe your feelings toward your role of teaching the students to
search the library resources to obtain materials needed for their homework
assignments?
2. Please describe your personal feelings regarding your role of promoting the
use of HomeworkNYC Apps through social networks to teenage patrons to
obtain homework assistance in the library and guiding them through the
process? and
3. Please describe in detail your personal feelings regarding the homework
assistance using HomeworkNYC Apps becoming part of your daily duties?
4. Please explain in detail challenges you experience when delivering this
service to teenage patrons?
The questions were designed to collect data related to the participants’ feelings
regarding (a) their role in teaching teenage patrons searching the library for educational
materials, (b) promoting the use of the Apps in their libraries, (c) the consistency of
delivering the service to teenage patrons in their library branches, and (d) to elicit
95

responses regarding the personal and professional challenges the participants encountered
when delivering the service to teenage patrons in their libraries.
The core themes formulated from the answers addressed the study's central
research question: How do librarians perceive the use of social media applications such
as DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver tutoring services to teenagers in
Queens Library branches?
Data Analysis
The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed to textual format using Microsoft
Word computer software. Microsoft Word documents that contain transcribed interviews,
participant observations, and documents were organized and coded using Nvivo 10.0
computer program software. NVivo 10.0 was used to identify frequently used words and
phrases to reveal themes related to the phenomenon under study. The participants'
perceptions and experiences were captured through direct quotes from the answers to
each interview question. The emerged themes from the answers to each interview
question are presented in a table at the end of the analysis of each interview question.
Interview Question 1
The first question allowed participants to express their thoughts and experiences
regarding the use of social networking websites in a general sense. The participants’
responses indicated that they perceive the social networks as communication tools to
connect people with each other despite distances. Although a few participants do not use
the social networks to communicate with others, they understood the reason for the social
networks is to communicate with the world. Participant LQ, L19 remarked, “I know
about them. I know people use them to communicate and I have Facebook but I don't
96

really use it.” Participant LE, L20 replied, "MySpace, I don't think is very popular any
more. It used to be very popular when it came out in 2006 and 2007, but Facebook is still
popular. I don't use either; it is my personal choice."
Participants perceived the social networks as an approach of communication and
they use them frequently. Participant LD, L5 commented, “My knowledge about social
networks is that they are the current way for people ages 9 to 40 to interact with the
world.” LO, L14 replied, “I used to use MySpace when I was a lot younger, and now I
only use Facebook and I use it as a way to connect with people and brands that I am
interested in.” Other participants viewed social networks as a source to share
information. LF, L10 stated, "I know about Facebook and Myspace as social networks
that people can communicate with each other and share information and entertainment
source as well. Personally, I use Facebook and check it every day for social reasons."
LI, L8 asserted, "I don't use MySpace and I am on Facebook, but I am not big on
posting everything like the teenagers are." LS, L18 responded, "Social networks are for
communication to connect with your friends and family and sharing your interest with
them. Personally, I use Facebook for the same reason to communicate with my family
members." LL, L4 stated, "I use Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter mainly as a social
media, but MySpace is not used as a social network anymore."
Some participants viewed social networks as a source of knowledge. For
example, Participant LC, L13 stated, “I am somewhat familiar with both, for personal and
commercial use. I do not use either, but occasionally, I browse commercial pages.”
Participant LN, L17 offered, “Personally, I find it as my new source of finding interesting
articles that people are posting about other things and for a busy person, it is really great
97

way to be able to do that.” Additional participants concurred with the use of Facebook.
Participant LT, L6 explained, “I use Facebook and I use it to keep up with the current
events with my colleagues and I use it for suggestions because they give you suggestion
pages and something like that.” Participant LM, L12 also uses the popular service
“primarily because of the popularity. It is used by numerous organizations and
companies to release information.”

Interview Question 2
Question 2 allowed participants to express their personal feelings toward the use
of social networking websites. The participants' responses indicated that they prefer the
use of social networks to communicate with others. Participant LQ, L19 elaborated, “I
like that I can be in touch with people I have not seen for a while and relatives. It is good
because you don't have to know their phone numbers or emails if you lose them you
know." Participant LC, L13 prefers the social network's capability of multiple
connections, acknowledging, “I like the instant connection that people can make with
multiple people at one time. Conversations are more dynamic as a result."
Participant LG, L3 elaborated, "What I like most about social networks is that
they make the world a small place where you can communicate almost instantaneously
with someone half way around the world." Participant LD, L5 explained, “Well, on the
98

personal basis, I think I like Facebook because it can keep me connected with family and
friends." Similarly, LF, L10 noted Facebook, "also keeps me in contact with my friends
and family who live far away." Participant LH, L7 also likes "that it helps me keep in
touch with my friends who don’t live local to me. It is also useful for making plans."
Participant LI, L8 concurred, stating, "I like that you be able to keep in touch with people
you know and may orally not in touch with."
Participant LK, L15 noted a specific benefit: "I lost contact with most of my
childhood friends, but through Facebook, I am now able to connect with them."
Participant LS, L18 explained, "Social networks created a small village out of the entire
world,” and continued that the social networks “help people to connect to each other and
share their moments and their interests." Another benefit was identified by Participant
LP, L9: "I like that you can reach out to people that you cannot meet in person and they
have similar interests." Similarly, Participant LO, L14 responded, "Connecting with
family and friends who are far away and connecting with people and things that are
bigger than myself and my community." Participant LR, L16 added, "It is easy to
connect with people that you know and to catch up with your old friends."
In addition to the social networks’ capability of communication, participants
perceived social networks as source of knowledge. Participant LM, L12 explained, "The
constant information that is being released makes social networking quite useful. It is
also another tool to communicate with people I know." Participant LB, L11 noted, "The
accessibility,” and explained, “People are interested in it and it is a good place to pull
information from a lot of different places." According to Participant LT, L6, "You can
find out a lot within the space of 5 minutes just by scrolling that is what I like the most;
99

information." Participant LL, L4 elaborated, “I like that is easy to stay on top of things
that are happening because I have friends that they share different news and articles."
Participant LD, L5 explained, "I keep up with people like me just simply by going
to the Internet and going to Facebook and see what they are talking about." And
Participant LG, L3 elaborated, "You meet people who share same ideas and same
interests, and to me, what technology and especially social media is making the world
much smaller place to live in." Participant LJ, L1 stated, "I like social networking
because from the title social network so you cannot be bored I guess because when you
feel board you go to the social network and see what is up with your friends." Table 3

Interview Question 3
Question 3 allowed the participants to express their personal concerns regarding
the use of social networks. Some participants raised concerns about the issue of privacy..
Participant LA, L2 contended, "People do not understand privacy; that is why people get
in trouble when they use Facebook and MySpace - because they don't really understand
that their stuff is on the Internet." Participant LQ, L19 remarked, “Personally, I do not
put out a lot of information because I like my privacy." Participant LG, L3 concurred
regarding “the privacy issue. I know that there are corporations out there that can access
100

your information on social networks and use it." Participant LI, L8 responded,
“Personally, I do not like everyone to know what I am doing every single minute of every
single day. I am not big on posting because I do not want anyone to know everything
about my life."
Participant LT, L6 explained, “Once you put something on that site, it stays there
and it is there forever, even if you delete it." Participant LO, L14 is "very concerned with
making sure that my private life stays private, and I don’t want people to know anything
about it." Participant LR, L16 raised an important concern: "You put your information
and it becomes a property of the owner of the social network and it can come back and
hurt you."
Safety was another concern regarding the participants' use of social networks.
Participant LN, L17 had only one personal concern regarding “being hacked and have my
identity stolen." Participant LG, L3 worried that "Prospective employers can use it
against you, especially if you are very vocal about your views." Participant LH, L7 has
"seen it been abused to harass my friends, and I feel like too many people take advantage
of the anonymity of the Internet for ill use." Participant LJ, L1’s personal concern "is
related to safety, because by using social networks, good things can turn bad, and most of
the time people get in trouble using those social networks." Participant LK, L15 replied,
"Social media, if not properly used, can land into serious, sometimes dangerous
situations." Table 4 contains thematic results from Interview Question 3.

Interview Question 4
The fourth interview question allowed the participants to express their
experiences regarding the use of social networking websites to communicate with
teenage patrons and to promote the library educational activities to teenage patrons using
social networking websites. The participants' responses evoked a strong impression of
their inability to communicate with teenage patrons through their library's official page
on social networking websites to promote library activities and communicate with the
library's teenage patrons. Participant LA, L2 explained, "I don't personally do it because
we have social media people to do that." LD, L5 replied, "Each library, including our
library, had a Facebook page at one point, and it is not there anymore. Now, it is one
person at the central library that is posting on Facebook on a regular basis." LQ, L19
stated, “I personally don't, but I used to do it here, and I am not doing it anymore, since I
have no control over Facebook as I used to." LG, L3 replied, “I personally don't; I know
the library organization does.”
LI, L8 responded, "I did have a library Facebook page. But now we have our
official Library organization Facebook page to address everything in all library
branches." Participant LT, L6 “used to post information to promote teenage activities to
teens on my library Facebook page. But not anymore, as I was told to stop using the
library Facebook page." Participant LR, L16 also used Facebook in the past “to promote
my programs and library services, just quicker posts. But they did change the way with
social networks that we cannot do posting anymore. So, I have stopped using it actually."
102

Participants were dissatisfied with their inability to communicate personally with teenage
patrons to promote educational activities and programs.
Participant LF, L10 commented, "I used to promote activities through the library's
Facebook page. But, they stopped us from doing that." Participant LS, L18 replied, "I
used to have access to my library’s Facebook page, and it was so successful for
promoting activities and book discussions for my teens. But I don't have access to this
page anymore." LJ, L1 concurred, noting, "I was told not to have any personal
communication with teens online or on Facebook. But I know the library is using
Facebook to market library activities." LN, L17 brought up another issue: "The teens in
my library asked me to be friends with them on Facebook and I refused because I don't
want them to be involved in my personal life." Participant LL, L4 replied, "I haven't
personally used social networks to promote activities. But, I know some locations do."

Interview Question 5
The fifth interview question allowed participants to express their personal feelings
regarding their role of teaching teenage students to search library resources for materials
needed for their homework assignments. The participants revealed a high level of

103

responsibility and willingness to educate and guide teenage patrons. Participant LQ, L19
stated, “I feel good about it. I feel that is exactly what we should be doing."
Participant LD, L5 replied, "I feel fine doing it because that is something that I
have been doing formally and informally for a long time, so I have positive feelings."
Participant LH, L7 expressed personal feelings, commenting, "I’m very happy to help out
in this regard. It is my job. I actually feel bad when we don’t have the materials on hand
to actually help them." Participant LN, L17 added, “I feel that is definitely our
responsibility to do that. I think that has been always our responsibility."
Some participants indicated educating teenage patrons searching the library
resources for materials needed for their homework assignments was part of their
responsibility. Participants claimed responsibility for teaching the teenage patrons how
to search and guide them through the process of obtaining homework materials.
Participant LA, L2 explained, "We have many students who come to here and they don't
know how to do any kind of research at all. So we have to basically get them started with
that." Participant LB, L11 responded, "When somebody professional teaches young
people how to use the correct sources to find the information they want, then it is training
for life to learn how to search and looking for things. So, I feel great with it." Participant
LE, L20 replied, “I think we should be able to serve as guidance to young people, or at
least give the patrons the correct information." Participant LK, L15 stated, "As a
librarian, it is my responsibility to lead the students in their search for information to
complete their assignments. Therefore, it is always a great pleasure to accomplish this
role."

104

Other librarians claimed responsibility not only regarding teaching teenage
patrons how to locate library materials needed for their homework assignments, but also
teaching them how to write research papers. Participant LS, L18 stated, “It is my job to
teach teens how to use the library resources needed for their homework assignments.
Beyond that, I teach them how to write research papers and how to cite resources." LM,
L12 commented, "As a young adult librarian, I feel it is mandatory that I expose my teen
patrons to resources that will enable them to get the information they require and instruct
them while they doing their papers." Table 6 contains thematic results from Interview
Question 5.

Interview Question 6
The sixth interview question allowed participants to express their personal
feelings regarding their role of promoting the use of the HomeworkNYC Apps through
social networking websites to teenage patrons in the library. Further, the question
allowed the participants to express their feelings regarding their role of guiding teenage
patrons through the process of obtaining professional homework help through using the
HomeworkNYC Apps.
Considering their role in promoting the use of HomeworkNYC Apps through
social networks to teenage patrons, librarians expressed their feelings of responsibility
toward promoting the Apps, as they considered the use of HomeworkNYC Apps similar
105

to any other program for teens in the library that needed to be promoted. Participant LD,
L5 stated, "Well, I feel comfortable doing it because it is interesting enough; All of us are
informal teachers, and I have done it before in the past in other libraries". LA, L2
commented, “HomeworkNYC Apps is a thing that teens can use, because, once they can
get help from professional teachers, then there is no problem for us to promote it".
Participants indicated their responsibility of promoting the Apps to be used in the
library by teenage patrons. However, participants expressed a sense of stress regarding
guiding the teenage patrons through the process of installing the Apps and using them
through their personal accounts on social networking websites. The first indication of
stress was in response to the lack of staffing. Participant LB, L11 stated, " The first thing
stresses me out is when most teens come when the library is very busy, so to set down
and show someone how to use the Apps takes my time away from helping other
customers". Participant LD, L5 explained, "Guiding the teens through the process needs
more staff to help, because I can't give one-on-one instruction to a student when I am on
desk and there are six others are waiting for quick answers; That creates a problem".
Participant LG, L3 remarked, “It is ok with me to promote it, and I do it actually
because this is our profession and we chose it". LM, L12 responded, “Promoting the
resource is fine, and it is our job to promote all resources that help teens. But the library
does not always have the time or staff to sit and explain the process to each individual".
Participant LO, L14 stated, “Just promoting the use of the Apps is not any different from
promoting any other library service. But, we need more staff to do what we should do."
Some participants conveyed a sense of stress because of the lack of technological
support to use the Apps as a source of homework help in the library. Participant LI, L8
106

explained, "Promoting the Apps is ok. But, I have to know if we can use the Google
nexus tablets that we have in the library for homework help using the Apps."
Some participants expressed their willingness to learn more about the Apps.
Participant LE, L20 responded, "Yes. It is our job to promote all information resources,
including HomeworkNYC Apps, and we do. But, we should learn more about the Apps
to be prepared more for teens’ questions." Participant LL, L4 replied, "First, they should
have given us more time to use the Apps ourselves to be familiar with them before
educating the teens how to use them. Second, provide us with enough gadgets to use for
the Apps."

Interview Question 7
The seventh interview question allowed the participants to express their personal
feelings toward delivering the service of homework assistance using the HomeworkNYC
Apps through social networking websites to teenage patrons. The participants accept
their responsibility to deliver the service. Participant LB, L11 stated, "It is a job like any
other duty, we do as required. It is just another thing you have to do, because it is part of
the job so I have to do it".
107

Participant LE, L20 elaborated. “Teens come here because they consider us a
good resource for the homework help. So, I should be the one who help them. I feel
good that I can help regardless of the stress". Participant LG, L3 stated, "This is a
position that we choose, and this is part of our duties, of course. So, I am happy to do it
because I look forward to help our community". Participant LH, L7 was concise in
answering the question: "I must do it no matter what. It’s my job, isn’t it?" Participant
LP, L9 “would rather to do this because it is part of my job for teens and children than
other reference things, because that what we do here".
Some participants discussed the pressure they felt because of a lack of staffing.
Participant LA, L2 noted, “I don't object because it is part of my job and it is totally fine.
But as long as I have the time and the support I need, because without support it becomes
so stressful". LK, L15 explained, "If I have help in the parts of the floor, keeping order,
providing programming for the younger customers, Then I will have time to help more
teens with their homework". Participant LL, L4 believes "it is natural evolution of how
we serve children and teens in the library. But like anything else we do, you want to be
sure that you have enough staff support".
Despite the pressure, the participants are motivated. One participant dealt with
the lack of staff through volunteers: Participant LQ, L19 stated, " Because it is a job that
must be done, I trained a volunteer to do and made it part of something that happens
every day, but I am not doing it myself. I only coordinate". Participant LC, L13 feels
“positive about the use of the Apps, as it allows us to help the teens to get their
homework done in the library". Participant LS, L18 has been “promoting
HomeworkNYC Apps for the past year and half, and I have initiated programs for
108

HomeworkNYC Apps as well. I feel it is my job and I have to do it way or another".
Participant LT, L6 responded, “If I have more staff to help, I would do more, but even
with no help, I still feel it is my job".
Participant LM, L12 summarized the other respondents by commenting, “I do it
out of a personal desire to see the teenage patrons at my library succeed". Table 8

Interview Question 8
The eighth interview question allowed participants to share their lived experience
regarding challenges they experience when delivering the homework assistance using the
HomeworkNYC Apps through social networking websites. Participants feel pressure
from the lack in technological support. Some participants also feel the need for more
technology equipment. Participant LI, L8 stated, "We need more equipment, especially
Google nexus tablets that we already have to help more teens with their homework".
Participant LE, L20 responded with more detailed challenges:
The first challenge I face here is I don't have enough gadgets to deal with the
Apps. The second challenge is the time limit of using our computers. Third
challenge is the staff shortage; I need help of at least someone to cover my
reference desk when I am involved with teens' homework. (Participant LE, L20)
109

Participant LO, L14 had similar complaints: “I have a limited amount of
computers in the library that are used by everyone. So waiting to use a computer for
HomeworkNYC is hard for the teens".
Other participants have technological challenges other than equipment.
Participant LC, L13 noted the instability of the Wi-Fi in the Queens Libraries.
Participant LS, L18 concurred: "I have enough computers, but the challenge disturbing
me is the Wi-Fi is so slow, especially when all teens access the HomeworkNYC apps on
their Facebook accounts at the same time". Participant LP, L9 also noted, "the challenge
with wireless availability, because wireless spots in the library are limited, and when all
teens want to go online at a certain time, they can't access it because there are too many
people". Participant LR, L16 also complained that, “The Wi-Fi signal is very bad at every
branch I have been into. Teens always complain that it is so slow. When I tested myself,
I found it is always so slow".
Participants identified the lack of staffing as another immense challenge.
Participant LB, L11 complained, "We don't have enough staff to accurately change
people. We have several duties that we have to do that may take away the time required
to teach teens accurately". Participant LG, L3 replied, "The only downfall is the staff
because in this library. Everything is in place for that area to do well, such as enough
computers, a quiet reading room, and we give out laptops to those who don't have".
Participant LM, L12 concurred, "The challenge here is staffing. I need more staff to help
me out to free enough time to educate the teens on the use of the HomeworkNYC Apps,
to watch them, and be sure they use the Apps for homework”.

Core Themes
Five core themes emerged from the extensive analysis of the study participants’
responses to the interview questions for this qualitative exploratory case study. The
analysis was focused on the participants’ experiences as professional librarians who
provide teenage patrons with homework assistance through the use of HomeworkNYC
Apps and social networking websites. Nvivo 10.0 and Microsoft word software
programs were used to identify themes and patrons.
Table 10 presents the five core themes that emerged from the interviews: (a) the
capability to communicate and share knowledge, (b) the inability to communicate with
teenage patrons, (c) the responsibility toward delivering social educational service, (d)
the librarian’s motivation toward educational role, and (e) pressure due to lack in staffing
and in technological support.

Core Themes: Relationship to the Central Research Question
The central research question that guided this qualitative exploratory case study
was, how do librarians perceive the use of social media applications such as
DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver tutoring services to teenagers in
112

Queens Library branches? The librarians identified five core themes through their
responses to the interview Questions.
Theme 1: Capability to Communicate and Share Knowledge
Regarding the use of social networking websites in general sense, 14 librarians
(70%) acknowledged social networking websites as a communication tool to connect
people. In the first interview question, 12 librarians (60%) acknowledged the social
networks’ capability of sharing information. Eight librarians (40%) acknowledged the
social networking capabilities of distributing knowledge.
Librarians discussed their personal feelings and experiences using the social
networking websites in the second interview question. Sixteen librarians (80%) pointed
out that they use social networking websites as a communication tool to connect with
friends and family members. Further, nine librarians (45%) pointed out that they use
social networks to share information with others, and eight librarians (40%) stated that
they use social networks as a source of knowledge to read articles and obtain professional
information.
According to the participant observation, all participants (100%) are capable of
communicating and sharing knowledge using social networks because all participants are
conducting social networking workshops for teenage patrons at their libraries every
month. Printed brochures to advertise the workshops are available for the public at each
library branch and workshop schedules are available for the public online through the
library's official website. The workshops are designed to educate teenage patrons on how
to protect their identity while using social network websites through using advanced

113

filters to protect their important and personal information, posts, and images from
strangers.
Theme 2: Inability to Communicate with Teenage Patrons
Through Interview Question 4, participants revealed their responsibility of
communicating with teenage patrons to promote library activities using their library
branches’ official pages on social networking websites. Seventeen librarians (85%)
pointed out that they were using their library branch’s official social network page to
connect and promote activities to teenage patrons. However, the library administrators
removed their access privileges to the libraries’ official social pages. Further, library
administrators created one official social page for the whole library organization to
promote general activities of the whole library organization and centralized the access
privilege to one person only at Central Library.
The responses of eight librarians (40%) indicated that librarians are not able to
communicate with teenage patrons outside the library official social network's page.
Librarians' responses also indicated their inability to communicate personally with
teenage patrons because the library officials prohibited librarians from creating personal
social network pages to communicate with teenage patrons. Other librarians were not
able to communicate personally on social networks with teens because of their privacy
concerns.
The participant observation and informal discussion with participants during the
observation indicated that using the library facility as a place for librarians to
communicate with teenage patrons and engage with them in educational activities is
insufficient. Every weekday, after school time, all library branches are full to capacity
114

with teenage patrons seeking to obtain homework assistance and to join other activities.
Librarians are serving as many teenagers as they can to provide them with homework
assistance, searching for library materials needed for their school assignments and
projects. However, the library's educational activities that were provided through the
library branches' official social network page such as promoting the use of
HomeworkNYC Apps, book clubs and educational group discussions were eliminated
when library administration restricted the librarians from accessing their library branches'
social page. Three librarians (15%) only were able to maintain conducting book
discussion activity in their library branches but not the other online activities.
Theme 3: Responsibility Toward Delivering Social Educational Service
According to the librarians’ responses regarding their perceptions toward using
the social applications through social networking websites to deliver homework help to
teens, librarians indicated they have a high level of responsibility. Further, the librarians
expressed their thoughts and feelings on a personal level, as the word I was used 852
times (7.39%) through the transcript. Eighteen librarians (90%) pointed out their
responsibility toward educating teens to search library resources for needed homework
materials. Further, 19 librarians (95%) vocally accepted their responsibility to promote
the use of HomedworkNYC Apps through social networking websites in their libraries.
Nineteen librarians (95%) overtly acknowledged their responsibility to deliver the service
of homework assistance to teenage patrons using the HomewokNYC Apps in their
libraries in spite of the pressure and challenges they experience.
The participant observation indicated that 16 librarians (80%) promoted the use of
HomeworkNYC Apps as an integral part of the social networking workshops to educate
115

teenage patrons on how to protect their identity online. However, the lack of
technological support such as computers and Internet connectivity and lack of staffing
hinder the librarians from developing specific workshops for homework assistance. Four
librarians (20%) only conducted homework assistance workshops though the use of
HomeworkNYC Apps every weekday after school time from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
because they have (a) sufficient computer workstations and laptops at their libraries, and
(b) enough staff to help the librarians with other duties while conducting the homework
assistance workshop. Further, 16 librarians (80%) guided teenage patrons through the
process of using HomeworkNYC Apps to obtain homework assistance individually.
Despite the challenges in the lack of technology and staff, librarians play a vital
role in delivering homework assistance to teenage patrons. Librarians provide teenage
patrons with materials needed for their homework assignments. Further, they guide
teenage patrons to obtain homework assistance by using the HomeworkNYC Apps
through the use of teenagers' gadgets and through library computers. All librarians
(100%) served multiple teenage patrons at the same time with different tasks such as
guiding a teenage patron through the process of using HomeworkNYC Apps while
searching for educational materials for another patron.
Theme 4: Motivation Toward Educational Role
Ten librarians (50%) indicated they were motivated to deliver the homework help
service through their responses to Interview Question 7. They promote the use of
HomeworkNYC Apps though social networking websites in their libraries. They are
willing to guide teenage patrons through the process of obtaining homework help through
the Apps in their libraries out of their personal desire to help teens succeed in school
116

through creating programs. A few participants developed programs for HomeworkNYC
homework help in their library branches.
The participant observation indicated that librarians are highly motivated toward
their role in delivering educational services to teenage patrons. Sixteen librarians (80%)
used the opportunity of conducting social network workshops for teens to promote the
use of HomeworkNYC Apps. A few librarians sacrificed their break time to guide
teenagers through the process of using HomeworkNYC App to obtain homework
assistance. Nine librarians (45%) sent formal requests to library administration to
allocate some of the library's Google Nexus tablets and wireless hotspots to be used in
obtaining homework assistance in their library branches. Two librarians (10%) trained
library volunteers to guide teenage patrons through the process of using HomeowrkNYC
Apps to obtain homework assistance.
Theme 5: Pressure Due to Lack of Staffing and Technological Support
The librarians revealed they feel pressure to deliver the service of using
HomeworkNYC Apps through social networking websites to teenage patrons in library
branches.
Sub-theme 5: Pressure due to lack of technological support. The librarians’
responses to Interview Question 6 indicated that eight librarians (40%) feel pressure
because of the lack of technological support. The respondents described the stress they
experience because of the lack of computers needed to deliver homework help service to
teenage patrons through HomeworkNYC Apps and social networks. Not having enough
equipment to deliver the service adequately to teenagers increases the pressure and the
stress they feel. The number of teenagers who must wait their turn to use the library
117

computers for homework help is significant, exacerbated by the limited number of
computers, limited staff, and limited time.
Fifteen librarians (75%) indicated the lack in technological equipment is a
significant challenge. Librarians claimed that they do not have enough computers to
serve all teenage patrons who come to the library to obtain homework help using the
Apps. The respondents stated that each library branch in Queens has received between
80 to 90 Google nexus tablets to lend to library patrons. However, those tablets are
blocked and can only be used as e-readers, so teenage patrons cannot use them to access
to their social network accounts to use the Apps.
Librarians revealed poor connectivity is another challenge they face when
delivering the homework help service to teenage patrons. Sixteen librarians (80%)
indicated that the Internet connectivity using the library wireless is slow in their library
branches, especially as usage increases. The participants reported the wireless signal is
weak, making it difficult for patrons to connect different devices to the Internet wirelessly
in their libraries.
The document analysis indicated that printed brochures and online advertisements
are available for the public in all library branches to encourage library patrons to borrow
Google Nexus tablets to use as an e-reader. The tablets are blocked and available only to
be used as e-readers to browse, borrow, and downloads the library's electronic materials.
The tablets can be borrowed by library patrons for 4 months. Other print and electronic
materials to encourage patrons to borrow Wi-Fi Internet access hotspots are available at
all library branches and on the library's official website. The hotspots can be borrowed
by library patrons for 4 months as well.
118

Sub-theme 5: Pressure due to lack of staffing. Nine librarians (45%) reported
feeling pressure because of the lack of staffing. Guiding teenage patrons through the
process of obtaining homework help using HomeworkNYC Apps throughout social
networks causes librarian high stress because of the staff shortage. Nine librarians (45%)
also expressed their feelings of stress when the task of delivering homework help using
HomeworkNYC Apps through Social networks had officially became part of their daily
duty.
The librarians indicated the lack in staffing is a major challenge they face in order
to deliver adequate homework help services to teenage patrons. Fourteen librarians
(70%) emphasized that they need staff coverage at the time of delivering the homework
help service to teenage patrons to serve other patrons who are not obtaining homework
help.
The participant observation indicated that the responsibilities of young adult
librarians in all Queens Public Library branches have shifted from focusing on providing
services to teenage patrons only to providing services to all ages of library patrons.
Young adult librarians in all library branches are serving children, teens, adults, and
senior citizen patrons to fill the gap that was created because of the lack in staffing.
Fifteen librarians (75%) were observed serving adults and teens at the time of homework
help. The pressure was clearly indicated when a librarian lost temper when an adult
called for help and the librarian was helping a teenage patrons with homework.
Summary
Chapter 4 included a presentation of the study's research questions, the sample
size, and the sampling criteria, the results of the pilot study, demographic data, the data
119

collection procedure, and the data analysis process. The textual description obtained
from answering the interview questions generated five themes in response to the research
questions. The five emerging themes were (a) the capability to communicate and share
knowledge, (b) an inability to communicate with teenage patrons, (c) responsibility
toward delivering social educational service, (d) motivation toward an educational role,
and (e) pressure due to lack of staffing and technological support.
The main research question that guided this qualitative exploratory case study
was, “How do librarians perceive the use of social media applications such as
DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver tutoring services to teenagers in
Queens Library branches?” To explore the librarians' perceptions further, two
subquestions were used. The first subquestion was, “How do librarians perceive the use
of social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace as educational platforms?”
The second subquestion used was, “How do librarians perceive their role in using social
media applications to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in the library
facility?” The third subquestion used was, “What challenges do librarians face when
using social media applications to deliver homework assistance to students ages 15 to 18
in Queens Library branches?” The study concludes with Chapter 5. The remaining
chapter includes a discussion of the findings and recommendations for stakeholders and
future researchers.

Chapter 5:
Findings and Recommendations
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
librarians' perceptions toward the use of HomeworkNYC Apps to deliver homework
assistance to teenage patrons through social network websites in Queens Library
branches. The participants' responses to interview questions revealed five themes: (a)
capability to communicate and share knowledge, (b) inability to communicate with
teenage patrons, (c) responsibility toward delivering social educational service, (d)
motivation toward educational role, and (e) pressure due to lack in staffing and in
technological support. Chapter 5 aligns the identified themes to the study's conceptual
framework and literature review. Chapter 5 includes a review of the study findings. The
chapter concludes with (a) implications for leaders, (b) recommendations for leaders, (c)
the significance of the study to leadership, (d) the study's limitations, and (e) suggestions
for future research.
Findings
HomeworkNYC social media applications (Apps) were developed by New York
City's public library systems (New York, Brooklyn, and Queens Public Libraries) to
address the gap in missing homework assistance services to teenage students following
budget alterations (Braun, 2010; Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2010;
Marritz, 2011; Tankus, 2013). The HomeworkNYC Apps allow teenage students to
obtain real-time homework assistance from professional teachers through social
networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace (Braun, 2010; Institute of Museum
and Library Services, 2010). Further, HomeworkNYC Apps allow teenage students to
121

search the library catalog for educational library materials needed for their homework
assignments (Braun, 2010). The library administrators of the three library systems in
New York City (NYC) expanded the use of HomeworkNYC Apps as a source of
homework assistance (Braun, 2010).
The staff shortage as a consequence of the budget reduction forced the Queens
Public Library system to offer insufficient homework assistance to teenage patrons
throughout the library branches (Marritz, 2011; Queens Library, 2014a; Tankus, 2013;
Urban Libraries Council, 2014). Two out of 63 Queens Public Library branches offer
free homework assistance to all teenage residents of Queens Borough, NYC (Queens
Library, 2014a; Tankus, 2013; Urban Libraries Council, 2014). Thus, expanding the use
of HomeworkNYC Apps in the library branches as was suggested by the library
administration might fill out the gap in the missing homework assistance services to
teenage students.
Delivering homework assistance to teenage patrons using the HomeworkNYC
Apps and social networking websites entailed young adult librarians’ involvement in the
process. Young adult librarians are responsible for (a) promoting the use of the
HomeworkNYC Apps to teenage patrons to be used through social networking websites
to obtain homework assistance in the library branches, (b) guiding the teenage patrons
through the process of using HomeworkNYC Apps to obtain real-time homework
assistance, and (c) teaching teenage patrons to search the library resources for educational
materials using the HomeworkNYC Apps (Agosto & Abbas, 2011; Braun, 2010;
Houghton-Jan, 2010; Michaelson, 2009). The purpose of this study was to explore young

122

adult librarians' experiences, feelings, and thoughts toward delivering homework
assistance to teenage patrons using HomeworkNYC social media Apps.
This qualitative exploratory case study involved interviewing 20 participants
working for Queens Public Library in the city and the state of New York. The
participants were selected based on (a) job classification as young adult librarians who
deliver library services to teenage patrons in the library (Young Adult Library Services
Association, 2010), and (b) length of employment of 5 years or more of working
experience as young adult librarians. Each participant shared personal feelings, thoughts,
and lived experiences regarding being responsible for delivering the homework assistance
to teenage patrons in the library using HomeworkNYC Apps.
Core Themes of the Study
Exploring the librarians' perceptions and experiences might enable library leaders
to address the challenges that hinder librarians from delivering effective and efficient
homework assistance services to teenage patrons in the library. Microsoft Word and
Nvivo 10.0 computer software programs were used to analyze the data collected from the
participants’ interviews, participant-observation, and documents. The merged themes
that evolved from the study revealed the librarians' perceptions. The study resulted in
five core themes: (a) capability to communicate and sharing knowledge, (b) inability to
communicate with teenage patrons, (c) responsibility toward delivering social educational
service, (d) motivation toward educational role , and (e) pressure due to lack in staffing
and in technological support.
Capability to communicate and share knowledge. The study participants
demonstrated a high level of knowledge regarding the importance of using social media
123

as communication tools. Further, participants explained their personal use of social
networks to communicate with others and to share knowledge with their peers, friends,
and family members. Fourteen librarians (70%) acknowledged the social networks'
capability to connect with people. Sixteen librarians (80%) use social networks to
communicate with their friends, peers, and family members to create an online social
realm.
The review of the literature supported the findings regarding the use of social
networks as communication tools. The computer-mediated approach allows people to
create virtual communities and interact and communicate with each other (Xiao et al.,
2012). The term social network includes web-based services that allow people to choose
particular users to communicate with and join the social realm of their virtual community
(Boyd & Ellison, 2007).
Twelve librarians (60%) acknowledged the social networks' capability of sharing
information between people online. Nine librarians (45%) use social networks outside of
work to share information with their social groups of friends and family members. Social
networking is an Internet phenomenon that allows people to share all activities with each
other (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Jang Hyun et al., 2010; Vitkauskaite, 2011).
Eight librarians (40%) acknowledged the social networks' ability to distribute
knowledge in order to share news, ideas, and academic information. Eight librarians
(40%) use social networks as a source to update their own knowledge. The ability to
share updated information, news, ideas, and academic articles with friends in real-time
interactions or asynchronously, converted social networks to a new resource to distribute
knowledge (Barker, 2009; Jang Hyun et al., 2010; Kuss & Griffiths, 2011).
124

Inability to communicate with teenage patrons. The study participants use
social networks to communicate with teenage patrons and engage them in library
educational activities. Seventeen librarians (85%) pointed out their former use of the
library branches' official social network pages to (a) connect with teenage patrons, (b)
promote educational activities including HomeworkNYC Apps, and (c) engage teenagers
with library educational activities such as book discussions. However, library
administrators removed librarians' access privileges to their library branches social pages.
Moreover, administrators created one organizational social network page to promote
general library activities and centralized the access privilege to one person at Central
Library.
In light of the study's conceptual framework, librarians acknowledged social
networking's potential as a tool that might be used to improve students’ engagement in
educational activities (Junco, 2011; Kuh & Gonyea, 2015; Lupa & Howerton, 2009).
The social communication between librarians and teenage patrons and between teenagers
and peers through social networks proved successful in promoting and delivering library
education services to teenagers (Lupa & Howerton, 2009). The study participants use
their library branches' social networking pages to engage teenagers in book discussions
and other educational activities, including promoting the use of HomeworkNYC Apps
(Agosto & Abbas, 2011; Junco, 2011).
The online relationship between teenage patrons and their libraries through social
networks creates a new extended form of social capital (Heath et al., 2010). Using the
library social network page to engage teenage patrons in groups with library educational
activities provided a convenient platform of social bonding for social capital to take place
125

(Chang & Hsiao, 2014; Herguner, 2011; Young & Rossmann, 2015). Further, the review
of the literature and participants' responses explained the librarians' ability of using web
2.0 technology such as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) to post and update real-time
library activities on the teenagers' social network news feeds (Squires & Golden, 2009).
Thus, engaging teenage patrons with library educational activities using social networks
expands the use of library services to be delivered outside the realm of the library
facilities (Anttiroiko & Savolainen, 2011; Herguner, 2011; Naidoo & Vargas, 2011;
Secker & Price, 2007).
Librarians recognized the vital role of social networks as s tool to engage local
teenage patrons in library educational activities. However, the responses of eight
librarians (40%) indicated their inabilities to communicate personally with teenage
patrons through social networks. Library administrators restricted the librarians from
establishing any interpersonal communications with teenage patrons on social networks
outside the official organizational library social page.
Other librarians refused to accept teenage patrons’ friendship on social networks
to keep their privacy intact (Agosto & Abbas, 2011). Thus, librarians in Queens Library
branches have become unable to communicate online with teenage patrons either
professionally or personally to engage them in the library branches' educational activities.
Consequently, the expansion of the library's online social capital and student engagement
in online educational activities (Heiberger & Harper, 2008; Junco, 2011; Lupa &
Howerton, 2009; Murray, 2008; Secker & Price, 2007; Young & Rossmann, 2015)
limited only to inside the library facility or were eliminated completely.

126

Responsibility toward delivering social educational service. Nineteen
Librarians (95%) overtly expressed their acceptance of their responsibility to promote
HomeworkNYC Apps to teenagers in library branches. Eighteen librarians (90%)
pointed out their responsibility regarding educating teenage patrons on how to search
library resources for educational materials needed for homework assignments. Further,
19 librarians (95%) overtly accepted their responsibility to deliver homework assistance
to teenage patrons in their library branches using HomeworkNYC Apps and social
networks. The repeated use of the word I throughout participants' responses' textual
transcriptions indicated that librarians understand their responsibility to deliver
homework assistance through the Apps on a personal level.
The review of literature regarding the looking glass self theory indicates that
librarians feel personally responsible for delivering the service because of their selfimage. Stolley (2005) asserted that the self-image of an individual affects the interaction
of this individual with others. The individual's action is driven by the people's
perceptions (Stolley, 2005). The librarians' self-image as information experts as
perceived by library patrons increases the pressure on librarians, as they feel responsible
for delivering all needed information services to teenage patrons. Study participant LE,
L20 stated, “Teens come here because they consider us a good resource for the
homework help. So, I should be the one who helps them. I feel good that I can help
regardless of the stress". Thus, librarians are driven to deliver an efficient homework
assistance service in order to live up to their teenage patrons' perceptions of them.
Motivation toward educational role. Ten librarians (50%) indicated they are
motivated to deliver homework assistance to teenage patrons using HomeworkNYC Apps
127

and social networks. Librarians are inspired and motivated to deliver an efficient
homework assistance service because of the teenage patrons' perceptions of librarians.
Librarians are using their multitasking abilities to (a) serve multiple teenage patrons
together, (b) develop instructional classes for groups of teenage patrons to educate them
on how to obtain homework assistance using the social Apps, and (c) educate and train
library volunteers on how to guide teenage patrons through the process of using
HomeworkNYC Apps to obtain homework assistance in the library to overcome the lack
of staffing.
Study participant LM, L12 stated, “I do it out of a personal desire to see the
teenage patrons at my library succeed." The librarians self-image of professionals who
feel responsible for delivering educational services to teenage patrons motivates them to
deliver the service regardless of their stress and challenges they face at work.
The looking-glass self-concept consists of (a) the imaginations of self-appearance,
(b) the imaginations of people’s judgment based on that appearance, and (c) the selffeelings toward that judgment (Stolley, 2005; Yeung & Martin, 2003). The librarians'
motivation is reflected by their self-feelings toward teenage patrons' judgment on them as
the source of educational assistance. Participant LS, L18 stated, "I am promoting
HomeworkNYC Apps for the past year and half, and I have initiated programs for
HomeworkNYC Apps as well. I feel it is my job and I have to do it way or another."
Further, librarians' motivation to deliver the homework assistance to teenage patrons
encourages them to consider different approaches to deliver the service. LQ, L19 stated,
"Because it is a job that must be done. I trained a volunteer to do it and made it part of
something that happens every day, but I am not doing it myself. I only coordinate."
128

Pressure due to lack of staffing and technological support. The study
participants indicated they felt pressure to deliver homework assistance to teenage
plastrons using HomeworkNYC Apps and social networks in library branches. The first
cause of pressure is the lack in staffing. Nine librarians (45%) reported they felt pressured
to promote the use of the Apps and social networks in their libraries. Nine librarians
(45%) pointed out their feelings of stress and pressure regarding the consistency of using
HomeworkNYC Apps and social networks as a source of homework assistance in library
branches with insufficient staff. Fourteen librarians (70%) consider the lack in staffing as
an immense challenge to deliver homework assistance to teenage patrons using the Apps
in their libraries.
Participant LB, L11 stated, "We don't have enough staff to accurately change
people. We have several duties that we have to do that may take away the time required
to teach teens accurately." LL, L4 replied, “I believe it is natural evolution of how we
serve children and teens in the library, but like anything else we do, you want to be sure
that you have enough staff support ". Participant LM, L12 reported," The challenge here
is staffing. We need more staff to help me out to free enough time to educate those teens
in the use of the HomeworkNYC Apps".
The second cause of pressure is the lack of technological support. Eight librarians
(40%) reported they felt pressure because of the lack of equipment needed to promote the
use of the Apps in library branches. Participants considered the lack in technological
support as an immense challenge to deliver homework assistance to teenage patrons in
library branches. Fifteen librarians (75%) recounted a lack of technological equipment
needed to deliver the homework assistance service. Sixteen librarians (80%) described a
129

lack of connectivity (weak wireless signal). Connecting teenage patrons and librarians to
the Internet is vital to use the HomeworkNYC Apps and social networks to promote and
use the Apps to obtain homework assistance.
Queens Library received a donation of 5600 Google Nexus tablets. Queens
Library administration distributed the Google Nexus tablets to library branches to lend to
library patrons. Each library branch holds between 80 and 100 tablets ready to lend to
patrons. Library patrons are allowed to borrow the Google tablet for 4 month and up to
12 month. Library patrons use the tablets as e-readers to access, borrow, and read the
library's electronic collections. Further, Queens Library received a donation of 2,800
mobile Wi-Fi hotspot gadgets to lend to library patrons. The hotspot gadgets provide
patrons with free wireless Internet access.
Meanwhile, librarians are challenged by the lack of technical support. Participant
LI, L8 stated, "Promoting the Apps is ok. But, I have to know if we can use the Google
Nexus tablets that we have in the library for homework help using the Apps." Thus, the
Queens Library system appears to have enough technological equipment to deliver
adequate homework assistance to teenage patrons using the Apps and social networks in
library branches. The problem may be in how the Queens Library administrators best
manage the use of the available equipment.
The demands on the Queens Library's free homework assistance program have
increased since administrators closed many neighborhood programs that used to provide
teenage students with free homework assistance due to lack of funding (New York
Community Trust, 2012). Thus, after school, teenage students attend their local libraries
to seek help with homework assignments. The use of HomeworkNYC Apps and social
130

networks as source of homework assistance in the library require (a) enough computers
and technology with Internet access, (b) extended time limits for usage to allow teenagers
to finish their homework assignments, and (c) staff coverage to do other duties while the
homework assistance librarians monitor (Agosto & Abbas, 2011) and guide teenage
patrons through the process of using the Apps through social networks to obtain
homework assistance.
The increased workload to fill the gap in services created by staffing cuts due to
budget alterations (Marritz, 2011; Tankus, 2013) increased the pressure on librarians
personally and professionally. Young adult librarians now may serve teenagers, adults,
and seniors to replace the former staff who used to deliver services to patrons other than
teenagers. Thus, serving in more than one area increases the personal stress on librarians.
Participant LO, L14 stated, "We need more staff to do what we should do".
Expanding the use of HomeworkNYC Apps through social networks in library
branches without sufficient technological support is adding more pressure on librarians.
The personal and professional pressure that librarians encounter negatively affects their
work performance. Accordingly, the quality and quantity of overall library services is
being negatively affected (Mohsenzadeh & Isfandyari-Moghaddam, 2011).
Summary of the Findings
The study findings in the light of the study’s conceptual framework and the
review of literature indicated the librarians’ acknowledgement of the importance of using
social media to communicate with teenage patrons. Librarians who work in Queens
Library branches used to communicate with teenage patrons in local communities where

131

library branches serve. The librarians engage teenage students who live in the library’s
neighborhoods in educational activities using social media.
Librarians expanded the library social capital to an online social environment.
However, library leaders removed the librarians’ access privileges to the library
branches’ official social pages. Accordingly, library leaders eliminated the extended
library’s online social capital and inhibited librarians from engaging teenage students in
online educational activities.
Librarians feel personally responsible for services they deliver to teenage patrons.
Regardless of the pressure they feel and the challenges they encounter due to the lack in
staffing and technical support, librarians are motivated to deliver homework assistance to
teenage patrons in library branches. The motivation and responsibility are reflected in the
teenage patrons' perceptions of librarians as a source of educational assistance. However,
the increased pressure because of (a) the increased demands for homework assistance to
teenage patrons, (b) the increased workload due to the lack in staffing, and (c) insufficient
technical support is negatively affecting librarians' working performance. Consequently,
the overall library services, including HomeworkNYC Apps homework assistance, are
negatively affected.
Implications for Leaders
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
librarians' perceptions of the use of HomeworkNYC social applications and social
networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace to deliver homework assistance to
students aged 15 to 18 in all Queens Public Library branches. The results of this study
align with the statements of Lupa and Howerton (2009), Anttiroiko and Savolainen
132

(2011), and O’Dell (2010) regarding the importance of using social media as educational
platforms. Librarians acknowledged the importance of using the social media to engage
teenage patrons in library education activities (Poellhuber & Anderson, 2011; Silius et
al., 2011). Further, the study findings indicated the librarians’ ability to use Web 2.0
technologies such as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds that allow them to update
information, discussions, and listings simultaneously on social networks (O'Dell, 2010).
The use of social media allowed librarians to: (a) communicate with teenage
patrons using the library branches’ official social network page to develop discussion
groups and collaborative learning activities, and (b) develop an online learning
environment that extend the library’s social capital concept to be occurred online
(Bassani, 2009; Okoro et al., 2012; Young & Rossmann, 2015).
The finding of this study indicated that the safety and privacy issues related to the
teenagers’ use of social networking websites are considered a high concern to librarians.
Forty percent of the study participants evoked privacy concern toward the use of social
networking websites (Agosto & Abbas, 2011; Jaeger & Zheng, 2009; Youn, 2008).
Further, 30% of the study participants evoked safety concern. Accordingly, librarians
developed social media workshops at all library branches to educate teenage patrons on
how to protect themselves online to eliminate the safety and privacy concerns regarding
to teenagers' use of social media. Thus, the study findings suggest using social media
applications and social networking websites to provide informal educational services to
high school students in all Queens Public Library branches.
The findings of this study indicate that librarians evoked high level of
responsibility and motivation regarding their role in using HomeworkNYC Apps to
133

deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18 in all library branches. Librarians'
feeling of responsibility and motivation toward delivering educational services to teenage
patrons are reflected by their self-feeling toward the teenage patrons’ perceptions of them
as the source for all educational needs (Stolley, 2005; Yeung & Martin, 2003). The
findings of this study suggest increasing the collaboration between librarians and library
leaders to develop better techniques for delivering the social applications for homework
assistance service to teenage patrons to ensure quality and consistency in homework
assistant services provided to teenage students in all Queens Library branches.
The findings of this study indicate the need for technology equipment and Internet
connectivity to deliver homework assistant services through the use of HomeworkNYC
Apps (Nunes et al., 2012; Sung-Min, 2012; Vitkauskaite, 2011). The study findings also
indicate that 75% of the study participants pointed out the lack of technological
equipment needed for delivering an adequate homework assistant service in library
branches. Further, 80% of the participants pointed out the instability and weakness of the
library Internet connectivity, especially as usage increases.
The lack of technological equipment and Internet connectivity increase the
pressure on librarians and hinder them from delivering an adequate homework assistant
service to teenage patrons through the use of HomeworkNYC Apps in library branches.
Meanwhile, Queens Library received 5,600 Google Nexus tablets and 2,800 Wi-Fi
wireless hotspots and distributed them to library branches to be borrowed by library
patrons for personal use. The findings of this study suggest that library leaders might
allocate sufficient numbers of the Google Nexus tablets and Wi-Fi wireless hotspots to be

134

used for delivering the homework assistant through HomeworkNYC Apps in all library
branches.
Recommendations for Leaders
The objective of this study was to explore librarians’ feelings, thoughts, and
experiences toward using HomeworkNYC Apps and social networking websites to
deliver homework assistance to teenage students in Queens Library branches. Exploring
the librarians’ experiences provided a description of how librarians perceive their role in
the process of delivering the homework assistance to teenage patrons. The following
recommendations for library leaders are based on the study’s findings to ensure the
quality and the consistency of the homework assistant services provided by librarians to
students aged 15 to 18 through using HomeworkNYC Apps and social networks in all
library branches:
1. Library leaders need to recognize the importance of the online social capital
concept and allow librarians to expand social communication with teenage
patrons throughout library branches. Initiating an official social network page
for each library branch would allow librarians in library branches to promote
library educational activities, including the HomeworkNYC Apps to teenage
patrons, through the library social page. Further, the library branch online
social page should be expanded to include the library services, thusreducing
the pressure on librarians, especially during the library’s busy hours.
2. Library leaders need to educate librarians on how to install the
HomeworkNYC Apps and use them through social networking websites.
Educating librarians further about the Apps through workshops provided by
135

professionals is vital for librarians to master the use of the Apps and be able to
answer all teenage patrons' questions and guide them effectively through the
process.
3. Library leaders need to provide librarians with sufficient technological tools to
deliver homework assistance using the Apps in library branches. The lack of
computer technology in the library increases the pressure on librarians and
prohibits them from serving all teenage students who attend the library for
homework assistance. Thus, library leaders need to provide each library
branch with enough computer technology with sufficient Internet connectivity
to be used specifically for homework assistance.
4. Library leaders need to engage librarians in decision making regarding library
services. Librarians are the professionals who deliver public services to
library patrons. Thus, allowing librarians to express and share their ideas,
needs, thoughts, and feelings about the library services they deliver would
enhance their working competence (Mohsenzadeh & Isfandyari-Moghaddam,
2011; Packard, 2010). Reducing the work-related personal and professional
pressure on librarians would enhance their motivation toward delivering better
services to teenage patrons. Administrators should recognize that librarians
are driven by their personal desire to deliver homework assistance to teenage
patrons in library branches.
5. Library leaders need to build a new system that would acknowledge the
librarians who succeed in helping more teenage students with homework.
Competitions in homework assistance in library branches would motivate
136

librarians to help more teenage patrons in obtaining homework assistance
through the use of the HomeworkNYC Apps in their branches. Accordingly,
librarians would transform the work-related pressure to a positive motivation
to succeed in proving their abilities to serve more teenage patrons.
Significance of the Study to Leadership
This qualitative exploratory case study contributes to library leaders’ body of
knowledge by providing a framework for managing library resources and technological
tools to enhance library educational services. The study provides a framework of using
innovative tools such as social networks and web 2.0 applications to enhance the delivery
of educational services to teenage patrons in the library. The study literature revealed a
gap in literature concerning the use of social media as a formal and informal educational
environment for high school students. This exploratory case study contributes to the
knowledge of using social media as an informal educational tool that may be used in
libraries to deliver educational services to high school students.
Library leaders may acknowledge the importance of exploring the librarians'
perceptions toward the library services they deliver to patrons. Exploring the librarians’
feelings, thoughts, and experiences may help library leaders to determine (a) better
approaches to deliver adequate library services to patrons (Packard, 2010), and (b)
personal and professional challenges that inhibit librarians from delivering library
services to patrons. Resolving the causes of librarians' pressure would increase the
librarians' contributions to library services. Making these changes will improve
librarians’ working performance and enhance the quality and quantity of library services
(Mohsenzadeh & Isfandyari-Moghaddam, 2011).

Limitations of the Study
This qualitative exploratory case study faced two limitation. The first limitation
was the perceptions and experiences of librarians in Queens Library may differ from
other librarians in other library systems in New York City, which limits the
generalizability of the study findings to other librarians in different library system in New
York City. The second limitation was the scope of the study was limited to the use of
HomeworkNYC social applications that are available to be used in New York City
libraries only, which limits the generalizability of the study findings to the use of other
social applications in other cities or states in the United States or other part of the world.
Suggestions for Future Research
The process of delivering homework assistance using HomeworkNYC Apps
entails the involvement of teenagers, teachers, and librarians. The Institute of Museum
and Library Services (2010) conducted a study to investigate how teenage students prefer
to receive homework assistance and concluded that teenagers prefer to receive homework
assistance through social networks. The aim of this study was to explore the librarians’
perceptions and lived experiences regarding their role in delivering homework assistance
to teenagers using the Apps and social networks. Thus, investigating teachers’
perceptions toward their role in the process of delivering assistance to teenagers using the
social media may be beneficial. Exploring teachers’ perceptions would add to the body
of knowledge regarding the use of social media as informal educational approach to high
school students. End-users also may offer valuable feedback; therefore examining the
issues related to homework assistance programs from the students’ perspective may also
be beneficial.
138

The population used in this study was librarians working in the Queens Public
library system, New York City. Choosing a population from one library system in New
York City limited the findings’ generalizability to other library systems in New York
City. Thus, conducting a similar study using a population from other library system
within and outside New York City may strengthen the findings of this particular study if
the results found similar.
The population used in this study was selected from young adult librarians who
serve teenage patrons in Queens Library. Expanding the population to include librarians
who serve adults and children may benefit the library leaders from recognizing obstacles
and stress factors that negatively affect librarians’ working performance. Resolving
obstacles and addressing changes needed to reduce work-related stress on librarians may
enhance the quality and quantity of library services.
Summary
The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the
librarians' perceptions toward using HomeworkNYC Apps and social networking
websites such as Facebook and MySpace to deliver homework assistance to students aged
15 to 18 in Queens Public Library branches. The study aimed to answer one central
research question how do librarians perceive the use of social media applications such as
DialATeacher, SearchIt, ListIt, and AttendIt to deliver homework assistance services to
teenagers in Queens Library branches? through answering two sub research questions.
The first sub research question was how do librarians perceive the use of social
networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace as educational platforms? And the
second sub research question was how do librarians perceive their role in the process of
139

using social media applications to deliver homework assistance to students aged 15 to 18
in library branches?
The conceptual framework of the study was based on the context of student
engagement (Junco, 2011) and social capital (Heath, Fuller, & Johnston, 2010) models.
The instruments used to collect data for this exploratory case study were
librarians’ interviews, participant observation, and documents. NVivo 10.0 computer
software was used to identify themes in this study.
Five core themes were emerged from the study that answered the two sub
research questions. The core themes were: (a) capability to communicate and share
knowledge, (b) inability to communicate with teenage patrons, (c) responsibility toward
delivering social educational service, (d) motivation toward educational role, and (e)
pressure due to lack of staffing and technological support.
The review of the study literature revealed a gap in literature regarding the use of
social media as a formal and informal educational environment for high school students.
This exploratory case study contributes to the knowledge of using social media as an
informal educational tool that maybe used in libraries to deliver educational services to
high school students.
The study had two limitation concerning the generalizability of study findings to
different settings. The study was significant to leadership because exploring the
librarians’ feelings, thoughts, and experiences may help library leaders to determine
better approaches to deliver adequate library services to patrons (Packard, 2010). Finally,
the study provided recommendations to library leaders and suggestions for future studies.

INFORMED CONSENT: LIBRARIAN

Dear
,
My name is Hesham Mohamed and I am a student at the University of Phoenix working
on a Doctoral degree. I am doing a research study entitled Librarians’ Perceptions
toward Using Social Media to Deliver Tutoring Services to Teenagers. The purpose of
this research study is to explore the Young Adult Librarians’ perceptions toward the use
of HomeworkNYC social media applications to deliver homework assistance to students
aged 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches.
Your participation will involve answering open-ended questions during face-to-face
interview. The interview will be audio-recorded and transcribed by the researcher to
ensure confidentiality. Your participation in study is absolutely voluntarily. Thus, you
can decide to be a part of this study or not. Once you start, you can withdraw from the
study at any time without any penalty or loss of benefits. The results of the research
study may be published but your identity will remain confidential and your name will not
be made known to any outside party.
In this research, there is no foreseeable social, stress, psychological, legal, or physical
risks to you or to your position greater than what you are already encountering in your
regular daily life as a young adult librarian.
Although there may be no direct benefit to you, a possible benefit from your
being part of this study is gaining better understanding to librarians’ perceptions toward
the use of HomeworkNYC apps as social media tools to deliver homework assistance to
students aged 15 to 18 in Queens Library branches as a new educational service
approach.
If you have any questions about the research study, please call me at (xxx) xxx-xxxx

Institutional Review Board via e-mail at IRB@phoenix.edu.

study and has answered all of your questions and concerns.

permission for the researcher, Hesham Mohamed, to record the interviews. You
understand that the information from the recorded interviews may be transcribed.
The researcher will develop a way to code the data to assure that your name is
protected.
5. Data will be kept in a secure and locked area. The data will be kept for three
years, and then destroyed.
