ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Features of Parent-Child Interaction as Predictors of Emotional, Cognitive, and
Behavioral Markers of Resilience in Children of Alcoholics
By MARIE C. HAVERFIELD

Dissertation Director:
Dr. Jennifer A. Theiss

Research in child development suggests that parental communication is one of the
primary influences on children’s healthy adjustment and development of prosocial skills.
Interactions between parents and children establish norms for how one is to manage
emotion, develop a strong sense of self, and demonstrate social competence. In families
of alcoholics, however, features of interaction between parents and children may have
different outcomes. The communication environment in families of alcoholics can be
characterized by conflict, neglect, and inconsistencies, which are often associated with
emotional, cognitive, and behavioral challenges for children of alcoholics. Despite these
challenging circumstances, some children of alcoholics manage to successfully adapt to
the conditions in their family and become resilient in the face of adversity. This study
considers how features of interpersonal communication in the family may act as a
protective factor for children of alcoholics and facilitate resilience. The goals of this

ii

study are three-fold. First, the study sets out to gain a better understanding of adolescent
resilience by examining emotion regulation ability, expressive self-efficacy, and
impulsivity as markers of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral well-being. Second, the
research draws on Baumrind’s (1991) parenting styles typology and Gottman’s (2001)
Emotion Regulation Theory to examine responsiveness, control, emotion coaching, and
emotion dismissing as features of parents’ communication behavior that predict
adolescent resilience for children of alcoholics and children of non-alcoholic parents.
Third, this study explores a variety of methods to assess resilience, extend existing
communication constructs, and examine the extent to which features of parent-child
communication and adolescent resilience differ between children of alcoholics and
children of non-alcoholics. To address these goals, this study invited parent-adolescent
dyads (30 from families with an alcoholic parent, 30 from families without an alcoholic
parent) to participate in a study in which they completed self-report measures of the
parent’s communication behavior and the adolescent’s resilience, adolescents’ heart rate
variability was measured to account for physiological changes in emotion regulation, and
both parent-adolescent dyads participated in two video-taped interactions that were later
coded for various features of parent-child communication and markers of resilience. The
results highlight the importance of parental communication in promoting adolescent
resilience and point to some notable differences in these associations between families
with an alcoholic parent and families without an alcoholic parent. These findings are
discussed in terms of their implications for advancing the literature on family
communication, promoting adolescent resilience, and responding to the challenging
communication climate in families of alcoholics.

CHAPTER ONE
Family relationships are some of the most crucial bonds in people’s lives and they
play an important role in shaping individual identity and promoting personal well-being.
In particular, the relationship between parents and children is integral to the socialization
and development of children in the family. A child’s first introduction to appropriate
communication behaviors and emotional expression begin with the socialization he or she
receives from their parents (Grolnick, Gurland, DeCourcey, & Jacob, 2002). Availability
of the caregiver also has direct links to a child’s positive perception of self (Bretherton,
1991). Lack of interaction and hostile communication between parent and child may
result in underdeveloped social skills, such as difficulty regulating emotion and
interacting with others (Calkins, 1994; Calkins & Dedmon, 2000; Keenan, 2000). In
families of alcoholics, which are characterized by conflict, turmoil, and communicative
inconsistencies, such an environment may produce complications for children’s healthy
development (Connors, Donovan, & DiClemente, 2001). There are approximately one in
four children growing up in an alcoholic home (Grant, 2000), many of whom experience
depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and behavioral problems. Among these children,
70% are likely to become substance abusers themselves (The Priory Center, 2006). Thus,
there seem to be communication dynamics in alcoholic families that may inhibit
children’s development and well-being.
Although the experience of growing up in an alcoholic home places children at
risk for emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems, there are some children who
demonstrate an ability to successfully cope with their challenging family circumstances.
Resilience refers to the development and achievement of positive outcomes and the

2
avoidance of negative outcomes amidst adversity (Wyman et al., 1999). Resilience is an
important personal characteristic for all children and adolescents to develop because it
arms them with coping mechanisms to respond to hardships both big and small (Fergus &
Zimmerman, 2005). For children of alcoholics (CoA), in particular, the tendency to
respond with resilience to their family circumstances is a key factor in their ability to lead
successful and healthy lives in adulthood (Werner & Johnson, 2004). Among the factors
that contribute to resilience, features of parent-child interaction are the most germane to
this study (Winslow, Sandler, & Wolchik, 2005). What, then, are the features of parentchild communication that can promote or impede resilience for adolescents, especially
those from families of alcoholics?
Although researchers have suggested communication is an important factor in
healthy child development (Aron & Aron, 1996), few have looked at how communication
impacts resilience. Research suggests that children growing up in an environment where
parents emphasize more authority and control experience higher levels of depression
(Koerner & Fitzpatrick, 1997) and lower self-esteem (Hamon & Schrodt, 2012) than
children from open communication households. An open communication environment
allows children to talk through concerns or triumphs, which could potentially mitigate
emotional or psychological issues stemming from their family situation (Pennebaker,
1985). Discussing the negative experiences affecting CoA, in particular, can be an
important part of the coping process (Bareket-Bojmel & Shahar, 2011). Therefore,
productive and open communication behaviors in families of alcoholics may contribute to
adolescents’ resilience.
Goals of this Dissertation

3
This study aims to identify the relationship between family communication and
adolescent resilience, especially in the context of families of alcoholics. Identifying
specific types of communication that facilitate resilience in adolescents may prove useful
for practitioners working with high-risk families, as well as the families themselves. This
study has three main goals: (1) gain a clearer understanding of adolescent resilience by
examining emotional, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations of resilience; (2) identify
the family communication dynamics that bolster or hinder resilience; and (3) utilize a
variety of methods to assess resilience and communication, extend existing
communication constructs, and explore any differences in parent-child communication
and adolescent resilience between families of alcoholics and families of non-alcoholic
parents.
First, to better understand the features of resilience this study specifically
examines the following concepts as markers of adolescent resilience: emotion regulation,
self-efficacy, and impulsivity. Emotion regulation refers to one’s ability to manage their
emotions (Gross & John, 2003). Children begin to develop their regulatory skills in
infancy through interactions with their caregivers. Children who learn to effectively
regulate their emotions demonstrate increased interpersonal competency and stress
management (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Self-efficacy describes one’s belief in his
or her ability to accomplish a task (Bandura, 1977). Individuals establish their selfefficacy through a process of assessing existing knowledge and appraisal of the context.
Those with a higher overall self-efficacy demonstrate less anxiety and superior cognitive
performance (Cervone, Jiwani & Wood, 1991; Cervone & Wood, 1995). Impulsivity is
described as a type of externalizing behavior when individuals act without considering

4
the potential for negative consequences (DeYoung, 2011). Individuals who frequently
demonstrate impulsivity also display more signs of aggression (Plutchik & Van Praag,
1989, 1995), report difficulty in relationships (Hinshaw & Melnick, 1995; Whalen,
Henker & Granger, 1990), and poor academic competence (Hinshaw, 1992). Each of
these variables represents an emotional, cognitive, or behavioral element of resilience,
which allows for a relatively complete picture of adolescent resilience.
Second, this study explores the dynamics of parent-child communication that may
differentiate resilient and non-resilient adolescents. Two theoretical perspectives inform
my thinking with regard to identifying features of parent-child interaction that may
promote or impede resilience. Baumrind’s (1991) parenting styles typology highlights
responsiveness and control as two dimensions of parental communication that promote
different outcomes in children. In addition, Gottman’s (2001) emotion regulation theory
describes emotion coaching and emotion dismissing behavior as two features of parental
communication that can influence emotional reactivity and expressiveness in children.
This study will examine the degree of responsiveness and control in parent-child
interaction, as well as the amount of emotion coaching and emotion dismissing behavior,
to identify features of parent-child communication that are associated with children’s
emotion regulation ability, self-efficacy, and impulsivity as markers of resilience.
Third, by using multiple methods, communication frameworks, and comparing
families of alcoholics with families of non-alcoholic parents, this dissertation aims to
extend the literature on family communication. This research makes theoretical,
methodological, and practical contributions to the literature on family communication.
Theoretically, this study integrates two theoretical approaches on parent-child

5
communication that are new to the field of family communication. Although the field of
family communication is growing, relatively few theories focus on the dynamics of
interaction between specific family members. Family communication patterns theory
(Koerner & Fitzpatrick, 2002), for example, focuses primarily on individuals’ perceptions
of their entire family’s communication tendencies, rather than focusing on specific
relationships within the family and specific behaviors within interaction. This dissertation
introduces new theories of family communication to the field that respond to both of
these shortcomings. Methodologically, this study uses a mixed-method approach to
measure and observe aspects of children’s resilience and parent-child communication. In
terms of assessing features of the parent-child communication, I will use both
observations of interactions and self-reports of the adolescents’ perceptions of their
parent’s communication behavior. In addition, the markers of resilience in this study will
be assessed using self-report, observational, and physiological measures. Specifically,
this study will include the physiological measure of heart rate variability to assess
biological expression of emotion regulation. Because emotion regulation is a complex
variable to study, examining it from several angles increases the chances of drawing
efficient conclusions. The process of measuring heart rate variability is noninvasive and
will allow for observing emotional arousal and time to recovery in adolescents.
Pragmatically, this study is significant because it extends the literature on family
communication by examining the experiences of high risk and non-high risk families. By
comparing and understanding the dynamics of family communication that lead to
resilience, this study can be useful in terms of identifying communication patterns that

6
are likely to promote resilience in CoA compared to children of non-alcoholic parents,
facilitating healthier adjustment, confidence, and overall well-being.
Preview of the Dissertation
To execute each of these goals, this dissertation will examine communication in
parent-adolescent dyads from both alcoholic and non-alcoholic families to see how
individual characteristics and features of parent-child interaction promote adolescent
resilience. The purpose of chapter two is to provide an overview of the characteristics of
families of alcoholics and identify three specific characteristics of adolescent resilience.
Chapter two begins by providing an overview of the disease of alcoholism and explains
how an alcohol use disorder may impact the family system. Since this study is focused on
adolescent outcomes of parent-child communication, I describe the various outcomes that
have been documented in children of alcoholics and demonstrate how these experiences
may differ for children of non-alcoholic parents. I then define adolescent resilience by
centering on three main characteristics: emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and impulsivity.
Each marker of resilience is explained, followed by a discussion of the operationalization
of the marker, the impact of parent-child communication on the marker, and the potential
for differences in the experiences of CoA and non-CoA.
Chapter three introduces two theoretical frameworks of parent-child
communication that may promote or impede child resilience: Baumrind’s (1991)
dimensions of responsiveness and control and Gottman’s (2001) emotion coaching and
emotion dismissing parenting behaviors. After describing each parenting style and the
outcomes associated with them, I highlight each dimension of parental communication as
a predictor of emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and impulsivity as markers of resilience.

7
In addition, this chapter discusses the potential for different outcomes of parent-child
communication for CoA versus non-CoA and advances several research questions to
investigate those differences.
In chapter four, I then provide a detailed explanation of the methodology of the
study. To properly assess each marker of resilience this study utilizes self-reports,
observations, and biomarker feedback. Both parent and adolescent were asked to consider
the adolescent’s ability to regulate emotion, self-efficacy, and impulsivity. Parents and
adolescents were then asked to participate in two 5-minute interactions involving a happy
topic and an unhappy topic at the discretion of the adolescent. The adolescent’s heart rate
was measured during each interaction and the 5-minutes following each interaction using
a plethysmograph (finger sensor), to identify any biological reactions during the
conversation. Two groups of parent-child dyads were involved in this study, 30 dyads
from families of alcoholics and 30 dyads from families of non-alcoholic parents.
In chapter five, I describe the analyses and results of the study. I begin by
summarizing preliminary analyses that compare means and bivariate correlations on all
variables for adolescents with an alcoholic parent and those without an alcoholic parent.
Then, I report the results of hierarchical linear regressions that examine the effects of
parental communication on each marker of adolescent resilience and the potential
moderating effect of the family’s status with or without an alcoholic parent.
A discussion of findings is presented in chapter six. In chapter six I review each
hypothesis and research question, explain the outcome for each, and consider their
implications in regards to families of alcoholics and families of non-alcoholic parents. I
also discuss the theoretical contributions of this research for the field of family

8
communication. Then, I highlight the pragmatic implications of parental communication
for improving adolescent resilience, especially for adolescents with an alcoholic parent.
Finally, I summarize the strengths and limitations of this study and point to future
directions for research on families of alcoholics and adolescent resilience.

9
CHAPTER TWO
The following chapter sets out to explain the dynamics present in families of
alcoholics and introduce important markers of adolescent resilience. To do this, I begin
by discussing experiences in families of alcoholics and the possible outcomes for children
of alcoholics. I then present the importance of resilience for children of alcoholics and
adolescents more broadly. Finally, I introduce each marker of resilience that will be the
focus of this study and discuss how they are measured, how they relate to parent-child
communication, and how they may differ across adolescent groups.
Dynamics of Families of Alcoholics
Alcoholism refers to an addictive and boundless consumption of alcoholic
substances and approximately 15 million people in the United States have been diagnosed
with the disease (NIAAA, 1995; SAMHSA, 2011). An alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the
fourth-most disabling disease among middle to low income countries and third-most
disabling in high income countries (WHO, 2008). Disease and injury conditions
attributable to an alcohol use disorder include infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes,
neuropsychiatric disease, cardiovascular disease, disease of the liver and pancreas, and
both intentional and unintentional injury (Rehm et al., 2009). Help and support for
individuals with an alcohol dependency is challenging due to the stigma often associated
with the disease (Lönnroth, Jaramillo, Williams, Dye, & Raviglione, 2009). These
features of alcoholism make it a prevalent and challenging illness.
Individuals affected by alcoholism often struggle to engage in regular activities or
fulfill their parental roles. Reasons for drinking include escapism, stress reduction,
reward, social lubricant, and to subside depressive symptoms (McMahon, Kouzekanai,

10
DeMarco, Kusel, & Davidson, 1992; Olenick & Chalmers, 1991; Ooteman, Koeter,
Verheul, Schippers, & Van den Brink, 2006; Verheul, Van den Brink, & Geerlings, 1999).
The use of alcohol as a coping mechanism often leads to antisocial behavior, narcissism,
and denial (Britton, 2004; Cornwell, 1968; Jacob, Leonard, & Haber, 2001). Alcoholic
parents are known to neglect their family and work obligations, have a low frustration
tolerance, experience high levels of anxiety, and have low self-esteem (Schade, 2006;
NIAAA, 2010). The severity of their drinking can lead to manipulation of family
members (Lyon & Greenberg, 1991) and the affection they give is typically inconsistent,
fluctuating between warmth and rejection (Woititz, 1985). There are predominantly more
alcoholic fathers than mothers with almost three times more male alcoholics than female
alcoholics (NIAAA, 1995). Alcoholic fathers are reportedly less sensitive and
communicate very little with their children compared to non-alcoholic fathers (Eiden,
Chavez, & Leonard, 1999).
Due to the often stressful family environment in families of alcoholics, dynamics
may be different from other types of families. Although experiences may vary, alcoholic
families often encounter high levels of conflict, stress, and disorder (Straussner & Fewell,
2011). Interparental conflict often spills over into interactions between parent and child
(Bradford & Barber, 2005), which may have negative impacts on parental
communication sensitivity and orientation. Characteristics of parenting practices in
families of alcoholics include inconsistency, frustration, explosive and inflexible
discipline, low supervision and involvement, minimal nurturance, and little concern for
adolescent substance use (Lam et al., 2007; Stanger, Dumenci, Kamon, & Burstein, 2004).
Members of families affected by alcoholism also report expressing fewer feelings and

11
less regard for other family members (Jones & Houts, 1992). Perhaps this is why CoA
who are exposed to family turbulence and dysfunction often develop more emotional,
cognitive, and behavioral problems than children of non-alcoholic parents (Liepman,
Keller, Botelho, Monroe, & Sloane, 1998).
One way that alcoholism can influence the family environment is through the
alcoholic’s relationship with his or her spouse. Families of alcoholics experience higher
levels of parental distress (Stout & Mintz, 1996). Conflict and miscommunication often
arise in couples with an alcoholic partner (Fals-Stewart & Birchler, 1998; Kelly, Halford,
& Young, 2002), as well as a higher chance for disinterest and decreased levels of
intimacy than in couples without an alcoholic partner (Carroll, Robinson, & Flowers,
2002). The higher levels of conflict found in alcoholic partnerships increases the potential
for verbal and physical abuse (Straus & Sweet, 1992; Testa, Quigley, & Leonard, 2003;
Wekerle & Wall, 2002). When the alcoholic parent is unable to fulfill their work
obligations due to intoxication, the non-alcoholic parent may call in sick for the alcoholic,
thereby enabling them, perpetuating the disease, and exposing the family to further abuse
(Zelvin, 2004). In addition, partners of an alcoholic spouse are at an increased risk for
mental health issues that may be detrimental to their long-term well-being (Le Poire,
2006). Therefore, alcoholic partnerships have the potential to involve hardships at the
personal and relational level.
An unhealthy and potentially turbulent relationship between parents can have
negative consequences for the children in a family. As family systems theory suggests,
each family member has an important function in the operation of the system as a whole
and family members mutually influence one another through their interactions (Bowen,

12
1978; Broderick, 1993). Marital strife may result in child neglect and demonstrate a poor
model for healthy relationships, making it difficult for children to process emotion and
gain prosocial skills (Frosch & Mangelsdorf, 2001; Davies & Cummings, 1994).
Prosocial skills refer to one’s efficacy in matching the expectations of social interactions,
assimilating to societal norms, and solving problems (Hines & Saudino, 2002). The
unpredictable behaviors of the alcoholic can reduce the adaptability and emotional
expressivity of family members (Mylant, Ide, Cuevas, & Meehan, 2002; Barnow,
Schuckit, Lucht, John, & Freyberger, 2002). A child’s physical health may also be
affected by parental conflict. Children exposed to high levels of conflict may experience
impediments to their sympathetic nervous system, which allows them to regulate stress
response, potentially putting them at physical risk (El-Sheikh et al., 2009). In families
that experience multiple stressors such as alcoholism, children are at an especially high
risk for developing adjustment problems (Jouriles et al., 1991). Thus, interactions among
parents can have long-term effects on the well-being of their offspring.
Beyond the impact of a tumultuous spousal relationship, alcoholic parents can
also have a more direct impact on their children’s development and well-being. Alcoholic
parents are known to withdraw from family relationships and responsibilities rendering
them unavailable (Schade, 2006). Non-alcoholic parents are often occupied with the
alcoholic, taking on additional responsibilities and covering up their drinking (Vernig,
2011). Thus, the neglect present in an alcoholic home may result in children’s insecure
attachment style (Erdman, 1998). One study found that mothers with an alcoholic partner
demonstrated less warmth and sensitivity when interacting with their child, which
eventually led to outcomes of poor social competence by grade school (Eiden, Colder,

13
Edwards, & Leonard, 2009). ACoA who reported having a distressed relationship with
their parent also reported feeling isolated, an inability to communicate effectively,
difficulty trusting others, more emotional longing, negative feelings towards the parent,
and an increase in depressive symptoms (Kelley et al., 2011). Alcoholic parents often
subscribe to a high conformity orientation and low conversation orientation (Rangarajan
& Kelly, 2006). Research shows that in families of alcoholics, communication patterns
moderate family stressors and attachment styles (Rangaragjan, 2008). Furthermore,
parents who demonstrate consistent warmth, discipline, and monitoring have been found
to greatly reduce the potential for negative outcomes in CoA (Molina, Donovan, &
Belendiuk, 2010). These findings paint a very different picture of the parent-child
dynamic in an alcoholic home as compared to non-alcoholic families.
Adolescents are even more susceptible to issues stemming from their parent’s
drinking than younger children due to the longevity of exposure to the disease and
negative outcomes from it (Peleg-Oren & Teichman, 2006). Also, during adolescence
the brain is not fully developed, which can make it difficult to manage emotions
(Cozzolino, 2006; Straussner & Fewell, 2011). At the same time, hormonal changes are
also rapidly taking place impacting the amygdala, or area of emotion control, which can
intensify emotional experiences. Thus, adolescents often appear to make rash decisions,
seem narcissistic, be overly dramatic, and make poor judgments (Cozzolino, 2006). The
stressful experiences of being an adolescent also add to the difficulty in coping with
stressors at home. Developmental issues that emerge in childhood are often exacerbated
during adolescence and into adulthood. In many cases, these problems lead to addiction,
with more than half of the adolescents exposed to substance abuse developing an

14
addictive disorder (Saraceno, Munaf, Heron, Craddock, van den Bree, 2009; Biederman,
Faraone, Monuteaux, & Feighner, 2000; Rothman, Edwards, Heeren, & Hingson, 2008).
As with most CoA, feelings of guilt and shame related to a parent’s drinking are also
present and may be associated with fear of disclosure regarding their parent’s disease and
related outcomes to family and/or health care professionals (Straussner & Fewell, 2011).
Despite the hardships that may arise for CoA, the family environment can also be
an important factor in coping with an alcoholic parent. Family rituals have the potential
to buffer the effects of an alcoholic parent (Wolin, Bennett & Jacobs, 1988; Hawkins,
1997). Rituals such as family dinner provide consistency in an otherwise inconsistent
environment, thereby exposing CoA to some form of discipline and regulation. Open
communication from the non-alcoholic parent has also shown to moderate the effects of
having an alcoholic parent (Miller-Day & Marks, 2006; King & Chassin, 2004). By
explaining and discussing the alcoholism, non-alcoholic parents may reduce child
uncertainty and confusion. Taken together, these findings suggest that in families where
at least one parent provides protective buffering, the effects of growing up in a
dysfunctional environment are minimized (Bijttebier & Goethals, 2006). Therefore, it is
possible that the communicative environment in the family may protect children from
adopting maladaptive behaviors and promote resilience.
Outcomes for Children of Alcoholics
Children who grow up in alcoholic families have been known to demonstrate a
variety of dysfunctional emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Conversely, some CoA
respond to their family environment by showing increased maturity, responsibility, and
resilience (Burnett et al., 2006; Walker & Lee, 1998). In this section, I discuss the

15
emotional, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes for CoA and I explore the potential for
resilience in the face of troubling family circumstances.
Children who grow up with an alcoholic parent may develop a variety of negative
emotional outcomes. Prohibiting discussion about the disease is a common pattern in
families of alcoholics as a way to maintain the function of the family system (Gravitz,
1985). An inability to disclose experiences and receive support potentially increases
stress and emotional reactivity (Bolger & Amarel, 2007; Terry, Rawle, & Callan, 1995).
Many individuals who grew up with an alcoholic parent select future relationship partners
who are also alcoholics (Schuckitt, Tipp, & Kelner, 1994). In those relationships, ACoA
struggle to express emotion and often report less marital satisfaction (Barnow et al.,
2002; El-Guebaly, West, Maticka-Tyndale, & Pool, 1993; Kearns-Bodkin & Leonard,
2008). Thus, the experiences from growing up in an alcoholic home have both short and
long-term implications for emotional well-being.
There are also a variety of challenging cognitive outcomes reported by CoA.
Researchers have found a significant relationship between quality of care at home and a
child’s cognitive progress (Arranz, 2005). For many CoA, growing up in an alcoholic
home results in negative psychosocial outcomes that affect their health and well-being
(Sher, 1991). CoA report lower levels of self-esteem and self-efficacy, resulting in an
inability to effectively cope with their environment (Hussong & Chassin, 1997;
Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006). In turn, many CoA are diagnosed with psychological
disorders such as anxiety and depression (Chassin, Pitts, & Prost, 2002; Sher, 1991;
Roosa, Dumka, & Tein, 1996). Thus, experiences in families of alcoholics may
contribute to negative cognitive outcomes for CoA.

16
Behavioral problems can also develop as a result of growing up in an alcoholic
home. CoA often demonstrate poor internalizing and externalizing behaviors (Hill et al.,
2008; Schuckit, Smith, Pierson, Trim, & Danko, 2007). Internalizing behaviors refer to
actions and behaviors that direct problematic energy inward toward the self, which often
manifests in self-harm, depression, and anxiety (Dornbusch, Mont-Reynaud, Ritter, Chen,
& Steinberg, 1991; Leadbeater, Blatt, & Quinlan, 1995). Girls are more likely to
experience internalizing behaviors such as withdrawal, low self-esteem, and loneliness
(Moylan et al., 2010). Externalizing behaviors refer to maladaptive responses to one’s
environment in which individuals direct their negative energy outward by lashing out at
others (Jackson & Warren, 2000). Negative behavioral reactions include behaviors like
attention deficit, hyperactivity, misconduct, poor interaction skills, and academic
problems (Straussner & Fewell, 2011). Signs of internalizing and externalizing behavior
vary depending on age, with older children demonstrating more internalizing behavior
than younger children (Puttler, Zucker, Fitzgerald, & Bingham, 1998). Some evidence
suggests that the mental health of one’s primary caregiver may influence the degree to
which a child experiences behavioral problems. Depressed mothers, common in families
of substance abuse, demonstrate less responsiveness and engagement when interacting
with their child, which may contribute to behavioral issues (Miller, 1993: Radke-Yarrow,
1998). Research suggests that the antisocial nature of a family may also be predictive of
the behavioral outcomes for CoA (Puttler et al., 1998).
Despite evidence that CoA struggle with emotional, cognitive, and behavioral
reactivity to their family circumstances, there are some situations in which children
succeed in spite of their family environment. Children’s ability to successfully adapt to an

17
adverse environment reflects their resilience. There are multiple factors that contribute to
resilience, one of which is parental communication (Hines & Saudino, 2002). Parents that
communicate consistent warmth and discipline aid in the development of emotional
expression and reduce the likelihood of CoA developing negative outcomes (Trainor,
Austin, & Desjardins, 2000; Molina, Donovan, & Belendiuk, 2010). Availability of
support systems are also a strong predictor of the resilience that children may develop
amidst a high-risk environment (Gruber & Taylor, 2006; Lam, Fals-Stewart, & Kelley,
2008). Thus, the availability of protective factors, such as healthy parent-child
communication, may minimize the negative effects of growing up in an alcoholic home
and instead promote children’s resilience. To better understand the importance of
resilience in children of alcoholics and adolescence more broadly, the following section
provides an overview of resilience and introduces three important features of resilience:
emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and impulsivity.
Characteristics of Resilience in Adolescents
A high-risk setting or a prolonged traumatic experience can expose children to a
stressful environment (Masten, 2001). Both genetic and environmental factors can
influence one’s vulnerability to negative experiences (Deater-Deckard, Ivy, & Smith,
2005). Although all children are exposed to some level of adversity, those that experience
chronic stressors are the most prone to deleterious outcomes. Various protective factors
act as coping mechanisms, allowing children to overcome their difficult circumstances.
Children who are better at navigating an unfavorable situation are more likely to avoid
negative outcomes (Lansford et al., 2006). Resilience refers to a successful adaptation in
an adverse environment (Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000). There are both positive and

18
negative outcomes that stem from resilience. On one hand, to successfully adapt to
stressful situations individuals must master certain developmental skills, including selfmonitoring and a healthy level of confidence, both of which can have long-term benefits
(Hall & Webster, 2007). On the other hand, learning to adapt to adverse circumstances
may put children in a position to take on responsibilities that require accelerated
maturation, preventing them from experiencing the joys of youth. Emotion regulation,
self-efficacy, and impulsivity are three distinct markers of resilience. Each marker was
chosen to represent the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral facets of resilience. They are
interrelated through the construct of self-regulation. Self-regulation refers to individuals
sense-making process in regards to the actions they take and how they react to external
stimuli (Carver & Scheier, 2011). Thus, each of these measures offers a valuable
assessment of individuals’ general ability to persevere amidst adversity (Vohs &
Baumeister, 2011). The following sections describe the relationship between resilience
and each of these markers, as well as how they operate in families of alcoholics.
Emotion Regulation as a Marker of Resilience
One indicator of children’s resilience is reflected in their ability to manage their
emotions. Emotion regulation describes one’s ability to control their emotional arousal
(Ochsner & Gross, 2005). Emotional responses are stimulated by cognitive appraisal and
affect behavioral outcomes (Smith & Lazarus, 1990). Individuals who learn to
successfully manage their emotions demonstrate prosocial skills and stress management
(Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Since resilience reflects successful adaptation to
adversity, adolescents with the ability to regulate emotion may exhibit the skills

19
necessary to effectively cope, this is particularly important for CoA who may experience
a stressful family environment.
The experience and expression of emotion is a complex process. The study of
emotion regulation began in the early 1900’s and has grown in both popularity and
operation (Gross & Thompson, 2006). One of the biggest challenges for emotion
regulation scholars is how to define and differentiate emotion and emotion regulation.
For the purpose of this study, emotions are the response system that allows individuals to
construct meaning across experiences (Cole, Martin, & Dennis, 2004). To break emotions
down even further it is important to understand that they involve goals, are multi-faceted,
and affect multiple systems (Gross & Thompson, 2006). Goals refer to the conscious and
subconscious ideals we have for a given situation that elicits some type of emotion,
whether it be positive or negative. Emotions are multi-faceted in that they incorporate
subjective experience, behavior, and physiology (Mauss, McCarter, Levenson, Wilhelm,
& Gross, 2005). Emotions are personal because they involve feelings and, in turn, action.
As feelings and action occur, a physiological process takes place in our nervous system,
gauging the way to respond based on that emotional experience. As a system, emotions
can interrupt our awareness and affect the way we behave in our social interactions
(Gross & Thompson, 2006). Emotions influence the decisions we make and the reactions
we have to various stimuli (Keltner & Kring, 1998; Tooby & Cosmides, 1990b). Thus,
the way we manage our emotions affects how we perceive experiences and behave in
social interactions.
The process of experiencing emotion often requires an attempt at control (Zaki &
Williams, 2013). The control feature is commonly referred to as emotion regulation,

20
which describes the way we navigate through positive and negative affect (Ochsner &
Gross, 2005). Affect refers to individual appraisals of a given state (Scherer, 1984a).
States include stressful responses, emotions, moods, and motivational stimuli such as
eating. States have the potential to elicit either a positive or negative response (Lazaraus,
1993). To manage our states we attempt to control or regulate our arousal (Gross, 1998).
Regulation strategies include reassessing a situation, distracting one’s self from the
situation, suppressing emotion, and distancing from the situation (Ayduk & Kross, 2010;
Gross, 1998; McRae et al., 2010; Ochsner, Silvers, & Buhle, 2012). Based on the way we
decide to regulate our emotion, a physiological arousal adjustment occurs, moment to
moment, and varies in latency, rise time, magnitude, and duration (Gross, 1998;
Thompson, 1990). Therefore, we regulate our emotional responses psychologically and
biologically.
As children develop there are several factors that may influence their ability to
regulate emotion including temperament, age, family dynamic, and peers. Literature on
emotion regulation is primarily focused on children and adolescents (Thompson, 1990;
1994). This is a period when temperament, brain development, abstract thinking, and
social networks are developing, thereby laying the groundwork for unique differences in
emotion regulation that continue into adulthood (Calkins & Hill, 2007; Rothbart &
Sheese, 2007; Thompson & Meyer, 2006). One’s temperament is a strong factor that may
affect how individuals perceive and express emotion. Temperament can be influenced by
genetics as well as experience and consists of two domains: reactivity and self-regulation
(Rothbart & Bates, 2006). Reactivity refers to the response to change in one’s
environment, both internal and external. Self-regulation describes an individual’s ability

21
to control and orient one’s self in a way that effectively manages reactivity (Rothbart &
Bates, 2006). Individuals begin to develop their self-regulation from infancy through
interactions with their parents and temperamental disposition (Eisenberg, Spinrad, &
Eggum, 2010; Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). By age five, most children are capable
of managing attention and behavior (Carlson, 2005; Li-Grining, 2007). Self-regulation in
childhood can also involve impulsivity and modulation of negative emotion (De Pauw &
Mervielde, 2011), which later reflects an individual’s ability to manage aggression and
behavioral problems (Caspi, 1998; Eisenberg et al., 2010). Moreover, proper selfregulation facilitates academic drive and compliance with social norms (Eisenberg,
Duckworth, Spinrad, & Valiente, 2014). During adolescence a substantial amount of selfregulation growth occurs (Albert & Steinberg, 2011) and continues throughout the
lifespan (Lengua, 2006).
Poor self-regulation may affect the way children respond to risky situations in
adolescence. For example, risk-taking tendencies are common among adolescents
(Romer, Duckworth, Sznitman, & Park, 2010). During adolescence, the body increases
the release of dopamine to the subcortical reward centers, which encourages attraction to
novel and exciting experiences (Chambers, Taylor, & Potenza, 2003; Spear, 2000). One’s
ability to delay gratification, or administer self-control, can potentially mitigate risktaking predispositions (Romer, Duckworth, Sznitman, & Park, 2010). Thus, the
successful development of self-regulation skills in childhood may prevent risk-taking
behaviors in adolescence.
Operationalizing emotion regulation. Contemporary research emphasizes the
need to measure emotion regulation in three ways: through self-report, observation, and

22
physiology (Cole, Martin, & Dennis, 2004). Self-report is utilized to gain the
participant’s perspective on the situational context and their perceived ability to respond
in emotionally appropriate ways. Observation affords researchers the ability to see the
expression of emotion in response to environmental stimuli. To further monitor the
occurrence of emotion regulation researchers study the down-regulation of negative
emotions through biological markers. Emotions affect and are influenced by various
biological functions such as the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine systems (Porges,
Doussard-Roosevelt, & Maiti, 1994; Stansbury & Gunnar, 1994). Because emotions are
so complex and the regulation of them must be situationally grounded, using multiple
cues to observe a change in regulatory behavior aids in making effective inferences (Cole,
Martin, & Dennis, 204). From a physiological standpoint, emotion regulation specifically
describes the process of regulating emotions to maintain homeostasis, or physiological
stability (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997).
Previous research on emotion regulation focused primarily on measuring a child’s
vagal tone (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Vagal tone refers to the regulation of the
vagus nerve, which is located in the brainstem, specifically the medulla oblongata
(Porges, Doussard-Roosevelt, & Maiti, 1994). The vagus nerve works as part of the
parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system in regulating homeostasis for
many of the body’s internal organs. The autonomic nervous system describes the
subconscious operations of the body such as breathing, digesting, and sweating. One of
the ways to measure vagal tone is monitoring one’s heart rate variability (HRV). When a
stimulus is presented to an individual that surprises or scares them, their heart rate
typically increases and is no longer in homeostasis. To adjust, the nucleus ambiguus,

23
which is one of several centers in the brainstem, increases output from the
parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) to the vagus nerve. When the vagus nerve
receives the increase in output from the PNS the vagus nerve slows down the sinoatrial
node in the heart thereby decreasing or regulating heart rate and returning to homeostasis.
The better a child is at suppressing vagal tone, regulation of the sinoatrial node, the better
they are at emotion regulation (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Children with high
baseline vagal tone, or a heightened reactivity, have been found to recover faster in
stressful situations, and children who are able to suppress vagal tone calm themselves
down faster, quickly returning to homeostasis. Thus, emotion regulation is filtered
through the child’s physiological make-up and their ability to manage positive and
negative affect (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Resilience, then, may be marked by
the emotion regulation ability of a child. Therefore, this study will include a measure of
HRV to identify the emotion regulation ability of adolescents.
Witnessing the changes in activated emotion is also important for confirming that
regulation took place; thus, self-report and observational methods are also key to
understanding the development of this process. Self-report measures allow individuals to
describe the strategies they use in order to regulate emotion. In this study, adolescents
will be asked to provide their experiences of reappraisal and expression of emotion.
Parents are also asked about their demonstrations of emotion as well as their views on the
adolescent’s ability to regulate emotion. Taken together, these perspectives provide more
detail regarding the adolescents’ cognitive process when stimulated by emotion and the
parent’s potential role in the development of the adolescent’s regulation ability.
Observation of the interactions between parents and adolescents allows for visible

24
demonstrations of the emotion regulation process. Early observation methods for
studying emotion regulation included the still-face paradigm, which examined change in
children’s emotion as a result of parental shift in affection (Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise,
& Brazelton, 1978). More recent research measured face-to-face interactions between
mothers and infants by focusing on the duration of emotional expression and the
sequence of behavioral shifts (Field, 1994). In this study, observations will focus on the
positive and negative expressions of emotion as demonstrated by adolescents and the
initial stimuli that activate the resulting emotional outcome. A similar observation
method was conducted with toddlers who were confronted with a stressful situation
(Grolnick, Bridges, & Connell, 1996). By engaging more with the environment toddlers
effectively self-regulated their emotion and in turn, demonstrated less negative affect. On
the other hand, the children who dwelled on the person or object causing the distress
demonstrated more negative emotion. Taken together, each method produces a piece of a
much larger construct, affording more inferences and offering a clearer understanding of
the emotion regulation process.
Communication patterns that promote emotion regulation. A child’s ability to
regulate emotion may be largely based on the family communication climate. Research
on emotion regulation found two parental communication styles that were predictive of a
child’s emotion regulation abilities: emotion coaching and emotion dismissing parenting
(Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Emotion coaching is considered a positive
communication style where parents aid in the children’s ability to recognize, manage, and
express emotion. Emotion dismissing communication is less supportive, critical, and
belittling of children’s feelings. Children who grow up in an emotion coaching family

25
appear to regulate their emotions better and demonstrate positive developmental
outcomes, such as interpersonal competency and stress management. Because children in
an emotion dismissing family are exposed to frustration and mockery when they express
feelings, their ability to regulate emotion suffers. Expression of negative emotions may
frequently be dismissed and the inability to manage those emotions may result in
outbursts of verbal and physical aggression (Cupach & Olson, 2006). Children in emotion
dismissing families also appear less healthy, receive lower academic scores, and
demonstrate more behavioral problems than children in emotion coaching families
(Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Thus, the family environment may be a strong
predictor of a child’s emotion regulation abilities and long-term well-being.
The emotional and communicative interaction style between parents and their
children develops the foundation for how the child will interact with the world around
them. At birth, child and primary caregiver experience a dyadic regulation where in most
cases a parent’s reaction to a child’s response mirrors how the child should be feeling and
how to address those feelings (Fonagy & Target, 1997; Beebe, Lachmann, & Jaffe, 1997).
The reaction of the parent demonstrates to the child how they should manage and
internalize emotion (Straussner & Fewell, 2011). A supportive and sympathetic response
from parents during a child’s expression of emotion allows the child to successfully
identify and address their emotion during a social episode (Gross & Thompson, 2006). In
doing so, children learn how to effectively regulate themselves in future interactions.
Parents who respond to their child’s emotion in a derogatory way often stimulates a
child’s negative adaptation and poor regulatory behavior (Denham, 1998; Eisenberg,
Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998). As children are exposed to the positive or negative

26
regulating process of emotions, the experiences lend a hand in shaping how they view
themselves and their environment (Peterson & Park, 2006).
Although parent-child interactions set the groundwork for how to regulate
emotion, peer interactions outside of the family offer children another channel to
negotiate conflict, manage aggression, learn to cooperate, and form friendships (Gottman,
Katz, & Hoover, 1997). Regulating negative affect, the inclination to experience
negative emotion, can impact the way peer interactions function (Gottman, Katz, &
Hoover, 1997; Watson & Clark, 1984). In families that neglect to teach their children
proper ways to handle emotion, regulation of negative affect may be difficult. Moreover,
when a child expresses more negative affect they are often viewed as a less desirable
interaction partner, making it difficult for interpersonal relationships to form. Poor social
interaction skills have been linked to other developmental outcomes including aggression,
poor attention span, low academic achievement scores, depression, and deviant behavior
(Patterson & Stoolmiller, 1991). Thus, the inability to regulate emotion may lead to a
variety of other developmental problems.
Emotion regulation among children of alcoholics. Based on the environment of
alcoholic homes, CoA may experience difficulty in regulating emotion. A responsive
parent that teaches a child how to engage in perspective taking is associated with
effective emotion regulation skills (Baumrind, 1971). In families where emotional
distress is experienced, such as families of alcoholics, parents’ demonstration of how to
manage emotion may be incapacitated. In addition, frequent conflict is a common
characteristic of alcoholic families (Connors, Donovan, & DiClemente, 2001). A child’s
reaction to conflict is often emotional distress due to the uncertainty about the parent

27
relationship (Cummings, 1987). Inability to appraise the situation may reduce their
feelings of emotional security, thereby inhibiting their emotion regulation function
(Davies & Cummings, 1994). Another common trait in families of alcoholics is
manipulated or inconsistent communication, making it difficult for the child to interpret
how to appropriately perceive communication and respond (Fonagy, Gergely, Jurist, &
Target, 2002; Fonagy & Target, 1997). A parent’s reaction to a child’s emotional
expression may demonstrate frustration and insecurity, potentially leading a child to
expect these same characteristics of themselves. Similarly, the misunderstanding and
poor management of emotion can have long term consequences for a child’s future
relationships (Fonagy et al., 2002). Thus, exposure to a distressed family environment
during the early stages of development can have lasting effects on emotion regulation and
individual well-being.
Self-Efficacy as a Marker of Resilience
Self-efficacy is a cognitive variable that is reflective of resilience. Self-efficacy
describes one’s perception of their ability to accomplish a given task (Bandura, 1997).
One’s perception of self-efficacy can influence what goals are set, level of commitment
to those goals, and the realization of accomplishments (Bandura, 2006). Individuals who
believe they are capable of overcoming an adverse situation would also be said to have
high self-efficacy in that context. The cognitive functions of self-efficacy impact the way
individuals develop, adapt, and change (Boyer et al., 2000; Holden, 1991; Holden,
Moncher, Schinke, & Barker, 1990; Moritz, Feltz, Fahrbach, & Mack, 2000). Thus, selfefficacy is a relevant factor when considering resilience because it reflects how

28
individuals cognitively motivate themselves to do something regardless of environmental
conditions.
Self-efficacy is one of many features in the cognitive system. According to the
knowledge and appraisal personality architecture model (KAPA), self-efficacy entails
both knowledge and appraisal (Cervone, 2004; Lazarus, 1991). Knowledge refers to the
cognitive network of experiences people store as future references for how they view
others, the environment, and themselves (Delia, 1977; Lazarus, 1991). Appraisal
describes the way individuals evaluate their experiences with assistance from their
existing knowledge. Perceived self-efficacy is situationally grounded, in that individuals
may feel capable in one context and quite incapable in the next (Cervone, Mor, Orom,
Shadel, & Scott, 2011). It is also important to note that self-efficacy is unique from other
constructs such as self-esteem. A self-efficacy appraisal, or the perceived capabilities to
perform, is different than considering one’s overall self-worth (Cervone et al., 2011).
Thus, self-efficacy appraisal involves reflection and decision making as part of the selfregulation process.
The knowledge and appraisal processes occur on both a cognitive and behavioral
level. There are four ways that an individual gains psychosocial knowledge for future
application: (1) mastery experience, or firsthand knowledge, is the primary influence on
appraisals; (2) observation of other’s experiences; (3) evaluation of emotional and
psychological states; and (4) persuasive attempts from others that bolster or hinder one’s
self-appraisals (Bandura, 1977). There are also four ways that self-efficacy affects
behavior (Bandura, 1997). First, self-efficacy influences the decision to participate or
avoid certain events (e.g. Hackett & Betz, 1995). Second, appraisals impact the amount

29
of effort applied to the task (e.g. Cervone & Peake, 1986). Third, the level of confidence
in completing the task influences one’s level of anxiety (e.g. Bandura, Cioffi, Taylor, &
Brouillard, 1988). Fourth, belief in one’s ability affects performance (e.g. Cervone,
Jiwani, & Wood, 1991). These factors suggest that higher self-efficacy appraisals
encourage better self-regulation and overall success.
There are several positive and negative outcomes that result from self-efficacy.
When individuals have low self-efficacy regarding a particular task and choose not to
pursue it, they may be limiting themselves in terms of knowledge and skill (Betz, 2001;
Betz & Hackett, 1981). Individuals who have high self-efficacy for an activity report less
anxiety in completing the task (Bandura, Cioffi, Taylor, & Brouillard, 1988; Bandura,
Taylor, Williams, Mefford, & Barchas, 1985). In contrast, those who frequently
experience low self-efficacy are susceptible to depressive symptoms (Bandura, Pastorelli,
Barbaranelli, & Caprara, 1999; Cutrona & Troutman, 1986). Self-efficacy also has a large
influence on cognitive competence. Those who have higher self-efficacy demonstrate
better performance on complex tasks (Cervone, Jiwani, & Wood, 1991; Cervone & Wood,
1995), problem-solving tasks (Artistico, Cervone, & Pezzuti, 2003), and tests of memory
(Berry, West, & Dennehey, 1989). Conversely, those with low self-efficacy towards
similar tasks may obsess over the challenge of the task and doubt their skill in
accomplishing the task, thereby affecting their ability to perform (Elliott & Dweck, 1988).
Taken together, high self-efficacy generates better self-regulation and accomplishment
than low self-efficacy (Cervone et al., 2011). Thus, individuals who believe they are
capable of accomplishing the task set before them may also demonstrate an increased
ability to cope amidst hardship.

30
Operationalizing self-efficacy. Self-efficacy focuses on identifying particular
goals and one’s perceived ability to manage that behavior (Bandura, 1997, 2006). In other
words, self-efficacy refers to the confidence individuals have in their ability to perform
the behaviors that will help them to accomplish their goals. Because self-efficacy is a
cognitive variable about beliefs, no real observational method can verify self-efficacy in
interaction. Thus, the primary way to measure self-efficacy is through self-report. Selfreport measures typically target a specific goal or behavior that the person feels efficacy
to accomplish. In this particular study, adolescents will be asked to reflect on their ability
to talk to their parent about their feelings and how capable they believe themselves to be
in expressing their emotions. Parents will also be asked to provide their perspectives on
the cognitive function of the adolescent as demonstrated by prosocial skill and selfregulation. The assessment of self-efficacy from two different viewpoints allows for
greater understanding of an adolescent’s confidence in their ability to communicate with
their parent and express emotion.
Communication patterns that promote self-efficacy. A child’s first experiences
and perceptions of self-efficacy occur within the family. Parents provide the initial
feedback that confirms children’s academic ability, progress, and efforts (Epstein, 1990).
Positive interactions with parents facilitate healthy levels of self-efficacy in children
(Bandura, 1997; Meece, 1997). Family environments that engage children’s curiosity and
encourage skill development provide opportunities for children to gain knowledge and
mastery experience (Meece, 1997). Families that provide few opportunities for parentchild interaction may result in lower levels of self-efficacy in children (Bandura, 1997).

31
Thus, families that have limited interaction or negative interaction may inhibit the
successful development of adolescents’ self-efficacy.
Relationships outside the home also influence self-efficacy. Observation of peers
often motivates children to attempt an activity and aim for success (Schunk, 1987).
Modeling others is a popular way for children to identify their level of self-efficacy in a
variety of contexts, particularly among children who have an underdeveloped sense of
self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986). Research on self-efficacy among school-aged children
found that as a child progresses through school self-efficacy has the potential to decrease
(Pintrich & Schunk, 1996) because the competition and comparison to others can cause
added stress and affect one’s perception of their academic abilities.
Self-efficacy among children of alcoholics. Self-efficacy may develop
differently in CoA due largely to the communication issues that arise in alcoholic
families. The variety of communication outcomes that a child is exposed to as a result of
growing up in an alcoholic home could have direct impacts on their self-efficacy.
Alcoholic parents are often inconsistent in their communication (Reed, 2006). Exposure
to inconsistency in communication may create relational uncertainty between the
alcoholic parent and child (Knobloch & Solomon, 2005). Uncertainty or inconsistencies
in interactions with a parent may make it difficult for a child to establish whether they are
capable, thereby damaging their perceptions of self-efficacy. The inconsistencies and
uncertainty that result from interacting with the alcoholic parent may also lead to
hypervigilence, a common characteristic among CoA that describes their heightened level
of anxiety (Johnson & Stone, 2009; Sher, 1997). In addition, the appraisals of inadequacy
towards interacting may render CoA unable to communicate effectively with others (cf.

32
Gudykunst & Nishida, 2001). Thus, the communication dynamics in an alcoholic home
may result in low self-efficacy in children.
Non-alcoholic parents may have a very different influence on the development of
child self-efficacy. Interactions with the alcoholic parent are likely to be unpredictable
and a source of major anxiety for children who are trying to establish inferences on how
to interact with others (Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006; Reed, 2006). Amidst the uncertainty,
non-alcoholic parents may be able to provide predictable patterns of social interaction.
Consistent and positive interactions with the non-alcoholic parent may make it possible
for CoA to develop their social perspective-taking skills and in turn communicate
effectively (cf. Berger, 1997). Consistent communication from the non-alcoholic parent
could potentially provide the proper relational inferences necessary for the CoA to
develop a healthy level of self-efficacy.
Impulsivity as a Marker of Resilience
There is research to suggest that one’s underdeveloped ability to self-regulate is
evident in behavior; thus, I look to impulsive behaviors as another indicator of resilience.
Impulsivity refers to a lack of inhibition regardless of the consequences (DeYoung, 2011).
Recent research subscribes to the idea of impulsivity as a trait that appears to be related to
the entire spectrum of externalizing behaviors (DeYoung, 2011; Kreuger et al., 2002).
Externalizing behaviors describe the overarching umbrella for all outwardly motivated
behavioral issues, including aggression, delinquency, and inattention (Achenbach, 1991;
Bezdjian, Baker, Lozano, & Raine, 2009; Sher, 1991). Children who struggle with
impulse control are often demonstrating other behavioral problems such as attention and
aggression disorders (August, Realmuto, MacDonald, Nugent, & Crosby, 1996; Plutchik

33
& Van Praag, 1995), interpersonal problems (Hinshaw & Melnick, 1995), and learning
deficiencies (Hinshaw, 1992). Individuals who are capable of controlling their behavior
are viewed as positively adjusting to their environment, demonstrating flexibility and
resourceful adaptation (Block & Kremen, 1996; Diener & Kim, 2004; Eisenberg &
Spinrad, 2004). Research also suggests that youth participating in risk-taking at an early
age, such as substance use and aggression, are found to demonstrate more impulsive
behavior in the first years of life (Caspi & Silva, 1995). Taken together, adolescents who
demonstrate more control and less impulsive behavior may also express higher levels of
resilience.
Impulsivity is a complex concept that has left researchers debating the extent of
cognitive, biological, and environmental influences. To understand how impulsivity
serves to illustrate resilience, it is important to first address the cognitive features of
impulsivity. To begin, one’s personality involves higher-level and lower-level traits
(DeYoung, 2011). An example of a higher-level trait is introversion. The lower-level
traits for introversion may include communication apprehension, shyness, and being antisocial. Research on the hierarchy of traits led to the development of the Big Five, or the
most relevant features of personality that includes: Extraversion, Neuroticism,
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness/Intellect (John, Naumann, & Soto,
2008). Impulsivity has been considered a facet, or lower-level trait, of each dimension,
which reflects its complexity (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1977;
Goldberg & Rosolack, 1994; Hofstee, de Raad, & Goldberg, 1992; Markon, Krueger, &
Watson, 2005; Zuckerman, 2005).

34
One of the most substantive assessments of impulsivity in relation to the Big Five
structure considers four different types of impulsivity: urgency, lack of premeditation,
lack of perseverance, and sensation seeking (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001). Urgency refers
to the negative reactions individuals may have in response to a face-threatening encounter.
Individuals who demonstrate urgency are likely to participate in impulsive behaviors in
an effort to deal with a negative emotion regardless of the consequences (Whiteside &
Lynam, 2001). Lack of premeditation describes the absence of forethought prior to an
action or behavior. Researchers have long agreed that lack of premeditation is an
important representation of impulsivity, adding that the action may occur without concern
for potential consequences (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1977; Whiteside & Lynam, 2001). Lack
of perseverance refers to one’s inability to see a goal through to the end. This type of
impulsivity suggests poor self-discipline, particularly towards tasks that are difficult or
unexciting. Sensation seeking describes the appeal of thrill-seeking and risk-taking
behavior and is one of the most prominent references to impulsive behavior. This facet of
impulsivity encompasses two functions: (1) the enjoyment of exciting activities and (2)
the willingness to try new experiences regardless of the risk. Each type of impulsivity
may be linked with a particular psychopathology and manifest itself in a variety of
behaviors. For instance lack of perseverance may be affiliated with attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder as demonstrated by the difficulty to stay on task and ease of
distraction. Similarly, sensation seeking may manifest itself in a substance use disorder.
Thus, the four facets of impulsivity stem from overarching personality dimensions that
play a unique role in the development of various psychopathological disorders made
visible in a variety of behaviors.

35
The features of one’s environment also influence impulsive tendencies. Behavior
regulation begins at infancy as children adopt and adapt to family norms of interaction
(Kopp & Neufeld, 2003). Parent demonstrations of appropriate behavior, as well as
feedback regarding the child’s behavior all influence the development of behavior
regulation (Calkins, 1994). Early exposure to severe stressors such as parental neglect
and substance abuse are associated with adverse behavioral outcomes (Anda et al., 2006;
Middlebrooks & Audage, 2008; Shonkoff, Boyce, & McEwen, 2009). Epigenetic
research found that individuals who experienced maltreatment in childhood showed a
decrease in their stress response gene as evidenced by changes to their hippocampus
(biological influence), a crucial component of the brains limbic system that regulates
memory and spatial function (McGowan et al., 2009; Romer et al., 2010). As a result,
these individuals demonstrated externalizing problems when later confronted with
stressful stimuli. These findings suggest that experiences may have long-term
implications on biological and cognitive functioning that in turn affect proper behavior
regulation. Taken together, environmental experiences may impact the development of
proper behavior regulation thereby affecting self-control and promoting externalizing
behaviors.
Operationalizing impulsivity. Self-report and observational methods help to
measure the practice of impulsive behavior since it is both cognitive and behavioral in
nature. Parents will be asked to reflect on children’s impulsive behavior and interpersonal
interactions. Children will complete the same set of questions about their own behavioral
experiences. Self-report from parents will also be collected following the interaction to
assess impulsive behavior in conversation. Third party observations of the interaction will

36
examine the appropriateness of behavior and the attentiveness of the child. The
combination of both perspectives and observations of behavior allow for making
inferences about the existence of impulsivity and the extent of impulsive behaviors.
Communication patterns that regulate impulsivity. Interactions between parent
and child may be an important predictor of behavioral development. A lack of parental
responsiveness may negatively impact early childhood behaviors and play an important
role in the development of externalizing problems as children search for ways to gain
their parent’s attention and affection (Loukas, Fitzgerald, Zucker, & von Eye, 2001).
Early research on parent child interactions found a strong link between maternal stress
and lack of child nurturance, which may negatively impact brain development and
functioning (Meany, 2001; Olds et al., 1997). On the other hand, children who received
skill based training that emphasized reward of good behavior in an effort to minimize
impulse disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), reduced
impulsive tendencies and improved executive functioning (Barry & Welsh, 2007; Petras
et al., 2008).
Children growing up in families experiencing heightened levels of conflict have
also been known to engage in externalizing behaviors (Patterson & Capaldi, 1991).
Frequent exposure to conflict may teach children that aggressive behaviors and lashing
out are appropriate ways to express their displeasure. Children who demonstrate
externalizing behavior also tend to have negative emotions and poor regulation
(Eisenberg, Fabes, & Murphy, 1996). Children learn how to self-regulate by modeling the
behavior in their environment and their awareness of contextual demands (Posner &
Rothbart, 2000). Children who demonstrate effective self-regulation are more likely to

37
have positive interactions with family and peers (Eiden, Edwards, & Leonard, 2007).
Conversely, children who demonstrate externalizing problems are more likely to struggle
with peer interactions (Calkins, 1994; Campbell, 1994; Spira & Fischel, 2005). Thus,
interactions within the family may establish a norm for behavior that encourages
impulsivity.
Impulsivity among children of alcoholics. Behavioral problems are a common
outcome as a result of growing up in an alcoholic home. A common characteristic among
alcoholics is an increase in depressive symptoms (Regier et al., 1990). In families with
depressed parents, children are more likely to develop externalizing problems due to less
positive family interactions and more familial conflict (Campbell, March, Pierce, Ewing,
& Szumowski, 1991; Chassin, Rogosch, & Barrera, 1991; Billings & Moos, 1983;
Johnson & Jacob, 1995). Furthermore, the distress commonly experienced in families of
alcoholics may affect interactions between parent and child, such that they are less
involved and fail to enact discipline, thereby perpetuating the likelihood for negative
behavioral outcomes (Patterson, 1982; Patterson & Capaldi, 1991). Children of substance
abusing parents also commonly display underdeveloped emotional and attentional
regulatory abilities resulting in an increase in impulsivity (Cole, Michel, & Teti, 1994;
Fitzgerald et al., 1993; Tarter & Vanyukov, 1994). Thus, the conditions in families of
alcoholics have the potential to influence the adaptive or maladaptive impulses of CoA.
Conclusion
In this chapter, I reviewed the characteristics of families of alcoholics and
discussed general outcomes of children of alcoholics. I then introduced the concept of
resilience and described how emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and impulsivity are

38
markers of resilience. I also explained how each variable may operate in families more
generally and in families of alcoholics specifically, potentially resulting in both positive
and negative outcomes. Thus, the information provided begs the question, what makes
CoA resilient and how is it different compared to children of non-alcoholic parents?
Chapter three aims to answer that question by focusing on the features of parent-child
communication dynamics that may foster or inhibit resilience.

39
CHAPTER THREE
Families are essential to the growth and development of well-adjusted children
(Bowlby, 1988). In particular, communication between parents and children is
instrumental in children’s socialization and adjustment. There are a variety of theoretical
perspectives that help to characterize the role of family dynamics in shaping outcomes for
children. Two communication frameworks are especially salient for characterizing the
communication dynamics that predict adolescent resilience: Baumrind’s dimensions of
parental communication (1991) and Gottman’s (2001) emotion regulation theory.
Collectively, this chapter aims to identify how parents’ communication behavior
influences emotional, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes for children in families of
alcoholics compared to families of non-alcoholic parents.
Baumrind’s Dimensions of Parental Communication
Baumrind (1991) identified two dimensions for describing parental
communication behaviors towards children: responsiveness and control. Parental
responsiveness refers to verbal and nonverbal communication that is attentive to a child’s
needs and supportive of a child’s individuality (Peterson & Hann, 1999). Parental control
describes communication behaviors that firmly regulate children’s behavior and emotions.
The following paragraphs review the specific verbal and nonverbal behavior associated
with each dimension, the typology developed to assess parenting styles, and how each
dimension may influence adolescent resilience as demonstrated by their emotional,
cognitive, and behavioral outcomes.
To understand how each dimension may function in families it is important to
highlight their specific communication features beginning with responsiveness. Generally,

40
responsiveness refers to communication that provides warmth and support from parent to
child (Peterson & Hann, 1999). Vocal tone, or fluctuations in pitch and rate of speech, is
a way for parents to demonstrate responsiveness when interacting with their child. These
alterations in language enable parents to gain child attention and participation in language
practices (Segrin & Flora, 2011; Van Egeren & Barratt, 2004). Gaze is another form of
nonverbal communication that reflects responsive communication. Eye contact or gaze,
illustrates focus and care between parent and child. This type of responsiveness is
associated with more positive vocalizations and an increase in language acquirement of
children in their first years of life (Keller, Schoelmerich, & Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1988; Deak,
Flom, & Pick, 2000). Parental touch also signifies responsive communication. Touch
may include handholding or a simple embrace and has a strong influence on the
emotional outcomes of children (Hertenstein, 2002). Verbal behaviors also demonstrate
responsiveness. Parents who are consistent, direct, and sincere in their communication
with children minimize the anxieties that may occur throughout child development and
into adulthood (Segrin & Flora, 2011). Thus, responsive communication has the potential
to facilitate healthy development and long-term well-being.
The control dimension offers a separate set of distinct verbal and nonverbal
communication behaviors. Research on parent-child interaction indicates that there are
two types of controlling communication, psychological and behavioral. Psychological
control describes the parents’ control over emotions in an effort to change child behavior
(Aunola & Nurmi, 2005; Barber, 1996). There are three forms of psychological control
that include: love withdrawal, disappointment, and intrusiveness. Love withdrawal
describes parental threats of reducing love and affection in an effort to punish the child

41
(Hoffman, 1980). Parents may do so by threatening neglect or abandonment.
Disappointment is an effective form of control with children who seek parent approval
(Segrin & Flora, 2011). Parental intrusiveness refers to the over-involvement of parents,
which enables them to manipulate emotions and reduce child independence (Barber &
Harmon, 2002; Peterson & Hann, 1999). Behavioral control is communicated through
physical and/or explicit demands (Barber, 1996; Galambos, Barker, & Almeida, 2003).
This type of control emphasizes the parents’ power over the children instead of using
reason to seek compliance (Baumrind, 1995). Verbal examples of behavioral control may
include “go to bed” or “because I said so.” Hitting, grabbing, or spanking are examples of
nonverbal behavioral control. Children exposed to psychological and behavioral control
are more likely to develop low self-esteem, demonstrate less obedience, and in some
extreme cases become substance abusers (Garbarino & Gilliam, 1980; Grolnick et al.,
2002). Thus, behavioral control may have more adverse implications for child
development and well-being.
A combination of these dimensions led to the development of a parenting style
typology consisting of four parenting styles: authoritative, permissive, authoritarian, and
neglecting (Baumrind, 1991; Macobby & Martin, 1983). Authoritative parents are high in
responsiveness and control, demonstrating a balance of both nurturance and discipline
(Baumrind, 1995). Parents high in responsiveness and low in control are considered
permissive parents, where nurturance is emphasized and few limits are placed on child
behavior. Authoritarian parents are high in control and low in responsiveness. These
parents enforce structure and demonstrate lower levels of empathy (Baumrind, 1971).
Lastly, neglecting parents are low in responsiveness and control, demonstrating an almost

42
indifference towards the needs of their children and are often emotionally unavailable
(Feldman, 2009). Baumrind’s typology provides a good framework for viewing
individual parenting styles rather than communication patterns of the entire family
system.
Research on families of alcoholics suggests that there may be substantial
differences in the ways that alcoholic and non-alcoholic parents communicate with their
children. In one study researchers found that each parent demonstrated a different
communication orientation (Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006). Alcoholic parents demonstrated
authoritative parenting and expected children to conform to their communication
behavior and beliefs. The non-alcoholic parent however, embraced a conversation
orientation where children participated in decision-making and their individuality was
supported. Another study established similar findings, in which paternal communication
orientations were positively associated with child eating disorders, whereas maternal
communication had no adverse effect (Miller-Day & Marks, 2006). Along these same
lines, alcoholic and non-alcoholic parents may demonstrate different parenting styles of
responsiveness and control, thereby influencing the resilience outcomes of children. To
examine how responsiveness and control may operate in families of alcoholics compared
to families of non-alcoholic parents and the implications of these parenting styles on
adolescent outcomes, the following sections introduce responsiveness and control as
predictors of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral markers of resilience.
Parental Responsiveness and Control as Predictors of Adolescents’ Emotional
Resilience

43
Exposure to responsive parental communication may be constructive in
promoting children’s resilience through emotion regulation. Parents who demonstrate
responsive communication patterns encourage children to self-regulate and develop
independence (Baumrind, 1991). One way parents demonstrate this is through their vocal
tone. As parents alter their communication style to elicit engagement with their child, the
vocal alterations illustrate expression of emotion (Trainor, Austin, & Desjardins, 2000).
In addition, demonstrations of affection through gaze and touch promote expression of
feelings and encourage supportive interactions (Hertenstein, 2002; Keller, Schoelmerich,
& Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1988). Children of responsive parents often exhibit healthy emotion
regulation by demonstrating effective support-seeking strategies and positive emotions.
Demonstrations of sympathy and problem-solving attempts from parents were positively
associated with lower levels of anxiety and distress in children (Eisenberg, Fabes,
Schaller, Carlo, & Miller, 1991). Parents who suggest different ways of managing a
situation facilitate better coping skills in children (Kliewer, Fernow, & Miller, 1996).
Taken together, this evidence suggests that responsive parental communication may help
adolescents develop better emotion regulation ability and more resilience. Thus, I
propose the following hypothesis:
H1:

Parental responsiveness is positively associated with adolescents’ emotion
regulation ability.

On the other hand, parents who assert more control in their communication may
inhibit a child’s ability to regulate emotion and behavior (Houck & Lecuyer-Maus, 2004).
Children exposed to an authoritarian parenting style and extreme control have the
potential to develop over-arousal or poor regulation abilities (Calkins, 1994). Negative

44
behavior from a parent such as psychological or behavioral control, has been associated
with a slower recovery of vagal tone following stressful situations (Calkins, Smith, Gill,
& Johnson, 1998). In families of alcoholics, expression of feelings and affection for other
family members is often suppressed (Jones & Houts, 1992). As a result, families of
alcoholics encounter high levels of conflict and difficulty expressing positive emotion
(Johnson, 2001). These studies indicate that family environments characterized by high
levels of parental control may discourage healthy emotion regulation for adolescents.
Based on these assumptions the following hypothesis is presented:
H2:

Parental control is negatively associated with adolescents’ emotion
regulation ability.

There is evidence to suggest that families of alcoholics demonstrate less
responsive communication and more control than families of non-alcoholic parents.
Characteristics of families of alcoholics include explosive and inflexible discipline, along
with low supervision and involvement (Lam et al., 2007; Stanger et al., 2004). The lack
of involvement and rigidity present in families of alcoholics may make it difficult for
CoA to express emotions and receive support, which may lead to higher levels of stress
and emotional reactivity (Bolger & Amarel, 2007; Terry, Rawle, & Callan, 1995).
Therefore, the predicted associations may differ for adolescents with an alcoholic parent
versus those without an alcoholic parent. Thus, I propose the following research
questions:
R1:

Does a family’s alcohol status moderate associations between emotion
regulation and parents’ responsiveness and control?

45
Parental Responsiveness and Control as Predictors of Adolescents’ Cognitive
Resilience
Parent communication style plays a large role in children’s cognitive development.
For example responsive parenting promotes positive self-esteem in children (Noller,
1995). When children express concern or unease, a responsive parent counters with
assurances that can bolster self-confidence (Segrin & Flora, 2011). The encouragement
and praise that children receive for their accomplishments contribute to the belief that
they can accomplish their goals. Thus, these types of positive interactions between parent
and child promote healthy levels of self-efficacy in children (Bandura, 1997; Meece,
1997). Furthermore, when families encourage independence and skill-building children
are exposed to a variety of experiences that add to their body of knowledge, thereby
increasing self-efficacy (Meece, 1997). Parent-child interactions that lack this type of
engagement may have the opposite effect resulting in lower levels of child self-efficacy
(Bandura, 1997). Taken together, the following hypothesis is presented:
H3:

Parental responsiveness is positively associated with adolescents’ selfefficacy.

A controlling communication environment may have a very different influence on
child outcomes. Children who experience love withdrawal from their parents often report
feeling guilty, have low self-esteem, and struggle to trust others (Grolnick et al., 2002;
Maccoby & Martin, 1983). Over-involvement from parents may affect how children view
their own abilities, potentially resulting in feelings of incompetence (Grolnick et al.,
2002). Moreover, high levels of control in parenting produce depressive symptoms in
children (Baumrind, 1971; Feldman, 2009). Children who have depressive symptoms are

46
unlikely to have confidence in their ability to achieve their goals and will have low selfefficacy. To explore this further, the following hypothesis is presented:
H4:

Parental control is negatively associated with adolescents’ self-efficacy.

The often volatile environment experienced in families of alcoholics may impede
parents’ ability to demonstrate responsive communication and instead require that they
rely on strict discipline and rule enforcement to maintain family function (Lam et al.,
2007; Stanger et al., 2004). Given that the environment may be more hostile in families
of alcoholics, it is possible that CoA experience self-efficacy differently than families of
non-alcoholic parents. As a result of the dysfunction and poor parent-child interaction
many CoA may struggle with poor self-esteem and low levels of depression (Hussong &
Chassin, 1997; Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006), which may render CoA unable to recognize
their full potential in accomplishing small tasks and larger goals. Thus, the following
research question is proposed:
R2:

Does a family’s alcohol status moderate associations between self-efficacy
and parents’ responsiveness and control?

Parental Responsiveness and Control as Predictors of Adolescents’ Behavioral
Resilience
Responsive communication from a parent plays a large role in shaping children’s
behavioral outcomes. Toddlers of parents who were responsive, discussed emotions
openly, and provided support as well as independence, were more capable of self-control
and attentiveness than toddlers exposed to an insensitive parenting style (Bernier, Carlson,
& Whipple, 2010; Calkins & Johnson, 1998). Children with insensitive parents were
more likely to exhibit distress during activities that asked the children to delay

47
gratification, such that they acted out more than children with responsive parents did.
These same environments also have implications on brain development in children,
hindering the biological circuitry necessary to exercise healthy self-control (Tarullo,
Obradović, & Gunnar, 2009). Taken together, this research suggests that resilient
behavioral outcomes are more common under conditions of responsive parental
communication and that impulsive and externalizing behaviors are more likely with
unresponsive parents. Therefore, I present the following hypothesis:
H5:

Parental responsiveness is negatively associated with adolescents’
impulsivity.

A healthy balance of both responsiveness and control has the potential to produce
positive academic, behavioral, and self-confidence outcomes (Domitrovich & Bierman,
2001; Mize & Petit, 1997; Segrin & Flora, 2011). Conversely, parents who emphasize
control generate negative outcomes for children, including dependency, passive
aggressiveness, and increased levels of aggression (Baumrind, 1995; Miller-Day & Lee,
2001; Segrin & Flora, 2011; Wilson & Whipple, 2001). Withdraw behaviors are also
common in children from families that utilize parental control (Baumrind, 1971; Feldman,
2009). Along these lines, children may show more impulsivity when they encounter
controlling parental communication. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H6:

Parental control is positively associated with adolescents’ impulsivity.

Impulsivity may develop differently in children with an alcoholic parent
compared to children with non-alcoholic parents due to the parent-child interactions.
Parenting behaviors in families of alcoholics may be less responsive in nature based on
CoA’s reports of parental neglect (Schade, 2006). Neglectful environments may impede a

48
child’s ability to develop self-control due to the lack of interaction and demonstration of
appropriate behavior (Shackman, Wismer Fries, & Pollak, 2008). As a result, CoA may
develop poor internalizing and externalizing behaviors (Hill et al., 2008; Shuckit et al.,
2007). Based on this reasoning, the following research question is presented:
R3:

Does a family’s alcohol status moderate associations between impulsivity
and parents’ responsiveness and control
Gottman’s Emotion Regulation Theory

Another framework that is applied in this study is Emotion Regulation Theory
(Gottman, 2001). From a meta-emotion perspective, this theory suggests that parents
address children’s emotional experiences in one of two ways during interaction: emotion
coaching and emotion dismissing (Cupach & Olson, 2006; Gottman, Katz, & Hooven,
1996). Emotion coaching involves expressions of empathy and views children’s
communication of emotion as an opportunity for parents to teach their children about
appropriate and inappropriate emotional reactions. Emotion dismissing encompasses
criticizing or scolding children for their experience and expression of emotion.
The theory originates from a series of detailed interviews with parents about
emotion. Analysis of the interviews found that parents exhibit emotion coaching
communication in several ways: (1) parents would demonstrate awareness of their child’s
emotions, even subtle expressions of emotion; (2) expression of emotion was viewed as
an opportunity to teach the child how to appropriately address the emotions being
experienced; (3) parents assisted children in the vocabulary necessary to describe their
emotions; (4) parents would attempt to empathize and demonstrate understanding of the
child’s emotions; and (5) parent and child would work together to address the emotion,

49
including goal setting and limiting inappropriate behavior (Cupach & Olson, 2006;
Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). On the other hand, emotion dismissing communication
was evident by: (1) parents’ inability to describe emotions; (2) lack of awareness of
subtle expressions of emotion; and (3) hostile reactions to negative emotions.
Each type of meta-emotion encompasses specific parenting behaviors. Emotion
coaching parents often adopt scaffolding/praising behaviors (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven,
1997). Scaffolding/praising refers to an engaged and warm teaching style between parent
and child that utilizes structure when offering support. A parent will introduce a child to a
task with some guidance, encourage their independence in completing the task, and then
praise the child for their successes. Emotion dismissing parents employ derogatory
behaviors. Derogatory parenting does not look for teaching opportunities but instead
embraces opportunities for criticism. In this form of parenting, parents may express
frustration when working on a task with their child and complete the task for them. In
some cases a child’s mistake leads to ridicule and disparagement (Cupach & Olson,
2006).
There are a number of outcomes affiliated with an emotion coaching parenting
style. Children growing up in an emotion coaching environment demonstrate prosocial
skills, academic competence, attentiveness, and good health (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven,
1997). The reason for these outcomes is the facilitation of emotional intelligence by
parents (Goleman, 1995; Salovey & Mayer, 1990). A high emotional intelligence
demonstrates the ability to regulate emotion (Cupach & Olson, 2006). Thus, when
presented with a stressful situation these children are much more capable of regulating
themselves and appropriately managing their emotions and behaviors.

50
Emotion coaching communication also influences a child’s regulatory make-up.
Children with emotion coaching parents have a higher basal vagal tone, which correlates
with an ability to be attentive and regulate emotion (Fox, 1989; Porges, 1973). A higher
vagal tone makes it possible to respond faster to stimuli, as well as returning to a calming
state, resulting in a faster recovery when confronted with stressful situations (Gottman &
Katz, 2002). Emotion coaching children also appear more capable at suppressing vagal
tone, or regulating their emotion, requiring less down regulation from parents when the
child behaves inappropriately or becomes overly excited (Gottman & Katz, 2002;
Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). As a result, children exposed to some form of emotion
coaching are found to be better equipped to handle a stressful environment such as high
levels of conflict (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Thus, this type of communication
can produce a biological buffer to adverse situations, thereby facilitating resilience.
Emotion Coaching and Emotion Dismissing as Predictors of Adolescents’ Emotional
Resilience
Children are better able to manage their emotions when exposed to emotion
coaching parenting. Children with parents that express acceptance of emotions and take a
teaching approach to managing emotion demonstrate successful regulation (Eisenberg,
Spinrad, & Eggum, 2010; Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). Research on mothers who
use assertive power strategies to address their child’s emotions found a decrease in child
patience for delay of gratification (Houck & Lecuyer-Maus, 2004), whereas parents who
attempted to teach their child about emotions by using a balance of control and empathy
techniques found an increase in child patience. Adolescents who have at least one parent
that encourages open communication have been found to adjust more successfully when

51
exposed to adverse situations (Moe, Johnson, & Wade, 2007; Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006).
Taken together, these findings endorse the following hypothesis:
H7:

Parents’ emotion coaching behavior is positively associated with
adolescents’ emotion regulation.

The opposite result may occur in children growing up with a parent that
demonstrates emotion dismissing behavior. Emotion dismissing communication entails
avoidance of negative emotion, difficulty describing emotion, and lack of awareness for
lower intensity emotions (Lukenheimer, Shields, & Cortina, 2007). Children exposed to
this type of parental communication often demonstrate poorer emotion regulation
(Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1996). Parents who avoid discussing negative emotions with
their children may inhibit healthy emotional development making it difficult for children
to regulate themselves. Thus, the following prediction is made:
H8:

Parents’ emotion dismissing behavior is negatively associated with an
adolescent’s emotion regulation.

There is evidence to suggest that alcoholic families may pay less attention to the
emotional needs of children and, instead, demonstrate a more emotion dismissing
communication behavior. In families of alcoholics, children are often exposed to neglect
and a fluctuation between messages of warmth and rejection (Schade, 2006; Woititz,
1985). Previous studies document parenting practices in families of alcoholics as being
low in supervision and involvement as well as offering minimal nurturance (Lam et al.,
2007; Stanger et al., 2004). Members of the alcoholic family, including children, often
report expressing fewer feelings and having less regard for other family members (Jones
& Houts, 1992). This type of dysfunctional environment suggests that CoA are more

52
likely to experience an emotion dismissing parenting style and, in turn, a higher potential
for negative emotional outcomes. With that in mind, I present the following research
question:
R4:

Does a family’s alcohol status moderate associations between emotion
regulation and parents’ emotion coaching and emotion dismissing
behavior?

Emotion Coaching and Emotion Dismissing as Predictors of Adolescents’ Cognitive
Resilience
Supportive communication may also facilitate positive cognitive outcomes for
adolescents. Emotion coaching parents promote expression of feelings and facilitate
healthy ways of addressing both positive and negative emotions (Hertenstein, 2002).
Children who learn to successfully regulate emotion are capable of remaining calm
during stressful situations (Lukenheimer, Shields, & Cortina, 2007). As a result, these
children develop prosocial skills and academic competence (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven,
1997). As children gain experience regulating their emotions in response to adverse
circumstances, they are likely to build confidence in their ability to cope with a variety of
negative experiences. Thus, emotion coaching parents are likely to promote self-efficacy
to the extent that they position children to experience success in their emotional and
behavioral regulation. Based on this assumption I propose the following hypothesis:
H9:

Parents’ emotion coaching behavior is positively associated with
adolescents’ self-efficacy.

Emotion dismissing communication has been linked to poor emotion regulation
(Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1996). Children who struggle to regulate emotion often

53
resort to distraction or rumination (Gross & Thompson, 2006). Distraction describes the
shift in attention to something other than the trigger of the emotional stimulation (Stifter
& Moyer, 1991). Rumination is the intense focus on feelings that are elicited by the
stimulation (Wegner & Bargh, 1998). Depressive symptoms are more severe and last
longer when individuals ruminate on sad experiences (Just & Alloy, 1997; NolenHoeksema, 2000). Similarly, depressive symptoms reduce perceptions of one’s selfefficacy (Muris, 2002). Thus, the cognitive and emotional outcomes that correlate with
emotion dismissing behavior are likely to diminish adolescents’ confidence in their
ability to communicate effectively. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H10:

Parents’ emotion dismissing behavior is negatively associated with
adolescents’ self-efficacy.

Families of alcoholics often experience high levels of conflict and stress
(Straussner & Fewell, 2011). As a result, parents often neglect the needs of their children
and communicate with less sensitivity (Das Eiden, Chavez, & Leonard, 1999; Schade,
2006). CoA growing up in this environment are at an increased risk for developing
depressive symptoms, high levels of anxiety, low self-esteem, and poor social
competence (Eiden et al., 2009; Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006). These conditions may make
it difficult for CoA to develop efficacy in the face of difficult circumstances, as compared
to children without an alcoholic parent. Thus, I propose the following research question:
RQ5: Does a family’s alcohol status moderate associations between self-efficacy
and parents’ emotion coaching and emotion dismissing behavior?
Emotion Coaching and Emotion Dismissing as Predictors of Adolescents’
Behavioral Resilience

54
The management of emotions as demonstrated by the parent can also have
implications for the behavior demonstrated by adolescents. Emotion coaching
communication promotes positive attachment bonds between parent and child (Waters et
al., 2010) and secure attachment between parent and child has been found to promote
effective self-regulation (Gilliom, Shaw, Beck, Schonberg, & Lukon, 2002). Children
with emotion coaching parents demonstrate less aggression and fewer behavioral
problems, even when exposed to high levels of conflict (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven,
1996; Gottman & Katz, 1995; Katz & Gottman, 1997). Children often model the behavior
of their parents (Denham, 1998; Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998); therefore,
exposure to positive interactions may reduce the likelihood for children to develop
externalizing problems such as impulsivity. Along this line of reasoning, the following
hypothesis is proposed:
H11:

Parents’ emotion coaching behavior is negatively associated with
adolescents’ impulsivity.

Conversely, exposure to emotion dismissing communication may increase the
likelihood for externalizing problems. Emotion dismissing parents may exhibit frustration
or avoidance when a child expresses negative emotions (Cupach & Olson, 2006). When
parents display more anger in their interactions, children tend to exhibit more problems
associated with externalizing behaviors as they attempt to model their parents’ behaviors
(Denham et al., 2000). Similarly, adolescents demonstrate an increase in negative
behaviors when parents avoid or fail to acknowledge children’s expression of negative
emotion (Eisenberg, Fabes, & Murphy, 1996). Given that children tend to act out when
their parents attempt to suppress emotional expression, I expect that emotion dismissing

55
behavior is associated with increased impulsivity. Therefore, I present the following
hypothesis:
H12:

Parents’ emotion dismissing behavior is positively associated with
adolescents’ impulsivity.

Given that the features of an alcoholic home often demonstrate emotion
dismissing parenting behaviors, CoA may be more prone to impulsive behavior than
children growing up in families without an alcohol use disorder. The impulsive and
aggressive behaviors commonly found among CoA may be the result of insensitive
parenting (Cole, Michel, & Teti, 1994; Fitzgerald et al., 1993; Hussong & Chassin, 1997;
Tarter & Vanyukov, 1994). A lack of instruction in terms of how to properly manage
emotions and behave in an appropriate manner may result in CoA acting out more than
children of non-alcoholic parents. Based on this reasoning, the following research
question is presented:
RQ6: Does a family’s alcohol status moderate associations between impulsivity
and parents’ emotion coaching and emotion dismissing behavior?
Conclusion
In this chapter, I presented two theoretical frameworks to guide this research:
Baumrind’s dimensions of parental communication and Gottman’s emotion regulation
theory. I then reviewed how the communication features of each construct have the
potential to facilitate or hinder resilience in terms of emotion, cognition, and behavior. In
doing so, I proposed several hypotheses that explore the relationship between specific
types of communication and the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral markers of
resilience in this study. I also posed several research questions that query the extent to

56
which the predicted associations may differ for children of alcoholics versus children of
nonalcoholic parents. The next chapter describes the methods and procedures of a study
that was designed to investigate these hypotheses and research questions.

57
CHAPTER FOUR
In an effort to examine how parent-child communication predicts resilience
among children of alcoholic parents and children of non-alcoholic parents, the proposed
study utilized a combination of methods, including self-report, observational, and
physiological measures. A total of 60 parent-adolescent dyads, 30 from families of nonalcoholic parents and 30 from families with alcoholic parents, participated in the study.
Dyads from non-alcoholic families were recruited by posting announcements about the
study in various social media platforms, posting informative flyers (see Appendix A)
about the study in local businesses, and relying on snowball sampling by having
participants tell other families about the study. I recruited parent-adolescent dyads from
alcoholic families through a variety of organizations and agencies in New Jersey, Texas,
and California that are geared towards high-risk families (Integrity House, Al-Anon
World Services, New Hope Outpatient Center, PRAB Family Success Center, National
Council on Family Relations, and the Middlesex County Coalition for Healthy
Communities).
Eligibility for the non-alcoholic parent-adolescent dyad required that (a) the
adolescent child be between the ages of 12 and 19; (b) parents were either married and
both live in the same home with the child, or unmarried but share custody of the child and
visitation with the non-residential parent occurred at least once a month; (c) both the
parent and the adolescent speak, read, and write in English; and (d) the adolescent was
not taking medication for any emotional or psychological disorders. The alcoholic parentadolescent dyads eligibility required that (a) the adolescent child be between the ages of
12 and 19; (b) at least one of the adolescent’s parents identified as an alcoholic by either

58
themselves or the other parent; (c) parents were either married and both live in the same
home with the child, or parents were unmarried but share custody of the child and
visitation with the non-residential parent occurred at least once a month; (d) both the
parent and the adolescent speak, read, and write in English; and (e) the adolescent was
not taking medication for any emotional or psychological disorders. For families with an
alcoholic parent, the parent who participated could be either the alcoholic parent or the
nonalcoholic parent. Both the parent and the adolescent completed pre-interaction selfreport measures, two video-taped interactions, and post-interaction self-report measures.
In addition, the adolescents wore a heart rate monitor for certain portions of the study to
measure variation in vagal tone.
Sample
The sample consisted of 60 parent-adolescent dyads, 30 from families with at
least one alcoholic parent and 30 from families with no alcoholic parent (see Table 1).
Among the adolescents who participated, there were 24 males (40%) and 35 females
(58.3%) with one adolescent declining to report. The mean age of adolescent participants
was 14.8 years (SD = 1.93), with a range of 12 to 19 years. The majority of adolescents
were Caucasian (70%), followed by African American (10%), Hispanic/Latino (6.7%),
Asian (1.7%), Native American (1.7%), and Other (6.7%). Two adolescents’ declined to
report (3.3%).
Of the parents who participated, there were 14 males (23.3%) and 45 females
(75%) with one parent who declined to report. The mean age of parent participants was
46.62 years (SD = 7.76), with a range of 27 to 63 years. The majority of parents were
Caucasian (80%), followed by African American (10%), Hispanic/Latino (8.3%), and

59
Indian (1.7%). In terms of parent education, 11.7% completed high school, 8.3% had
some college, 13.3% had a 2-year college degree, 25% had a 4-year college degree,
26.7% had a master’s degree, 3.3% had an advanced degree in their field (e.g., Ph.D.,
M.D., etc.), and 10% reported other. One parent declined to report their highest level of
education. For current household income, 8.3% reported less than $25,000, 10% reported
$26,000 to $50,000, 18.3% reported $51,000 to $75,000, 10% reported $76,000 to
$100,000, 6.7% reported $101,000 to $125,000, and the majority of families had a
household income of more than $126,000 (43.3%), with two families declining to report.
When asked about the relationship status of parents, the majority reported being involved
in a committed relationship with the child’s other parent (85%). Among parents who
were romantically involved with the child’s other parent, 3.3% claimed to be dating but
not married, 80% claimed to be married, 3.3% claimed to be in a common law marriage,
and 13.3% declined to report. For the 15% of participants not involved with their child’s
other parent 37.5% reported being separated, 37.5% reported divorce, 12.5% reported
being widowed, and 12.5% reported never having a committed relationship.
In the dyads from families with an alcoholic parent, the participating parent
identified as an alcoholic in 6 dyads and the non-participating parent was identified as the
alcoholic in 13 dyads. In 11 dyads, both parents had an alcohol use disorder. The
alcoholic parent(s) consumed an average of 23.5 alcoholic beverages in a typical week.
Of the parents who participated in both groups, the majority reported never being in
recovery for a substance abuse problem (81.6%). Of the parents who reported being in
recovery or that their child’s other parent was in recovery (15%), the mean length of
recovery was 6 to 10 years.

60
Procedures
Dyads who were eligible participated at the interaction laboratory in the School of
Communication and Information at Rutgers University, or at a public location made by
arrangement and with IRB approval. Prior to participating in the study, parent and
adolescent dyads were screened for medication that may affect regulatory behaviors and
asked to refrain from caffeine, exercise, and smoking at least 2 hours prior to the
interaction, and instructed to eat something at least two hours prior to the interaction
(Udo et al., 2009). Upon arrival to the laboratory, the parent and adolescent provided
informed consent to participate in the study (see Appendix B & C), then the parent and
the adolescent independently completed questionnaires about perceptions of the family
and communication behaviors within the family. Adolescents were asked additional
questions about their resilience, ability to regulate emotion and behavior, and their
feelings toward each parent. The parent was also asked to report on their own and the
other parent’s health behaviors regarding alcohol, perceptions of their child’s resilience,
and perceptions of their communication with the child. The parent and adolescent
completed the online questionnaires on computers in separate rooms, on iPads in separate
rooms, or filled out a hardcopy version of the questionnaire if that was their preference.
The researcher was available to assist participants with any questions they had during the
survey. Prior to the start of the study, two adolescents aged 12 and 13 were each paid $20
to complete the surveys and provide feedback to ensure that the survey items were
appropriate for the age group of our sample and easy to understand.
After completing the surveys, the parent and the adolescent were asked to
participate in an interaction task where they discussed a happy experience and an

61
unhappy experience (Afifi, Granger, Denes, Joseph, & Aldeis, 2011; Fivush, 1994). Prior
to the interaction, adolescents were asked to think of three happy experiences and three
unhappy experiences that had happened to them within the past two weeks and write
these experiences down on separate note cards as possible discussion topics (McLaren &
Pederson, 2014). If the adolescent could not think of anything occurring in the past two
weeks, they were instructed to write down an experience from any point in time. They
were then asked to pick one experience from each topic, happy and unhappy, to discuss
with their parent. The order of the happy and unhappy topic conversations were
alternated at random to avoid ordering effects. A timer was set for the interaction
allowing for 5 minutes of discussion on each topic.
Prior to the start of the interaction, adolescents were asked to wear a small sensor
(or plethysmagraph) on their pointer finger or ear lobe to measure heart beat pulses
during the interactions. Adolescents were asked to minimize movement upon application
of the sensor. Following completion of the pre-interaction survey, a baseline measure of
heart rate was collected to familiarize participants with the heart rate measuring process
prior to the interaction. Following each interaction, the adolescent was asked to sit quietly
for 5 minutes wearing the heart rate sensor to obtain a measure of heart rate variability.
Interactions were video-taped to later be coded for the dimensions of responsiveness,
control, emotion coaching, and emotion dismissing behavior on the part of the parent and
positive/negative emotional expression and inappropriate/appropriate behavior on the part
of the adolescent.
Following each interaction, the parent and the adolescent completed a brief survey
about their perceptions of the interaction, in terms of whether or not the interaction was

62
realistic to how they typically communicate, as well as their feelings during the
conversation. After all study elements were completed, the dyad was debriefed and
compensated for their time. The parent and adolescent each received a $50 VISA gift
card for their participation.1
Measures
This study employed a range of self-report, observational, and physiological
measures to assess hypotheses. The pre-interaction and post-interaction surveys included
a variety of closed-ended scales to assess the variables of interest. Following data
collection, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted for all scales (Hunter & Gerbing,
1982). The criteria for a good fitting structure were set at χ2/df < 3.0, confirmatory fit
index (CFI) > .90, and root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) < .10 (Kline,
1998). After confirming unidimensionality, composite variables were created for each
scale for subsequent analyses (Carle & Chassin, 2004). Based on a sample size of 60
dyads and significance tests set at α = .05 for two-tailed tests, power to detect small
effects (r = .10) was .12, power to detect medium effects (r = .30) was .67, and power to
detect large effects (r = .50) exceeded .99 (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). In
addition to self-report measures, I employed a physiological measure of heart rate
variability as an indicator of emotion regulation. The interactions were coded by a team
of trained research assistants to evaluate the features of conversation that are of interest in
this study. Lists of the individual items for each scale and instructions for coders for each
feature of conversation are presented in the Appendices.
Pre-interaction Measures for Parent

63
Parents were asked to complete surveys consisting of demographic information
and descriptive information about the family, followed by scales designed to measure the
degree of their own and their partner’s substance abuse, parental communication behavior,
and perceptions of their child’s emotional, cognitive, and behavioral coping (see
Appendix D).
Perceptions of child’s emotion regulation. The parent’s assessment of the
adolescent’s emotion regulation was measured using the Emotion Regulation Checklist
(ERC; Shields & Cicchetti, 1997). The 24-item measure was intended for use by parents
and teachers to evaluate a child’s ability to regulate emotion. The 5-point scale (1 =
rarely/never like this child, 5 = almost always like this child) asks parents to respond to
statements regarding their child’s general expression of emotion (e.g., “Is a cheerful
child,” “Is empathetic towards others; shows concern when others are upset or
distressed”). In previous studies, this measure has demonstrated high reliability on both
the positive emotion regulation and negative emotion regulation subscales. In a study of
emotional competence and classroom adjustment among low-income preschoolers, the
scale showed reliability scores of α = .83 for positive emotion regulation and α = .92 for
negative dysregulation (Miller et al., 2006). Another study that assessed emotion
regulation in family interaction tasks found similar reliability results with positive
emotion regulation α = .83 and emotional negativity α = .96 (Lunkenheimer, Shields, &
Cortina, 2007). Given the length of the survey in this study, I used a subset of 16 items
from this scale focused on general emotion regulation to prevent cognitive exhaustion. I
also employed a 5-point scale instead of a 4-point scale to be consistent with other scales

64
in the survey. Scores closer to 5 indicate poor emotion regulation (M = 1.84, SD = .52, α
= .77, χ2/df = 1.16 CFI = .96, RMSEA = .05).
Parent’s perceptions of child’s cognitive competence. To evaluate cognitive
processes of the adolescent, parents were asked to complete the Social Competence Scale
(Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2002). The 10-item assessment inquires
about the adolescent’s prosocial skills and emotion regulation, with a total competence
score resulting from combining the two subscales. The assessment asks parents about
how their child responds to a situation using a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = very well;
e.g., “My child copes well with failure,” “My child can accept things not going his/her
way”). This scale has typically been measured among elementary school students but
demonstrated temporal stability across ages over time. At the preschool level among both
normative and high risk samples, the emotion regulation subscale demonstrated a
reliability of α = .84 and prosocial skills subscale with a reliability of α = .89 (Gouley,
Brotman, & Huang, 2008). Another study examining social-emotional and literacy
interventions for school-based programs found a combined reliability score of α = .97
across four waves of participants (Jones, Brown, & Aber, 2011). In this study, results
indicated a combined reliability that was acceptable across the 10-item scale (M = 4.14,
SD = .61, α = .80, χ2/df = 1.46, CFI = .96, RMSEA = .08).
Parent’s perceptions of child’s behavior. Parents were also asked to evaluate
child behavior using the Impulsivity Scale for Children (ISC; Tsukayama, Duckworth, &
Kim, 2011). The 8-item measure assesses schoolwork impulsivity and interpersonal
impulsivity as well as an overall measure of impulsivity from both parent and adolescent
perspectives. The assessment operates on a 5-point scale (1 = almost never, 5 = at least

65
once a day) asking how often the adolescent did the following during the past year (e.g.,
“My child interrupted other people while they were talking,” “My child lost his/her
temper”). Parents who rate their child higher on the scale present a child with higher
impulsivity. In testing this scale, previous studies found internal reliability ranging from
α = .78 to α = .94 (Duckworth, Kim, & Tsukayama, 2012). In another test of the scale’s
reliability, the self-report measure was assessed from individual, parent, and teacher
perspectives. Results indicated acceptable reliability at α = .78 for children, α = .85 for
parents, and α = .93 for teachers (Duckworth, Quinn, & Tsukayama, 2012). The
reliability of the scale in this study was slightly lower than what has been achieved in
previous studies, but still in the acceptable range (M = 2.40, SD = .77, α = .77, χ2/df = .51,
CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .00).
Parent perceptions of responsiveness and control. Aunola and Nurmi’s (2005)
Parenting Style Questionnaire (PSQ) and Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, and Hart’s (2001)
Parenting Style and Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) were combined to create a
measure of parental perceptions of responsiveness and control. On a 7-point scale (1 =
strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) parents were asked to rate their level of agreement
with 10-items for responsiveness (e.g., “I talk it over and reason with my child when
he/she misbehaves,” “I encourage my child to talk about trouble he/she experiences”) and
8-items for control (e.g., “My child must learn that there are rules in our family,” “When
my child is crying, it is best if I don’t rush to comfort him/her”). The PSQ assesses
parental affection and behavioral and psychological control by pulling items from earlier
scales on parenting practices (see Barber, 1996; Baumrind, 1991; Maccoby & Martin,
1983; Roberts, Block, & Block, 1984; Schaefer, 1965). Tests of the PSQ found

66
acceptable levels of reliability for all three dimensions across both mothers and fathers,
for affection α = .88 and α = .86, for behavioral control α = .72 and α = .72, and for
psychological control α = .79 and α = .80 (Aunola & Nurmi, 2005). A study attempting to
target parenting practices to increase efficacy in interventions found the 32-item scale
reliable for all three dimensions of the scale, authoritative α = .82, authoritarian α = .78,
and permissive α = .76 (Hubbs-Tait, Kennedy, Page, Topham, & Harrist, 2008) The
original PSDQ measure consisted of 62-items and has been scaled down in various
studies to a 32-item measure. Since it was combined with the PSQ scale for this study
only 8-items from the 32-item scale were incorporated. These items were selected based
on the statements reference to parental control (Responsiveness: M = 2.34, SD = .70,
alpha = .69, χ2/df = 1.11, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .04; Control: M = 4.84, SD = .99, alpha
= .71, χ2/df = 1.11, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .04).
Parent perceptions of emotion coaching and emotion dismissing. An
assessment of parents’ emotional communication was measured using the Maternal
Emotional Style Questionnaire (MESQ; Lagacé-Séguin & Coplan, 2005). The
questionnaire has 7-items that address emotion coaching parenting styles and 7-items that
address emotion dismissing parenting styles, for a total of 14-items. Items are assessed on
a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) asking mother’s to indicate
their level of agreement with each statement (emotion coaching e.g., “When my child is
sad, it’s time to problem-solve,” “Anger is an emotion worth exploring”; emotion
dismissing e.g., “I try to change my child’s angry moods into cheerful ones,” “I prefer a
happy child to a child who is overly emotional”). For the purposes of this study, the
measure was adapted to ask both mothers and fathers about their emotional

67
communication style. In an earlier study, the scale was found to have an acceptable
reliability on both emotion coaching α = .69 and emotion dismissing α = .74 parenting
styles (Lagacé-Séguin & d’Entremont, 2006). Another study examining both parenting
styles at two different time points also demonstrated acceptable reliability with α = .83
for emotion dismissing and α = .77 for emotion coaching at time one and α = .87 for
emotion dismissing and α = .82 for emotion coaching at time two (Havighurst, Wilson,
Harley, & Prior, 2009). Results of psychometric tests for this study revealed a good
fitting measurement model and acceptable reliability (Emotion coaching: M = 3.52, SD
= .56, α = .71, χ2/df = .85, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .00; Emotion dismissing: M = 3.11, SD
= .81, α = .78, χ2/df = .96, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .00).
Pre-Interaction Measures for Adolescent
Adolescents completed surveys about their emotion regulation through reappraisal
and expressive suppression, the amount of confidence they have in accomplishing
different activities, the extent of their impulsive behavior, and their current state of
psychological well-being (see Appendix E).
Emotion regulation. Gross and John (2003) developed a 10-item self-report
measure of emotion regulation that focuses on two regulation strategies, cognitive
reappraisal and expressive suppression. In line with the Emotion Regulation Theory, the
7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) reports how an individual
is able to regulate their emotions based on emotional experience and emotional
expression (e.g., “I control my emotions by changing the way I think about the situation
I’m in,” “When I’m faced with a stressful situation, I make myself think about it in a way
that helps me stay calm”). Higher scores on each scale indicate increased ability to

68
engage in emotion regulation. A study on emotion suppression and reappraisal among
college students found the scale to be reliable, α = .81 (Ehring, Tuschen-Caffier, Schnülle,
Fischer, & Gross, 2010). In a study about stigmatized groups similar results were found
with a reliability of α = .83 (Hatzenbuehler, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Dovidio, 2009). In this
study, the scale was converted to a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
agree) to be consistent with other scales in the survey (M = 3.40, SD = .88, α = .76, χ2/df
= .18, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .00).
Self-efficacy. A modified version of the Resilience of Self-Efficacy Scale was
used to assess child self-efficacy (Bandura, 2001). This questionnaire is designed to
better understand self-efficacy as it relates to resilience. Children were asked to rate how
certain they are that they can do each of the 12 items described by selecting a number
between 1 and 5 (1 = cannot do it at all, 5 = highly certain can do it; e.g., “Bounce back
after you tried your best and failed,” “Realize when I make someone else upset”). Prior
studies that have used the measure have not clearly reported the psychometric properties
of the scale, but reliability analysis in the current study revealed that the scale had
acceptable reliability (M = 3.92, SD = .85, α = .83, χ2/df = 1.42, CFI = .98, RMSEA
= .08).
Impulsivity. The Impulsivity Scale for Children (ISC; Tsukayama et al., 2011)
was included as a self-report measure of behavior from the parent and adolescent
perspective. The 8-item measure assesses schoolwork impulsivity and interpersonal
impulsivity, as well as an overall measure of impulsivity (e.g., “I stopped listening
because my mind was wandering,” “I talked back when I was upset”). The assessment
operates on a 5-point scale (1 = almost never, 5 = at least once a day) asking how often

69
the adolescent did the following during the past month. The ISC was found to be reliable
in previous studies, as noted in the parent measure, and had acceptable reliability in the
adolescent sample for this study (M = 2.84, SD = .77, α = .75, χ2/df = 1.34, CFI = .96,
RMSEA = .07).
Interaction Measures
Physiological marker. To assess an individual’s ability to regulate emotion
effectively, a triangulation of measures is recommended that includes self-report,
observation, and physiological markers (Cole, Martin, & Dennis, 2004). Self-report was
assessed prior to the interaction and after the interaction using existing measures of
emotion, cognition, and behavior. Observations were coded for communication patterns
reflecting emotion regulation and impulsivity. A physiological measure of heart rate
variability (HRV) was used to assess emotion regulation. Heart rate frequencies modulate
between 0 and 0.5 Hz (Berntson et al., 1997). Baseline, interaction, and recovery HRV
measures were collected from adolescents using the HeartMath EMWAVE® PRO
biofeedback instrument. The HRV measure uses a plethysmagraph sensor clipped to the
participant’s ear lobe or finger and connects to the computer for data collection.
Following each session the heart rate data collected was transferred to the
software program, Kubios, for reporting purposes. Kubios takes the RR, time between
successive beats or peaks in the heart wave, and develops an output using several
algorithms. There are two types of output terms that are commonly used in reporting
heart rate variability, time domain and frequency domain (Task Force, 1996). Time
domain is focused on measuring the beat-to-beat intervals and includes the measures:
SDNN, RMSSD, and pNN50. SDNN, refers to the standard deviation of all normal RR

70
intervals, where the SDNN index is the mean of all 5-minute standard deviations of NN
or normal RR. RMSSD describes the root mean square successive difference, which
calculates the square root of the mean of the squared differences between successive NN
intervals as they occur over time. pNN50 is a percentage of the differences between
successive NN intervals over time or pNN50/total NN’s and helps to explain any
parasympathetic responses. Frequency domain is focused on the variability present in the
heart rate and utilizes the following frequency measures: VLF, LF, and HF. To calculate,
bands of frequency are assigned and the number of NN intervals that match that band are
added together. VLF is very low frequency and establishes responses from the
sympathetic nervous system. LF stands for low frequency and signifies the
parasympathetic nervous system. HF represents high frequency and reactions of the
vagus nerve. A low value of an HRV measure reflects low HRV. Low HRV is
undesirable, suggesting that the adolescent's heart rate shows less variability, less
flexibility, and less of an ability to regulate their emotions. A high HRV value suggests
that there is a healthy level of emotion regulation; thus, a better ability to regulate
emotions and the potential to be more resilient. Results for each domain were compiled
for each participating adolescent. Then, it was necessary to clean the HRV data and
identify any existing outliers. To clean artifacts, or noise, present in the data, adjustments
were made using the Kubios software levels according to the presence of artifacts.
Outliers were assessed using the Mahalanobis distance test p < .001 (de Maesschalck,
Jouan-Rimbaud, & Massart, 2000). No outliers were identified in the data. The clean data
set from Kubios was then compiled and added to SPSS for further analysis. The mean for
SDNN ranged from 87.77 to 97.36 across the five assessments, RMSSD ranged from

71
81.47 to 97.32 across the five assessments, pNN50 ranged from 42.41 to 48.89 across the
five assessments, VLF ranged from 1950.39 to 4235.87 across the five assessments, LF
ranged from 2288.65 to 4292.44 across the five assessments, and HF ranged from
2417.28 to 3506.23 across the five assessments.
Coding for parent features of conversation. All videotaped interactions were
coded for parent emotion coaching style, parent emotion dismissing style, parent
responsiveness, and parent control. To code the interactions, four coders were given the
following instructions, “For each 30-second interval of the conversation, please rate the
interaction on a five-point scale with regard to…”. Each set of instructions was
customized based on the features of conversation under consideration. The five-point
scale varied depending on the message feature. Reliability of the coders was determined
using Cronbach’s Alpha.
Observed interactions of responsiveness and control were coded according to
Baumrind’s (1991) classifications (see Appendix F). A group of four trained coders were
given directions for how to code the recordings based on a 5-point Likert-scale (1 = not at
all responsive/controlling, 5 = completely responsive/controlling). For the responsiveness
dimension, coders looked at how responsive or how unresponsive the parent
communicated during each interaction. Responsiveness signs include encouragement,
support, praise, acknowledgement of feelings, and verbal and nonverbal expressions of
care. Frustration, impatience, avoidance, discomfort, and lack of eye contact demonstrate
an unresponsive communication style. The control dimension was assessed based on how
controlling the communication was from parent to child during each interaction. A
controlling parent may make demands, nag the child, stress rules, and demonstrate

72
aggression. A parent that is not demonstrating control would not blame the child, changes
their own behavior, and appears passive during the interaction tasks (Estlein, 2013).
Coders were reliable across both dimensions: parental responsiveness (α = .87, M = 3.66,
SD = .48) and parental control (α = .85, M = 2.55, SD = .59).
Observations were also coded with the Family Emotional Communication
Scoring System used for assessing emotion coaching and emotion dismissing
communication from an observed interaction (see Appendix G; Shields, Lunkenheimer,
& Reed-Twiss, 2002). Emotion coaching communication refers to statements or
questions that validate, describe, and/or aim to solve the adolescent’s emotions. Examples
of emotion coaching statements are “Can you think of anything that would have made you
feel better?” and “I could tell you were mad because you walked away.” A dismissing
parenting style may demonstrate both verbal and nonverbal communication that
invalidated, criticized, and/or disregarded the adolescent’s emotions. Emotion dismissing
statements might include “It wasn’t anything to get upset over” or “Are you proud of
yourself?” A group of trained coders were directed to code the recordings based on a 5point Likert-scale (1 = not at all emotion coaching/dismissing, 5 = completely emotion
coaching/dismissing) at 30-second intervals. A follow up study examined family
interaction tasks, emotion regulation, and behavioral problems among children in middle
childhood and found high inter-rater reliability for emotion coaching α = .96 and emotion
dismissing α = .89 (Lunkenheimer, Shields, & Cortina, 2007). A study used the same
construct to assess emotion socialization style of parents with children who have
emotional functioning deficits (Pasalich, Waschbusch, Dadds, & Hawes, 2013). Results
demonstrated high reliability for the measure in mothers and fathers for both emotion

73
coaching (α = .95, α = .98) and emotion dismissing (α = .96, α = .78). For this study,
coders achieved the following reliabilities: emotion coaching (α = .71, M = 3.61, SD
= .49) and emotion dismissing (α = .78, M = 2.37, SD = .58).
Coding for adolescent features of conversation. Videotaped interactions were
also coded for adolescent emotion regulation and adolescent impulsivity. To code the
interactions coders were given the same instructions, “For each 30-second interval of the
conversation, please rate the interaction on a five-point scale with regard to…”.
Instructions, as well as the five-point scale, were customized based on the features of
conversation under consideration.
A positive and negative affect behavior scale was developed to measure
observations of adolescent emotion regulation (see Appendix H). The measure assesses
the degree of control a person has over their emotional expressions. Coders were
instructed to assess emotion regulation behavior based on a 5-point scale (1 = poor
emotion regulation, 5 = excellent emotion regulation) for 30-second intervals of
interaction. When coding for poor emotion regulation, coders were asked to look for
adolescents’ demonstrations of explosive behavior, withdrawing from the conversation,
lack of eye contact or eye rolling, and criticizing of the parent. For excellent emotion
regulation, coders were asked to observe signs that the adolescents’ were comfortable,
engaged in the conversation, demonstrating emotions appropriate to the conversation,
relaxed posture, eye contact, and leaning towards the parent. Coders were reliable in
assessing adolescent emotional expression (α = .75, M = 3.71, SD = .65).
Adolescent appropriate and inappropriate behavior was observed using an
adaptation of the Revised Edition of the School Observation Coding System (see

74
Appendix I; REDSOCS; Jacobs et al., 2000). The revised version was intended for
observing classroom behaviors among pre-school and elementary school children by
measuring the number of 10-second intervals that the child misbehaved divided by the
total number of intervals. Of the original eight assessment categories, one was modified
and adopted for the purposes of measuring adolescent behavior in interaction. The coding
scheme was also adjusted to match similar observation assessments. The revised category
includes inappropriate/appropriate behavior. Using a 5-point scale, coders were asked to
measure inappropriate/appropriate behavior (1 = appropriate behavior, 5 = inappropriate
behavior) for each 30-second interval of interaction. When coding appropriate behavior
of the adolescent, coders were asked to look for effective turn-taking during the
interaction, active listening, no forceful gestures, and appropriate volume of speech.
Observers of adolescents’ inappropriate behavior were asked to look for signs of
aggression such as speaking over the parent or yelling, being easily distracted or visibly
annoyed, fidgeting, and limited eye contact. In a study regarding Head Start programs
and classroom-based incentives the measure was assessed using 10-second intervals with
high reliability averaging to α = .91 (Reitman, Murphy, Hupp, & O’Callaghan, 2004).
Another study training teachers in behavior management found high inter-observer
reliability for appropriate behavior α = .85 and inappropriate behavior α = .83 (Tiano &
McNeil, 2006). For this study, coders demonstrated high reliability of adolescent
impulsivity (α = .83, M = 2.14, SD = .74).2

CHAPTER FIVE
In this chapter, I present the findings of both preliminary and substantive analyses
designed to investigate my hypotheses and research questions. Initial t-tests demonstrated
some differences across groups. Bivariate correlations were then conducted to assess preinteraction responses of both parents and adolescents followed by a second assessment of
both conversation types (happy and unhappy) among each family type (alcoholic and
non-alcoholic) accounting for coded interactions and heart rate measures. I then ran
hierarchical linear regression and moderation analyses for each hypothesis and confirmed
whether hypotheses and research questions were supported.
Preliminary Statistical Analyses
Independent Samples t-tests
As a first step, I conducted independent samples t-tests to compare means on all
of the variables for children of alcoholics versus children of non-alcoholics (see Table 2).
For the self-report variables, results of the independent samples t-tests indicated that there
were significant differences between alcoholic and non-alcoholic families on some of the
variables. Children of alcoholics reported a higher mean for impulsivity (M = 3.03, SD
= .80) than did children of non-alcoholic parents (M = 2.64, SD = .71). Parents’
perceptions of adolescents’ self-efficacy was higher for children of non-alcoholic parents
(M = 4.32, SD = .46) than children of alcoholics (M = 3.97, SD = .70). Parents’
perceptions of adolescents’ impulsivity was higher for children of alcoholics (M = 2.63,
SD = .69) than for children of non-alcoholics (M = 2.17, SD = .78). Finally, parents of
children from families of alcoholics reported more responsiveness in their parental
communication (M = 2.54, SD = .65) than did parents of children from non-alcoholic

76
families (M = 2.15, SD = .70). For the observed features of interaction, parents from nonalcoholic families demonstrated increased emotion coaching behavior during the unhappy
interaction (M = 3.79, SD = .31) as compared to parents from families of alcoholics (M =
3.52, SD = .62). In addition, adolescents from non-alcoholic families demonstrated more
emotion regulation during the happy interaction (M = 3.91, SD = .38) than did their peers
from families of alcoholics (M = 3.54, SD = .84).
Next, I conducted independent samples t-tests comparing means of all variables
for male and female adolescents (see Table 3). For the self-report variables, results of the
independent samples t-tests indicated that there were significant differences between
male and female adolescent participants for adolescents’ self-reported impulsivity and
parents’ self-reported emotion coaching behavior. Female adolescents (M = 2.99, SD
= .82) had a higher mean for impulsivity than male adolescents (M = 2.59, SD = .65).
Parents’ perceptions of their emotion coaching behavior were also higher when they had
daughters (M = 3.66, SD = .60) as compared to sons (M = 3.33, SD = .44). For the
observed features of the interaction, parents’ responsiveness during the happy interaction
was higher in conversations with daughters (M = 3.15, SD = .98) as compared to sons (M
= 2.59, SD = 1.00).
A final set of independent samples t-tests was conducted to compare means of the
self-reported and observed parenting behaviors for mothers versus fathers (see Table 4).
For the self-report variables, differences between fathers and mothers emerged for
perceptions of adolescent emotion regulation and self-efficacy, as well as for parents’
perceptions of their own emotion coaching behavior. Fathers reported a higher mean in
perceptions of adolescent emotion regulation (M = 2.16, SD = .63) than did mothers (M =

77
1.75, SD = .46), whereas mothers (M = 4.22, SD = .61) reported more adolescent selfefficacy than did fathers (M = 3.85, SD = .54). In addition, fathers (M = 3.78, SD = .60)
reported more emotion coaching behavior than did mothers (M = 3.45, SD = .53). For the
observed features of the interaction, fathers demonstrated more control during the sad
interaction (M = 2.95, SD = 1.00) as compared to mothers (M = 2.53, SD = .55). In
addition, adolescents showed more impulsivity during the unhappy conversation in
interactions with fathers (M = 2.60, SD = .81) than mothers (M = 1.93, SD = .65), and
they showed more emotion regulation in both conversations with mothers (happy M =
3.86, SD = .56; unhappy M = 3.87, SD = .57) than with fathers (happy M = 3.32, SD
= .85; unhappy M = 3.21, SD = .91).3
Bivariate Correlations
As a next step, I assessed the bivariate correlations among the variables in this
study. Bivariate correlations were calculated separately for families of alcoholics versus
families of non-alcoholics. First, I assessed correlations among the self-report variables
as measured in the pre-interaction survey (see Table 5). There were several correlations
that were significant across both groups, adolescents’ perceptions of emotion regulation
was positively associated with adolescents’ perceptions of self-efficacy for both groups.
Parents’ perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy were negatively associated with parents’
perceptions of adolescents’ emotion regulation. Parents’ perceptions of adolescents’
behavior was positively associated with both adolescents’ perception of behavior and
parents’ perception of emotion regulation. Parents’ perceptions of responsiveness was
positively associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescents’ emotion regulation and
behavior, and negatively associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescents’ self-

78
efficacy. Parents’ perceptions of emotion dismissing behavior was positively associated
with parents’ perceptions of control and emotion coaching behavior. There were also
correlations significant only for families of alcoholics. Adolescents’ perceptions of
impulsivity was positively associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescent emotion
regulation and responsiveness. Correlations that were significant only for families of nonalcoholics were also present in the findings. Parents’ perceptions of adolescents’ emotion
regulation was positively associated with parents’ perceptions of control, emotion
coaching, and emotion dismissing behavior. Parents’ perceptions of adolescents’ selfefficacy was negatively associated with parents’ perceptions of control. Parents’
perceptions of adolescent impulsivity and parents’ perceptions of responsiveness were
each positively associated with parents’ perceptions of emotion dismissing behavior.
Finally, parents’ perceptions of control was positively associated with parents’
perceptions of emotion coaching behavior.
The second set of bivariate correlations examined the associations between the
observed communication features of the interactions and the measures of heart rate
variability as a marker of emotion regulation. Not surprisingly, the majority of HRV
measures were positively interrelated. Beyond these expected intercorrelations, I also
examined associations between the HRV measures and observed variables for both
unhappy and happy interactions (see Table 6 for unhappy interactions and Table 7 for
happy interactions). The vast majority of associations with HRV were nonsignificant,
with the exception of several negative correlations in the sample of non-alcoholic
families between adolescents’ emotion regulation during the happy interaction,
impulsivity during the unhappy interaction, and a positive correlation with

79
responsiveness during the unhappy interaction. Associations between HRV variables and
coded observations were also largely nonsignificant for families of alcoholics with the
exception of several negative correlations including emotion coaching during the happy
interaction, emotion dismissing during the unhappy interaction, emotion regulation
during the happy interaction, and responsiveness during the happy interaction. A positive
correlation was found for impulsivity during the happy interaction.
A third bivariate correlation analysis was conducted to assess the correlations
among the observed variables for both parents and adolescents (see Table 8). There were
significant correlations for both families of alcoholics and non-alcoholic families in terms
of predictors and outcomes for happy and unhappy interactions. For both alcoholic and
non-alcoholic families, observed parent responsiveness was positively associated with
observed adolescent emotion regulation in the unhappy interaction and negatively
associated with observed adolescent impulsivity in both the happy and unhappy
interactions. Observation of parental control was negatively associated with observed
adolescent emotion regulation and positively associated with observed adolescent
impulsivity during the unhappy interactions. Observed emotion coaching was positively
associated with observed adolescent emotion regulation during the unhappy interaction
and negatively associated with observed adolescent impulsivity in both the happy and
unhappy interactions. For alcoholic families only, observed control was negatively
associated with observed adolescent emotion regulation during the unhappy interaction.
There were no significant correlations between predictors and outcomes for observed
emotion dismissing behavior.4
Test of Hypotheses

80
The hypotheses and research questions in this study were evaluated using
hierarchical linear regression. The dependent variable in each analysis was one of the
emotional, cognitive, or behavioral markers of adolescent resilience (e.g. emotion
regulation, self-efficacy, impulsivity). Separate analyses were conducted for the different
operationalizations of each variable. For example, emotion regulation was
operationalized as a self-report variable, an observed variable, and a physiological
variable; thus, I conducted separate regressions for each outcome variable. Similarly,
behavioral impulsivity was measured as a self-report variable and an observed variable,
so separate analyses were conducted for each outcome. The first step of each regression
included adolescents’ age and gender, parents’ relationship status, and number of
children in the family as control variables. The second step of each model included the
self-reported and/or observed parental communication variables (e.g., responsiveness,
control, emotion coaching, emotion dismissing), depending on whether the outcome
variable was self-reported or observed, and a dummy coded variable identifying the
family as alcoholic or non-alcoholic. Then, to address the research questions in this study
and assess the potential moderating effect of a parent’s alcoholism, the third step of each
model included the interaction term between the substantive predictor(s) in the model and
the alcoholism identifying variable. In the sections that follow, I summarize the results
for adolescents’ emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and behavioral impulsivity as predicted
by parents’ communication behavior.
Associations between Emotion Regulation and Parental Communication
Recall that my first set of hypotheses suggested that emotion regulation is
positively associated with parental responsiveness (H1) and negatively associated with

81
parental control (H2). In addition, I also hypothesized that emotion regulation is
positively associated with parents’ emotion coaching behavior (H7) and negatively
associated with parents’ emotion dismissing behavior (H8). Research questions queried
whether these associations differ for adolescents with an alcoholic parent versus those
without an alcoholic parent (RQ1 & RQ4). In this section, I summarize the results of
regression analyses that examined the effect of each of these four parental
communication patterns on self-reported, observed, and physiological markers of
emotion regulation.
Self-reported emotion regulation. To begin, I constructed models in which the
adolescents’ self-reported emotion regulation and the parents’ self-reported perceptions
of the adolescents’ emotion regulation were outcome variables predicted by the parents’
self-reported responsiveness, control, emotion coaching, and emotion dismissing in
separate models (see Table 9). In the models predicting adolescents’ self-reported
emotion regulation, the control variables accounted for 17% of the variance in the
dependent variable and revealed a negative association between number of children and
adolescents’ self-reported emotion regulation. The second step of predictors included the
family status variable and the parents’ self-reported communication behaviors, which
accounted for 9% to 10% of the variance in the outcome variable. Results for the second
step revealed that family status was positively associated with adolescents’ self-reported
emotion regulation. In addition, parents’ self-reported responsiveness was nonsignificantly associated with adolescents’ self-reported emotion regulation; thus, H1 was
not supported in this model. Parents’ self-reported control was negatively associated with
adolescents’ self-reported emotion regulation, as predicted in H2. Contrary to predictions

82
(H7), parents’ self-reported emotion coaching behavior was not significantly associated
with adolescents’ self-reported emotion regulation in this model. Finally, parents’ selfreported emotion dismissing behavior was not significantly associated with adolescents’
self-reported emotion regulation in this model (H8). The interaction terms between
family status and each substantive variable were entered as predictors in separate models
on step three and accounted for 0% to 4% of variance in the dependent variable. None of
the interactions were significant predictors of adolescents’ self-reported emotion
regulation.
In the models predicting parents’ perceptions of adolescent emotion regulation,
the control variables accounted for 1% of the variance and none of the associations were
significant. Results for the second step revealed that the substantive variables accounted
for 3% to 60% of the variance in the outcome. Parents’ self-reported responsiveness was
positively associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescent emotion regulation; thus, H1
was supported in this model. Contrary to predictions (H2), parents’ self-reported control
was positively associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescent emotion regulation, not
negatively associated as was predicted. Parents’ self-reported emotion coaching behavior
was not significantly associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescent emotion
regulation, demonstrating no support for H7. Finally, parents’ self-reported emotion
dismissing behavior was not significantly associated with parents’ perception of
adolescent emotion regulation (H8). Results for step three of the models indicated that the
interaction term accounted for 0% to 6% of variance in the outcome and also revealed
that the family’s alcoholism status moderated the effects for responsiveness. To evaluate
the moderation, I ran the regression model separately for alcoholic families and

83
nonalcoholic families to isolate the slopes for each group. As shown in Figure 1, the
association between parents’ self-reported responsiveness and parents’ perception of
adolescent emotion regulation was stronger for alcoholic families (alcoholic β = .90, p
< .00) than those from non-alcoholic families (β = .77, p < .00).
Observed emotion regulation. The model for observed emotion regulation was
designed the same way as the model for self-reported emotion regulation, with the
dependent variable being observed adolescent emotion regulation in either the happy or
unhappy interaction and predictor variables including observed responsiveness, control,
emotion coaching, and emotion dismissing for the corresponding happy or unhappy
interactions (see Table 10). The control variables for the happy interaction accounted for
4% of the variance, but none of the effects were significant. The substantive predictors on
step two accounted for 7% to 17% of the variance in adolescents’ emotion regulation
during the happy interaction. Observations of parent responsiveness during the happy
conversation were not significantly associated with observed adolescent emotion
regulation, showing no support for H1 in this model. Consistent with H2, observed
parental control was negatively associated with observed adolescent emotion regulation.
Observation of emotion coaching during the happy conversation was not significantly
associated with observed adolescent emotion regulation, showing no support for H7. For
observed emotion dismissing behavior, there was no significant association with
observed adolescent emotion regulation (H8). Results also revealed that the family’s
alcoholism status moderated the effect of control during the happy interaction. To
evaluate the moderation, I ran the regression model separately for alcoholic families and
nonalcoholic families to isolate the slopes for each group. As shown in Figure 2, the

84
association between observed parental control and observed adolescent emotion
regulation during the happy interaction was stronger for alcoholic families (β = -.67, p
< .01) than for non-alcoholic families (β = .08, p < .70).
Similar models were constructed to evaluate the associations in the unhappy
conversations. The control variables for the unhappy interaction accounted for 5% of the
variance, but none of the associations were significant. On step two, the substantive
variables accounted for 4% to 32% of the variance in observed adolescent emotion
regulation. Observed parent responsiveness during the unhappy interaction was positively
associated with observed adolescent emotion regulation in support of H1. Consistent with
H2, observed parent control was negatively associated with observed adolescent emotion
regulation. Observed emotion coaching was positively associated with observed
adolescent emotion regulation, supporting predictions for H7. Observed emotion
dismissing was not significantly associated with observed adolescent emotion regulation,
showing no support for H8 in this model. The interaction terms entered on step three of
the model were non-significant.
Physiological markers of emotion regulation. HRV was also assessed and for
the majority of the measures, no significant associations were found with any of the
predictor variables. Results revealed significant associations between three of the HRV
measures and parents’ observed communication behavior that will be discussed in more
detail, the remaining analyses have been excluded from this section for the sake of
parsimony. First, SDNN during the recovery period of the happy interaction was set as
the outcome variable predicted by responsiveness, control, emotion coaching, and
emotion dismissing during the happy interaction (see Table 11). The control variables

85
accounted for 6% of the variance. The substantive predictors on step two accounted for
3% to 12% of the variance in adolescents’ observed emotion regulation. SDNN was
positively associated with observed responsiveness during the happy interaction, showing
support for H1. SDNN was not significantly associated with observed control (H2),
observed emotion coaching (H7), or observed emotion dismissing (H8). Moreover, the
interaction terms were also non-significant.
Next, VLF during the recovery period of the happy interaction was assessed (see
Table 12). The control variables accounted for 7% of the variance in the dependent
variable, but none of the effects were significant. The substantive predictors entered on
step two accounted for 0% to 9% of the variance in the outcome variable across models.
In support of H1, observed parental responsiveness was positively associated with VLF;
however, observed control (H2), observed emotion coaching (H7), and observed emotion
dismissing (H8) were not significantly associated with VLF. In addition, none of the
interaction terms were significant.
The third HRV measure to be examined was pNN50 measured during the stimuli
session of the unhappy interaction (see Table 13). The control step accounted for 5% of
the variance of the dependent variable, but none of the individual predictors produced
significant associations. The predictors entered in step two accounted for 13% to 21% of
the variance in the outcome variable across models. Family alcohol status was positively
associated with pNN50 across models. Observed parental responsiveness during the
unhappy interaction was positively associated with pNN50 as a marker of emotion
regulation, showing support for H1. The remaining parental communication variables
were non-significant predictors of pNN50 and none of the interactions were significant.

86
Associations between Self-Efficacy and Parental Communication
Adolescent self-efficacy was the next marker of resilience to be assessed. Since
self-efficacy is a cognitive measure of adolescent resilience it was only measured through
self-report measures of the adolescent and the parent. To review, H3 predicted that parent
responsiveness would be positively associated with adolescent self-efficacy and H4
predicted that parental control would be negatively associated with adolescent selfefficacy. In addition, H9 predicted that parents’ emotion coaching behavior would be
positively associated with adolescent self-efficacy and H10 predicted that parents’
emotion dismissing behavior would be negatively associated with adolescent selfefficacy. Two research questions were also presented to explore whether these
associations differ for adolescents with an alcoholic parent versus those without an
alcoholic parent (RQ2 & RQ5). The following sections summarize the results of
regression analyses, which examined each of the four parental communication variables
as predictors of adolescent self-efficacy.
Self-reported self-efficacy. For this model, adolescents’ perceptions of selfefficacy and parents’ perceptions of self-efficacy were the outcome variables, the same
control variables that were included in the previous models were included for step one,
the same four predictor variables were included in separate models for step two, and the
corresponding interaction variables were placed in step three (see Table 14). The
following paragraphs report the findings for each of the hypotheses and provide an
answer to each research question.
In the models predicting adolescents’ self-reported self-efficacy, the control
variables accounted for 22% of the variance in the dependent variable. Results revealed a

87
positive association between adolescents’ self-reported self-efficacy and parents’
relationship status, such that adolescents whose parents were married reported more selfefficacy than those whose parents were never married or divorced. Adolescent age and
number of children in the family were also negatively associated with self-efficacy, such
that older individuals and individuals with more siblings reported lower self-efficacy. The
second step contained the substantive variables for the model and accounted for 7% to
9% of the variance in the outcome variable. Results for the second step revealed that
family status was positively associated with adolescents’ self-reported self-efficacy in the
model for responsiveness, but adolescents’ self-reported self-efficacy was not
significantly associated with parents’ self-reported responsiveness (H3), control (H4),
emotion coaching (H9), or emotion dismissing (H10). In addition, there were no
significant interactions on step three of the model.
Parents’ perception of adolescent self-efficacy was the dependent variable in the
next model to assess adolescent self-efficacy. The control variables accounted for 5% of
the variance in the dependent variable, but none of the associations were significant. The
substantive predictors in the model accounted for 4% to 25% of variance in the outcome
variable. Contrary to H3, parents’ self-reported responsiveness was negatively, not
positively, associated with their perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy. Consistent with
H4, parents’ self-reported control was negatively associated with parents’ perceptions of
adolescent self-efficacy. Parents’ self-reported emotion coaching behavior was not
significantly associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy, showing no
support for H9. Parents’ self-reported emotion dismissing behavior was not significant
with parents’ perceptions of self-reported self-efficacy (H10). Results also revealed that

88
the family’s alcoholism status moderated the effects for responsiveness and emotion
coaching behavior, accounting for 2% and 12% of the variance in each model
respectively. To evaluate the moderations, I ran the regression model separately for
alcoholic families and nonalcoholic families to isolate the slopes for each group. As
shown in Figure 3, the association between parents’ self-reported responsiveness and
parents’ perception of adolescent self-efficacy was stronger for alcoholic families (β = .64 p < .01) than those from non-alcoholic families (β = -.31, p < .11). As shown in
Figure 4, the association between parents’ self-reported emotion coaching and parents’
perception of adolescent self-efficacy was positive for families of alcoholics (β = .48 p
< .05) and negative in non-alcoholic families (β = -.38, p < .04).
Associations between Behavioral Impulsivity and Parental Communication
The final marker of resilience was behavioral impulsivity. Impulsivity was
measured by both self-report and observational measures. Recall that H5 predicted that
parent responsiveness would be negatively associated with adolescent impulsivity. H6
predicted that parental control would be positively associated with adolescent impulsivity.
For the other parenting styles, H11 predicted that parents’ emotion coaching behavior
would be negatively associated with adolescent impulsivity and H12 predicted that
parents’ emotion dismissing behavior would be positively associated with adolescent
impulsivity. Research questions inquired as to whether these associations differ for
adolescents with an alcoholic parent versus those without an alcoholic parent (RQ3 &
RQ6). The following sections summarize the results of regression analyses, examining
each of the four parental communication variables as predictors of self-reported and
observed outcomes of adolescent impulsivity.

89
Self-reported behavioral impulsivity. I constructed models in which the
adolescents’ self-reported impulsivity and the parents’ perceptions of the adolescents’
impulsivity were outcome variables predicted by the parents’ self-reported
responsiveness, control, emotion coaching, and emotion dismissing in separate models
(see Table 15). In the models predicting adolescents’ self-reported impulsivity, the
control variables accounted for 9% of the variance in the dependent variable, but none of
the effects were significant. The variables in step two accounted for 9% to 26% of the
variance in the outcome variable. Family status was positively associated with
adolescents’ self-reported impulsivity in the models for parental control, emotion
coaching, and emotion dismissing. Contrary to H5, parents’ self-reported responsiveness
was positively associated with adolescents’ self-reported impulsivity, not negatively
associated as predicted. Parents’ self-reported control was not significantly associated
with adolescents’ self-reported impulsivity (H6). Similarly, parents’ self-reported
emotion coaching behavior (H11) and emotion dismissing behavior (H12) were not
significantly associated with adolescents’ self-reported impulsivity. In addition, none of
the interactions were significant.
Next, I examined parents’ perceptions of adolescent impulsivity as the dependent
variable with parents’ self-reported responsiveness, control, emotion coaching, and
emotion dismissing as predictor variables. The control variables accounted for 6% of the
variance of the dependent variable. Results revealed a negative association between
parents’ perceptions of adolescent impulsivity and adolescent gender, such that parents’
perceived that females were more impulsive than males. The variables on step two
accounted for 5% to 31% of the variance in the outcome variable. Contrary to predictions

90
(H5), parents’ self-reported responsiveness was positively, not negatively, associated
with parents’ perceptions of adolescent impulsivity. Consistent with H6, parents’ selfreported control was positively associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescent
impulsivity. Parents’ perceptions of adolescent impulsivity were not significantly
associated with parents’ self-reported emotion coaching (H11) or emotion dismissing
(H12). The interaction terms between family status and each substantive variable were
entered as predictors in separate models on step three and accounted for 0% to 8% of the
variance in the dependent variable. Results revealed that the family’s alcoholism status
moderated the effects for emotion dismissing behavior. To evaluate the moderation, I ran
the regression model separately for alcoholic families and nonalcoholic families to isolate
the slopes for each group. As shown in Figure 5, the association between parents’
perceptions of emotion dismissing behavior and parents’ perceptions of adolescent
impulsivity was positive for non-alcoholic families (β = .36, p < .08) and negative for
alcoholic families (β = -.29, p < .24), although neither of the slopes reached significance.
Observed behavioral impulsivity. In the models for observed impulsivity,
observed adolescent impulsivity in the happy and unhappy conversation was selected as
the dependent variable in separate models (see Table 16). In step one, the same control
variables were selected. In step two, family status and each of the observed predictor
variables were entered for both happy and unhappy interactions in separate analyses. In
step three, the corresponding interaction terms were entered. For the happy interaction,
the control variables accounted for 10% of the variance, but none of the variables were
significant predictors. The variables entered on step two accounted for 2% to 57% of the
variance in the outcome variable. Consistent with H5, observed parent responsiveness

91
was negatively associated with observed adolescent impulsivity. Observation of parent
control was not significantly associated with observed adolescent impulsivity (H6).
Consistent with predictions (H11), observed emotion coaching was negatively associated
with observed adolescent impulsivity. Finally, observation of emotion dismissing
behavior was not significant with observed adolescent impulsivity, showing no support
for H12. None of the interactions were significant.
For the unhappy interaction, the control variables accounted for 5% of the
variance but were not significantly associated with the outcome. The variables on step
two accounted for 1% to 28% of the variance in adolescents’ observed impulsivity.
Observation of parent responsiveness during the unhappy interaction was negatively
associated with observed adolescent impulsivity, consistent with H5. In line with H6,
observation of parent control was positively associated with observed adolescent
impulsivity. Predictions for H11 are supported with observed emotion coaching being
negatively associated with observed adolescent impulsivity. Observed emotion
dismissing behavior was not significantly associated with observed adolescent
impulsivity, showing no support for H12. The interactions entered on step three were not
significant in any of the models.
Summary
To review, the majority of hypotheses were supported or at least partially
supported, with some receiving no support, and others being contradicted (see Table 17).
The first set of hypotheses considered parent responsiveness and parent control as
predictors of adolescent emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and impulsivity. Findings
indicated that responsiveness was positively associated with adolescent emotion

92
regulation in all of the models except adolescent self-report and observed adolescent
emotion regulation during the happy interaction, showing mostly support for H1. H2
predicted a negative association between parental control and adolescent emotion
regulation, which was partially supported with observation data, but self-report data
revealed positive associations, contrary to predictions. H3 was not supported, with
parents’ perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy being positively associated with parents’
responsiveness, which was opposite of initial predictions. Support was found for H4,
showing that parents’ self-reported control was negatively associated with parents’
perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy. H5 received partial support, which predicted that
parent responsiveness was negatively associated with adolescent impulsivity. Both
adolescent and parent self-report results revealed a positive association between parents’
responsiveness and adolescent impulsivity; however, both happy and unhappy
observations were positively associated with observations of adolescent impulsivity.
Finally, H6 was supported indicating that parent control was positively associated with
parents’ perceptions of adolescent impulsivity and observations of adolescent impulsivity
for the unhappy interaction.
The second set of analyses explored parent emotion coaching and emotion
dismissing behavior as predictors of adolescent emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and
impulsivity. H7 was partially supported in that parent emotion coaching was positively
associated with emotion regulation during the observations, but not for self-report data.
There was no support in any of the models for H8, which predicted that parent emotion
dismissing communication would be negatively associated with adolescent emotion
regulation. H9 and H10, were also not supported. Parent emotion coaching was not

93
positively associated with adolescent self-efficacy and parent emotion dismissing was not
negatively associated with adolescent self-efficacy. Both H11 and H12 received partial
support. Parent emotion coaching behavior was negatively associated with impulsivity
for the observation data but not for self-report data, resulting in partial support for H11.
For H12 parent emotion dismissing was positively associated with impulsivity based on
the observation data for the unhappy conversation only.
Six research questions also explored any differences between adolescent
outcomes from families of alcoholics and families of non-alcoholics for each of the
outcome variables assessed. Although several mean differences arose in the independent
samples t-tests comparing children of alcoholics and children of non-alcoholics, results of
the regression analyses only revealed five moderating effects. The first interaction effect
was between alcoholic families and non-alcoholic families regarding adolescent emotion
regulation (RQ1). The association between parents’ self-reported responsiveness and their
perceptions of adolescent emotion regulation was stronger for alcoholic families
compared to non-alcoholic families. Observed parental control and observed adolescent
emotion regulation during the happy interaction also demonstrated an interaction effect,
with the effect being stronger for alcoholic families compared to non-alcoholic families.
A difference between groups was also present in regards to parents’ self-reported
responsiveness and their perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy (RQ2), such that the
effect was stronger for alcoholic families compared to non-alcoholic families.
Associations were also different for adolescents in families of alcoholics and families of
non-alcoholic parents when the predictor was emotion coaching (RQ5), such that the
effect was positive for families of alcoholics and negative for families of non-alcoholics.

94
Finally, differences were found between parents’ self-reported emotion dismissing
behavior and parents’ perceptions of adolescent impulsivity (RQ6), such that the effect
was positive for non-alcoholic families and negative for alcoholic families.

CHAPTER SIX
To review, the goals of this study were threefold. First, by conducting this study
I hoped to better understand resilience among adolescents by examining emotion
regulation, self-efficacy, and impulsivity as markers of resilience. Second, this study
aimed to distinguish family communication styles and behavior that may bolster or hinder
resilience in adolescents. Finally, I incorporated a variety of methods in the hopes of
properly measuring each marker of resilience, expand on existing communication
frameworks, and explore the extent to which features of parent-child communication and
adolescent resilience differ between children of alcoholics and children of non-alcoholics.
In this chapter, I will discuss the findings of the study, provide some explanation for the
outcomes established, consider the implications of this research, identify strengths and
limitations, and provide future directions.
Interpretation of Results
Based on the analyses and assessment using multiple methods, 7 of the 12
hypotheses in this study received at least partial support. Given that I measured all of the
variables in this study in multiple ways, ranging from self-report measures to
observational and physiological measures, and including perceptions on the part of the
adolescent as well as the parent, interpretation of the findings is not very straightforward.
In some instances a hypothesis received support using one measure of resilience, but a
different operationalization of the same variable yielded nonsignificant or even
contradictory results. In this section, I will walk through each of the findings and provide
an explanation of the results.
Findings for Emotion Regulation as a Marker of Resilience

96
The first hypothesis, H1, predicted that parental responsiveness would be
positively associated with adolescents’ emotion regulation ability. H2 predicted that
parental control would be negatively associated with adolescents’ emotion regulation. For
H7, I predicted that parents’ emotion coaching behavior would be positively associated
with adolescents’ emotion regulation. Alternatively, H8 predicted that parents’ emotion
dismissing behavior would be negatively associated with adolescents’ emotion regulation.
Emotion regulation was measured through adolescent and parent self-reports, observation
of interaction, and through vagal tone or heart rate variability. Although no significant
findings emerged based on adolescents’ self-reported emotion regulation, all of the
remaining measures yield some significant results. Notably, parental responsiveness and
control were far more reliable predictors of adolescent emotion regulation than were
parental emotion coaching or emotion dismissing behavior.
Parents’ self-reported responsiveness was positively associated with their
perceptions of the adolescents’ emotion regulation ability, as predicted in H1. This result
makes sense when considering that one way children learn to regulate their emotions is
through interactions with their parent (Eisenberg et al., 2010). Since responsiveness refers
to a parent who is attentive to their child’s needs (Peterson & Hann, 1999), parents who
are responsive in nature are more likely to notice when their child is struggling to manage
emotions and aid them in the regulation process (Baumrind, 1991). Contrary to
expectations (H2), parents’ self-reported control was also positively associated with the
parents’ perceptions of adolescents’ emotion regulation. This result is perplexing,
especially given that the association between parental control and adolescent emotion
regulation was in the predicted negative direction for the observation variables. Why,

97
then, this anomaly for parents’ self-reported control? On one hand, it does make sense
that parental control may be positively associated with adolescents’ emotion regulation.
Parents who are more controlling of their children may interact in such a way that
children are not responsible for regulating their own emotions (Peterson & Hann, 1999).
Constantly being told what to do, how to act, and how to feel does not leave much room
for children to regulate their emotions independently, they simply feel the way they are
told to feel (Barber & Harmon, 2002). The initial prediction assumed that parents who are
more controlling produce children who are less experienced in dealing with their own
emotions effectively. Perhaps when parents are more controlling of how and when
emotions are expressed children are conditioned to regulate emotions quickly in order to
appease their parents’ demands. On the other hand, this explanation fails to account for
the fact that our predictions did bear out as expected in the observational data. This could
suggest that parents are not particularly skilled at judging their own enactment of parental
control or assessing their child’s ability to regulate emotion. Alternatively, perhaps
parents assume that when they tell their child to act or feel a particular way that a child’s
outward compliance is a true reflection of their internal experience, which may not be the
case. Additional research is needed to see if this result replicates itself in future studies,
or if it is unique to this particular context.
With regard to the observational measures, observed parental responsiveness
was positively associated with adolescent emotion regulation in the unhappy conversation,
but the association in the happy conversation was nonsignficant; thus, H1 was partially
supported by the observational data. Notably, although nonsignificant, the association
between parental responsiveness and adolescent emotion regulation was also in the

98
opposite direction from what was predicted. Why would parental responsiveness perform
as expected in the unhappy conversation, but not in the happy conversation? It is possible
that responsive parenting in the context of an unhappy topic is likely to provide support
and validation that may have a calming effect on the child and assist them in overcoming
negative emotions (Segrin & Flora, 2011). In a happy conversation, responsiveness may
simply validate the existing positive emotions, which may serve to amplify emotional
expression rather than suppress it. In addition, positive expressions are more likely to be
perceived as an already appropriate way to respond to the situation and unnecessary to
regulate, whereas negative emotional expressions are likely to be perceived as more
inappropriate and requiring some type of control (Aunola & Nurmi, 2005). Turning to
observed parental control, the association with adolescent emotion regulation was
negative in both the happy and the unhappy conversations, as expected (H2). Overt
expressions of control observed during the interactions may suggest more extreme levels
of parental control. Consistent with the prediction, children who are exposed to
psychological or behavioral control are less likely to have healthy emotion regulation and
more likely to experience anxiety and distress (Calkins, 1994; Houck & Lecuyer-Maus,
2004).
The physiological measures of emotion regulation were only significantly
associated with observed parental responsiveness. It is possible that HRV is not the most
reliable measure of emotion regulation in an interactive context such as this one. Perhaps
emotions during the 5-minute controlled interaction are not extreme enough to produce
much variability. In the future, studies using HRV may benefit by looking at the child’s
communication behavior as a more proximal predictor of heart rate. It may be that the

99
children’s own communicative responses leads to an increase in heart rate rather than the
parents’ communication. If children are unable to express themselves or they become
overly excited, their own behavior may be more likely to correlate with the heart rate
outcome. One study using HRV examined how an image may elicit a particular type of
physiological response in an individual suffering from an alcohol use disorder compared
to someone without an alcohol use disorder (Eddie et al., 2013). Those with an alcohol
use disorder reacted more to the stimuli than those without the alcohol use disorder,
suggesting that it was the individuals’ behavior and experience that ultimately altered
heart rate. In addition, it is possible that the design of this study did not introduce stimuli
stressful enough to produce dramatic changes in HRV. Regardless, parents’
responsiveness did have a significant effect and should not be overlooked.
Surprisingly, only one significant association emerged when looking at emotion
coaching and emotion dismissing behavior as predictors of emotion regulation. Parents’
observed emotion coaching was positively associated with adolescents’ emotion
regulation in the unhappy interaction (H7). Parent emotion coaching behavior expresses
empathy towards the child’s emotions and aims to teach effective coping of both positive
and negative emotions (Cupach & Olson, 2006). It makes sense, then, that observations
of emotion coaching behavior during a conversation that is likely to produce negative
emotions for adolescents would also demonstrate healthy emotion regulation abilities in
adolescents. At a broader level, these results point to Baumrind’s dimensions of parental
responsiveness and control as more robust predictors of adolescent emotion regulation
than Gottman’s dimensions of emotion coaching and emotion dismissing behavior. This
finding is surprising given that Gottman’s typology was developed specifically to

100
examine parental behaviors that are predictive of children’s emotion regulation. There are
a couple of explanations for this finding. Baumrind’s dimensions may be more universal
because they are not limited to expression of emotion and are therefore more applicable
to a variety of contexts. It may also be the case that the design of the study, controlled
interactions for 5-minutes with adolescents selecting the topic, does not permit enough
time to generate strong emotions, making it difficult to warrant and assess the presence of
emotion coaching and emotion dismissing behavior. Longer interaction time or topics
that are selected to generate extreme emotions may improve the chances of witnessing
Gottman’s dimensions of parental communication.
Findings for Self-Efficacy as a Marker of Resilience
The next marker of resilience assessed was adolescent self-efficacy.
Observation and physiological methods could not be used to assess self-efficacy since it
is a cognitive measure of one’s confidence that they can accomplish a task or goal, not
their actual ability to do so. Thus, the findings for self-efficacy are entirely based on selfreport of both adolescents’ perceived self-efficacy and parents’ perceptions of adolescent
self-efficacy. Results indicated that none of the parental communication behaviors
predicted adolescents’ own self-reported self-efficacy. Turning to the parents’ selfreported perceptions of adolescents’ self-efficacy, parents’ self-reported responsiveness
and control were the only significant predictors.
Given that self-efficacy is a cognitive appraisal of one’s own confidence in his
or her ability to accomplish a desired goal, it is surprising that associations with parents’
perceptions of the child’s self-efficacy were significant, but the adolescents’ own selfreported self-efficacy was not significantly associated with parents’ self-reported

101
parenting behavior. Although surprising, this outcome is consistent with previous
research where examinations of child and adolescent self-efficacy are typically measured
through parent self-reports and considerations from third parties, such as a teacher
(Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2002). Other studies have also been
known to examine the self-efficacy of the parent to assess offspring self-efficacy ability
(Jones & Prinz, 2005). Perhaps adolescents are unable to articulate such a complex
cognitive construct like self-efficacy, requiring them to consider their strengths and
beliefs toward accomplishing a task or goal. It is also possible that the adapted scale used
in this study was too challenging for this age group.
The results for self-efficacy revealed that, contrary to predictions (H3), parents’
self-reported responsiveness was negatively associated with parents’ perceptions of the
adolescents’ self-efficacy. In addition, parents’ self-reported control was also negatively
associated with parents’ perceptions of adolescents’ self-efficacy, as predicted (H4).
These unexpectedly similar results may reflect differences in the direction of the effect.
Whereas the negative effect for parental control may reflect the influence that parenting
behavior has on adolescents’ efficacy to perform tasks, the negative effect for parental
responsiveness may reflect the type of parenting behavior that is required when children
lack confidence. Perhaps increased parental control creates a context in which
adolescents lack the confidence to complete tasks independent from a parent’s influence
(Barber & Harmon, 2002). In other words, adolescents may become decreasingly
motivated or incapable of performing certain tasks if their parents are always stepping in
to control their actions, which would diminish their confidence to do so in other
situations. Responsive parenting behavior, on the other hand, might be increasingly

102
warranted when adolescents possess especially low self-efficacy to accomplish their
goals. When adolescents are feeling particularly discouraged about their abilities, perhaps
parents need to step in with more supportive, responsive, and encouraging
communication to bolster their child’s confidence (Baumrind, 1991). Although I had
theorized that parental communication is predictive of adolescent self-efficacy, it seems
that a more complex reciprocal relationship may be at play among these variables.
Results provided no support for parents’ self-reported emotion coaching
behavior (H9) or emotion dismissing behavior (H10) as predictors of adolescents’ selfefficacy. On one hand, this outcome is surprising considering that emotion coaching and
emotion dismissing behaviors could have a great impact on the way adolescents view
their accomplishments and their ability to persevere (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997).
On the other hand, given that Gottman’s dimensions of parental communication focus
predominantly on the ways that parents cultivate appropriate emotions and sensitivity in
their children, they may not be as influential for predicting more cognitive or behavioral
outcomes. Although Gottman’s research has found that emotion coaching behaviors
promote prosocial skills and reduce behavioral problems in children (Gottman, Katz, &
Hooven, 1996, 1997), it is the ability to successfully regulate emotions that allows
children to remain calm and cope with stressful situations (Lukenheimer et al., 2007).
Findings for Impulsivity as a Marker of Resilience
The final marker of resilience examined was impulsivity. The analyses for
adolescent impulsivity received the most support across different types of measurement,
but with few exceptions the results were isolated to parental responsiveness and control,
with relatively fewer significant results for emotion coaching and emotion dismissing

103
behavior. Although the results for responsiveness and control were widely significant,
some of the associations with self-reported parental responsiveness contradicted my
hypotheses.
Contrary to hypotheses (H5), results for the self-report measures revealed that
parents’ self-reported responsiveness was positively associated with both adolescents’
own self-reported impulsivity and parents’ self-reported perceptions of adolescents’
impulsivity. Why might adolescents be more likely to enact inappropriate and impulsive
behaviors when their parents are highly responsive? Perhaps a parent’s responsiveness
serves to reinforce undesirable behaviors for adolescents. If parents respond to their
children’s inappropriate actions with support and understanding, this may teach children
that continued impulsivity will gain the parental attention that they desire (Cothran,
Kulinna, & Garrahy, 2009; Aunola & Nurmi, 2005). To the extent that responsive
parenting fails to correct inappropriate behaviors, adolescents may perceive
responsiveness as permission to continue behaving badly. Results for parental control
were in the predicted direction, such that parents’ self-reported control was positively
associated with their perceptions of adolescent impulsivity (H6). This finding may reflect
a degree of reactance on the part of adolescents, such that the more parents attempt to
control children’s behavior, the more children act out to avoid conforming to parental
expectations (Barber & Harmon, 2002; Baumrind, 1989).
Whereas self-reported responsiveness was positively associated with adolescent
impulsivity, observed parental responsiveness was negatively associated with adolescents’
inappropriate behavior in both the happy and the unhappy conversation, as expected (H5).
These results support the idea that parents who are sensitive to the needs of their children,

104
encourage open discussion, and offer independence will produce children who practice
similar behaviors such as being attentive to others and demonstrating self-control
(Bernier et al., 2010; Calkins & Johnson, 1998). Although the observational results
support this logic, it is unclear why the self-report results produced such divergent results
for parental responsiveness. These results may suggest that parents have a biased view of
their own parenting behavior, such that any form of attentiveness may be equated with
responsiveness, whereas the outside observers were trained to look primarily for
constructive and supportive communication as markers of responsiveness. The self-report
measure of responsiveness may also reflect more of an ideology of parental
communication that differs from the communication behaviors that parents actually enact
during conversations with their children.
Parents’ observed control was positively associated with adolescent impulsivity in
the unhappy conversation, as predicted (H6), but not in the happy conversation. This
result makes sense given the different content of these conversations. The content of the
happy conversation focused on positive experiences and emotions, which are topics that
are less likely to correspond with inappropriate behaviors or efforts to control a child’s
thoughts and actions. The unhappy conversation, on the other hand, focuses on negative
or undesirable experiences, which provides more opportunities for children to act out and
more opportunities for parents to enact control of their children’s undesirable actions
(Davies & Cummings, 1994; Peterson & Hann, 1999).
With regard to emotion coaching and emotion dismissing parenting behavior,
results indicated that parents’ emotion coaching behavior was negatively associated with
adolescents’ impulsivity in both the happy and unhappy conversation, as predicted (H11).

105
Previous research has found that adolescents misbehave in an effort to receive attention
(Cothran et al., 2009). If a parent is providing empathy and coaching a child through an
emotional experience the adolescent may feel that they are receiving the attention they
need and are therefore less likely to act out. Consistent with this reasoning, children with
emotion coaching parents have been found to exhibit less aggression and behavioral
problems (Gottman & Katz, 1995). Emotion dismissing behavior was not significantly
associated with adolescent impulsivity in any of the measures (H12). Adolescents’ may
not demonstrate impulsivity in the face of emotion dismissing behavior to avoid further
ridicule or parental aggression. The age of the adolescent and what is considered
appropriate and inappropriate behavior may influence these findings. For a 12-year-old
participant, fidgeting in the seat during an interaction may be viewed as expected or more
appropriate behavior compared to an 18 year old participant. Withdrawal is another
component of impulsivity that is considered inappropriate in nature. One could argue
though, that withdrawal may be an appropriate response to a parent’s persistence in
discussing an uncomfortable topic. Additional consideration of appropriate and
inappropriate behavior is necessary when reviewing these findings.
Theoretical Implications for Family Communication
Based on the study findings, Baumrind’s dimensions of parental communication
received far more support as predictors of resilience than did Gottman’s dimensions. This
is likely due to the fact that Baumrind’s dimensions capture a broader range of parenting
behaviors than do Gottman’s. Baumrind’s dimensions could be applied to a broader range
of communication situations in parent-child interactions, whereas Gottman’s focuses
primarily on behaviors that encourage the appropriate experience and expression of

106
emotion. A different study design may demonstrate more applicability in using
Gottman’s parental communication dimensions.
It is also important to note that responsiveness often produced different results in
the self-report as compared to the observed variables. Given the discrepancy in outcomes,
it may be worthwhile to reconsider the measurement strategies that have been used to
operationalize responsiveness. The observational method, for example, seemed to be a
strong resource in assessing parental responsiveness. Observational methods may be less
subject to self-report and social desirability biases making them more effective in
measuring behavior, but more prone to other cultural expectations that the coders may
subconsciously enact during the coding process.
Based on the utility of Baumrind’s dimensions it is worth comparing this
framework to other family communication theories and typologies that exist. The
responsiveness and control dimensions seem to be quite useful for predicting outcomes in
children that are a direct result of parenting behavior, whereas family communication
patterns theory (Fitzpatrick & Ritchie, 1994) is more adept at characterizing family
communication patterns within the whole family system and is less capable of isolating
the interpersonal dynamics that are responsible for individual outcomes. The same could
be said of family systems theory, which posits that the lives of family members are
interdependent and tends to examine the norms and dynamics that evolve out of the entire
family system as opposed to the individual relationships within it (Broderick 1993).
Family systems theory provides a valuable perspective for family research that examines
the family as a social unit; however, the nature of this study was interested in individual
level outcomes and not characteristics of the whole family system. Another

107
developmental framework that illustrates the impact of parent-child interaction is
attachment theory. The theory suggests that from infancy we have an innate drive to be in
close proximity with our primary caregiver and that the caregivers’ role is essential in
developing children’s internal representation of self (Bowlby, 1973, 1977; Straussner &
Fewell, 2011). Although attachment styles are likely correlated with the markers of
resilience that were examined in this study, it circumvents the focus on parental
communication behavior as a predictor of resilience since the communication behaviors
that produced the attachment would have happened during infancy.
Comparing Children of Alcoholics and Children of Non-Alcoholics
A number of research questions were posed in this study to investigate potential
differences in parental communication and adolescent resilience in families with an
alcoholic parent versus those without an alcoholic parent. Results of the independent
samples t-tests and the moderation analyses revealed some noteworthy differences
between adolescents from alcoholic families and those from nonalcoholic families.
Results of the t-tests indicated that children of alcoholics had higher self-reported
impulsivity, lower self-reported self-efficacy, and lower observed emotion regulation
than children of non-alcoholics. In addition, parents from alcoholic homes reported more
responsiveness and enacted less emotion coaching behavior than parents from
nonalcoholic homes. Moderation analyses revealed that a family’s alcohol status
moderated associations between parents’ self-reported responsiveness and perceptions of
adolescents’ emotion regulation, parents’ self-reported responsiveness and perceived
adolescent self-efficacy, parents’ self-reported emotion coaching and perceived

108
adolescent self-efficacy, observed parental control and adolescent emotion regulation,
and parents’ self-reported emotion dismissing and perceived adolescent impulsivity.
The Moderating Effect of Family Alcoholism
The first significant moderation showed that the positive association between
parents’ self-reported responsiveness and their perceptions of adolescents’ emotion
regulation was stronger in families of alcoholics than in families of non-alcoholics.
Although responsiveness has been found to be a beneficial way of communicating in
families in general (Baumrind, 1991), it may be especially important in families of
alcoholics given the broader range of adverse conditions that children of alcoholics need
to navigate (Johnson, 2001; Jones & Houts, 1992). CoA may be exposed to more conflict,
stress, and neglect compared to children of non-alcoholics (Lam et al., 2007; Stanger et
al., 2004; Straussner & Fewell, 2011). These challenging experiences that some CoA
navigate are likely to produce negative emotion. Having a responsive parent may be a
crucial protective factor in bolstering resilience in CoA, by buffering the negative
impacts of alcoholism (Hertenstein, 2002; Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006). For both CoA and
children of non-alcoholic parents the effects were positive, where the presence of more
parental responsiveness led to more adolescent emotion regulation. Although the effect
was stronger for families of alcoholics, the role of parental responsiveness in adolescent
emotion regulation is also important to consider for non-alcoholic family types.
The second moderation revealed that observed parental control in the happy
interaction was negatively associated with adolescent emotion regulation in alcoholic
families, but positively associated with adolescent emotion regulation in nonalcoholic
families. It may be that there is a double standard experience for CoA when a parent

109
attempts to control their actions. Alcoholic parents often demonstrate antisocial behavior,
low frustration tolerance, and high anxiety (Britton, 2004; NIAAA, 2010; Schade, 2006).
If parents are modeling poor behavior in the home, children are likely to feel frustrated if
they are held to a higher standard. A parent who typically behaves in inappropriate ways
but expects their child to behave in more appropriate ways may incite a reactive response
rather than compliance from the adolescent. The reverse was true for families of nonalcoholic parents, the more observed parental control the better the adolescent emotion
regulation. In families of non-alcoholic parents there may be more consistency in terms
of control such as limit setting and boundary expectations. Thus, children in families
exposed to consistent regulatory behavior from their parents may be more aware of these
enforcements and respond to them accordingly.
A third moderation showed that parents’ self-reported responsiveness is
negatively associated with perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy in families of
alcoholics, whereas it was positively associated with adolescent self-efficacy in families
of non-alcoholics. Due to their family circumstances, CoA may develop poor confidence
and self-efficacy (Kelley et al., 2011). In addition, our results point to more parental
responsiveness in alcoholic homes versus non-alcoholic homes. As previously argued,
perhaps the negative association for families of alcoholics reflect the greater need that
CoA have for responsive parenting given their tendency to have especially low selfconfidence. Whereas responsiveness from parents in nonalcoholic families likely serves
to reinforce their children’s already high levels of confidence and perceived ability,
responsiveness from parents in alcoholic families likely serves to address some deficit
that exists in adolescents’ self-efficacy.

110
Results for a fourth moderating effect indicated that parents’ self-reported
emotion coaching behavior was positively associated with perceived adolescent selfefficacy in alcoholic families, but negatively associated with adolescent self-efficacy in
non-alcoholic families. This finding was particularly puzzling. Why would emotion
coaching be such a detriment to self-efficacy for children of non-alcoholic parents and a
benefit to self-efficacy for CoA? Based on the t-tests, alcoholic parents are doing less
emotion coaching than non-alcoholic parents. Perhaps the emotion coaching in nonalcoholic families is perceived more as interference, thereby restricting children’s ability
to cope with circumstances on their own. Since emotion coaching is more limited in
alcoholic families, and self-efficacy is lower in those families too, it is possible that when
emotion coaching is enacted it has a more pronounced effect in terms of bolstering
confidence. The neglect often experienced in families of alcoholics may help to explain
this line of reasoning (Das Eiden, Chavez, & Leonard, 1999; Schade, 2006). Children
who encounter emotion coaching behaviors infrequently may give more weight to those
emotion coaching events when they do occur, resulting in inflated perceptions of selfefficacy.
The fifth and final moderation demonstrated that parents’ self-reported emotion
dismissing behavior and parents’ perceptions of adolescent impulsivity was positive and
stronger for non-alcoholic families and negative in alcoholic families. Notably, the main
effects for each group were nonsignificant so the results should be interpreted with some
caution, but if these results are significant in a larger sample, why is emotion dismissing
behavior negatively associated with adolescent impulsivity for CoA, but positively
associated with impulsivity for non-CoA? Perhaps this result also reflects a different

111
direction of the effect. Research has shown that CoA tend to demonstrate an array of
behavioral issues, including withdrawal, hyperactivity, poor interaction skills, and
misconduct (Moylan et al., 2010; Straussner & Fewell, 2011). Perhaps emotion
dismissing behavior is perceived as less appropriate in this context since some of the
behavioral issues displayed by CoA may be an expected or even understandable response
to their family circumstances. The slope for families of alcoholics is near zero. Perhaps
the presence of emotion dismissing communication and adolescent impulsivity is
considered typical behavior and therefore does not register one way or the other. For
families of non-alcoholic parents, emotion dismissing communication may be less
frequent than in families of alcoholics (Schade, 2006; Woititz, 1985). When emotion
dismissing communication is introduced in families of non-alcoholic parents it may incite
more of a reaction from adolescents who are less familiar with this parental response.
Practical Implications for Children of Alcoholics
Results point to parental responsiveness as an important factor in promoting
adolescent resilience and that practitioners and family counselors may want to work with
parents to cultivate more responsive behaviors. This may be especially true in families of
alcoholics, given that the effects of responsiveness are more pronounced in these families.
In terms of emotion regulation, parental responsiveness seemed to facilitate better
emotion regulation for children of alcoholics. This finding suggests the importance of
parental responsiveness in families experiencing an alcohol use disorder. Parents in
families of alcoholics may want to incorporate more responsive parenting in an effort to
buffer the effects of risk factors that might prevent healthy emotion regulation and, in
turn, resilience. Previous research on families of alcoholics supports this notion,

112
demonstrating the potential benefits of a communicative environment that provides
children with acknowledgement and support (Hertenstein, 2002; Rangarajan & Kelly,
2006). In doing so, CoA may become more resilient to the adverse environment that
many families of alcoholics experience (Rangarajan & Kelly, 2006). The larger sample of
mothers involved in the study compared to fathers may also have something to do with
the prevalence of responsiveness. Mothers are typically viewed as the caregiver of a
family, often operating in the role of nurturer for other family members (Le Poire, 2006).
This outcome may have been different if more fathers were present in the study, which
presents an important consideration for future research.
Parental control may be another important behavior for families to consider in
terms of promoting adolescent resilience. The relationship between observed parental
control and observed adolescent emotion regulation was stronger for families of
alcoholics. In a dysfunctional family environment, like that of families of alcoholics,
control may be the only way to manage the chaos (Stanger et al., 2004). Therefore,
parental control may be a very common communication practice in families of alcoholics.
It may also be quite difficult for a parent to relinquish control under these circumstances.
Parental control may also produce negative outcomes (Grolnick et al., 2002), requiring
children to be resilient amidst their parents’ communication and behavior, rather than as a
result of it. Although this places a large burden on CoA, it may be better than the
emotional hardship they might experience by attempting to deal with controlling parents.
In addition, these findings suggest that reducing the amount of parental control may
improve adolescent emotion regulation. Many CoA may take on responsibilities even
when they are not told or expected to, simply to maintain family function (Burnett et al.,

113
2006). CoA may need to learn how to cope independent of parental influence and the
study results suggest they are capable of doing this. A healthy balance of parental control
and responsiveness may be very beneficial for CoA (Domitrovich & Bierman, 2001;
Segrin & Flora, 2011), instilling boundaries and discipline while also being responsive to
children’s needs and requests for support. Practitioners working with families of
alcoholics may want to explore the dimensions of responsiveness and control and work
with families to reduce the extent of controlling communication among family members.
Emotion coaching and emotion dismissing are not parental behaviors that should
be emphasized in family therapy given that they have limited influence on adolescent
resilience. That said, parents’ emotion coaching and parents’ perception of adolescent
self-efficacy was once again stronger for families of alcoholics. Parents’ emotion
coaching behaviors have been found to promote more positive outcomes among
adolescents including better academic performance, interpersonal skills, and attentiveness
(Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1997). The presence of emotion coaching suggests that
adolescents are able to express their emotions, both positive and negative, to a parent
knowing they will receive sympathy and guidance (Cupach & Olson, 2006). Regular
exposure to this form of communication may improve adolescents’ concept of self and
facilitate the belief that they are capable of overcoming any obstacle set in front of them.
This may be especially rewarding for adolescents growing up with an alcoholic parent,
who may experience a variety negative emotions as they interact with family members in
that environment (Eiden et al., 2009). Their ability to cope may strongly rely on having a
parent they can talk to about their feelings (Bijttebier & Goethals, 2006). Growing up
without emotion coaching parents may result in an inability to navigate emotions and

114
impede emotional development, which in turn may affect CoA’s perception of self and
their ability to accomplish goals.
There are a few additional factors to consider regarding the results of this study.
This sample of participants is primarily Caucasian; however, the cultural background of
families is an important feature to consider when making recommendations for
acceptable communication behaviors. In some cultures, it is less acceptable for children
to express themselves, thereby placing limits on their ability to disclose opinions and
emotions (Shearman & Dumlao, 2008). There were also more alcoholic fathers
represented in this study compared to alcoholic mothers. Although the distribution of
maternal versus paternal alcoholism is consistent with previous findings (NIAAA, 1995),
communication with an alcoholic mother versus an alcoholic father may have very
different effects on adolescent outcomes. Mothers are often the primary caretakers in a
family, so if they are the alcoholic parent, the consequences for CoA may be more
problematic (Le Poire, 2006). The gender of the adolescent and gender of the alcoholic
parent is also an important feature of the communication environment that should be
considered (Coffelt et al., 2006). In some cases, the participating parent was the alcoholic
and other times it was the non-alcoholic who participated. Again, the dynamics of
communication with each parent may drastically differ. Finally, some of the alcoholic
parents who participated in the study had entered or are currently in a program of
recovery. Communication may operate differently in families that have not sought help
compared to those who are open to receiving outside support. This study does not have
enough data on families of alcoholics and families of non-alcoholic parents to identify

115
these major differences across groups; however, the hope is that these findings shed some
light on communication behaviors that may enhance CoA resilience.
Strengths and Limitations
There are several strengths to this research. First, this study provides a
comparison between alcoholic and non-alcoholic families. Without such a comparison it
may be difficult to identify and examine the similarities and differences across family
types. Second, this study involved parent-adolescent dyads. The inclusion of both a
parent and child family member allowed for multiple perspectives regarding the family
communication dynamic and extent of adolescent resilience. Third, this study involved
three different measures of adolescent resilience. The ability to examine such a complex
construct like resilience through various methods allowed for a more well-rounded view
of how communication impacts resilience and the extent to which adolescents
demonstrate resilience. A fourth strength of this study is the variety of regions that
contribute to the participant sample. Since the sample was not exclusively from one area,
there is greater validity in the patterns that are present, suggesting that the communication
behaviors and adolescent outcomes are universal in nature. The fifth strength of this study
is how it contributes to theory in family communication. The research does this not only
by examining a unique family context but also by assessing two important family
typologies. Finally, the use of physiological data adds strength to this research. Although
the significant results of the physiological data were minimal, the findings that were
established confirmed other methods and demonstrated the presence of a biological
response to communication.

116
This study is not without several limitations. First, the relatively small sample size
of the study limits the ability to generalize findings and prevents further examination of
different family characteristics that may have an impact on results. Findings may also be
affected by type I error due to the number of tests that were conducted, such that
hypotheses that were found to be supported should not actually be supported. The
Bonferroni correction may aid in any multiple comparison issues; however, after some
consideration, the correction was considered too conservative and therefore not used in
these analyses.
Second, a few of the adolescent participants in this study were 18 to 19 years of
age. Although these ages are considered part of the adolescent age group (Mackenzie,
2000), the experiences and communication behaviors of adolescents at this age may vary
from those of younger adolescents. Impulsivity for example may manifest in different
ways for a 12 year old compared to an 18 year old. Although coders attempted to account
for these variations, a closer look at these differences may be warranted. In addition, the
age of the parents participating in this study range from 27 to 63 years of age. The
communication behaviors of a young parent with adolescents may differ from that of an
older parent with adolescents.
A third limitation was that the eligibility criteria did not control for which parent,
the alcoholic parent or the non-alcoholic parent, participated in the study. As mentioned
earlier, it is possible that adolescents have very different interactions with the alcoholic
parent compared to the non-alcoholic parent. Relatedly, a fourth limitation is the number
of mothers who participated compared to fathers. Previous research identifies that the
nature of communication with a mother can be quite different from that of

117
communication with a father (Winsler, Madigan, & Aquilino, 2005). Along these lines,
another limitation was that the study did not incorporate enough of the family system to
address co-parenting influences or the role of siblings in predicting adolescent resilience.
Future research would benefit from incorporating both parents in the study, or at least
trying to get a more even sample of mothers and fathers.
A final limitation is that this study excluded non-English speaking families. In
doing so, this study neglects a large demographic of families who may also benefit from
this research. Incorporating non-English speaking families into future research has the
potential to extend theoretical frameworks as well as improve our understanding of
parent-child communication and adolescent resilience.
Future Directions
The results of this study present many opportunities for future directions. One
avenue of future research is further exploration of HRV in relation to families of
alcoholics and resilience. One practice of HRV is coherence, a breathing technique that
facilitates relaxation and improves emotion regulation (McCraty & Tomasino, 2006).
Teaching coherence techniques to CoA while measuring family communication and
resilience may present even more usefulness of the HRV tool in learning about emotion
regulation. Future research should also focus on working with larger samples of families
of alcoholics and do more comparisons across families of alcoholics who have entered
recovery versus those who have not. Another benefit to future research is incorporating
both parents in the research. This would allow researchers to examine differences in
communication across parent types as well as identify any co-parenting influences.
Conducting longitudinal research with adolescents, such as a daily diary study, would be

118
another important direction for future research. The longitudinal data could express
changes over time, facilitate healthy communication, provide an outlet for expression of
emotions, and identify certain communication circumstances that are particularly harmful
to adolescent resilience. Finally, future research that examines communication in families
of alcoholics and the effects communication has on CoA resilience may provide useful
information for developing evidence-based programming geared towards substance abuse
prevention. Prevention programs geared towards CoA and other children from high-risk
families may offer communication skills that they would otherwise not be exposed to,
allowing them to cope and build resilience.
Conclusion
The first goal of this study was to clarify the nature of adolescent resilience by
focusing on emotional, cognitive, and behavioral markers of resilience. Emotion
regulation, self-efficacy, and impulsivity were the markers used in this study to identify
resilience. To measure markers of resilience I incorporated self-report, observational, and
biomarker methods. Both self-report and observational methods proved most helpful in
assessing outcomes of parent-child communication on markers of resilience. The second
goal of this study was to identify features of parent-child communication that promote
resilience among adolescents. I drew on Baumrind’s parenting styles and Gottman’s
dimensions of parental communication as frameworks for this study. My results point to
Baumrind’s framework as the more reliable and robust model for predicting adolescent
resilience. Finally, this study utilized a variety of methods, extended existing
communication frameworks, and examined the potential differences in adolescent
resilience between children of alcoholics and children of non-alcoholic parents. The

119
results point to a handful of ways that CoA and non-CoA experience resilience
differently that are worthy of future investigation.

You are invited to participate in a research study that is being conducted by Marie Haverfield,
who is a graduate student in the Department of Communication at Rutgers University. Before you
agree to participate in this study, you should know enough about it to make an informed decision.
If you have any questions, ask the investigator. You should be satisfied with the answers before
you agree to be in the study.
The purpose of this research is to examine how parent-child communication affects resilience in
adolescents. Approximately 100 parent-adolescent dyads (100 parents, 100 adolescents) will
participate in the study. Your involvement in the study will last approximately 60 minutes. The
study procedures involve reviewing and signing the consent form, after which an assent form will
be given to your adolescent child to obtain his/her consent. If either you or your child refuse to
participate in the study no further steps will be taken and you may leave the laboratory without
compensation. If you and your child both consent to participate, the next phase of the study
requires completing pre and post interaction questionnaires and participating in a video-taped
interaction. You and your child will each complete an initial questionnaire. Your questionnaire
will ask you to provide demographic information and report your perceptions of your family
dynamics and your child’s resiliency. Your child’s questionnaire will ask him/her to report on
his/her perceptions of the family and report on their own emotions, cognitions, and behaviors.
Then, you will engage in a video-taped interaction with your child about two topics that your
child will select, one topic will be an experience that made him/her feel happy or proud and the
other topic will be an experience that made him/her feel angry or sad. In order to participate in
this study, it is necessary that the interaction is videotaped. If you refuse to be videotaped you
may end your participation in the study at this time and leave the laboratory without
compensation. Finally, you and your child will be asked to complete two post-interaction
questionnaires about your perceptions of the interaction on each topic. You and your child will
each receive a $50 VISA giftcard as compensation for your participation in this study.
Your participation in this study is voluntary. Although answering every question is preferable,
you have the right to skip any questions that you do not want to answer. You also have the right
to stop participating at any time prior to the completion of the study. If you withdraw from the
study before data collection is completed your data will be removed from the data set and
destroyed. If you withdraw from the study before data collection is completed, you will still
receive compensation for your involvement in the study. The investigator also reserves the right

123
to terminate the participation of individuals in the study if it becomes apparent that they are
overwhelmed or at risk.
This research is confidential. Confidential means that the research records will include some
information about you/your child and this information will be stored in such a manner that some
linkage between you/your child’s identity and the response in the research exists. Some of the
information collected about you/your child includes age, biological sex, family history of
alcoholism, drinking behavior, and mental well-being. This information is kept confidential by
limiting individual's access to the research data and keeping it in a secure location. If you agree to
take part in the study, your name will only appear on this consent form, which will be stored
separately from your questionnaires and other data. Questionnaires will be completed online or
immediately converted to online by the investigator immediately following your session at which
point the paper version of the survey will be shredded. The online questionnaires will contain no
identifying information about you and will be stored on a secure website accessible only to the
investigator and the faculty advisor. Your interactions will be videotaped and even though your
name will not be included in any of the videos, it might be possible for someone to identify you
from your video image. To prevent this breach of confidentiality from occurring, the videos will
be stored on a secure website accessible only to members of the research team.
Thus, to the extent possible, your identity will be kept confidential. If imminent danger is
disclosed, then it may be necessary for the investigator to break confidentiality. The investigator
must notify the appropriate authorities if a participant is believed to be a threat to herself/himself
or others. The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the
only parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. If a report of
this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference, only group
results will be stated. All study data will be kept for three years.
Risks associated with participation in this study are limited, but might include nervousness,
embarrassment, or self-consciousness stemming from being videotaped, or potential emotional
distress resulting from increased reflection on your family. There are some possible benefits as a
result of your participation. You may benefit from the opportunity to reflect on your experiences
and communicate with your child about events that you may not otherwise discuss. As a whole,
this research will benefit society by identifying the features of parent-child communication that
facilitate resilience in adolescents.
If you experience emotional distress or increased stress and anxiety about your family
relationships following your participation in this study, you are encouraged to seek counseling
services. You can find a certified counselor in your area by searching the counseling directory of
the American Counseling Association at the following web address:
http://www.counseling.org/Resources/CounselorDirectory/TP/Home/CT2.aspx
Steps are in place to minimize stress and address distress should it occur. First, you are instructed
at the beginning of the study that you are welcome to terminate your participation at any time and
are able to skip questions that may make you uncomfortable. Second, during the interaction the
researcher will monitor the exchange on a video monitor in a nearby room. Should distress
become apparent, the researcher will stop the interaction and separate you and your child, if
necessary. Then, a member of the study risk committee will immediately be contacted to establish
the appropriate course of action. Third, a list of local resources will be made available to you and
your child at the end of the study and you are encouraged to utilize the resources if any distress is
experienced as a result of your participation in this study.

You are being asked to be in a research study about how teens like you communicate with their
parents. There are a few things I want you to know before you agree to be in the study. Please
read this form and the audio/videotape form on the last page and ask any questions you might
have before agreeing to be in the study.
Why are you being asked to be in this study?
You are being asked to be in this study because we are interested in family communication and
how that makes you feel about yourself. I also want to know how your parents talk to you about
your feelings.
What will happen during this study?
First, you are being asked to read and sign this consent form and the audio/videotape consent
form because your parent has already agreed to participate in the study. If you agree to participate
too, you will fill out a survey about your family and your feelings about yourself. While you do
this, I will connect a small device to your earlobe or finger to measure your heartbeat. Then, I will
ask you to write down some events that happened recently that made you feel happy or proud and
angry or sad. You will pick two of these events that you want to talk to your parent about. Next,
you will have a conversation with your parent about this topic that I will video-tape so that I can
look at your communication behaviors later. During this conversation, you will also wear the
device that measures your heartbeat. After the conversation, you will fill out a short survey asking
about how the conversation made you feel.
Do I have to be in this study?
Your parent needs to give permission for you to be in this study. You do not have to be in this
study if you don’t want to, even if your parent has already given permission. If you start, you can
decide to stop being in the study at any time. If you decide to stop, no one will be angry or upset
with you.
Will I get anything for being in this study?
You will receive a $50 VISA giftcard for being in this study. Even if you decide to stop being in
the study after you get started, you will still receive the giftcard.

127
Are there any risks of being in this study?
The risks of being in this study are very minor. It is possible that you might feel a bit
uncomfortable or embarrassed being video-taped for this study. It is also possible that some of the
questions in the survey or the conversation with your parent might make you think more about
your family, which could be stressful. If being in the study makes you feel upset or stressed, you
can quit at any time.
Who will see my activities in this study?
The only people who will see the answers to your survey or your video-taped conversation are me
and my advisor. Later, a small team of research assistants will also watch your video-tape to
analyze your communication, but they will not be able to tell anyone who you are or what you did
in this study. We will keep your information and your identity completely private. I will write
articles that summarize the results of the study, but they will not include any information that can
identify you.
What questions do you have?
You have the right to ask questions about this study and to have those questions answered by me
before, during, or after the research. If you have any further questions about the study, at any time
feel free to contact me, Marie Haverfield at marie.haverfield@rutgers.edu or by telephone at 408375-6966.
Do you want to be in this study?
Signing here means that you have read this paper or had it read to you and that you are willing to
be in this study. If you don’t want to be in the study, don’t sign.

The purpose of this coding scheme is to assess adolescent emotion regulation behavior during the
conversation. Emotion regulation refers to the degree of control a person has over their emotional
expressions. The parent-adolescent dyads in this study were instructed to have two 5-minute
conversations about a happy topic and an unhappy topic. Your task is to assess the extent to
which the adolescent manages their emotions during the interaction.
For each 30-second interval of the conversation, please rate the interactions on a five-point scale
with regard to the adolescent’s emotion regulation behavior during the interaction. Please use the
following scale when rating the interactions:
1
2
Poor Emotion
Regulation

3

4

5
Excellent Emotion
Regulation

Using this scale, you would give the adolescent the rating of “1” if they showed difficulty
controlling their emotions, such that they displayed discomfort, explosiveness, frustration,
inappropriate crying, or reluctance to communicate when expressing emotion. Use the following
guidelines to help you determine when it is appropriate to assign a code of 1:






The adolescent displays emotions that are highly intense or explosive, especially with
regard to negative emotion.
The adolescent responds to the parent’s efforts to engage discussion about emotion by
refusing to acknowledge what their parent is saying, ignoring the parent, withdrawing
from the conversation, accusing the parent, changing the subject, or interrupting (e.g., “I
don’t want to talk about it”, “You never listen to me”).
The adolescent expresses negative emotions by lashing out aggressively, criticizing the
parent, or disobeying the parent. Adolescents also demonstrate difficulty empathizing.
Look for nonverbal cues that would indicate difficulty managing emotions such as
expressions of anger, frustration, impatience; signs of stress; lack of eye contact; indirect
body orientation; eye rolling; restlessness; or withdrawal from the conversation.

Using this scale, you would give the adolescent the rating of “5” if during that 30-second interval
they appeared comfortable, in control, and attentive during the interaction. Use the following
guidelines to help you determine when it is appropriate to assign a code of 5:





The adolescent appears to have control over their emotions. They appear comfortable
talking about their feelings and are skilled at expressing their emotions.
The adolescent is engaged in the conversation with their parent and freely contributes
their opinions, describes their emotion, and demonstrates active listening.
The adolescent expresses both positive and negative emotions with a degree of intensity
that is suitable to the conversation.
Look for nonverbal cues that would indicate controlled emotions such as relaxed posture,
eye contact, leaning toward the parent, laughing, nodding and smiling, etc.

Appendix I
Observation Coding Scheme for Adolescent Inappropriate/Appropriate Behavior
The purpose of this coding scheme is to assess adolescent expression of behavioral impulsivity
during the conversation, which is reflected in the extent to which children demonstrate behaviors
that are appropriate or inappropriate to the conversation. The parent-adolescent dyads in this
study were instructed to have two 5-minute conversations about a happy topic and an unhappy
topic. Your objective is to assess the extent to which the adolescent demonstrates
inappropriate/appropriate behavior with the parent.
For each 30-second interval of the conversation, please rate behavior on a five-point scale with
regard to the adolescent’s impulsivity during the interaction. Please use the following scale when
rating the interactions:
1
Appropriate
Behavior

2

5
Inappropriate
Behavior

Using this scale, you would give the adolescent the rating of “1” for Appropriate behavior if
during the 30-seconds they were calm, collected, attentive, and engaged. Use the following
guideline to help you determine when it is appropriate to assign a code of 1:




The adolescent effectively took turns in conversing with their parent, they did not speak
out of turn, did not make any forceful gestures, and spoke at an appropriate volume.
The adolescent was able to stay on topic, appeared to be actively listening to their parent,
was responsive to questions asked, and showed respect.
Look for nonverbal cues such as direct body orientation, posture that shows active
engagement, consistent eye contact, no fidgeting, no unnecessary bodily movements, etc.

Using this scale, you would give the adolescent the rating of “5” on Inappropriate behavior if
they showed signs of annoyance, inattention, or disruption during the interaction. Use the
following guideline to help you determine when it is appropriate to assign an
inappropriate/appropriate code of 5:





The adolescent appears aggressive or destructive by doing things such as speaking with
hostility, loud volume, or yelling. The adolescent may interrupt their parent, talk over
them, or show disrespect.
The adolescent is disengaged from the conversation, easily distracted, visibly annoyed
with the parent, and eager to end the conversation.
Look for nonverbal cues such as fidgeting, rolling their eyes, aggressive gestures, facial
expressions of disgust or boredom, and limited eye contact.

To assess emotions that were experienced during the interaction, parents and
adolescents were asked to complete an adapted version of Dillard et al.’s (1996) emotion
scale. Parents and adolescents were asked to complete a post-interaction questionnaire
following each interaction that asked them to indicated the extent to which each emotion
item described how they felt during the interaction (1 = not at all, 5 = a lot). The adapted
scale consists of 12-items that can be broken down into four categories: anger (angry,
mad, irritated), sadness (sad, gloomy, depressed), happiness (happy, glad), and fear
(afraid, scared, frightened). CFA’s were conducted to assess the means and standard
deviations of each composite variable for both the happy and unhappy interactions. For
the adolescent emotional reports during the happy interaction results were: anger (M =
1.44, SD = .87), sadness (M = 1.47, SD = .97), happiness (M = 3.53, SD = 1.37), and fear
(M = 1.14, SD = .40). For the adolescent reports during the unhappy interaction the
results were: anger (M = 1.51, SD = 1.01), sadness (M = 1.64, SD = 1.13), happiness (M =
3.47, SD = 1.39), and fear (M = 1.16, SD = .57). For the parent emotional reports during
the happy interaction results were: anger (M = 1.21, SD = .69), sadness (M = 1.23, SD
= .63), happiness (M = 3.87, SD = 1.20), and fear (M = 1.14, SD = .49). For the parent
reports during the unhappy interaction results were: anger (M = 1.10, SD = .39), sadness
(M = 1.31, SD = .67), happiness (M = 3.81, SD = 1.20), and fear (M = 1.12, SD = .48).
The low means for anger, sadness, and fear may attribute to the nonsignificant findings
related to emotion coaching and emotion dismissing behavior.

I ran t-tests to compare families with one alcoholic parent to those with two
alcoholic parents for both self-report and observed variables. Based on the analyses only
one difference was found. Parents’ perception of their own emotion coaching behavior
was higher for families with one alcoholic parent than families with two alcoholic parents.
I also ran ANOVA analyses for each dependent variable to assess whether there were any
differences between the two groups, families with one alcoholic parent and families with
two alcoholic parents. No significant differences were found.
4

Bivariate correlation analyses were conducted to examine correlations between
parent self-reports and observed interactions. Based on the analysis no significant
correlations were found.
