Abstract
The emergence of mobile technologies and social media applications has led to a shift in
the emergency/disaster related communication environment. Citizens are playing an increasingly
important role in providing real time information to emergency organizations. This shift has
resulted in an expectation by the public that emergency management (EM) organizations monitor
and respond to calls for help disseminated via these applications. The purpose of this study is to
explore the extent to which Florida EM agencies have incorporated the monitoring of social
media into their organizational processes.
The state of social media use in Florida is under researched. In this explanatory
sequential design study, Florida EM personnel was surveyed using the CNA Analyst/National
Emergency Management Association (NEMA) survey (Su et. al, 2012) on the use of social
media in EM. Subsequently, a subset of respondents was interviewed to determine to what extent
they have incorporated the monitoring of social media into their organizational processes.
Several recommendations can be made related to the use of social media in emergency
management in Florida. Each of these is discussed in detail: 1.) Reverse mentoring programs; 2.)
Development of social media policies; 3.) Continue to attend trainings and conferences; 4.)
Explore promising practices; and 5.) Social marketing campaigns for citizens.
Overall, it appears that Florida has an immature yet evolving system for use of social
media in emergency management. While Florida EM agencies are knowledgeable about social
media in general, they lack policies, systems, and staff to take full advantage of social media as a
tool in emergency management. As more training is offered, and promising practices are shared,
vii

systems will likely continue to evolve. The evolution of systems within agencies will depend
largely on leadership attitudes, organizational policies, and staffing resources.

Chapter One: Introduction
The following section will be divided into several subsections. The following subsections
include: (1.) Background; (2.) Statement of the Problem; (3.) Purpose of the Study; and (4.)
Definition of Terms and Acronyms
Background
The use and ubiquity of social media tools, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and
Flickr (Lindsay, 2011) has increased significantly over the past ten years. Facebook, founded in
2004, has “more than a billion monthly active users” – 680 million of which “used Facebook
mobile products” (Facebook, n.d.); YouTube, launched in 2007, has “more than 1 billion unique
users visit each month” (Youtube, n.d.); Twitter made available in late 2006 (Hughes & Palen,
2009) has approximately 100 million users (Crowe, 2011) and according to Lindsay (2011) one
of the most important social media sites related to emergency management (EM) practitioners.
The emergence of social media and access and availability of these applications on
mobile devices has drastically transformed the communication environment within which we
live. The evolving social context within which messages are sent and received is extended
geographically beyond our immediate neighborhood both in everyday life and during
emergencies. With the advent of social media and the increase in its daily use, citizens are
reaching out to each other and emergency personnel in times of emergency through these tools
(Acar & Muraki, 2011; Bruns & Burgess, 2012; Huang, Chan, & Hyder, 2010; Merchant, Elmer,
& Lurie, 2011; Starbird & Palen, 2012). Information in the form of texts and photos uploaded via
social media sites such as Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, blogs and videos via YouTube, can be used
1

as a method of informing situational awareness during disaster response and relief (Gao, Barbier
& Goolsby, 2011).
During emergencies the public is able to provide valuable real-time information which
can help responders gain an awareness of the situation at the site of the event. This awareness,
referred to as situational awareness, is a clear “understanding what is going on around you”
(Toner 2009, p. 1). The information obtained by citizens through their collective intelligence and
experience is called crowdsourced information. This ability for citizens to provide valuable
information to responders is changing the way crisis communication is conceptualized. While
traditional crisis communication models focus on one-way communication from emergency
personnel to the public, a new multi-channel model of communication is emerging in which
citizens provide information to responders and to each other.
Along with the emergence of this new trend in crisis communication developed the
expectation by citizens that their messages are being heard. In 2010, the American Red Cross
conducted an online survey of over 1000 adults which indicated that 69% of respondents felt that
“emergency responders should be monitoring social media sites” and “74% expected help to
come less than an hour after their tweet or Facebook post” (American Red Cross, the Case for
Integrating Crisis Response with Social Media, 2010, p. 4). Further, organizations such as Red
Cross and FEMA “recognized the need to prepare themselves to listen to and process incoming
communications from the public by having fluency in and processes for whatever tools the
public may choose to use” (p 3.)
For real-time information (provided by citizens via social media) to be valuable,
responders have to be aware that people are trying to communicate with them. For social media
messages from citizens to get to emergency personnel, systems must be put into place for

2

monitoring and responding to these communications or, in other words, emergency personnel
need to “pull” this information IN. According to Lindsay (2011, p. 3), governmental agencies
use Facebook and Twitter to issue alerts (or “push” information OUT to the public), “however,
the main source of information disseminated and sought after is generally posted by citizens,
rather than EM agencies and organizations.”
Statement of the Problem
Use of social media by citizens to create situational awareness during an emergency
situation is a largely untapped and uncoordinated resource with potential to improve emergency
response. This new pattern of communication during disaster has begun to be examined. In 2010
a national summit took place at the American Red Cross national headquarters and virtually to
explore the issues related to incorporating social media into emergency and disaster response. In
2011, “A Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs met with
representatives from Apple, Craigslist, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter to discuss how
to harness the capabilities of the digital world to better serve the public” (Lindsay, 2011, p.2).
The literature calls for a redesign of current EM models to better incorporate social media
tools and participation by citizen groups (Magsino, 2009; USDHS, 2012c). Sutton, Palen, and
Shklovski (2008, p. 2) indicate a “need for changes in EM policy that take into account and
recognize the advantages of the way the public is using information and communications
technology during disasters”. While some research has been done nationally on the uses of social
media in EM (Su et al., 2013) there is limited data on how EM agencies within Florida are using
these tools.
Florida in particular is vulnerable. Florida is divided into 67 counties and has a
population of approximately 19,317,568 people (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012) and is host to a

3

large tourist population of approximately 90 million people (State of Florida, n.d.). Forty percent
of all hurricanes in the U.S. hit Florida and “eighty-eight percent of major hurricanes strikes have
hit either Florida or Texas” (NOAA, n.d.). Little is known about the current landscape of social
media use in EM in Florida. To understand how Florida’s system can be improved to capitalize
on social media tools and crowdsourced information, it is necessary to determine what Florida’s
current capabilities are. The aim of this study is to determine what Florida’s current usage and
capabilities are, related to social media in EM.
Examining the extent to which a system for monitoring social media is embedded within
the current Incident Command structure (to be discussed in more detail in Chapter Two) in
Florida, and conceptualizing ways in which this resource might be harnessed during disaster, has
future public health and public safety implications. If a process for monitoring social media
during emergencies and disasters is developed, citizens can play an important role in creating
situational awareness and in aiding first responders and emergency managers during emergencies
and disasters. This collaboration between citizen and EM organizations will streamline the
emergency response process and allow for a more efficient response, similar to that of the 911
system. This could cut down on redundancy in financial and human resources used during a
response, create quicker response times, add to situational awareness, and potentially save lives.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which Florida EM agencies have
incorporated the monitoring of social media into their organizational processes. While some
research has been done nationally on the uses of social media in EM (Su et al., 2013), there is
limited data on how EM agencies within Florida are using these tools. The proposed study is
timely and pertinent to the future of crisis communication in situations that impact the health of

4

the public. This study will follow an explanatory sequential design in which the quantitative
(survey) segment of the study takes place prior to the qualitative (interviews) segment of the
study. Data from the survey will be used to inform the interview questions (Creswell & Plano
Clark, 2007; Creswell, 2009). Specifically, eight research questions will guide the study. By
answering the research questions this study will describe the current state of social media use for
EM agencies in Florida and will provide a launching point from which improvements to current
systems can be made. The research questions are:
1.) How knowledgeable are emergency management (EM) agencies in Florida regarding
social media?
2.) Do EM agencies in Florida use social media?
3.) In what ways do EM agencies in Florida use social media?
4.) Are EM agencies in Florida monitoring social media /pulling information IN?
5.) What are the current capabilities for using social media in EM in Florida?
6.) Do EM agencies in Florida have experience using social media in real world events?
7.) What are Florida EM attitudes toward social media?
8.) What are the main challenges to social media use by EM agencies in Florida?

Chapter Two: Literature Review
The following section is divided into several subsections including: (1.) Introduction; (2.)
Social Media; (3.) Florida’s Emergency Management System; (4.) Literature on the Use of
Social Media in Emergency Management; (5.) Situational Awareness; and (6.) Theoretical
Framework.
Introduction
The use of social media tools, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr (Lindsay,
2011) have increased significantly over the past decade. Applications like Twitter, not available
until late 2006 (Hughes & Palen, 2009), are being used to communicate and share information
during emergencies. Mobile technologies such as smartphones, available with features from high
resolution cameras to GPS receivers, are highly accessible (Yuan et al., 2013). These tools are
available even in the poorest countries and are being used during emergencies to call for help and
share information. For instance, according to Yuan (2013) 85% of Haitians had smartphones
during the 2010 earthquake.
Social media use by citizens during emergencies can be seen throughout the world. Some
examples of this are the Southern California wildfires (Sutton et al., 2008), the 2010 Haitian
earthquake (Starbird & Palen, 2011), the Deepwater horizon Oil Spill (Merchant et al., 2011), the
South East Queensland floods (Bruns, Burgess, Crawford, & Shaw, 2012), the 2011 Egyptian
uprising (Starbird & Palen, 2012), the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan (Acar &
Muraki, 2011), and Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan (Huang et al., 2010).

8

Magsino (2009, p. 30) points out that “government agencies will be unable to ignore
networking tools because of the growing reliance on networking (versus traditional
communication approaches) by the public”. Similarly, Sutton et al. (2008, p.2) indicate that
“with each new disaster peer-to-peer communications through social media, text and instant
messaging applications, blogs, wikis, and other web forums, are growing as a means for
supporting additional, often critical and accurate, dissemination of information within the public
sphere”.
Social media has created a shift in the pattern of communication during disasters.
Members of the public are becoming a resource for emergency responders and each other,
providing real-time information that can be used to create situational awareness (Acar & Muraki,
2011; Bruns & Burgess, 2012; Gao, Barbier et al. 2011; Gao, Wang et al. 2011; Hughes & Palen,
2009; Palen & Liu, 2007; Terpstra et al., 2012; USDHS, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c; USDHS 2013;
Vieweg et al., 2010). Despite the potential for citizens to aid public health response by providing
accurate and timely information, much is unknown about how to coordinate these efforts in a
way that would be most useful to EM personnel. Gao, Barbier et al. (2011, p.10) note that “social
media does not provide an inherent coordination capability for easily coordinating and sharing
information, resources, and plans among disparate organizations.” Research on the use of social
media in emergency management is necessary to determine how to better coordinate these
applications for use during emergencies/disasters.
Su et al. conducted a survey in 2012, in conjunction with the National Emergency
Management Association (NEMA), to determine how social media was being used by
emergency organizations. The survey established that various EM agencies are beginning to use
social media but do not have policies and procedures for doing so and have a long way to go

9

toward taking full advantage of these technologies (Su et al., 2013). While this and other
information was gathered about the nature of social media use in EM, their data on the use of
social media in emergency management in Florida was sparse. The current research strives to
determine the nature of social media use in EM in Florida.
While much of the literature on the use of social media in emergency management
focuses on social media’s use in more traditional models of crisis communication- those that
focus on one-way communication in which information is “pushed” out to the public by
emergency personnel (USDHS, 2012a; USDHS, 2012b; USDHS, 2012c) . While this use of
social media, as an information hub for officials to communicate with the public, is important,
the literature in this area has been already been explored and is therefore not the focus of this
study.
However, the practical applications of how citizens are using social media during disaster
and how emergency organizations are monitoring citizen communications have not been studied
in as much detail (particularly not in Florida). Information on this could lead to new policies,
procedures, memoranda of agreement, training for the EM workforce, and social marketing
campaigns for educating citizens. A collaborative process between EM personnel and citizens
has implications for increasing the reach of information diffused during a disaster; providing
real-time information; taking the impetus for crisis communication out of the hands of
emergency managers and sharing it with citizens and their networks.
Social Media
Social media are “mobile and web-based applications that allow people to communicate
and share information across multiple platforms” (Hughes and Palen, 2009, p.1). Social media
include text and instant messaging applications, blogs, wikis, social networking sites (such as

10

Facebook and Twitter), and photo and video-sharing applications (Palen & Liu, 2007; Sutton et
al., 2008). Information in the form of texts and photos uploaded via social media sites such as
Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, blogs and videos via YouTube, can be used as a method of informing
situational awareness during disaster response and relief (Gao, Barbier et al. 2011 & Gao, Wang
et al. 2011). While all types of social media have the potential for use during an emergency, the
primary focus of this section will be Twitter as it is the example most often used in the literature
(Acar & Muraki, 2011; Bruns & Burgess, 2012; Bruns et al., 2012; Hughes & Palen, 2009;
Terpstra et al., 2012; USDHS 2013; Vieweg et al., 2010).
Twitter’s structure lends itself to the finding and sharing of data. According to Bruns et
al. (2012), the various permissions and privacy functions associated with Facebook make it
harder to analyze information posted there. Facebook still has potential for use as a
communication tool during an emergency; communication via Facebook will be peer-to-peer
rather than person-public such as Twitter. Twitter posts are broadcast more publicly and have
farther reach; they are largely accessible by the public and by EM personnel who are monitoring
them.
Focusing on Twitter as the primary social media tool in emergency management, one can
describe a continuum of possible capabilities for how social media could be sorted into useful
bits of information depending on the level of capabilities within an organization. For instance,
EM organizations with firewalls on their computers, or policies which prevent access to social
media will not be able to mine social media for data. However these organizations still have
access to traditional modes of accessing information from the public such as 911 calls. The 911
emergency number was instituted in the United States in 1968 in a few states but did not become
mainstream until the 1980s (iRevolution, 2010). It is an early pre-cursor to crowdsourcing--

11

using the general population or “capable crowds” (Gao, Barbier et al. 2011) to pull in large
amounts of data which can be sorted and organized into information for use by decision makers.
According to iRevolution, “approximately 240 million calls are made in the US each year, 30%50% are placed using wireless services” (iRevolution, 2010)
Agencies with Twitter accounts can monitor social media and sort it into useful bits of
information with or without the use of software. At the most basic level, agencies can sort
Twitter data by using search features already built into Twitter. Twitter allows users to send 140character messages, called tweets, to other users who are “following” their account, but every
tweet is also posted to a public and searchable timeline unless users have selected a privacy
setting (Starbird & Palen, 2011). Starbird and Palen (2011) describe the process of crescive
adaptation in which Twitter users developed conventions and shortcuts for communicating via
the Twitter platform. Since the platform only allows messages of 140 characters, shortcuts were
developed out of necessity to keep communications efficient. An example of a linguistic
convention developed by Twitter users is the @ sign. The @ sign is known as the addressivity
convention and was developed so that users could single out other individual users to address a
message to. For instance, if Dr. Perrin had a Twitter account and someone wanted to send her a
message they would start it with @Perrin. Another convention is the retweet. The retweet is a
mechanism for forwarding tweets or resending someone else’s tweet. Retweeting is a way of
spreading information quickly throughout the social network. The hashtag (#) convention
imbues Twitter with a built-in searchable form of metadata. The hashtag is a way of coding
information in Twitter so that others can more easily sort it (Starbird & Palen, 2011). Any
agency or person with a Twitter account can use Twitter’s search box to search hashtags or key

12

words from tweets. In this way agencies or persons with limited capabilities could sort Twitter
information into useful bits at a basic level.
A more advance method for tracking hashtags (sorting Twitter information into useful
bits) is using one of the available open-source (free) Twitter Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs). An API is an application that allows one program to interface with another. Tweets were
sorted in this way during the 2010 Haitian earthquake. In an effort to streamline how users
tweeted information, a group of researchers created a tweeting syntax protocol called Tweak the
Tweet (TtT) which encouraged users to report their needs by using a specific set of hashtags so
information could be more easily sorted. An example tweet following the TtT protocol would
look like this: #event #need #location #contact- or more specifically #haiti #food (or #rescue or
#shelter or #gas), #Prince Street #email address. The researchers used Twitter’s REST API to
gather 292,928 tweets which they then hand coded and analyzed.
Twapperkeeper.com is another open-source application used to track hashtags on Twitter.
Twapperkeeper uses Twitter’s search API to collect data by hashtag. This data can then be
exported into other applications for analysis. Bruns et al., (2012) used data collected from
Twitter in this way to research tweets posted during the floods in Queensland Australia. Rather
than hand coding the data, they exported it into open-source software to analyze it. Specifically
they used Gawk and Gephi which are free software packages that allow the user to calculate
statistics describing Twitter activity and to extract social network data which can be then be
visualized.
Another free analytic tool is the E-Data Viewer developed by Kate Starbird at the
University of Colorado. The E-Data Viewer allows researchers to make sense of large data sets,
and to code each message quickly and in context (Starbird, n.d.).

13

In addition to open-source software, there are several proprietary products which can be
purchased and used for mining Twitter data. Software such as Radian 6 is a social media
monitoring tool that companies like Dell use in their Listening Command Center. Radian 6
allows Dell to monitor thousands of posts related to its company. Using Radian 6 software, Dell
monitors in real-time what clients are saying and respond immediately to client concerns.
Recently, Dell partnered with the American Red Cross to establish a social media Digital
Operations Center (American Red Cross, n.d.). In smaller counties, cost may be a barrier for
using proprietary software, such as Radian 6.
While cost is not a barrier for the open source software, the more complex software
requires some level of expertise to use. The required expertise may be a limiting factor for both
rural and urban agencies. However, agencies can still benefit from the kinds of data generated by
these tools through partnerships with digital volunteer communities and non-profit foundations.
Agencies that have partnerships with non-profit groups such Ushahidi can fully access the power
of crowdsourcing for free and with the help of technical experts. Ushahidi is a non-profit tech
company that creates open source software for information collection, visualization, and
interactive mapping, provides consulting services, and oversees the technical components of
deployment. According to their website, their services “can include hosting deployment,
developing unique add-ons, running regular security audits to keep data secure, updating backups so that data is never lost, and maintaining the site” (Ushahidi, n.d.). They also provide
training services.
Finally, several researchers are working on social media analysis tools designed
specifically for use in EM. TEDAS (Twitter-based Even Detection and Analysis System) is a
platform which takes advantage of the metadata associated with tweets such as time stamps and

14

available GPS information. TEDAS culls tweets, detects events, creates temporal and spatial
patterns for the events, and displays them in a visual format (Li, Lei, Khadiwala, & Chang,
2012). SensePlace2 is a similar platform currently under development at Penn State
(MacEachren et al., 2011). Twitcident is a similar project under development in the Netherlands
(Abel et al., 2012). There is great potential for partnerships between these research groups and
EM agencies. In summary, there are many options available for agencies- with or without
financial and technological resources- to take advantage of social media information and sort it
into useful bits.
In addition to providing situational awareness, social media are being used to raise funds,
coordinate volunteers, and track loved ones. According to Gao, Barbier et al. (2011, p. 10), in 48
hours after the Haiti earthquake “the American Red Cross received $8 million in donations
directly from texts.” Goa and Barbier (2011) also note the use of social media sites to
communicate with loved ones post-disaster, in Japan, when jammed phone lines no longer
worked. According to Reddick (2010, p. 45), “Information technology has proven to be effective
for all phases of EM, but especially for the response phase.” There are many potential
advantages to using social media as a tool in disaster response.
Florida’s Emergency Management System
There are many agencies involved in EM. In the Florida Emergency Preparedness
Association alone, there are all levels of government, multiple response agencies (fire, police,
EMS), private sector groups, non-governmental agencies, non-profits, volunteer groups and
tribal entities. It is essential to have a coordinated multi-disciplinary/multi-stakeholder
collaboration during an emergency. Citizens are also a vital part of the response effort.

15

To understand the use of social media in EM in Florida, an explanation of the local
response structure must first be described. Subsequently, an explanation of how local agencies
coordinate with state and federal systems must be given. During a disaster/emergency, local
jurisdictions such as police, fire, and EMS (emergency medical services) work with county EM
agency (there is one for each county) to provide the initial response.
When local resources are exhausted, or existing resources are not sufficient to respond,
state assistance may then be requested (FCEMP, 2012). Chapter 252 of the Florida Statutes
dictates that Florida’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (FCEMP) serves as the
guiding document for emergency operations for the state (FCEMP, 2012). The CEMP defines
responsibilities at all levels of government, private, volunteer, and non-governmental
organizations; is compliant with the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and
incorporates the Incident Command System (ICS) structure (FCEMP, 2012). By being
compliant with NIMS and incorporating ICS structure, the FCEMP is linked to the federal
system of EM.
In the state of Florida, disaster response is not conducted by one agency but rather, is an
inter-agency, multi-stakeholder undertaking. There are 18 Emergency Support Functions (ESFs)
at the state level, around which the FCEMP is based; each is assigned to a state agency with the
resources and expertise to manage that particular function. Table 2 provides a list of the agencies
assigned to each ESF area.

Each primary agency appoints an Emergency Coordinating Officer (ECO) to manage the
ESFs’ function at the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC). Together, the appointed
ECOs, staff of the Division/Office/Bureau, staff of other state agencies, private volunteer
17

organizations, and non-governmental agencies form the State Emergency Response Team
(SERT). The SERT is the “primary operational mechanism through which state assistance to
local governments is managed” (FCEMP, 2012, p. 4). The SEOC structure is flexible allowing
EOCs to expand or contract in response to the size of the event (United States Department of
Homeland Security [USDHS], 2008). Figure 1 summarizes the structure described above.
The State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) is configured using both Incident
Command System (ICS) sections: “Planning, Operations, Logistics, Finance and Administration”
(FCEMP, 2012, p. 39) and the ESF structure. “The Incident Command System (ICS) is a
standardized, on-scene, all-hazards incident management approach that: allows for the
integration of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and communications operating within
a common organizational structure; Enables a coordinated response among various jurisdictions
and functional agencies, both public and private; and establishes common processes for planning
and managing resources”(FEMA, n.d.). ICS is a field level, local response structure. Figure 2
provides a visual of the ICS (Su et al., 2013, p. 30).
Once the state is involved, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) is where
multi-agency collaboration occurs. On the ground level the Incident Command post
communicates with local officials and local EOC who then communicate with state officials and
State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC). Communication travels bi-directionally up and
down the chain from State to local to Incident Command and back. A Joint Information Center
(JIC) is created to coordinate information flow. “The JIC serves as a focal point for coordinated
and timely release of incident-related information to the public and the media” (USDHS, 2008,
p. 52). The JIC is a transient structure enacted during times of disaster. The state Public

18

Information Officer and other communication staff would share resources to create this ad hoc
function. Figure 3 illustrates ICS and ESF are integrated in Florida (FCEMP, 2012, p. 40).
When a state’s resources are exhausted and federal assistance is needed, the Governor
asks for and obtains assistance and a Joint Field Office (JFO) is established where federal-state
coordination takes place. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates
response by using one or more of their 15 emergency support functions—similar to Florida’s.
FEMA’s, ESFs are listed in Table 3 (USDHS, 2008).
The matter of where to integrate the social media monitoring function within the current
ICS structure is a national and state-level issue that has yet to be officially addressed. However,
the United States Department of Homeland Security’s “Social Media Strategy” (2012c) calls for
an analysis of NIMS and ICS to determine how these systems can integrate social media. At the
federal level, the Department of Homeland Security in its ESF #2 (communications), ESF #5
(emergency management), and ESF #15 (external affairs) would be the appropriate agency for
housing a social media role. When ESFs are activated, they support decision making. So
information pulled in from social media might be communicated to other parts of the system
such as ESF #9 (search and rescue). At the state level social media use and monitoring would
likely be incorporated in Florida’s ESF #14 (External Affairs/Public Information) and Florida’s
ESF # 5 (Plans) sections. In a national survey of state, county and local EM and response
agencies (Su et al., 2013), respondents were asked where their agency’s social media activities
primarily reside. The majority of respondents indicated that social media activities occurred
within the Public Information Officer (PIO) function.

No one agency is going to be responsible for monitoring social media however, rather
multiple agencies will have social media and operations personnel who collaborate during the
response, as was seen during Hurricane Sandy. During Hurricane Sandy, the social media
monitoring effort was widespread and handled by a variety of stakeholders in many types of
agencies, rather than by a single position in a single location. Volunteers played a huge role in
monitoring social media. In many cases volunteer groups were previously established, such as
CrisisCommons or Humanity Road, and in other cases, volunteers were impromptu ad hoc

23

groups who emerged to fill gaps. During the Hurricane Sandy response, in fulfillment of ESF
#15, FEMA’s web manager issued guidance to all government agency websites. The guidance
instructed government agencies how to organize the information they disseminated about Sandy
to ensure consistency. FEMA worked with non-profit organizations such as Humanity Road to
assist people in finding aid. Non-profit agencies served to broker information and coordinate
resources. Organizations like CrisisCommons used Ushahidi’s platform to map crowdsourced
information about the location of available resources such as public Wi-Fi, gas, food, shelter.
Similarly, Hurricane Irene also provides an example of how federal, state, and county
agencies worked together to use social media and share information during an emergency.
During Hurricane Irene, 3,000 tweets per second were sent (Greenberg, 2011). Because
organizations don’t have the capacity to sort through and analyze all the information generated
during an emergency (Greenberg, 2001) they often have to rely on digital volunteers. During
Hurricane Irene, agencies worked with digital volunteers and consultants to coordinate use of
social media to communicate to the public and monitor messages from the public. The American
Red Cross trained digital volunteers to monitor information on social media and to provide
updates via social media. The Department of Homeland Security First Responder Technologies
Program coordinated with Florida’s Division of EM and GH International, a consulting
company, to filter through the mass of information. Together they developed an Irene Twitter
web service that aggregated information from multiple sites (all levels of government, non-profit,
private sector) and put it all in one place so that officials in multiple states could view, sort, and
analyze the information within their own operational systems. The information was then linked
to geospatial data so it could be visualized in a map and integrated with the specific agency’s
operational environment (Greenberg, 2011). In this example many people came together to fulfill

24

the social media monitoring function. It was a coordinated effort rather than a task assigned to an
individual in a specific agency. The social media monitoring and coordination function was
dispersed.
The examples of Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy illustrate how federal and state
agencies worked hand in hand with non-profits, consultants, and digital volunteer groups to use
information pulled in from social media to distribute resources and aid decision making. These
examples illustrate that social media monitoring was a shared function within various
organizations rather than an individual function assigned to one agency.
Survey results from a 2012 survey of state, county and local EM and response agencies
were discussed in “Social Media in the Emergency Management Field” (Su et al., 2013) and
indicated that limited resources and insufficient staff were factors in unsuccessful social media
use. Because of limited resources it is important that county, state, and federal agencies
collaborate with non-profits and digital volunteer groups as these groups are, in essence,
workforce multipliers. While digital volunteers were at one time ancillary they are now
becoming a vital primary part of the response effort. An examination of Florida’s current
monitoring and use of social media, the purpose of this study, will provide some insight into its
capabilities.
Literature on the Use of Social Media in Emergency Management
Scientific Literature
There is a specific subset of literature specifically examining the use of social media in
EM. This subset can be divided into scientific/peer-reviewed literature and grey
literature/technical reports. The discussion of literature in this area begins with the scientific
literature. The discussion on scientific literature examines the main topic segments, gaps in the

25

literature, and a synopsis of some of the key articles on the topic of social media use in EM.
Subsequently a similar description of the technical reports will be given.
The scientific literature can be categorized into topic segments: methodologies for
extracting Twitter data; case studies; and crowdsourcing. The first segment of scientific literature
is focused on methodologies for extracting, analyzing and visualizing tweets for use in EM
(Bruns et al., 2012) and the development of Twitter analytic tools (Rogstadius, et a;., 2011) such
as TEDAS (Klein et al., 2012; Li, Lei et al., 2012; Li, Sun, & Datta, 2012; Petrovic et al., 2013);
SensePlace2 (McClendon & Robinson, 2013; Crooks et al., 2012; Lohman et al., 2012;
MacEachren et al., 2011); Twitcident (Abel et al., 2012a; Abel et al., 2012b; Terpstra et al.,
2012; Nurwidyantoro & Winarko, 2012).
The second segment of the scientific literature focuses on case studies which demonstrate
how citizens use social media during emergencies. For instance, Merchant, Elmer, and Lurie
(2011) discuss the use of social media in the Deepwater horizon Oil Spill; Bruns and Burgess
(2012) discuss the use of Twitter during the South East Queensland Floods; Starbird and Palen
(2012) document the use of microblogging during the Egyptian uprising in 2011; Acar and
Muraki (2011) describe the use of Twitter in the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan;
and Huang, Chan, and Hyder (2010), discuss the use of social media during a typhoon. Finally, a
third segment of the literature relates to crowdsourcing information to create situational
awareness (Gao, Barbier et al., 2011; Gao, Wang et al., 2011; Vieweg, Hughs, Starbird & Palen,
2010; Palen & Liu, 2007).
The gaps or scientific research needed to move the topic of social media use in EM
forward are related to three areas: research on the level of knowledge and skill within the
community- specifically to “determine the level at which the community understands and/or

26

participates in preparedness activities” (USDHS, 2012a, p. 7); continued research and betatesting of social media analytic tools in practical settings; needs assessment research on the state
of current capabilities in various states to determine how systems need to be modified to
accommodate the use of social media in EM. The current study focuses on this last category.
Below is a sampling of the key articles in this area along with their findings. In 2007,
Palen and Liu discussed the ad hoc organization of citizens via information communication
technologies (ICT) during disasters and underscore the need for changes in the traditional
command- and-control EM structures to accommodate them. They explain the concept of the
“ecology of peer-to peer communications” and link it to the socio-temporal stages of disaster.
They provide specific examples how citizens use ICT at different stages of a disaster (Palen &
Liu, 2007, p. 728).
In 2008, Sutton et al. used quick response research to collect data in the aftermath of the
2007 California wildfires. They used an online questionnaire to ask about information and
communications technology (ICT) as well as observation, interviews and collection of on-line
texts to collect qualitative data from people affected by the wildfires. The authors predict citizens
will be more involved in future emergency response efforts and urge public officials to consider
how to work with them. Findings related to how those impacted by the wildfires sought
information: 54% used mobile phones to contact family/friends; 76% used information portals
and websites; 38% via traditional news outlets and blogs; 15% via web forums; and 10% from
photo sharing sites. Members of the public served as technical facilitators and information
brokers linking each other to vital information (Sutton et al., 2008). Finally, social media was
self-policing and generated unique and otherwise inaccessible information. While quick response
research is necessary to quickly collect perishable data during disaster, by nature it is less

27

structured and limited. Data are collected from people in the midst of a trauma and skewed to
reflect the respondents’ state of mind. Respondent recall and attention may be impacted by their
circumstances and this may be reflected in the data (Sutton et al., 2008).
In 2010, Vieweg et al. analyzed tweets generated by citizens during two 2009 disaster
events- Oklahoma (OK) Grassfires and Red River (RR) Flood. They specifically identify
information posted which contributed to increased situational awareness. Using search terms
related to the events, the researchers originally collected 4,592,466 tweets related to the Red
River Floods and 1,986,091 for the OK Grassfires and then condensed the data sets to user
streams that contained at least three tweets related to the search terms. Tweets with geo-location
information were evident in the data stream. Geo-location information was contained in 40% of
the OK data set while 18% of the RR data contained geo-specific information. RR tweets were
twice as likely as the OK tweets to provide specific place names. The researchers attributed the
difference in percentages of geo-location information to the nature of the disaster (fires are
unexpected whereas floods provide some warning) and to differences in the phase of disaster
(warning versus impact phase). Tweets providing situational awareness were also evident and the
researchers provide specific qualitative examples of these. In 2009 methodologies for collecting
and analyzing Twitter data were not as well developed as they are today. The researchers had to
make immediate decisions about what data to collect as the data was being generated in the midst
of the event and prior to understanding the full scope of the event. Many of the methodological
choices were subjective- for instance the choice of search terms to use to obtain a representative
sample of data and how to condense the data. The limitations of this and other studies in the field
are a reflection of the newness of this area of study. Methodologies for collecting and analyzing
this kind of information are still evolving (Vieweg et al., 2010).

28

In 2011, Starbird and Palen, 2011 described the behaviors and self-organization of digital
volunteers in the 2010 Haitian earthquake. They specifically looked at tweets that followed the
Tweak the Tweet (TtT) syntax format and at volunteers who translated tweets into the TtT
format (Starbird & Palen, 2011). The researchers also described ad-hoc communication
infrastructures and discuss a theory to explain emergent voluntweeter (twitter users who
voluntarily tweet and retweet information during a crisis) self-organization. The researchers
found that the majority of translators were women located in North America; however, volunteer
translators spanned the globe. Translators were motivated by connections to Haiti or people in
Haiti or were altruistically motivated. Similar to the limitations of the other studies, disaster
research is an immediate real-time process; Twitter data collection methods are relatively new;
the field of research on social media in EM is relatively new and methodologies are being
developed; and qualitative research in general has limitations such as not being able to generalize
(Starbird & Palen, 2011).
Acar & Muraki (2011) sent open-ended questionnaires to randomly selected Twitter users
and analyzed tweets in disaster impacted areas after the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in
Japan. The authors found that tweets in disaster struck areas were related to “warnings, requests
for help, reports about the environment, reports about self, concerns and condolences” (p. 396).
They also found that a major concern by Twitter users was the reliability of tweets and retweets.
They indicate that respondents recommended using official hashtags and an information
traceability system to ensure reliability of tweets. Choices made during the study were arbitraryfor example the authors chose to analyze tweets sent within a 15 mile radius of the two main
cities of impact; to use the city names as keywords; to collect tweets in impacted areas sent from
between 2:45pm to 12pm; and to collect the first 200 tweets sent after 2:45pm in indirectly

29

impacted locations. Different choices by the researchers may have changed the results of their
study (Acar & Muraki, 2011).
Klein et al. (2012) described tools that use Twitter to detect emergencies and recommend
an approach for decreasing the information “noise” associated with tweets. They describe the
Social Awareness Based Emergency Situation Solver (SABESS) Framework which “consists of
a Twitter crawler, diverse analysis tools, tweet aggregators, and content summarization
component” (p. 464). The authors describe the “pipeline architecture” of their system which goes
beyond traditional trend spotting (hashtag extraction and key word analysis) and uses natural
language processing and social network analysis to create information summaries. Their process
uses social network analysis as a means of obtaining information credibility. The SABESS
Framework is still evolving and needs further testing. Studies have not yet been conducted to
determine if the SABESS framework is a producer of higher quality tweets than traditional
methods. Another potentially limiting factor for practitioners who read the paper is its technical
jargon. While the described system has incredible potential for use in the EM community, the
authors will need to be able to communicate to a lay audience of EM decision makers (Klein et
al., 2012).
Non-Scientific/Grey Literature: Technical Reports and Recommendations
The remaining, non-scientific, literature on the use of social media in EM is divided into
technical reports or grey literature and scientific literature. A sampling of the key technical
reports is discussed chronologically. In 2009, the American Public Health Association published
a document focused on how agencies can use social media to push information out to the public;
it describes various available social media tools; and provides a matrix of recommendations for
core challenges encountered in social media use (APHA, 2009).

30

In 2010, the American Red Cross published a comprehensive report providing evidence
and rationale for incorporating social media into EM efforts. It summarizes the issues inherent in
relying on information generated through social media such as privacy, authenticity, veracity and
ownership; describes the results of an ARC survey in which citizen expectations- regarding EM
response to requests for assistance using social media- were assessed; describes crowdsourcing
and discusses various organizations and initiatives such as the Ushahidi platform,
CrisisCommons, and Tweak the Tweet (American Red Cross, 2010a).
A follow-up report was published in 2010 by the American Red Cross which summarized
the recommendations of experts who met at ARC’s Emergency Social Data Summit and
describes steps the EM community can take to advance the use of social media in EM (American
Red Cross, 2010b). It talks about challenges such as the lack of human resources available in
most Emergency Operations Centers, verification of data, and management of public
expectations. (American Red Cross, 2010b). This report also describes a number of workgroups
which emerged out of the summit and which were tasked to address challenges identified in the
summit such as public awareness and education, technology tools, collaboration and governance,
empowerment of citizens, and information accessibility (American Red Cross, 2010b).
The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative in conjunction with the UN Foundation and the
Vodafone Foundation developed a report that makes recommendations for how humanitarian
organizations can partner with volunteer and technical communities. It uses the 2010 Haitian
earthquake as an example and discusses the role played by volunteer and technical communities
and lessons observed during that event (Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, 2011).
In 2011, the Congressional Research Service disseminated a report commissioned by
Congress to determine how social media could be used in federal response efforts to support

31

local communities. It describes how EM officials have used social media during past response
and recovery efforts and discusses promising practices and lessons observed. It recommends the
use of social media to supplement the current 911 system. The report focuses on the push of
social media out to the public, rather than the pull of information IN from the public (Lindsay,
2011).
Many of the technical reports in the area of social media use in EM were created by the
United States Department of Homeland Security (USDHS), Virtual Social Media Working
Group (VSMWG). The working group was established to “provide guidance and promising
practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on the safe and sustainable use
of social media technologies before, during, and after emergencies” (USDHS, 2012c, p.2). They
published a series of technical reports from January 2012 through June 2013. The first in the
series, “Social Media Strategy”, introduces the concept of social media use in EM by both EM
agencies and the general public. It describes various types of social media and calls for an
analysis of the current National Incident Management System and Incident Command System
structures to determine how social media can be incorporated within them (USDHS, 2012a).
The second in the series states that goals and strategies need to be developed for how to
use social media within EM organizations before specific tools can be adopted because specific
social media tools will evolve over time (USDHS, 2012b). It indicates that organizations need to
decide how and why they want to use social media; in what ways and for what purpose. It
underscores the fact that development of strategy should include stakeholders from across
departments within the organization; that model policies exist from which organizations can
create their own (USDHS, 2012b). The document also stresses that the technology capabilities of
the organization must be taken into consideration when developing strategies; that the

32

organization must determine in what ways it wants to engage with itself, other agencies, other
stakeholders, and the community and determine if its current technology is capable of doing this;
it indicates that strategies should take into consideration community, the emergence of ad hoc
volunteer groups, and the use of social media by the general public during disaster (USDHS,
2012b).The document stresses that monitoring of social media should be part of the agency
strategy and indicates that it is important for agencies to use social media before a disaster
occurs; that a trial and error approach to social media is acceptable. Organizations should not be
afraid to try various strategies to see which ones work best and to monitor and adjust along the
way (USDHS, 2012b). Finally, the report recognizes that social media use will vary from one
agency to another. There is no ONE right way to incorporate social media into agency
operations; and issues of privacy, record retention, and security should be considered and
discussed when developing strategies (USDHS, 2012b).
The third document in the US DHS VSMWG series, published in 2012, focuses on
promising practices from agencies already using social media. It talks about the concept of
“Whole of Community”- a model used by the FEMA. The “Whole of Community team of EM
partners includes FEMA, and its federal, partners, local, state, tribal, and territorial partners, nongovernmental organizations like faith-based and non-profit groups, private sector industry,
academia, individuals, families, and communities” (p.5) The report talks about integrating the
entire community into the response effort (USDHS, 2012c). The report identifies the goals of
community engagement as well as how to build agency credibility within the community; talks
about how crowdsourcing via social media can improve situational awareness; discusses
challenges such managing the agency brand, information overload, and lack of message

33

standardization; and discusses established promising practices related to crowdsourcing, online
information sharing, creative engagement, and volunteer networks (USDHS, 2012c).
Finally, the fourth document in the US DHS VSMWG series, disseminated in June 2013,
discusses the use of digital volunteers and provides a case study for how multiple governmental
agencies worked with digital volunteer groups during a disaster to crowdsource information and
provide situational awareness to EM personnel (USDHS, 2012d). Review of the current
technical reports on the use of social media in EM demonstrates there is a “need for change in
EM policy that takes into account and recognizes the advantages of the way the public is using
information and communications technology during disasters” (Sutton, Palen, & Shklovski,
2008, p. 2).
Situational Awareness
The discussion about the uses of social media in EM naturally revolves around the
concept of situational awareness or, simply put, “understanding what is going on around you”
Toner (2009, p. 1). The emergence of social media tools and availability of these applications on
mobile devices has drastically transformed the communication environment within which we
live. The social context within which messages are sent and received is extended geographically
beyond our immediate neighborhood both in everyday life and during disasters. With the advent
of social media and the increase in its daily use, citizens are reaching out to each other and to
emergency personnel in times of disaster with these tools.
In addition to Toner’s (2009) definition, there are several other definitions of situational
awareness. Son et al. (2007, p. 414) indicates that situational awareness is “a cognitive construct
that refers to awareness and understanding of external events in our immediate and near future
surroundings and is defined as perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of

34

time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the
future.” Sarter and Woods (1991, p. 55) define it as “all knowledge that is accessible and can be
integrated into a coherent picture, when required, to assess and cope with a situation.” Endsley
(1988, p. 97) defines situational awareness as “the perception of the elements in the environment
within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of
their status in the near future”.
Endsley (2000) breaks her definition of situational awareness into three levels: level 1
(perception), level 2 (comprehension) and level 3 (projection). Endsley’s definition of situational
awareness is embedded in the field of aviation. While it applies in general to situational
awareness during a disaster, Endsley’s definition must be taken together with the other
definitions (Starter & Woods, 1991; Son et al., 2007; & Toner, 2009) to conform better to the
field of EM.
Endsley speaks in terms of an “operator” (presumably a pilot) and describes the concept
of space and time in terms of this operator. For Endsley, space and time refers to the idea that
information is coming into the operator’s (in our case the EM personnel’s or even a member of
the public’s) awareness and that information is embedded in the context of space (how far away
an event is) and time (when did the event occur). These elements of space and time impact how
and when decisions are made; they help the operator prioritize and triage information. Endsley
(2000, p. 7) indicates that operators “constrain the parts of the situation that are of interest to
them based not only on space but also on how soon that element will have an impact on the
operator’s goals and tasks”. Similarly, in Son et al. (2007) notes that agencies often only attend
to information that is of direct consequence to them and don’t share or aggregate information.
Endsley (2000) discusses the perception (level 1) of cues in terms of incoming information;

35

comprehension (level 2) in terms of how people internalize and give meaning to that
information; and projection (level 3) in terms of understanding and predicting future events
based on the available information to make decisions.
Disaster response is often hindered by lack of situational awareness which in turn
interferes with the ability to make appropriate decisions (Son et al., 2007). According to Son et
al. (2007, p. 414) “improved situational awareness can have a critical impact on accuracy of the
decision making process, resource management, and coordination and response effectiveness.”
Vieweg et al. (2010) proposes a way to increase situational awareness during a disaster by
examining information from those affected by the disaster. Rolka et al. (2008) discuss the
importance of the need for real-time information to create optimal situational awareness. Social
media can be used to examine real-time information from those affected by a disaster;
information technology makes that possible. Reddick (2011) emphasizes the potential of
information technology use in all phases of EM but especially in response.
Situational awareness is not only important for aiding emergency responders in making
decisions, it is important for informing and guiding decisions of the general public as well.
Keeping in mind Toner’s (2009, p. 1) definition, situational awareness is “understanding what is
going on around you”; people in Japan used social media to improve situational awareness for
anyone viewing their tweets on March 11, 2011 when the Great Tohoku earthquake occurred.
According to Wallop (2011, p. 2), “within an hour after the earthquake 1,200 tweets a minute
were coming from Tokyo”.
Similarly, in the 2011 South East Queensland floods in Australia, social media provided
“first-hand footage of the flash floods, in effect operating as an unofficial, distributed early
warning system” (Bruns et al., 2012, p. 11). Between January 10-16, 2011 more than 35,000

36

tweets containing the #qldfloods designation were captured (Bruns et al. 2012). Most of the
tweets to the Queensland Police Service Media Unit’s account (@QPSMedia) were related to
providing situational awareness. According to Bruns et al. (2012, p. 43), these tweets kept people
“up to date on flood levels, locations of flooding and other risk factors”. Responders were able to
make projections (level 3) using the available social media, about where evacuations should take
place. Not only did social media add to an increase in emergency responders’ situational
awareness, it also allowed citizens to make informed decisions by perceiving (level 1),
comprehending (level 2), and projecting (level 3) by using information and dialog available via
social media platforms such as Twitter.
Another example of increased awareness via social media use is Typhoon Pablo which
struck the Philippines in 2012. “During this event, the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs activated the Digital Humanitarian Network (DHN) to rapidly deliver a
detailed dataset of geo-tagged pictures and video footage (posted on Twitter) depicting the
damage caused by the Typhoon” (iRevolution, 2013). The Digital Humanitarian Network, a
network of several groups of digital volunteers, assisted the UN in analyzing thousands of tweets
to improve situational awareness. Using Endsley’s levels, the DHN undertook levels 1 and 2
(perception and comprehension) to assist the UN in level 3 (projection).
Li, Lei et al., (2012) describe the benefits of a Twitter based event detection and analysis
system (TEDAS). They indicate that because tweets are created in real-time, data that is tweeted
can be detected almost immediately whereas traditional news media would capture and report the
event much later. For example, when an earthquake occurs, news of the event can be
communicated via Twitter within minutes, while traditional media might take hours to
communicate the event. By their nature, tweets are able to provide real-time, widespread (due to

37

the nature of retweets) information dissemination that traditional news media outlets cannot
emulate.
Use of information from the public to gain situational awareness is not a new concept.
Rolka et al. (2008, p. 1) discuss the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
BioPHusion program which focuses on “the identification of critical information requirements
and the operationalization of real-time public health information fusion and leadership decisionsupport activities.” While use of information from the public to gain situational awareness is not
new, the tools with which this can be done are new and are rapidly evolving. These tools (such as
Twitter or SMS text messages) make it easier for the public to communicate information in realtime. Rolka et al. (2008, p.5) indicate that “informal communications and social networks based
on individual relationships can be an important complement to formal lines of communication”.
“The ideal successful situational awareness network is a hybrid of the informal community
‘grass roots’ type of information exchange within formal trans-organizational reporting
framework” (Rolka et al., 2008, p. 5).
Toner (2009) describes situational awareness as being multilayered, including
components such as gathering the right information, analyzing it, making projections based on
analysis and using the information (acting on it). These layers mirror Endsley’s levels of
perception, comprehension, and projection. Toner (2009, p. 1) discusses the “observe-orientdecide-act-loop”, also known as the Boyd Cycle, to describe the multi-layered characteristics of
situational awareness. “To achieve situational awareness, the right information (without a lot of
noise) is needed at the right time, and the right person is prepared to receive it, is capable of
analyzing it, and is then able to do something useful with it” (Toner, 2009, p. 2).

38

Information in the form of texts and photos uploaded via social media sites such as
Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, blogs and videos via YouTube, can be used as a method of informing
situational awareness during disaster response and relief (Gao, Barbier et al., 2011). Ushahidi
Haiti Project (UHP) provided situational awareness by generating information from data in realtime and tagging that information with geographical specificity (Morrow et al., 2011).
The UHP is an example of social media use in emergency response and of Endsley’s
levels of situational awareness. UHP was a volunteer driven crisis mapping and crowdsourcing
initiative that emerged in the wake of the 2010 Haitian earthquake. Crowdsourcing is “data
collection and information sharing that strongly leverages participatory social media services and
tools” (Gao, Wang et al., 2011, p. 197). Crowdsourcing is using the general population or
“capable crowds” (Gao, Barbier et al., 2011) to pull in large amounts of data which can be sorted
and organized into information for use by decision makers. Specifically, Ushahidi used
information from texts, “web, email, radio, phone, Twitter, Facebook, television, List-serves, live
streams, and situation reports” (Morrow et al., 2011, p. 8) to create maps. UHP linked this
crowdsourced data to geographical information and created crisis maps for agencies to use in
decision making. According to a 2011 evaluation of the Ushahidi Haiti Project, the Department
of State analysts used Ushahidi to “triangulate conclusions about situation on the ground”
(Morrow et al., 2011, p. 4) and “US military organizations used Ushahidi data feeds along with
other sources in a similar manner to inform their early situational assessments” (Morrow et al.,
2011, p. 4).
Emergency response is a multi-agency/multi-stakeholder effort. Son et al. (2007, p. 412)
note that “often each agency limits its assessment to those observations of direct consequence to
that particular organization without sharing or pooling such information”. Ushahidi put

39

information into a visual geographic format that allowed multiple agencies to view the same
information and the same time thereby creating shared situational awareness.
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework that drives this study is the Data-Information-KnowledgeWisdom (DIKW) model. Zhang et al. (2002, p. 371) describe the DIKW process, as it relates to
EM, by stating “In order to respond to disasters quickly, humanitarian organizations are in the
information business. They collect, analyze, store, and communicate facts and figures and then
make relief decisions” (Zhang et al., 2002, p. 371).
While there is debate about the definitions of each term and no real consensus has been
reached on the definition of information (Rowley, 2007), the general constructs can be discussed.
Rowley (2007) provides a review of the many definitions of information. To summarize,
information is data that have been processed, organized, shaped, interpreted, formatted, or the
like, to add understanding and meaning.
Rowley (2007, p.171) describes the processes associated with converting data into
information as “classification, rearranging/sorting, aggregating, performing calculations, and
selection”. Using Twitter as an example, the hashtag (#) is a classification mechanism which aids
in sorting and classification of messages in that platform (Li et al., 2012a, 2012b; Milstein et al.,
2008; Starbird & Palen, 2011). In the 2011 Queensland floods, researchers used Twitter API to
retrieve, aggregate, sort and classify data into information. They exported the transformed data
into open source (free) platforms called Gawk and Gephi which generated statistics and metrics
associated with Twitter activities and created visualizations (Bruns et al., 2012) of the
information, thus turning information into knowledge (discussed below) from which decision
makers could act.

40

While there are various iterations of the DIKW model-- one containing the concept of
enlightenment (Zeleny,1987); one understanding and intelligence (Ackoff, 1989); one truth
(Jashapara, 2005)-- the current version of the DIKW model (also called the information
hierarchy, knowledge pyramid, and knowledge hierarchy) contains four levels data, information,
knowledge, and wisdom. Within the model each layer builds on itself and is woven together by
the concept of understanding. Bellinger et al. (2004) identifies the concept of understanding as a
transition point from one pyramid level to the next. Specifically “moving from data to
information involves understanding relations; moving from information to knowledge involves
understanding patterns; moving from knowledge to wisdom involves understanding principles”
(Rowley, 2007, pp. 166-167). Using the Queensland flood example discussed above, researchers
made it possible for understanding to occur by manipulating data into a manageable format that
could be visualized.
While many scholars discuss and debate the nature of knowledge (Barnes, 2002; Choo;
1996; Boddy et al., 2005; Jetter et al., 2006; Mertins et al., 2003) for the purpose of this
discussion, “knowledge is the combination of data and information, to which is added expert
opinion, skills, and experience, to result in a valuable asset which can be used to aid decision
making” (Rowley, 2007, p. 172, quoting the European Framework for Knowledge Management).
It is actionable information from which decisions can be made (Jashapara, 2005; Zhang et al.,
2002).
According to Rowley (2007, p. 173) knowledge can be broken down into “explicit (know
what) and tacit (know how)”. In the case of social media, organized tweets that are conveyed to
emergency managers would constitute “know what” or explicit knowledge. The knowledge
inherent in the emergency manager, who receives and processes the information, constitutes

41

“know how” or tacit knowledge. The background skills, training, and experience of the EM
personnel embedded within the system of rules and procedures of the organization would be used
to determine what actionable response to take- these constructs represent the conditions that
allow for the transformation of information to knowledge.
The necessary steps to progress from the element of data to information to knowledge in
social media can be discussed within the context of Bellinger et al.’s transition points. To move
from data to information within social media there must be an understanding of relations and
from information to knowledge there must be an understanding of patterns. Twitter analytic tools
such as TEDAS, visualization tools such as Gawk and crisis maps created with the Ushahidi
platform, form data into discernible relationships and patterns that can be understood and acted
upon.
During Hurricane Sandy social media made it possible for many agencies, nonprofits, and
volunteer groups to aggregate information and resources and to publish them in one place”
(USDHS, 2013, p. 8). Social media allows multiple stakeholders to have shared access to
information and shared explicit knowledge. Tools like crisis maps allow for multiple agencies to
visualize the same information such as citizen needs and to be updated when those needs have
been met so that response will not be redundant. The response effort is a multi-agency effort
(Zhang et al., 2002; Murphy & Jennex, 2006). The specific agencies involved depend on “the
type of emergency, its location and scale of impact” (Murphy & Jennex, 2006, p. 199).
According to Murphy and Jennex (2006, p. 199), it is hard to predict who will be “gathering and
supplying information as well as who will be responding and contributing resources”. Tacit
knowledge (know how) will vary depending on the training and skill of the person who examines
the information. However, some fundamental baseline tacit knowledge will be shared among

42

those within the emergency response community as standard operating procedures are followed
and workforce development trainings ensure a certain level of shared competency. According to
Zhang et al. (2002, p. 371) “information in disaster relief is an essential resource that translates
into supplies, logistics, and cooperation among relief agencies”.
Social media allows the DIKW process to happen in a real-time, large scale, efficient
way. Social media tools include social networking (i.e. Facebook), microblogging (i.e. Twitter),
video sharing (i.e. YouTube) and photo-sharing (i.e. Flickr) sites. But social media may also
include systems like Sharepoint and wikis (web applications that allow multiple people to
contribute) which allow for information sharing within and among EM organizations/agencies.
Sharepoint and wikis however, do not include access by the public. Yates and Paquette (2011)
discuss how interagency information sharing via social media (Sharepoint and wikis) during the
2010 Haitian earthquake was used to make decisions. They highlight the necessity of
institutional knowledge- something that exists tacitly within organization members and
organizational expertise to be able to convert information into actionable information. While
information can be made available, there must be a skilled and trained individual with
institutional memory to make sense of that information and to work within the organization’s
procedures to convert that information into knowledge and action. Yates and Paquette provide
the example of the USNS Comfort, a floating hospital ship. Information came in indicating that
there was a need for an alternative hospital system for victims of Haiti because many of the
hospitals in the capital were destroyed. This information created situational awareness. Tacit
institutional knowledge of Comfort’s existence, role, and capabilities allowed for the information
about a need to be converted into knowledge that allowed for action- i.e. the deployment of
USNS Comfort to meet the need.

43

Texting is also a form of social media that can be used during emergency response.
During the 2010 Haitian earthquake, Mission 4636 was an initiative that involved 50 countries
and provided online translation and information processing (Mission 4636, n.d.). Messages
(data) were texted to 4636, those messages were then organized and routed (information) to
translators and the appropriate relief agency for action. This shared information provided explicit
knowledge to emergency management personnel who, using their tacit knowledge (inherent
knowledge from experience, training, and understanding policies/procedure) could make a
decision about how to act. There are several examples of how data transformed into information
and then into knowledge empowered decision makers to take action which resulted in saved
lives. In one case a trapped UN worker was saved; in another case two individuals who needed
medical assistance helped (Mission 4636, n.d.).
Hurricane Sandy provides an example of how social media use in EM follows the DIKW
model. During Hurricane Sandy data was converted to information which was converted to
knowledge which allowed for decision making. Thousands of digital volunteers worked with the
emergency response community to gather data from social media and then map requests. For
example, the Hurricane Sandy Communications Map (USDHS, 2013, p. 11) “mapped locations
of public Wi-Fi available in areas hit by Sandy as well as telephone outages”. Digital volunteers
organized data (from Tweets and other social media) and made it into information (by organizing
and classifying it) that was available across organizations. Mapping information transformed it
into knowledge in the sense that the map showed patterns which could be viewed by multiple
agencies and used in decision making.
Occupy Sandy, a social relief effort which emerged to help victims of Hurricane Sandy,
is another example of how social media and technology were used during the hurricane to move

44

data along the hierarchy to information and then knowledge. Occupy Sandy was a group of over
5,000 volunteers who provided technology support. They used free software called Sahana Eden
to “develop a technical infrastructure and disaster management system for information sharing
and response support. The system was used to log requests for assistance, print waybills with
inventories and their destinations, and to track requests for disaster relief supplies like food,
water, dry goods and cleaning supplies” (USDHS, 2013, p. 13). Data in the form of requests for
assistance were organized into information in the form of work orders and inventories. This
information was acted upon by response personnel who made decisions about what supplies and
assistance to send and where to send it. In this way information was converted into knowledge.
The entire DIK process was significantly aided by the used of social media and technology.
Because there is an enormous amount of data (in less than a month during the event, there were 2
million posts, USDHS, 2013, p. 20), tools such as Radian 6 (a social media monitoring software)
that help sort and organize data into information allow for a more efficient and coordinated
response.
Bernstein (2009, p. 70) describes the DIKW Hierarchy and its antithesis. He discusses the
negative counterparts to data (missing data or absence of data), information (misinformation),
knowledge (ignorance) and wisdom (stupidity or folly). Social media use during Hurricane
Sandy provides an example of Bernstein’s Antithesis model in the form of rumor and
misinformation. Misinformation and rumor are challenges of using social media. Ironically one
of the solutions to misinformation and rumor via social media is social media itself. During
Hurricane Sandy this was handled through sites such as www.isTwitterwrong.tumbler.com. On
this site people would post their findings after trying to verify various photos that emerged on
social media. In addition to the website, Twitter users would retweet or track down the original

45

sources of photos to debunk false information. FEMA also had a rumor control website in place
to help alert people to misinformation. Similarly, in the 2011 South East Queensland Floods
(Bruns et al.,2012) in Australia, certain tweets were labeled @QPSMedia’s #Mythbuster. These
labels allowed data to be tagged and organized into information which was then used for
decision making (knowledge)- in this case about the veracity of the information.
Social media not only helps EM personnel make decisions on actionable information. It
allows the general public to make decisions as well. For example, Airbnb.com is a site that links
people who need a place to stay with those who have available accommodations. During
Hurricane Sandy, “more than 1,350 people used Airbnb to offer free living space to those
displaced by Sandy” (USDHS, 2013, p. 24). Sites like Airbnb take data and organize it into
information. Once this information is seen and processed by an individual it becomes knowledge
and enables the person to make a decision. Social media allows for this process to happen in a
real-time, large scale, efficient way.

Chapter Three: Methods
This chapter describes the methods used in this study. The chapter is organized into six
sections. These sections include: (1.) Purpose of the Study; (2.) Study Design; (3.) Study Population
and Sample; (4.) Methodology; (5.) Data Collection Procedures; and (6.) Data Analysis Plan.
Purpose of the Study
There are limited data on Florida’s use of social media in EM. The purpose of this study
was to explore the extent to which Florida EM agencies have incorporated the monitoring and
use of social media into their organizational processes. Specifically, eight research questions
guided the study: (1.) How knowledgeable are emergency management (EM) agencies in Florida
regarding social media? (2.) Do EM agencies in Florida use social media? (3.) In what ways do
EM agencies in Florida use social media? (4.) Are EM agencies in Florida monitoring social
media /pulling information IN? (5.) What are the current capabilities for using social media in
EM in Florida? (6.) Do EM agencies in Florida have experience using social media in real world
events? (7.) What are Florida emergency managers’ attitudes toward social media? (8.) What are
the main challenges to social media use by EM agencies in Florida?
Study Design
According to Crosby et al. (2006) exploratory studies are used when there is a dearth of
knowledge on a topic or the issue has not been clearly defined. The state of social media use in
Florida is an under researched area. This study used an exploratory sequential design (Creswell,
2009) to address the research questions. The rationale for using this approach as well as the
strengths and weaknesses associated with this approach are discussed below.
47

The study followed an explanatory sequential design in which the quantitative (survey)
segment of the study took place prior to the qualitative (interviews) segment of the study. Data
from the survey guided the phone interview questions (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Creswell,
2009). This approach, also called the qualitative follow-up approach (Morgan, 1998) is grounded
in both post-positivism (quantitative phase) a constructivism (qualitative phase). The exploratory
sequential design was selected because there was an existing quantitative instrument for
measuring the constructs of interest; access to the community that completed the survey was
available and follow-up with this group, for qualitative data collection, was possible; resources
were limited- the research was conducted by an individual rather than a team- and therefore the
study needed to be conducted in phases. According to Creswell (2009), this is the best approach
to use in the circumstances previously described.
The quantitative data guided the interview questions by adhering to the follow-up
explanations model, part of the explanatory sequential design. Following this model, quantitative
data analysis determined what items needed further explanation via qualitative phone interviews.
A subset of those survey respondents were interviewed and were selected based on the results of
the quantitative data.
The strengths of an explanatory sequential design are that a single researcher can conduct
both segments; it is straightforward to implement; reporting results can occur in two segments
making them clearer; it lends itself to data that emerges throughout the process; and it makes
possible the development of a comprehensive picture of the landscape of social media use in EM
in Florida (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Creswell, 2009). The limitation of this design is that it
takes time conduct (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Creswell, 2009). Interview questions and
interview participants were driven by data from the quantitative portion of the study; therefore

48

extra steps are needed to adequately frame the study approach was used to receive Institutional
Review Board approval.
Study Population
The Florida Emergency Preparedness Association (FEPA) has approximately 600
members from all levels of government, multiple response disciplines, private sector, nongovernmental, non-profit, volunteer and tribal. Letters of support to conduct a survey and followup interviews were provided by both the Florida Emergency Preparedness Association and
Division of Emergency Management. This non-probability purposive sample was used for the
dissemination of the survey as this group is a representative segment of EM personnel in Florida.
Because this group was already established it is also a convenience sample (Crosby et al., 2006).
Consistent with the explanatory sequential design, the composition of the qualitative
sample was determined after analysis of the quantitative portion of the study (Creswell, 2009).
Because the objective of the study was to understand the knowledge, use, capabilities, and
attitudes of each agency individually and to describe that, generalization to a larger population
was not desired. When generalization is not the objective, purposeful sampling is appropriate
(Onwuegbuzie & Leech 2007). Of the several methods for purposefully sampling (Miles &
Huberman, 1994; Onwuegbuzie & Leech 2007), the ones best suited to the explanatory
sequential design method (Creswell, 2009) and therefore the ones used to determine the
interview sample were maximum variation sampling (in which a diverse subset is interviewed- in
this study that was a diverse selection of agency types); and stratified sampling (in which the
sample is divided into groups and participants from each group are interviewed). In this study,
strata were determined based on government level such as county-level participants in one strata
and city-level in another.

49

Sample size selected for the qualitative segment is a subject of debate in the literature
(Guest et al., 2006 & Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007; Bernard & Ryan, 2010). To demonstrate the
lack of consensus on this topic, even the recommendations of a sole researcher vary over a
period of time, specifically, Creswell (1998) recommends that 20-30 people should be
interviewed in grounded theory but then he (Creswell, 2002) recommends 15-20 for a grounded
theory study. Typically sample sizes in qualitative research should be large enough to achieve
saturation but not so large that it is not feasible to undertake (because of expense and time).
Phases of the Study
Phase I: Quantitative Research
Quantitative data were collected using a pre-existing survey instrument (Su et al., 2012).
The survey instrument was developed by Su et al. in 2012 in collaboration with the National
Emergency Management Association (NEMA). The survey underwent expert review and was
assessed for face and construct validity. Face validity is the extent to which the test appears to
measure a certain construct (Borg & Gall, 1989; de Vaus, 2001; Crosby et al. 2006; Creswell,
2014). Construct validity is the extent to which a particular survey item measures a theoretical
construct. Groves et al. (2009) emphasizes that survey items should meet three standards: content
standards, cognitive standards and usability standards. The survey used for this study met those
standards.
The survey was developed from concepts and issues which emerged during a conference
of subject matter experts at the National Emergency Manager Association at an SMEM Camp
(Social Media in Emergency Management Camp). Su et al. (2013), researchers at CNA Analysis
and Solutions developed the questions and sent them through an internal review at CNA
Analysis and Solutions. After the internal review they asked subject matter experts in the field of

50

EM to review the survey and subsequently submitted the survey to four reviewers as final
verification (Su et al., 2013).
There are both advantages and disadvantages of using an existing survey for the current
study. An advantage of using an existing survey is that the existing survey used for this study
was validated and the survey developers (Su et al., 2012) ensured that word choice, instruction
clarity, and overall survey flow were addressed up front via several layers of field testing. The
survey also went through several iterations of pilot testing. A limitation of using an existing
survey is the lack of control over how the survey was developed and whether or not it meets the
standards of a good survey (Fowler, 1995). For example, despite the fact that the Su et al. (2012)
survey is the most comprehensive survey on the topic of social media use in EM, the survey has
not been tested for reliability. While reliability is an important considerations for survey
instrument selection, in practice settings surveys are typically selected based on current
promising practices/standards of practice, availability, and if they make sense or are practical for
assessing what the practitioner wants to know. In this case, the Su et al. survey is the most
comprehensive survey on the use of social media in EM that exists in the field at this time.
Finally, online surveys in general, whether existing or newly developed, are limited due to a lack
of control over who actually completes the survey. While a certain audience may be targeted,
there is no guarantee that that audience will complete the survey.
A few minor changes were made to the survey instrument to increase usability. Item
number eight in the section called “Social Media Development” says “For those types of federal
government support your agency would find worthwhile, please rank your choices from the most
important to least important, with 1 representing the most important” (Su et al., 2012, p. 26). In
the national survey results (Su et al., 2013), the authors indicated that respondents answered in a

51

way that demonstrated they did not realize the question was a ranking question rather than a
rating question. A simple modification asking respondents to rank the items in consecutive order
allowed the question to better adhere to Fowler’s (1995) principles “clearly communicate to all
respondents the kind of answer that constitutes an adequate answer to the question (p.103)” and
“survey should be worded so that every respondent is answering the same question.”
Other modifications were made to questions with yes/no response options. In some
instances an “I don’t know” response option was needed and therefore added. For example, in
question number four under “Social Media Capability: General” which asks “Does your agency
have a social media policy in place for its employees?” An “I don’t know” option was added.
Finally, a demographic question about agency type was also added as it will allow for analysis of
dependent variables such as social media use, by agency type. Finally questions were added to
the survey to determine if agencies had an interest in trainings related to social media use in EM.
In addition to the pilot testing conducted with the national survey, the survey was pilot tested
again with a subset of FEPA members to ensure that changes made were viable. Members of the
FEPA Board of Directors were given the survey prior to widespread dissemination and asked to
review it and provide feedback. The members were able to complete the survey without issue
and no negative feedback was received.
The survey was entered into Qualtrics software and sent, on April 15, 2014, by the
president of FEPA to approximately 25 FEPA board members to pilot test. Of these, 14
completed the pilot and 0 recommended changes. In accordance with Dillman, Smyth, and
Christian (2009) recommendations, an initial email was sent to the entire FEPA list serve
consisting of approximately 600 members, on April 24, 2014. A week later, on May 1, 2014, the
survey link was sent to the FEPA board of directors and on May 5, 2014 to the entire FEPA list

52

serve. Follow up emails were sent on May 12 and May 17. Additionally, on May 12, the
Governor’s Hurricane Conference took place in Orlando. Fliers were distributed at the FEPA
table at the conference to market the survey. Participants were offered a chance to win one of
twenty-five $10.00 Starbuck’s gift cards.
Phase II: Qualitative Research
In accordance with the explanatory sequential design, results from the quantitative
segment of the study drove follow-up qualitative sample selection as well as interview question
development. Figure 4 depicts factors driving both sample selection and development of
interview questions. Qualitative sample selection was driven primarily by specific demographic
groups based on geographic location and agency type. The researcher consulted with an expert in
the field of emergency management to ensure that of those respondents willing to be
interviewed, all county sizes (small, medium, and large) were represented as well as counties
from different geographic locations within the state (east coast, west coast, panhandle, and
central). Additionally it was ensured that representatives from all the agency types were included
(county, city, university, and private) in the qualitative sample.
Interview questions emerged from review of the survey responses and focused on outliers
in the quantitative data, non-significant results that were not expected, and significant results
(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). Each of these is discussed briefly: 1.) Outliers in the
quantitative data-for example, analysis of quantitative data revealed that agencies with no social
media policy but who actively engaged in social media were outliers- this resulted in an
interview question related to social media policy as well as inclusion of the outlying agency in
the interview sample; 2.) Non-significant results that were not expected- for example, analysis of
quantitative data revealed that contrary to what was expected, county size did not dictate whether

53

counties monitored social media or were familiar with social media. An interview question about
how monitoring is conducted was added to the interview guide to explore these results; and 3.)
Significant results- for example quantitative data showed that there was a statistically significant
relationship between level of government and agency comfort using data from a third party
technology group. An interview question exploring use of third party technology groups was
therefore added to the interview guide.
The interview guide included questions related to social media policy, monitoring
processes, use of third party virtual technology groups, verification of information received via
social media, existence of memoranda of agreements, and challenges associated with the
monitoring and use of social media in emergency management. All interview guide questions
were based on issues that emerged in the quantitative portion of the study. An interview guide
was developed and reviewed by committee members. See Appendix A.

Selection & Interview Question Development

The phone interviews followed a semi-structured format. Phone was selected as the
interview method, because it was more cost effective and efficient than face-to-face interviews.
In the present study, respondents were located across Florida. The geographic spread of the
respondents made them hard to reach and face-to-face interviews would have exceeded the
available resources (Sturges & Hanrahan, 2004). However, conducting phone interviews had the
drawback of not being able to see body language and facial expressions (Sturges & Hanrahan,
2004). Not all interviewees had access to video conferencing platforms such as Skype and
FaceTime and therefore, to maintain consistency, interviews were conducted by phone rather
than by video conferencing platforms. Emails were requested at the end of the survey for those
interested in participating in follow-up phone interviews. Interested participants who were
selected for follow-up interview were emailed and interviews were scheduled over a two week
period. Interview participants were randomly selected to receive a $20 Walmart gift card
incentive for participation. Civi.com, a transcription service was used to record and transcribe the
interviews. Interview participants were asked verbally for their consent and were informed that
they were taking place in research, that their responses were confidential and that they were
being recorded. Data trustworthiness, or credibility, was examined in several ways.
Several strategies were used to validate qualitative data and to ensure inference quality
and trustworthiness of both quantitative and qualitative throughout the entire mixed method
study. Trustworthiness of qualitative data was assessed in several ways. In particular, member
checking also called stakeholder checking (Suter, 2012) was used. Member checking is a method
in which major themes and findings are taken back to interviewees and verified, shared and
discussed. Clarification of researcher biases to maintain transparency and presentation of
outlying themes or disconfirming evidence (presentation of information that does not conform to

55

the themes) was used to ensure trustworthiness (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2006; Creswell, 2014).
In accordance with Creswell and Plano Clark’s (2007, p. 148) recommendations for reducing
threats to validity during research following the explanatory sequential design, the same
individuals were used for the quantitative and qualitative segments of the study (Creswell &
Plano-Clark, 2007).
Reliability plays less of a role in qualitative research than it does in quantitative (Creswell
& Plano Clark, 2007). Reliability in qualitative research refers to the consistency of the
researcher’s approach (Creswell, 2014) and to inter-coder reliability which can be calculated
using kappa (Bernard & Ryan, 2010). Transcript checking (ensuring that there are not obvious
mistakes in the transcript) and multiple coder review were used to determine reliability.
Specifically, another coder was asked to code the same transcripts to determine if there was
inter-coder reliability. This process was repeated until there was consensus about the codes.
Once the codebook reliability had been established a single coder was used to code the
qualitative data.
Data Collection Procedures
Recruitment for the survey was through the Florida Emergency Preparedness
Association. The Florida Emergency Preparedness Association (FEPA) has approximately 600
members from all levels of government, multiple response disciplines, private sector, nongovernmental, non-profit, volunteer and tribal. These, approximately 600 FEPA members,
received the survey. Letters of support to conduct a survey and follow-up interviews were
provided by both the Florida Emergency Preparedness Association and Division of Emergency
Management. This non-probability purposive sample was used for the dissemination of the
survey as this group is a representative segment of EM personnel in Florida.

56

In addition to identifying a champion within the organization (Fowler, 2014) discusses
the importance of having a known person disseminate the survey, recruitment strategies included
sending out pre-survey announcements via email, sending out the survey link with an email, and
sending out a minimum of one follow-up reminder. Fowler (2014) indicates that “the same kinds
of steps that have been found to be helpful to postal surveys are likely to help enlist cooperation
for internet surveys: identifiable sponsors, well-designed instruments, financial incentives, and
repeated contacts.” All of the steps described above were followed.
The survey was administered online. This type of administration is cost effective,
efficient, and enables a broad reach. Online surveys dispense with the need for data entry, are
convenient for both researcher and respondent and alleviate interviewer bias that can occur with
face-to face or telephone survey (Fowler, 2002). Finally, online survey administration was
selected because it is an appropriate option to use when the “population under study is
distributed across a large geographic area” as well as when the population all have access to
computer and the internet (Van Selm & Jankowski, 2006, p. 437).
Response rate is a challenge of using surveys, regardless of the mode of distribution.
Because of this, recommendations offered by Dillman, Smyth, and Christian (2009) for how to
ensure a high response rate were followed. These recommendations include: a user friendly
survey, personalized correspondence, inclusion of a small incentive, follow-up contact and
inclusion of a stamped, return envelope will result in higher response rate. In accordance with
these recommendations, the following steps were taken to ensure high response rate. (1.) A userfriendly survey was administered. Su et al. (2013) validated the survey and ensured that word
choice, instruction clarity, and overall survey flow was addressed up front via several layers of
field testing. The survey went through several iterations of pilot testing. (2.) Inclusion of a small

57

incentive. Participants had the opportunity to win one of twenty-five $10.00 Starbuck’s gift
cards. They were asked to enter their contact information in a separate screen after completion of
the survey. (3.) Follow-up contact—repeated contact was made, including an initial email
announcing the survey, an email with the survey link, and at two follow-up emails after
dissemination of initial survey.
Additionally, recommendations for online survey administration offered by Dillman,
Smyth, and Christian (2009, pp. 298-299) were taken. These included: (1.) Use of multiple
contacts and varying the message across them. (2.) Keeping email contacts short and to the point.
(3.) Taking steps to ensure that emails were not flagged as spam. This was done by having the
president of FEPA send out email correspondence. (4.) Providing clear instructions for how to
access the survey. (5.) Assigning each sample member a unique ID number.
Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with a subset of participants from the
quantitative portion of the study. Sturges and Hanrahan (2004) discuss the circumstances in
which telephone interviews may be appropriate; these include: sensitive topics, access to hard-toreach respondent groups, interviewer safety, and cost. They indicate that “telephone interviews
can be used productively in qualitative research” (p. 107). In this study, respondents were located
across Florida. The geographic spread of the respondents made face-to-face interviews costprohibitive.
Survey respondents were asked to provide email contact information if they were willing
to participate in a follow-up interview. The survey respondents selected for follow-up interview
were selected after analysis of the quantitative portion of the study and in partnership with the
doctoral committee practitioner. The interviewees were selected based on their geographic
location, county size, city/county pairings and inclusion of outliers such as private groups and

58

universities who participated in the survey. Data from the survey was used to guide the creation
of an interview guide (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Creswell, 2009).

Univariate Analysis. Quantitative data were exported from Qualtrics (Qualtrics, n.d.)
into SPSS for analysis. Prior to data analysis, data were cleaned to remove duplicate responses,
completely blank responses, responses limited to demographics only, and responses missing
demographics. Basic descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were calculated for each
survey response.
Bivariate Analysis. Prior to bivariate analysis, data were analyzed to determine if they
were parametric or nonparametric. Because data were parametric, a one way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to determine differences in response between agency types. It was also used
to determine differences in response between different levels of government. Because there was
not a large enough sample, Fisher’s Exact test was used instead of Chi-Square. Fisher’s Exact
test was used to determine if there were significant differences in categorical data responses
related to agency type or level of government.
Qualitative Data Analysis
The interviewees were selected based on their geographic location (if more than one
participant from a specific agency answered, both were interviewed, county size, city/county
pairings and inclusion of outliers such as private groups and universities who participated in the
survey.
Data from the survey were used to guide the creation of an interview guide (Creswell &
Plano Clark, 2007; Creswell, 2009). The interview guide (discussed earlier in the methods
section under Phase II Qualitative Data) was reviewed by committee members for clarity.
Interviews were recorded and transcribed for analysis using Civic.com recording and
transcription service. Each transcript was checked by simultaneously listening to the recording
and reading the transcript to ensure accuracy.

61

A codebook was constructed a priori based on questions from the interview guide. Ulin
et al. (2005) describe five steps to analyzing qualitative data. These steps are iterative and
include: reading, coding, reducing, displaying and interpreting; these five steps were adhered to
during the qualitative analysis. Specifically, the researcher read through each line of each
transcript and assigned codes to each discrete unit of meaning. Some of the assigned codes were
from the a priori list of codes while others were inductive, emerging as the transcripts were
reviewed. The codebook was modified as the interviews progressed in accordance with Miles
and Huberman’s recommendations (1994). From the individual codes emerged larger domains or
themes; these are represented in Table 11 in the results section. Once the initial codebook was
complete, the process of determining intercoder reliability was undertaken. Specifically, an
independent coder (a PhD who was experienced doing qualitative analysis) was trained on the
meaning of the various codes and discussion occurred until mutual understanding was reached.
The researcher then coded one transcript using the codebook. The researcher coded the same
transcript separately and then results were compared. The researcher and independent coder
discussed coding choices and further modified the codebook based on mutual understanding of
the themes. The researcher and independent coder then separately coded two other transcripts
and compared results. Results were nearly identical. The final codebook was used to code the
rest of the qualitative data. Coding was done by hand using Microsoft Word. Codes were cut and
pasted into the word document. Transcripts were then reviewed one by one and in instances
where codes emerged, lines from the transcript were cut and pasted under the appropriate code.
Coding and recoding were over when the analysis itself appeared to have run its course—“when
all the incidents were readily classified, categories were ‘saturated’, and sufficient numbers of
‘regularities’ emerged” (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 62).

62

Ethical Considerations
Ethical issues were addressed at each point of the research process according to
Cresswell’s (2014) recommendations. Prior to the study and during study design, issues of
participation, appropriateness of the study, and study methodology were addressed by ensuring
that: the literature supported the relevance of the current study; there were no conflicts of
interest related to funding or affiliations for the researcher conducting this study; letters of
support and participation were obtained from FEPA and the Florida Division of Emergency
Management; the University of South Florida Institutional Review Board (IRB) process was
completed.
The principles of respect for all persons, beneficence, and justice were followed
throughout the study. Informed consent that was not coerced was obtained. An informed consent
statement was placed at the beginning of the online survey and was read to participants at the
start of the phone interviews. Participants were able to withdraw from the study at any time.
While incentives were offered to participate in the study (Creswell, 2014), they were not
excessive or inappropriate (Miller & Salkind, 2002). During data collection, the researcher
maintained truthfulness, integrity, transparency and self- reflexivity; made sure data collection
was consistent from one participant to the next; preserved anonymity and confidentiality; and
avoided leading participants to a particular response during interviews (Creswell, 2014).
During the reporting phase of the study, the researcher ensured that data and findings
were neither falsified nor plagiarized; the researcher ensured that information harmful to the
participants was not disclosed (Creswell, 2014). The researcher strived to ensure that the
reporting of the data was clear, accurate, and thorough. A final report will be shared with
participants and other relevant stakeholders (Ryen, 2004; Creswell, 2014).

63

Finally, confidentiality was maintained in the following way: (1.) Participants were
assigned a study ID. This study ID was used throughout the study and its relationship to other
identifiers was stored in a locked cabinet with access only to the PI. All online data was
password protected; (2.) No respondent names were used in final reports. Data analysis followed
protocols approved by the committee and all findings, even unexpected or unwanted findings
were reported accurately and thoroughly.

64

Chapter Four: Results
The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which Florida EM agencies have
incorporated the monitoring and use of social media into their organizational processes. Results are
discussed per research question. Quantitative and qualitative results are given for each research
question.
Quantitative Overview
The survey was sent to the entire FEPA listserve, a group of approximately 600
individuals, on May 5, 2014. The survey closed on May 24, 2014 with 88 responses. Out of the
88 surveys, only 67 were used in data analysis. Figure 5 illustrates the survey case deletion
process. Survey participants had the opportunity to win one of twenty-five $10 Starbuck’s gift
cards. Despite following the Dillman, Smyth, and Christian (2009) approach for ensuring a high
response rate, the response rate (67 surveys received out of a possible 600) was 11.1%. Survey
respondents covered the major regions of the state with the exception of the panhandle. Two
counties from the Panhandle of Florida partially completed the surveys. During the period in
which the survey was disseminated, several Panhandle counties were in the midst of a disaster
which required federal public assistance; these included: Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and
Walton counties. Responses came from agencies in large, medium and small counties as
categorized in Table 10. The majority (58%) of respondents were from county government
emergency management agencies and had a position title of Emergency Managers or Directors.
The majority (80%) of respondents were over 40 years old. Tables 5-9 provide the demographics
for the survey respondents.
65

Low response rate is a limitation to the study and results should be viewed keeping
response rate in mind. Fowler (2014, p. 58) indicates that “although we can calculate a rate of
response, we usually do not know the effect of nonresponse on data.” Fowler (2014, p. 58)
discusses example studies which showed that “surveys with comparatively low response rates
producing results that are similar to those with a much higher response rate.” He also notes that it
is difficult to discern when low response rate is likely to indicate bias or not related to survey
content.

Qualitative Overview
Of the 67 survey respondents, 27 agreed to be interviewed and 13 of those were selected
for an interview (see Table 9). Interview participants received a $25 Walmart gift card. Sample
selection for the follow-up interviews were driven by demographic data such as geographic
69

location (including small, medium and large counties) and agency type including county, city,
sheriff, private, and university representatives. In instances where more than one individual from
an organization answered the survey and agreed to be interviewed, both individuals were
interviewed. For example, two people from St. Johns County Emergency Management and two
from Volusia County emergency management were interviewed. In some instances more than
one individual from an agency answered the survey but did not agree to be interviewed. When
selecting university, city, and first responder representatives for interview, the corresponding
county emergency management agency was also selected. For instance, a city and its
corresponding county emergency management agency were both selected as were a university
and its corresponding county emergency management agency. Similarly, a sheriff’s office and
the corresponding county emergency management agency were selected.
Several themes and subthemes emerged during qualitative analysis. Specifically, the
emerging themes are described in Table 11.

Table 11
Qualitative Themes and Subthemes
Both explicit and tacit knowledge play a role in agency familiarity with social media
The existence and content of social media policies related to the use of social media in EM varied
among agencies
Agencies used social media in different ways. The majority of agencies used social media to push
information out to the public.
Whether monitoring of social media was done in an agency depended on whether there was an
emergency activation or not.
Monitoring was conducted different ways among different agencies. It ranged from simply
“eyeballing” social media to more advanced use of analytics to monitor social media.
Agency use of social media in EM exists are at varying levels of maturity. Different agencies are at
different stages of evolution toward expanding their capabilities and processes.

Table 11. Continued
While agencies had some experience using social media in real-world events (most often as
information pushed out from the agency), they did not have experience in practicing the
verification of information being pulled in to the agency from social media
There were several challenges to the use of social media in EM. These included:
 Generational Issues
 Staffing
 Rumor Control/Information Verification
 Restrictive internal policies
 Leadership buy-in
 Ability to test social media and verification of data in a real-world event
 How to integrate various social media tools and platforms into a streamlined system
 How to speak with a unified voice
 The fact that monitoring does not occur 24/7 but the public’s use of social media might
Trust of information received via social media
While agencies identified challenges to the use of social media, they also saw the potential of the
tool.
Organizations are sharing promising practices with each other and improving their systems based
on what they learn from trainings and conferences.

Overviews of both the quantitative and qualitative data were provided above. Below is a
breakdown of quantitative and qualitative results as they relate to each research question.
Qualitative quotes will be designated with the agency type and county size for reference
purposes and to preserve respondent and agency anonymity.
1.) How knowledgeable are emergency management (EM) agencies in Florida regarding
social media?
Florida survey respondents considered themselves to be familiar (37%) with social media
(Table 12). Familiarity in this context is an expression of explicit knowledge (part of the DataInformation-Knowledge-Wisdom Hierarchy) or “know what” (this concept was discussed in
Chapter Two under Theoretical Framework). Florida respondents were most familiar with
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and consistent with the national survey, least familiar with the
following stakeholders, tools, and concepts such as Ushahidi, Nixle, and Open Source Data
71

(Table 13). The majority (63%) of respondents were familiar with the concept of Virtual
Operations Support Teams (VOST) (Table 14). VOSTs are groups of workforce multipliers who
assist organizations virtually (via the internet), during times of disaster, in sorting through the
large volumes of data generated by social media.

An ANOVA determined that there was no statistically significant difference among
agency type and familiarity with social media. An ANOVA determined that there was no
statistically significant difference among level of government and familiarity with social media
(f= 1.4; df= 6; p= .226). There was no correlation between age and familiarity with social media
(r = -.451; p< .05)
In addition to explicit knowledge (“know what”) revealed in the survey results, evidence
of tacit knowledge (“know how”) emerged during the qualitative interviews. This type of
knowledge is inherent based on background, skills training and experience. Specifically, the role
of Public Information Officer (PIO) emerged as a natural facilitator of the social media function
within agencies. This theme emerged as part of the discussion of how organizations could use
social media (specifically for monitoring) without having a social media policy in place.

Despite the absence of social media policy, one respondent knew what to do when it
came to using social media as part of his role as PIO. Often individuals in this role had previous

73

journalistic experience and training. When asked ‘who is the designated person for using social
media within the agency’, the respondent noted:
It’s just me for emergency management mainly because the county’s policy is that the
only ones that were allowed to speak with press are the county administrator, the fire
chief, and myself. Now, I’m a qualified and certified PIO so that’s maybe why. The fire
chief has been through PIO training and then the county administrator is also type 3
PIO, so. (County EM, Small)
Previous experience in the field of journalism/news added to the tacit knowledge related
to social media processes.
No. It’s basically done by the three professionals in our Public Information Community
Relations office. That’s myself included plus two other Public Information Officers who
are both former journalists. We’ve all been involved with social media from the onset of
social media like a lot of agencies have. (Sheriff, Medium)
Another respondent said:
I should mention something else, too. My background, if you go back many, many years
ago, I used to be in the news business. Having been in the news business, I’ve learned not
to trust anything you hear until you check it out. (County EM, Large)
2.) Do EM agencies in Florida use social media?
The majority of Florida respondents (89%) use social media in some way (Table15). The
majority of respondents indicated that their agency maintains a website, Facebook page, or
Twitter account (Table 16). Of the 13 respondents that were interviewed, 1 indicated that they do
not use social media at all. Four of the interviewees indicated that they do not have a social
media policy. Social media policies varied from very informal- “…it’s not exactly a written
policy”(County EM, Large); to general (non-EM specific agency social media policies) - “we do
have a social media policy for overall county use but there’s not one that is specifically separate
for the use of social media in emergency management”(County EM, Large); to specific
emergency management social media policies- “as far as any content, it has to be either
emergency-management related or something that our Public Information Officer feels would be
74

appropriate to go out under our emergency management Twitter handle and put on our
Facebook page.”(County EM, Large)
It was evident from the interviews that agencies use social media even without having a
written policy to guide social media use. For instance, in one agency, the social media policy
pertained only to tips on how to use social media in one’s personal life-“it has to do more with
our agency members’ use of social media, not so much our agency’s use of social media…so it’s
basically our agency members and their private lives. It kind of guides them what to do and not
to do with social media.” (County EM, Medium)
Other agencies were in the process of discussing the development of a policy to guide
their social media use. For instance one county said “In fact I was just in a meeting yesterday
where I’ve been tasked with developing the social media policy along with what we call the pit
crew. That is something that we plan on probably implementing in the next 30 to 60 days.”
(County EM, Medium)
Other agencies have policies related to pushing information out but not to pulling
information in (or monitoring) social media. For instance, one agency stated:
So we’re still in our infancy of trying to develop a policy of what it is that we’ll utilize to
monitor it. The way I have it set up right now is developing a team of four that can be
increased to as big as we need it” (County EM, Medium). Another indicated “yes, on
pushing out, very much so, on monitoring, less of a rule, as it were. (Private Industry)

3.) In what ways do EM agencies in Florida use social media?
Respondents indicated that social media is used by their agency to support routine
activities, planned events, or no-notice events as depicted in Table 17. A small percentage of
respondents indicated other uses for social media within their organization; these included uses
such as to gain situational awareness in the field, hazard notifications, emergency notifications,
to create public interest through public outreach, and to provide preparedness tips.

When asked to characterize the use of social media in real-world events, respondents
indicated that their agencies use social media to push information out to the public as well as to

76

monitor or pull information in as shown in Table 18. Qualitative interviews supported that the
push of information was more common than information pull. One respondent indicated that “in
my case emergency management we’re pushing out weather information, we’re pushing out
preparedness information or safety tips, city activities, that sort of thing” (City, Large). Another
agency indicated that “it’s basically…we’ll use it for public outreach, educational programs,
public safety alerts” (County EM, Medium). Another agency indicated that each department
within the organization had a specified day on which they could push information out via social
media:
For social media to push out something, there’s basically like you’re allowed to
on these normal operations days, push out on these days. Unless you have some
kind of planned event and then we’ll make special considerations but if you’re
designated as Monday, don’t push out on a Tuesday. (County EM, Large)

4.) Are EM agencies in Florida monitoring social media /pulling information IN?
The majority of respondents indicated that their agencies do monitor social media. In
particular, Facebook and Twitter were the most monitored followed by online news sources as
depicted in Table 19. It is important to note that in the qualitative interviews “monitoring”
ranged from just looking at the agency twitter page- “we just eyeball it”, (Sheriff, Medium) - to
conducting analytics to gain situational information in a systematic way during a real-world
event, as many respondents indicated they do- “we have a platform called HootSuite that allows
us to monitor several social media feeds by putting in key words” (City, Large).

57% indicated that they have goals related to the monitor real-time information daily (Table 20).
The majority of respondents 86% feel it is their agency’s responsibility to monitor social media
channels for a large-scale disaster (Table 21).

Survey respondents were asked to indicate what kind of information they would need in
order to gain situational awareness from citizens who want to communicate with them via social
media during an emergency. Responses varied from “hazmat releases, flooding/storm surge

79

impact, road closed due to debris, entrapped people (technical rescue)” to “I personally believe
there is too much liability involved in using social media as an official means of communication
for a request from a citizen- we do not control the platforms and therefore cannot rely on them
and consider them official.”
5.) What are the current capabilities for using social media in EM in Florida?
Several survey items helped answer this research question. Agency capability relates to
assessment by the respondent about the level of maturity of the organization’s capabilities;
existence of a social media policy; existence of a dedicated social media position within the
organization; buy in from leadership; and use of workforce multipliers. The result of each of
these survey items follows.
Respondents indicated that their agency’s capabilities were at various stages of maturity
related to their social media goals (Table 22). The majority of respondents (38%) indicated that
their agency’s capabilities were moderately mature. Only 5% indicated that their capabilities
related to their goals were completely mature, while 7% indicated their agency has no social
media goals. The majority (69%) of survey respondents indicated that their agency does have a
social media policy in place (Table 23). Of those interviewed, nine indicated that their agency
had a social media policy and four indicated that their agency did not have a social media policy.
Only 25% indicated that their agency had a widespread commitment and buy-in, related to social
media, from senior staff and political officials (Table 24).

Respondents (86%) indicated that their agency does not have a dedicated social media
position separate from the Public Information Officer (Table 25). Both quantitative and
qualitative data confirmed that responsibility for social media activities primarily resides within
the Public Information Officer role (Table 26). There was no statistically significant difference
among agency type and agency use of social media. There was no statistically significant
difference among level of government use of social media (2= 9.304, df= 6, p= 0.149). There
was also no statistically significant difference among agency type and use of social media (2=

Virtual technology communities (VTCs) are a workforce multiplier resource for agencies.
Very few agencies (16%) indicated that they had previously worked with volunteer technology
communities (VTCs) such as Crisis Commons or Humanity Road to supplement their response
efforts (Table 27). Only one respondent (Table 28) had formal memoranda of agreement with
volunteer technology communities (VTCs). However, 53% of respondents (Table 29) indicated
that they do have memoranda of agreement with other types of agencies/organizations (agencies
other than VTCs) including a statewide mutual agreement, American Red Cross, colleges and
universities, school board, etc. In most cases (78%), memoranda of agreement are formal (Table

In addition to staff structure, policies, memoranda of agreement, and leadership buy-in,
agency capabilities also pertain to what technology infrastructure and data/analytic systems are
in place. The majority of agencies use existing technology to support social media and use ad
84

hoc manual review to analyze data. Tables 32 and 33 depict what respondents indicated related
to agency capabilities in the areas of technology/infrastructure and data /analytics respectively.

Qualitative data provided examples to enrich quantitative findings. Interviewees
discussed the use of workforce multipliers to augment current capabilities during activation. For

85

example, some agencies indicated that they would call in other county staff (e.g., waste
management staff) or librarians to aid in the monitoring of social media during activation:
Yes, I have three individuals that are PIOs that are from other agencies. They’d come in
and augment our Incident Management Team. We have one county PIO, one from
Raulerson Hospital, and then one from—oddly enough—waste management. (County
EM, Small)
and
Our ESF 14, which is public information, is staffed probably 50% by a library staff who
are very well versed with people. They’re also very well versed with social media and
technology. (County EM, Medium)
Qualitative interviews supported the notion that social media use by emergency
management agencies is in various phases of maturity. While some agencies are not allowed to
use social media at all, others have more advanced systems already in place and still others are in
the process of putting systems into place. Agencies were at various levels of evolution. Some
were in the process of developing policies related to social media use while others were testing
systems through exercises. For instance, one respondent said:
That is something that we do plan on probably implementing in the next 30 to 60 days…I
look at the policy two folded. One is a policy for users who are using the government
platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and the other for internal measures as well…Yes.
There has to be that (monitoring) especially if you use social media properly where
there’s a free flow of information, where people can submit suggestions or write on your
timetable. (County EM, Medium)
Similarly, a respondent from a different County EM agency indicated the evolution of
their process:
We had a slow start. The county was hesitant to jump in to the social media
arena. So, we had to do some reassurance on how social media was going to be
used, that there would be structure in place, that we’d be very careful with it,
conservative as to what we put out on social media, make sure that there were
check points involved, that more than one of us would look at it, those types of
things; that we wouldn’t just jump in with both feet without having a plan. So,
that’s why we have a social media policy (County EM, Medium).

86

Another County EM agency indicated that they have a plan for how they would
monitor social media based on what they learned from other agencies that had been
through a real life emergency such as Hurricane Sandy (which includes use of virtual
operations support teams):
Actually, something I discussed…one of the Public Information Officers for the county is
assigned to our division. I’ve discussed that with her, specifically, because during
Hurricane Sandy over a period of about seven days, there were 20,000,000 tweets that
were related to that disaster. So I asked her, “How are we going to handle this?” She
said that she would dedicate someone to specifically be monitoring social media the
entire time an event was going on. I’m not sure if that would be enough. I’m thinking we
might have to get a firm that specializes in doing that. I think they’re called virtual
media, something or other, but anyway. (County EM, Large)
In general, one County EM agency on the east coast of Florida stood out as having a
progressive attitude toward use of social media in emergency management and as being farther
along than other counties in the evolution of its systems:
I did setup a hashtag during the hurricane exercise and we have a couple interns working
for us. I gave them a couple pages of tweets that I had prepared with the hashtag that we
were using. So we have exercised that but we’ve never actually created one for a real
event yet. (County EM, Large)
A city EM agency in central Florida is also relatively mature specifically in its
monitoring capabilities.
During an emergency, during an activation, we have to make sure that the road is open
two way, that our social media outlet becomes a way of pushing out information but also
becomes a way of receiving information from the citizens and the people out there seeing
what they see and reporting what they’re reporting…We have a platform called
HootSuite that allows us to monitor several social media feeds by putting in keywords.
Like for example, tornado, [city name], or severe storm [city name], something to that
degree. We’re able to capture postings and tweeting going on in reference to that
particular buzz word, that we’re looking at keyword, that we’re would looking for the
[city name] area. (City, Large)
The qualitative interviews also highlighted the distinction between social media use
during a normal (non-emergency) day versus during an emergency activation. For instance, when

87

asked if anyone from the agency would see a message posted on Twitter, one agency said
“Depending on the time of the day. Obviously, if we know there’s severe weather coming and a
there’s a threat of tornados or if there’s a hurricane coming, yes. We’re going to be monitoring
as part of our activation.” (County EM, Medium).
6.) Do EM agencies in Florida have experience using social media in real world events?
When asked about their use of social media in real-world events, 74% of respondents
indicated that they had (Table 34). When asked to characterize the ways in which their agency
used social media during a real-world response, respondents indicated that their agencies use
social media to push information out to the public as well as to monitor or pull information in
(Table 35). Social media was also used to enhance situational awareness by gathering, filtering,
and analyzing information. Respondents indicated that they have used social media in response
to a real world event including storms, floods, tornadoes, major public or newsworthy events,
e.g. NASCAR races, protests, fires, and gas leaks. The majority of real world events in which
social media was used occurred from 2012-2014 while in a few instances social media was
incorporated earlier (the earliest instance noted was 2004).

Despite the use of social media in real world events, very few agencies indicated that they
had worked with volunteer technology communities such as Crisis Commons or Humanity Road
to supplement their response efforts (results discussed under research question 5). There was no
statistically significant difference by agency type and whether an agency had used social media
in a real world event or not (2= 8.932, df= 12, p= 0.763). There was no statistically significant
difference between level of government and whether the agency had used social media in a real
world event (2= 3.846, df= 6, p= 0.766).

Similarly, there was no statistically significant

difference between agency type and response to the question “Do you feel it is your agency's
responsibility to monitor social media channels for a large-scale disaster?” (2= 6.452, df= 6, p=

channels for a large-scale disaster?” (2= 3.789, df= 3, p= 0.369).

Although the majority of survey respondents indicated having used social media in a real
world event, many of the interviews indicated that they had not been tested in real-life events,
and therefore the processes for verification of information had not been tested. For instance, one
agency said:
It’s a real good question. We haven’t had a practical exercise or a real-world event to
test that function so a lot of it is very ethereal at this point, very theoretical. Well, if it did
happen, this is what we think we would do, but it has not been a proven method to this
point. (County EM, Large)
The majority (56%) of respondents indicated that their agency’s use of social media in a
real-world event was successful while 44% indicated it was partially successful (Table 36).
Reasons given for a partially successful response, rather than a successful response, included the
need for more staff, the need for staff who are acquainted with the systems, no real ways to
measure the impact because social media was one tool among many, no real commitment from
senior leadership to use social media aggressively, unfamiliarity with Twitter (one organization
indicated they had just started using it days before the event occurred and had not become
familiar with it yet), lack of coordination across the agency, and the fact that the public would
have to be subscribers to the social media sites in order to get information. One respondent
indicated that social media use during the event was:
Partially successful because there were rumors that just could not be suppressed. [There
was] extreme anxiety in the community about closing of bridges which were major
connectors to arterials and evacuation routes. Even with the assistance of the major
television and cable outlets, rumors continued to persist that the city intended to close
bridges prior to rush hour commencement. (City, Large)
When asked if their agency would be able to effectively incorporate social media
activities into a large scale disaster, (84%) indicated the agency would (Table 37).

7.) What are Florida EM attitudes toward social media?
A series of items in the survey examined issues of social media value and
trustworthiness. Specifically, the majority of agencies indicated that they would not act on the
information unless it was verified by a response agency or other trusted source (Table 38) and
that they would attempt to verify information received via social media sources (Table 39). Only
7% of respondents indicated that they trust social media more than traditional media outlets
(Table 40). There was a significant difference between the level of government and whether the
agency would be comfortable receiving and using data that was compiled by a third party group
91

or platform (2= 12.824, df= 6, p= 0.002). However, there was no statistically significant
difference between agency type and whether the agency would be comfortable receiving and
using data that was compiled by a third party group or platform (2= 9.988, df= 12, p= 0.596).

Qualitative data provided examples of the immediacy of information available via social
media outlets. One interview respondent indicated that in 2012 Tropical Storm Debbie
“verification was interesting because I found that social media actually provided more real time
results than what we were actually getting from the Emergency Operations Center, believe it or
not” (County EM, Medium). Other interview respondents noted timeliness of information as a
potential challenge saying “If I identify, if I’m looking at tweets that are three hours old, is that
sufficient or do I need to be able to look at something that is no longer than 30 minutes
old?”(County EM, Large).
Various strategies for verification of information were discussed by interviewees; these
included self-policing that occurs on social media sites in which other social media users verify
posted information or county level verification in which county employees such as law
enforcement, fire rescue or medical reserve core volunteers were used to verify information
particularly as it pertained to assessment of damage. To illustrate: “most of our population
concentration is in about a 10-mile square and the rest of the county is rural agriculture. So
when we get reports, it’s very easy to get people out to those different areas” (County EM,
Small). Another agency in a larger county indicated that they too use law enforcement to verify
information. Trust among leadership was an attitude discussed by some interviewees. One
participant noted:
I understand why not everyone should be doing that because, let’s face it, a lot of people
will get on social media and they’ll play and they’ll do their personal stuff and it’s not
necessarily work related, but there’s a perceived, at least in my opinion, a perceived lack
of trust as to county employees accessing social media. (County EM, Large)
and
We had a slow start. The county was hesitant to jump in to the social media arena. So,
we had to do some reassurance on how the social media was going to be used, that there
would be structure in place, that we’d be very careful with it, conservative as to what we
93

put out on social media, make sure that they were check points involved, that more than
one of us would look at it, those types of things. (County EM, Medium).
8.) What are the main challenges to social media use by EM agencies in Florida?
The primary barrier related to social media use by EM agencies in Florida relative to their
agency goals were lack of lack of dedicated personnel for social media operations (Table 41).
Those respondents, who indicated insufficient funding, noted that funding was insufficient for
personnel, training, and technology.
While the majority (65%) of respondents indicated that social media training
opportunities have been made available to their organization (Table 42), the majority (63%) also
indicated that their agency needs training on how to incorporate social media use and monitoring
into its organizational processes (Table 43). Of the respondents who answered, the majority
(74%) indicated that both face-to-face and online training is needed (Table 44).

What format of training would be preferable?
Answer

Analysis of the qualitative data revealed several themes related to the challenges of using
social media in emergency management. Similar to the quantitative results, qualitative data
highlighted lack of sufficient staff as a significant challenge noted by several interviewees. For
instance, one respondent noted “Sometimes in the small counties, their emergency management
director is doing five or six other jobs as well” (County EM, Large). Another participant noted
“staff, especially since the 2008 crunch. Most departments that had three or four people are now
down to two or one.” (County EM, Small)
95

Generational issues and insufficient real-world incidents to test established policies and
plans also emerged as themes in the qualitative data. An example of a generational issue was
articulated by one respondent:
I think one area which I often bring up and I don’t think many people like it. We did a
survey awhile back. We were taking a look back in 2006 working at how we disseminate
information, public information. It was conducted by university students. The university
students came back and said, “You’re doing everything the old fashion way. You’ve got
printed paper that nobody reads and it all says the same thing,” which it does… So the
reality is the world is moving away from that and the world is moving into technology
where people will not be seeing hard copies of slick paper that they’re going to throw out
as soon as they get it…..Here where I’ve got the interns who are putting these things on
to my computer so we can now use it. I never heard of the [doggone] systems before but
they said that the Dropbox is used all the time by university students when they’re
working on projects together and all. So it’s entirely generational issues. (County EM,
Large)
and
I would say that it would have to be with- I don’t know how to say this diplomatically but
it’s kind of an age thing. The majority of – and this is probably true in general- most
emergency management agencies, the staff is fairly senior in terms of how long they’ve
been working in emergency management. (County EM, Large)
Other challenges noted by interviewees were, rumor control, and trust or the need for
information verification (examples are given below respectively):
Well I think the number one thing is the validation process. It’s still kind of new and
different to be able to do that and there are a few good ways of doing any kind of
immediate vetting or verification. (Private Industry)
and
So, the social media, it is problematic because you do have a lot of voices speaking at
once and you have to try to discern what is correct, what is incorrect out there, and be
able to work on that. (Sheriff, Medium)
Internal policies were also discussed by participants as being a challenge to the use of
social media in their organization. Some agencies have policies forbidding social media use.

96

Other agencies have policies that make social media use cumbersome. One respondent provided
an example of how policy restrictions interfere with social media use saying:
The other thing is there’s also a review process. So before you post on your emergency
management Wednesday, it has to go to the clearing house for approval ahead of time.
Social media is more instantaneous than these traditional media communications and
they’re treating social media, in my opinion, more like normal, mainstream media
instead of the new instantaneous accessed social media. (County EM, Large)
Talking with a unified voice- was also a theme articulated by respondents- “With our
organization, probably true with all organizations, is just knowing what everyone else is doing
so we can basically provide efficiencies in a unified voice and information” (University,
Medium). Another challenge stated in various ways by multiple participants was that their
agency was not open 24/7 and therefore could not be relied on by the public to have a constant
social media presence.
The other question we get quite a bit is, ‘Why don’t we use it for immediate notification?’
Like tornado warnings and things like that. What we tell them is, “We are not manned
24 hours a day. We are an 8:00 to 4:30 operation unless there is a disaster and there is
a way faster applications out there for their smartphones and emails other than us using
Twitter. (County EM, Medium)
Finally, the need to integrate the various types of social media platforms emerged as a
concern for several respondents. “I would say the biggest challenge is the various and sundry
platforms that are out there that depending on who we’re trying to reach they may gravitate to
one network or another.” (County EM, Medium)
Despite the challenges, agencies recognize the potential of social media as a tool for
emergency management. Respondents (62%) indicated that they believe social media will have a
significant potential future impact on response (Table 45). While leadership and generational
issues can often stymie forward movement and adoption of new technology, many of the
respondents expressed that they believe social media will be more widely accepted and serve as a

97

valuable tool to emergency management in time. As one respondent noted, “I think that social
media is probably – It’s going to be how people communicate primarily in the future” (County
EM, Large). Another participant stated “No, I think this is going to evolve over time. With 911
now being able to receive text messages with the integrated public warning system, I think that
it’s going to become more paramount”(County EM, Small). Another interviewee stated:
I personally take the standpoint that, to me, social media is going to just become second
nature like email. It’s just something that we all use and we all just need to know how
each other are using it… Like it’s just a tool that everyone is using for whatever they
need to use it for. (University, Medium)

CHAPTER 5: DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter summarizes the study findings. It is organized into the following sections: (1.)
Discussion; (2.) Strengths and Limitations; (3.) Conclusions; (4.) Practice Implications; and (5.)
Recommendations.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which Florida EM agencies have
incorporated the monitoring of social media into their organizational processes. It was based on
the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom Hierarchy (DIKW Hierarchy) which describes how
data from social media is converted into information and knowledge which subsequently allows
decision makers to apply wisdom to making emergency management related decisions. Several
main discussion points emerged during the data analysis. In particular, EM agencies in Florida
are relatively knowledgeable about social media; they use social media in EM to some extent;
they have varying levels of capabilities throughout the state; they have limited experience using
social media in real-world events; and while agencies have various challenges in incorporating
social media use into EM systems, they are gradually doing so with some agencies leading the
way for others across the state. Each of these discussion areas is elaborated as they pertain to the
study research questions.
1.) How knowledgeable are emergency management (EM) agencies in Florida regarding
social media?
Quantitative and qualitative data highlighted the distinction between explicit and tacit
knowledge associate with the DIKW Hierarchy. Respondents had both technical (explicit) and

99

tacit (inherent) knowledge of social media. Technical knowledge informs tacit knowledge when
combined with experience. Specifically, the role of Public Information Officer emerged as a
natural facilitator of the social media function within agencies. For instance, despite the absence
of social media policies in some agencies, the inherent skills associated with the role of PIO
contributed to the ability of respondents to use social media. This observation has implications
for how emergency managers and in particular Public Information Officers are trained and from
what backgrounds these individuals are hired into the emergency management field. For
instance, during the interviews it emerged that some Public Information Officers had
backgrounds as journalists. Librarians also were noted by interviewees as having the inherent
skills needed to handle social media. Because staffing is a major challenge related to use of
social media in emergency management, drawing human resources from other divisions,
bureaus, agencies or organizations into the emergency management field may be useful.
2.) Do EM agencies in Florida use social media? and
3.) In what ways do EM agencies in Florida use social media?
Quantitative and qualitative data indicated that agencies in Florida are using social media
but in different ways among different agencies. Agencies are using social media mainly to push
information out to the public. However, some agencies are using social media in more advanced
ways such as to pull information in from citizens especially during an emergency activation.
Maturity of social media systems was not necessarily a product of county or agency size per se
but rather a product of: existing social media policies; decisions made by leadership; what
trainings people had attended; and staffing capabilities.
Existing social media policies were often restrictive and prevented emergency personnel
from using social media to its full potential. Restrictive social media policies were not a product

100

of county size. For instance, one large county, has a restrictive social media policy which is
offset by a city within that county which has a more flexible policy.
Decisions made by leadership and compelling leadership to see the importance of using
social media in emergency management were mentioned by interviewees in several instances.
Generational issues were also noted by participants. Buy-in from leadership will ultimately be
critical for social media processes to be incorporated into emergency management organizations.
The structure of Florida’s emergency management system is such that each county emergency
management agency is a separate agency. While they work collaboratively with the State
Division of Emergency Management, they do not specifically report to the Division director.
Because of this structure, each county has different processes for handling emergency
management and use of social media within emergency management; this was evident in the
interviews.
Trainings seemed to play a factor in use of social media in emergency management.
Interviewees from both small and large counties who had attended trainings on the use of social
media in emergency management seemed more knowledgeable and open to using social media
and to investigating social media’s potential use in their organization.
Staffing also played a role on the ability of current systems to include use of social
media. Large, medium, and small counties all seemed to struggle with lack of adequate staff
available to engage in social media activities. During activation counties, of all sizes, called on
external resources such as other county staff or volunteers to increase their workforce.
4.) Are EM agencies in Florida monitoring social media/pulling information IN?
Monitoring of social media is a more advanced use of social media in emergency
management. Many agencies have not yet moved from the less advanced function of pushing

101

information out to the public via social media to the more advanced function of pulling
information in from the public. Qualitative interviews illuminated two distinctions related to
monitoring of social media from those agencies that were using social media in this way. One
distinction was between use of social media during an activation versus in daily routine. It was
evident from the interviews that agencies (regardless of size) are not equipped to monitor social
media 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, during emergency activation, agencies bring in
volunteers and county employees to meet surge capacity. There is a clear distinction between
agency capabilities for social media use during normal operations versus during an emergency
activation. During normal operations and emergency activation both, it appears that agencies are
largely using social media to push information out to citizens. During emergency activation
however, agencies seem also monitor social media. However, agencies do not seem to actively
and efficiently using citizens as force multipliers to provide key situational awareness during an
event. This result is consistent with the American Red Cross (2010b) report which states “Some
counties have made steps toward starting to build capacity, but at present they are mostly push
systems to aggregate and report information, rather than systems that capture and aggregate
incoming information (pg.3).”
The second distinction which emerged from the qualitative data was related to how
agencies were defining “monitoring”. Monitoring of social media took various forms from
simply “eyeballing” what citizens were posting to using basic analytics like Hootsuite to cull
information from social media. Agencies are not taking advantage of the more advanced systems
for capturing information from citizens via social media or of virtual operations support teams
and virtual technology communities; this is an untapped resource that should be explored by
agencies in the future.

102

5.) What are the current capabilities for using social media in EM in Florida?
There are various levels of maturity in the capabilities of agency systems for monitoring
and using social media during an emergency. “There are 67 counties and probably 134 different
ways” (Large, County EM). While some of the agencies who participated in the study are using
social media in the same ways, what each particular agency is doing varies across the state and is
not necessarily predictable based on county size. For instance, county size did not determine
advanced use of social media. To illustrate, a large county Emergency Management’s social
media policy is very restrictive which makes the use of social media in emergency management
cumbersome. It was evident from both surveys and interviews that agencies vary along the
continuum from immature to mature systems. Some agencies appeared to be stuck at the
immature end, having done very little toward taking advantage of social media as a tool for
emergency management, while others were in the midst of updating policies and exploring
promising practices. It did not appear that any of the counties interviewed had yet reached full
maturity. The current findings are consistent with the national survey summary, in that
“penetration of social media remains incomplete” (Su et al., 2013, p. 63).
The concept of capability included factors such as leadership buy-in, existence and
content of policies related to social media use, existence of a dedicated social media position
within the organization, use of workforce multipliers, partnerships with virtual technology
support teams, available technology and data analytic infrastructure. These factors were not
consistent among the various agencies or even among county emergency management agencies.
This variation in agency capabilities reflects the decentralized structure of Florida’s emergency
management system. While the Florida Division of Emergency Management exists as a central
point for emergency management in Florida, that agency does not control each of the individual

103

county EM agencies nor the city EM agencies. A more centralized EM structure might provide a
uniform set of standards and capabilities across the state for EM agencies. Until the structure
shifts the state will likely continue to see agencies in different stages of evolution and maturity
related to EM functions and capabilities.
6.) Do EM agencies in Florida have experience using social media in real-world events?
The survey response rate drops off as the questions related to real-world use of social
media begin. Survey respondents answered questions at the beginning of the survey but as
questions moved into practical application of social media in real-world emergencies, fewer
respondents answered the question. This resulted in missing data, or a low N, for real-world
questions. Qualitative interviews underscored this lack of experience testing social media in realworld events. In particular, interviewees indicated they had not been able to test methods for
verifying information coming in through social media. Verification of information coming in
through social media is essential and yet processes for verification in many agencies are only
theoretical and have not yet been tested. The majority of survey respondents indicated that they
did have experience using social media in a real-world event. However, qualitative interviews
revealed that real-time testing of social media had not occurred in the agencies of many of those
interviewed. Interview respondents highlighted the importance of verifying information coming
in through social media but indicated that systems for verification had not been well tested. The
American Red Cross report (2010b, p. 12) underscores the issue of authentication and
verification of information coming in through social media. They state “once the technology and
people are in place to parse incoming social emergency data, we’ll need to authenticate and
verify that information so it becomes actionable”. It was evident through the interviews that

104

agencies are struggling with some of the same issues regarding information verification that were
highlighted in the American Red Cross report.
7.) What are Florida EM attitudes toward social media?
Generational issues and leadership buy-in are key factors in the maturity of agency social
media processes. A large portion of EM leadership is over the age of 40 (80% of survey
respondents were over age 40). Social media technologies are relatively new. For example,
Facebook was founded in 2004 and Twitter in 2006. Because these technologies are relatively
new, seasoned EM professionals may not be as open to using them as younger incoming EM
staff. Overall agencies seemed to recognize the potential for social media use in emergency
management but struggled with knowing how to cull through the vast amounts of data with
limited staff and how to verify information coming in through social media channels. In time, as
some agencies take the lead in developing more progressive systems for using social media in
EM, promising practices will be copied by other less advanced agencies. This pattern is already
being demonstrated in Florida. For instance, Volusia County indicated that they are using the
national response to Hurricane Sandy as a model for implementing social media in their agency;
while Okeechobee County indicated that it is incorporating promising practices learned at a
training in Honolulu. The systems for using social media in Florida will continue to advance as
progressive EM agencies take the lead and continue to implement and emulate promising
practices learned from other states or from national level response. One at a time EM agencies in
Florida will make advances to their systems and will share those advancements with others. In
this way the entire state will gradually evolve its systems.
8.) What are the main challenges to social media use by EM agencies in Florida?

105

There are several challenges to incorporating the use of social media into EM in Florida.
The main challenge noted by respondents was staffing. Several documents have been written
addressing this issue. For instance, the American Red Cross and United States Department of
Homeland Security Virtual Social Media Working Group series discuss the challenge of
supplementing workforce in order to handle the bulk of data coming in from social media. As
agencies in Florida begin to model the national promising practices and forma partnerships with
third party virtual technology groups, the problem of inadequate staffing will somewhat resolve.
Another challenge which could easily be addressed is the lack of social media policies
within organizations in Florida. Several social media policy templates exist and can be copied by
EM agencies without existing policies. Generational issues, leadership buy-in, and trust are
challenges which will all likely resolve themselves over time as social media becomes more
ubiquitous and as promising practices for data verification are shared.
Strengths and Limitations
There are two main strengths associated with this study- 1.) the study’s uniqueness and
2.) the explanatory sequential design model. 1.) The current study is unique. Aside from the
national survey conducted by Su et al. (2013), the landscape of social media use in emergency
management in Florida is largely unexplored. While this study does not present the entire
picture, it is a necessary starting point for investigating what the use of social media in
emergency management in Florida. 2.) Another strength of the study was the use of the
explanatory sequential model design. This design allowed follow up interviews to be conducted
to better explore the nuances of the survey data.
Limitations of the study include: 1.) Low survey response rate; 2.) Lack of
generalizability; 3.) Missing data; and 4.) Structure of Florida’s Emergency Management

106

System. Each of these is discussed in more detail. 1.) Low survey response rate was a limitation
to the study. Out of the approximately 600 FEPA members, 88 surveys were received and 67 of
those were viable for data analysis. There is ultimately no way to know why individuals chose
not to complete the survey. Possible reasons for low response include length of the survey,
method of survey link distribution, and lack of priority-for instance, during the period when the
survey was open, several counties in the Florida panhandle were undergoing an emergency
activation which took priority over completion of the survey. 2.) Lack of generalizability is also
a limitation. Data from one agency cannot be used to make inferences about other agencies.
Similarly, data from one county cannot be used to make inferences about other counties. 3.)
Missing data are a limitation of the study. Not all 67 respondents answered every question.
Response drops off once questions start getting more specific about use of social media in a realworld event. This could indicate that respondents did not have experience using social media in
real world events. The survey could have been structured such that respondents were required to
answer every question. Questions could have been worded to include an N/A or “I don’t know”
response. For instance, one of the demographic questions asks “what is your agency type”, one
of the choices is government; the subsequent question asks respondents to indicate level of
government. The sequence of the question makes it appear as though there are missing data for
the question “what is your level of government?” (44 responded) when in fact there were only 44
individuals who indicated in the prior question about agency type that they were part of a
government agency. The addition of an N/A option for the question “what is your level of
government?” would have eliminated any confusion related to missing data. The survey should
have been set up with skip patterns to eliminate the issue of missing data; 4.) The structure of
Florida’s emergency management system is decentralized. In other words, no one agency is in

107

charge of Florida’s emergency management. While there is a Division of Florida Emergency
Management, each county emergency management agency is its own independent agency and
does not report to one centralized leader. This method makes the information gathered unable to
be generalized because each agency is a unique entity. In addition, emergency management is
interdisciplinary in nature. Multiple agencies are involved in emergency management; and
during an emergency activation, transient structures, such as the EOC emerge to respond. The
current study was only able to take a small snapshot of a much larger intricate system. While
data gleaned from the surveys and interviews is relevant and useful, it is hardly the whole picture
of social media use in emergency management in Florida.
Conclusions
Overall, it appears that Florida has an immature yet evolving system for use of social
media in emergency management. There appear to be variations across the state in capability and
maturity levels. Leadership buy-in, internal policies, trainings attended, and available
technological infrastructure are all factors in the level of maturity of the individual systems. The
decentralized structure of Florida’s Emergency Management system adds to the variations in
maturity of social media systems from one agency to the next. While Florida EM agencies are
knowledgeable about social media in general, they lack policies, systems, and staff to take full
advantage of social media as a tool in emergency management. The results of the Florida Survey
are largely consistent with those of the national survey. So while Florida’s system may still be in
its infancy, Florida is not necessarily behind compared to others. Due to small sample size it is
not possible to generalize results. However, the intention of the study was not to generalize
across the state but rather to take a snapshot of the current uses of social media in EM in
particular agencies in Florida. Data demonstrated that each agency varied from the next and that,

108

while some agencies shared similar approaches, there is not one coordinated system across the
state.
As the use of social media in emergency management continues to be investigated at a
national level, promising practices will likely emerge and be filtered down to states and counties
for implementation. Many interview respondents cited trainings related to using social media in
EM that they had attended. As more training is offered, and promising practices are shared,
systems will likely continue to evolve. The evolution of systems within agencies will depend
largely on leadership attitudes, organizational policies, and staffing resources.
Practice Implications
Several promising practices emerged during the study, such as, the use of call center staff
and librarians to monitor social media, use of interns to research how other agencies who have
been through real life emergencies are using social media, partnerships with VOST (virtual
operations support team) units, and strategies for information verification- such as use of damage
assessment teams.
There are gaps in social media use in emergency management in Florida. Agencies are
not taking full advantage of social media’s capabilities in practice. The implications for systems
that are lagging behind are a less efficient and coordinated response and potential lives lost.
Citizens are using social media to communicate with emergency management agencies and
unless system capabilities are advanced enough to capture communications from citizens during
and emergency vital information is missed and response is hindered.
While survey respondents indicated that training opportunities related to social media are
plentiful, they also indicate that they would like to receive more training. One major practice
implication is training of the public health workforce and public health students in the use of

109

social media in EM. Continuing education courses providing hands on practice for using social
media can be developed along with exercised based skills building activities. Masters level
students could receive education related to using social media in courses such as social
marketing and health promotions.
Recommendations
Several recommendations can be made related to the use of social media in emergency
management in Florida. Each of these will be discussed in detail: 1.) Reverse mentoring
programs; 2.) Development of social media policies; 3.) Continue to attend trainings and
conferences; 4.) Explore promising practices; and 5.) Social marketing campaigns for citizens.
Reverse Mentoring Programs
Reverse mentoring programs in which younger interns and employees are paired with
more senior emergency management staff would allow for a bidirectional knowledge exchange.
Data savvy interns or employees could be paired with more senior staff to help set up social
media systems while in turn learning emergency management principles and wisdom that more
senior staff has to impart.
Development of Social Media Policies
It was evident from both the quantitative and qualitative data that social media policies do
not exist consistently across the state. While some agencies have structured social media
policies, others have no social media policy or unwritten social media policies. Social media
policies are necessary for agencies to have a clear process for the use of social media, to ensure
the agency is speaking with a unified voice and to articulate strategies for information
verification. Agencies should work with each other to develop their social media policies and
rely on promising practices and social media policy templates already created by other agencies.

110

This recommendation is consistent with the literature which calls for a redesign of current EM
models to better incorporate social media tools and participation by citizen groups (Magsino,
2009; Sutton et al., 2008; USDHS, 2012c). Sutton, Palen, and Shklovski (2008, p. 2) indicate a
“need for changes in EM policy that take into account and recognize the advantages of the way
the public is using information and communications technology during disasters”.
Trainings and Conferences
Another recommendation is that agencies continue to participate in training and to attend
conferences. It was evident from the qualitative data that conferences and trainings played a role
in contributing to progressive attitudes and practices among those agencies using social media.
Specialized trainings developed particularly to provide agencies with the skills and tools to
integrate social media into their processes would be useful.
Explore Promising Practices
Agencies also might benefit from exploring promising practices related to augmenting
workforce during an emergency activation. Increasing workforce capabilities by tapping into
county resources such as librarians and other county staff, using call center volunteers to monitor
social media platforms, and establishing memoranda of agreement with virtual operations
support teams are all ways agencies can increase their staffing.
Social Marketing Campaigns
Finally, social marketing campaigns, relating to the use of social media during an
emergency, should be targeted to the general public. Citizens are already using social media to
communicate with emergency management agencies. It is therefore imperative that emergency
managers work with the general public to maximize the usefulness of this tool during an
emergency. It is important for emergency managers to determine what information they need

111

from citizens and to tell citizens explicitly via social marketing campaigns. For instance, similar
to the “stop, drop, and roll” campaign for fires, citizens might be told “#location; #need,
#agency”—similar to the Tweak the Tweet syntax format piloted by Starbird and Palen (2011).
Dissemination Plan
The topic of social media use in EM crosses many disciplines. Manuscripts are published
in journals from multiple disciplines. Potential journals which could accommodate the topic of
social media use in EM include: Journal of Information Science; Journal of Emergency
Management; International Journal of Web Based Communities; or the American Journal of
Public Health. Currently, the bulk of the scientific literature on this topic is published in
information science journals, journals specific to web based communications, and in conference
proceedings. In addition to submitting the research findings to the types of journals described
above, an executive summary will be provided for the Florida Emergency Preparedness
Association.
Public Health Implications
According to the World Health Organization, public health refers to all organized
measures (whether public or private) to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life among
the population as a whole. Its activities aim to provide conditions in which people can be healthy
and focus on entire populations, not on individual patients or diseases (World Health
Organization, n.d.). Emergency management is a system that encompasses many aspects of
public health including law, policy, systems, safety, and well-being of the population. During a
large scale emergency, infrastructure can be disrupted, people can be injured, without clean
water, without shelter or proper care; these are all public health issues that are necessary to
address by having the most efficient and cutting edge response effort available. Social media,

112

especially social media use by citizens to convey situational awareness, are an emerging tool that
aid emergency managers to keep the public safe and aware of the public’s needs during an
emergency. It is a resource that agencies can take advantage of to provide a better and more
coordinated response. It has the potential to save lives, reduce suffering and speed recovery of
impacted communities.
