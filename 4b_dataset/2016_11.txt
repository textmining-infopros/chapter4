ABSTRACT

The information society is also an aging society. This means that as information
technology becomes woven into the fabric of daily life, the median age of humanity continues to
rise. The participation of this growing population of older adults in the information society is
often seen in the popular press and even in scholarship as dependent on their ability to cope
with their supposedly declining minds and declining bodies. This study reframes this
phenomenon by studying older adults in the communities where they live.
This dissertation asks to what extent and how does community-based information
infrastructure support older adult digital literacy. Three theories shape this analysis: 1)
information infrastructure as the co-creation of information systems and information users (Star
& Ruhleder, 1996), 2) digital literacy as the integration of technology into our lives (Prior &
Shipka, 2003), and 3) older adulthood as a socially shaped stage in the human lifecourse
(Hutchison, 2014). Using the extended case method approach (Burawoy, 1998), these three
theories are scrutinized in relation to the empirical reality I studied. Through this situated
understanding (Suchman, 1987), this dissertation contributes to the development of these
theories, which are used in multiple academic disciplines. This dissertation further contributes
to the fields of community informatics and library & information science, both of which are only
beginning to study aging in the information society.
I study senior centers and public libraries, institutions that are ubiquitous in the United
States of America, as community-based information infrastructure. This dissertation consists of
a comparative case study of three public libraries and three senior centers in a particular
Midwestern metropolitan area. I direct particular attention to 209 of the older adults who

ii

participate in technology support services at these six institutions. During a one-year period
involving 267 field sessions I conducted participant observation with these older adults, as well
as with staff. I also interviewed 54 of these older adults, and seven staff members. I finally
reviewed documents produced in the past and in the present by and about the institutions.
The overall finding from this investigation is that community-based information
infrastructure is indeed supportive of older adult digital literacy. However, this support is not as
robust as it could be. Particular findings include: 1) community-based information infrastructure
emerges out of and evolves through individual and social struggle; 2) community-based
information infrastructure is rooted in the lives of older adults; 3) ageism conditions both
community-based information infrastructure and older adult digital literacy; and 4) older adults
are determined and creative learners who with support integrate technology into the diverse
rhythms of their lives.
These lives can be best understood through a new concept articulated in this
dissertation, the informatics lifecourse. This concept refers to how a person learns technology
through the stages of his or her life. The informatics lifecourse is populated by countless
informatics moments (Williams, 2012), instances of giving and receiving technology support.
Breakdowns in the informatics lifecourse of the individual relate to breakdowns at the level of
the community. This finding illustrates how individuals and communities are interdependent.
By foregrounding the agency of older adults in the information infrastructure they and
others rely on to learn technology across time, this dissertation challenges deficit models of
aging premised on decline and disengagement. Public libraries and senior centers are
overpressured, publicly funded institutions. By embracing the agency of older adults, these
institutions could reconfigure themselves for an information society that is aging.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
In the popular press (and even in the scholarly literature) the digital literacy of older
adults is often understood in relation to their supposedly declining minds and bodies. That is,
age-related disabilities orient the discourse on older adults and digital technology (Bowen,
2012a). In this dissertation, I instead study this topic in the communities where older adults live.
Just as it proverbially “takes a village to raise a child,” it may likewise take a local community to
support people as they learn, practice, and expand digital literacy in old age. To analyze the
hypothesis that community support is crucial for the digital literacy of older adults, this
dissertation draws on the theory of information infrastructure to ask: To what extent and how
does community-based information infrastructure support older adult digital literacy?
This chapter argues for the practical importance of this study in the world today. This
argument has three parts: (1) that the information society is also an aging society; (2) that by
participating in public libraries and senior centers, older adults participate in public spheres; and
(3) that older adults play important leadership roles in their communities. Better support for the
digital literacy of older adults, therefore, could increase their capacity to use technology for
themselves and for their communities.
The structure of the remainder of this dissertation is as follows. Chapter 2 situates this
study in the academic literature. Chapter 3 explicates the methods used to answer this research
question. Chapter 4 analyzes public libraries and senior centers as community-based
information infrastructure. Chapter 5 analyzes older adult digital literacy among the participants
in this study. Finally, chapter 6 integrates the findings from chapters 4 and 5 to answer this
dissertation’s overarching research question. This concluding chapter also discusses the
implications of this dissertation for theory, practice, and teaching.

A. The information society is also an aging society
Since the 1970s, societies around the world have been transitioning from industrial to
informational societies (Castells, 1989), in which digital information technology has been
integrated into all aspects of society (Nedovic-Budic & Williams, 2013). This information
revolution has been an uneven one; as Nedovic-Budic and Williams (2013) point out, “not every
sector of society has crossed the digital divide” (p. 5).
The exclusion of older adults from the information society has been called the grey
digital divide (Friemel, 2014; Millward, 2003; Morris, 2007), but this divide is closing. In the USA,
six in ten older adults now regularly go online, including four out of ten adults aged 80 and older
(Smith, 2014). Nonetheless, digital technology has not yet become fully integrated into older
adulthood (Damodaran, Olphert & Sandhu, 2013).
As the median age of the US and global population rises, so do the stakes of this study.
The core institutions of the modern age were built on the premise of a large number of youth
and a small number of elders. This premise increasingly does not hold true. Between 1960 and
2010, the percentage of the USA population aged 0 to 18 decreased from 36% to 24% (Table 1).
During this same time period, the percentage of the population aged 65 or more increased from
10% to 13%. The U.S. Census Bureau (2010) estimates that by 2100 the percentage of the
population aged 65 or more will exceed the percentage of the population aged 0 to 18.

With the aging population comes changes to the demographics of older adulthood. In
the popular media it is common to hear discussion of what the Los Angeles Times (Lee, 2014)
calls “a widening demographic gap between older whites and young minorities” (p. 1). In
contrast, empirical data show that the median ages of US minority populations are in fact rising
faster than the median age of the European American population (Vincent & Velkoff, 2010). In
the years to come there will be both more young minorities and more old minorities in the USA.

Many nations around the world are also aging. In 1965, 38% of global humanity was
aged 0 to 14, while only 8% was aged 60 or more (Table 2). By 2050, 21% of the world will be
aged 0 to 14, equal to the percentage aged 60 or more. In 1950 the nation of Japan was among
the youngest on the planet, with a median age of 22. By 2025 its median age will be 50 (HelpAge
International, 2014; NOVA, 2004; United Nations, 2002; United Nations, 2013; World Health
Organization, 2014). Many nations are predicted to soon have a higher median age than the
USA: South Korea by 2015, China by 2025, Thailand and Vietnam by 2035, Mexico by 2045, and
Brazil by 2050 (United Nations, 2002).
The aging of humanity affects local communities. The aging of the baby boomer
generation, born between 1946 and 1964, has been a major force shaping the aging of
communities in the USA (Gergen & Gergen, 2000). In 2000, 27% of the local community where
this study took place was aged 0 to 19 (Table 3). By 2010, that percentage had dropped to 25%.
Simultaneously, the percentage of the community aged 50 to 74 (i.e. the baby boomer

3

generation) increased from 14% to 17%. The percentages of the local population aged 20 to 49
and aged 75 or more held steady between 2000 and 2010.

B. By participating in public libraries and senior centers, older adults participate in public
spheres
The public sphere is neither the state nor the private sphere of domestic life but rather
the "sphere of non-governmental opinion-making" (Habermas, 1974, p. 49). The public sphere is
important because, as Alkalimat & Williams (2001) state “the public sphere is a social ecology
for relevant discourse that shapes policy, public opinion, and the dominant intellectual themes
of an era” (p. 182). Since Habermas coined the term in 1962, scholars have shown that there are
multiple public spheres, including counter-public spheres formed by populations marginalized
from the mainstream public sphere (Downey & Fenton, 2003). For instance, the African
American church is an institution in the African American counter-public sphere (Alkalimat &
Williams, 2001).
Public libraries and senior centers are also institutions in public spheres (Buschman,
2003; Kim & Ball-Rokeach, 2006). Public libraries are places in which diverse sections of a local
community come together to access information and exchange ideas. Senior centers are also
places where older adults gather to socialize, engage in programs, and discuss ideas. In

4

communities throughout the USA, senior centers and public libraries occupy overlapping roles in
the lives of older adults (Table 4). As digital technologies become deeply embedded in society,
both institutions have included more technology support services for older adults.

Table 4: Comparison of how older adults participate in public libraries and senior centers.
Lists based on Schull, 2013, p. vi; Beisgen & Kraitchman, 2003, pp. vii-viii & x.

Generally funded by local government (Beisgen & Kraitchman, 2003, p. x), senior centers
emerged in local communities throughout the USA after World War II. Now numbering 11,400
across the country (National Council on Aging, 2014), they have been described as “the one
community institution that our independent elderly can identify as theirs” (Cohen, 2003, p. ix).
This statement receives empirical support in research on the roles of senior centers in local
communities (Myerhoff, 1980). Research also shows that senior centers confront many
obstacles as they reconfigure themselves to support the digital literacy of the older adults that
participate in them (Gardner, Kamber, & Netherland, 2012).
Not all older adults in the USA participate in senior centers. Depending on how older
adulthood is understood, there are between 107 million (aged 50 and older) and 45 million

5

(aged 65 and older) older adults in the USA (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014), and of that number the
National Council on Aging (2014) estimates that only one million older adults participate daily in
senior centers. Nonetheless, senior centers aspire to be and often are community hubs for older
adults.
Public libraries also aspire to serve all members of local communities, including older
adults (van Slyck, 1995; Zickuhr, Purcell, & Rainie, 2014). There are 16,536 public libraries in
communities throughout the USA (American Library Association, 2016). Despite this mission to
serve all, public library work with older patrons only began receiving national attention during
the second half of the twentieth century. In 1957, the American Library Association’s Adult
Services Division administered a survey of public library services for older adults. This survey led
to the publication in 1961 of Service to the Aging, the first handbook on public library services
for older adults (Casey, 1975). In 1975, the American Library Association’s Reference and Adult
Services Division (now Reference and User Services Association) published Library Services to
Older Adult Guidelines, the first professional guidelines on this population (American Library
Association, 1987). The guidelines have been revised three times, in 1987, 1999, and 2008
(American Library Association, 2008).
Schull (2013) identifies the period from 2005 to 2011 as “a turning point, a time when
librarians started to respond to the aging of America” (p. vii). During this time, librarians at the
vanguard of this trend developed new programs and services for older adults. Increasing focus
on lifelong learning in the USA’s Institute of Museum and Library Services drove many of these
developments (Borg & Mayo, 2005; De la Peña McCook & Barber, 2002; Rothstein & Schull,
2010), and some public libraries started initiatives to support older adults learning digital
technologies (Schull, 2013, p. vi). Despite these advances, however, research suggests that many

6

public libraries have not yet reconfigured themselves to support the digital literacy of older
adults in their communities (Bennett-Kapusniak, 2013; Charbonneau, 2014; Perry, 2014).

C. Older adults play leadership roles in their communities
Through seven years of community informatics research on digital heritage in local
communities, I discovered that older adults play important leadership roles in their
communities. From 2007 to 2009, I conducted action research with the Katherine Dunham
Center for Arts and Humanities in East St Louis, seeking to understand how the preservation of
the center’s archival records relates to the empowerment of the marginalized African American
community in which the center is located (Lenstra, 2008). I found that the nucleus of the
center’s board, tasked with sustaining the center across time, is composed of retired older
adults.
The finding that older adults play leadership roles in their communities was extended in
a subsequent research project, though somewhat inadvertently. This study, which ran from
2010 to 2013, investigated how a collaboratively constructed digital heritage library, known as
eBlackCU, became integrated into community life (Lenstra & Alkalimat, 2012a). Although the
project initially focused on teenagers, older adults participated more and more as it developed.
The formal structure of the project included me hiring, training, and supervising a team of 10
teenage digital archivists, in addition to collaborating with two local high schools (Lenstra,
2014b). I found, however, that the people most engaged in the project were older African
Americans. Older adults wanted help using the digital library to access heritage information, and
they also wanted to contribute memories and documents to the digital library. In 2012, a
statewide workshop series on Digital Local & Family History organized in and around Illinois

7

public libraries confirmed these trends: the median age of the 70 participants was 60 (Lenstra,
2014a).
Most fascinating of all, I also discovered older adults already using digital technologies
to lead community archives. I identified one older adult who from December 2009 to February
2010 posted almost 9000 photographs that document her community to Facebook (Table 5).
This woman has continued this work into the present and is known as the unofficial historian of
her local African American community. The digital practices of older adults like her suggest that
better support for the digital literacy of older adults will enable older adults to use technology to
lead their communities in similar ways.

D. Summary
In our increasingly digital society, older adults have much to offer. Nonetheless, digital
divides hinder the full participation of older adults in their communities. As institutions in the
public sphere, public libraries and senior centers could support and may already be supporting
the digital literacy of the older adults. This dissertation investigates this topic by asking to what
extent and how do these institutions of community-based information infrastructure support
older adult digital literacy.

CHAPTER 2. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
This chapter argues for the theoretical and scholarly importance of this dissertation by
situating it in the research literature of multiple academic disciplines. The literature on the topic
of older adult digital literacy tends to quickly pass over the institutional and community contexts
in which digital learning takes place. In this dissertation, I study older adult digital literacy in this
community context by utilizing the theory of information infrastructure to understand to what
extent and how public libraries and senior centers support older adult digital literacy.
Theoretical understanding of the topic of older adult digital literacy is further hindered
by assumptions in the literature that: (1) older adults should use technology like young people,
and (2) that the aging minds and bodies of older adults structure their relationship with
technology. In addition, theoretical ambiguity around the concept of “older adulthood” itself
hinders our understanding of older adult digital literacy. As a result of these ambiguities and
lacunae in the literature, more research is needed to understand how and why communities
support older adult digital literacy. To reiterate, this problem is important in the world because
(1) our information society is also an aging society, and (2) older adults play important
leadership roles in their communities. Public libraries and senior centers are institutions in the
public sphere that may already structure how older adults engage with technology.
Understanding the roles these institutions play in the digital literacy of older adults will improve
the capacity of these and other institutions to create a more inclusive information society.
By way of introduction to this review of the literature, I now define the terms of this
dissertation’s research question in relation to the literature. The research question investigated
in this dissertation is: To what extent and how does community-based information
infrastructure support older adult digital literacy?

9

By community, I mean multi-generational groups of people connected by a shared
history, and based in the geographical spaces where daily life is lived (Williams & Durrance,
2009), and by information infrastructure, I mean the relationships between information systems
and information users (Star, 1999). These always evolving relationships lead to always evolving
information institutions. By older adult, I mean humans occupying that stage of the human
lifecourse which occurs during the latter period of a normal life: a life that does not suffer from
premature death. The boundaries of this stage of life are cultural and social and change over
time, and from place to place (Cole, 1992). By digital literacy, I mean the state of having
integrated digital technology into the social activities of life (Prior & Shipka, 2003, p. 185). Since
there are multiple ways of being in the world, there are multiple ways to be digitally literate.
This review of the literature begins with the theory of information infrastructure. This
theory has been used to understand governance, scholarly communication, and corporate
organizations. Although some scholars have found that information systems condition how
older adults learn technology, the relationship between information systems and the digital
literacy of older adults has not been systematically analyzed. More generally, the information
infrastructure of marginalized communities has not been systematically analyzed.
After establishing the theoretical framework of information infrastructure, I then discuss
how scholars understand digital literacy to be shaped in social settings, through the actions of
daily life. Beginning in the late 1980s, a growing number of scholars have studied how and why
older adults learn and use digital technologies. Nonetheless, we lack theoretical understanding
of older adult digital literacy as a social phenomenon shaped in local communities.
A problem facing our understanding of older adulthood is that there is no scholarly
consensus on what “older adulthood” actually means. In studies of older adults and digital

10

technologies, older adulthood has been operationalized in multiple ways. To understand older
adulthood on a firm theoretical footing, I draw on the lifecourse approach to sociology to
suggest that older adulthood is a socially evolving stage of the human lifecourse.
Finally, I introduce the field of community informatics. Community informatics scholars
have found that local, historical communities shape how people use and learn to use digital
technologies. This review of the literature shows that research is indeed emerging on the topic
community informatics and older adults, but more research is needed to theoretically
understand how communities support the digital literacy of their older members.
Having surveyed the body of scholarly knowledge on older adulthood and digital
literacy, and identified some lacunae within, this chapter concludes by discussing the literature
on the methodology and methods used to conduct this investigation.

A. Information infrastructure and older adults learning technology in institutions
The theory of information infrastructure was chosen as a guiding theoretical framework
for this dissertation for three reasons: (1) the theory frames information users as active agents
in information systems; (2) unlike other theories premised on this assumption, information
infrastructure has a specific multi-dimensional definition that aids in its operationalization; and
(3) the theory has not been widely used to understand how marginalized communities use
information, suggesting a gap in our theoretical understanding that this dissertation can
address.
Information users as active agents in information systems. Over the last 50 years,
scholars in the field of library & information science have debated how to study information
users and information systems. Before the 1980s, much of the literature focused on information

11

systems. The paradigmatic case of systems-centered research is Parker and Paisley’s study of
information systems for scientific communication (Parker & Paisley, 1966). Reacting to this
trend, scholars such as Dervin and Nilan (1986), Kuhlthau (1991), and Wilson (2000), among
others, established through their research user-centered theories of information behavior. The
focus in this research is on how users and user groups search for and use information.
More recently, theories of information behavior have shifted from information users in
the abstract to information users in the context of information systems (Courtright, 2008).
Related to trends in social informatics and in science and technology studies (Frohmann, 2004;
van House, 2003), this shift has emerged around concepts such as information infrastructure
(Star & Ruhleder, 1996), cyberinfrastructure (Atkins et al., 2003), and socio-technical systems
(Lamb & Kling, 2003), among others.
In these new theories of information behavior, the focus is on the interchange and
interplay between, as well as the mutual shaping of information systems and information users.
As Lamb and Kling (2003) wrote in their critique of the user-centered paradigm:
Using analyses from a recent study of online information service use, we develop an
institutionalist concept of a social actor whose everyday interactions are infused with
ICT use. We then encourage a shift from the user concept to a concept of the social
actor in IS research. We suggest that such a shift will sharpen perceptions of how
organizational contexts shape ICT-related practices, and at the same time will help
researchers more accurately portray the complex and multiple roles that people fulfill
while adopting, adapting, and using information systems. (p. 197)
As Lamb and Kling suggest, the focus in these new theories of information behavior is on
analyzing both information systems and the social actors who shape them: systems shape users,
and users shape systems. This theory has many parallels to recent media and communication
scholarship focused on understanding how technology users play active roles in designing the
technologies they use (Oudshoorn & Pinch, 2003).

12

Contributing to these theoretical trends, Star (1999) theorizes that information
infrastructure results from the interactions of information users and information systems.
Information infrastructure, she writes, is “a fundamentally relational concept, becoming real
infrastructure in relation to organized practices” (Star, 1999, p. 380). Real infrastructure here
consists of those information systems that have been integrated into the organized practices of
a group.
Guribye (2015) traced the conceptual history of information infrastructure back to Kling
and Scacchi’s (1982) work on the Web of Computing. Kling and Scacchi (1982) found that
“computing consists of a web of practices and interconnected computational units” (cited in
Guribye, 2015, p. 186). Here again, the focus is on interconnected systems and users. According
to this theoretical framework, to analyze information infrastructure requires attending to the
interactions between information systems and information users. Information infrastructure is
not just stuff, the substrate of information practices. Rather, information infrastructure
conditions the information practices it supports and is in turn adapted and changed through
those practices.
Studying information infrastructure. Like all theories, the theory of information
infrastructure evolves over time. Although Star and Ruhleder (1996) initially defined information
infrastructure as consisting of eight dimensions, Star (1999) later added a ninth. More recently,
Guribye (2015) added another dimension to aid in research on information infrastructure
designed to support learning, bringing the total to ten.
The ten dimensions used to study information infrastructure in this dissertation are:
•

Embeddedness. Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social
arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily distinguish the several
coordinated aspects of infrastructure.

13

•

•
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Transparency. Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have
to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those
tasks.
Reach or scope. This may be either spatial or temporal—infrastructure has reach
beyond a single event or one-site practice.
Learned as part of membership. The taken-for-grantedness of artifacts and
organizational arrangements is a sine qua non of membership in a community of
practice. Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be
learned about. New participants acquire a naturalized familiarity with its objects, as
they become members.
Links with conventions of practice. Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the
conventions of a community of practice (e.g., the ways that cycles of day-night work
are affected by and affect electrical powerrates and needs).
Embodiment of standards. Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions,
infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools
in a standardized fashion.
Built on an installed base. Infrastructure does not grow de novo; it wrestles with
the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths and limitations from that
base. Optical fibers run along old railroad lines; new systems are designed for
backward compatibility, and failing to account for these constraints may be fatal or
distorting to new development processes.
Becomes visible upon breakdown. The normally invisible quality of working
infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes
out, there is a power blackout. Even when there are back-up mechanisms or
procedures, their existence further highlights the now-visible infrastructure.
Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally. Because infrastructure is
big, layered, and complex, and because it means different things locally, it is never
changed from above. Changes take time and negotiation, and adjustment with
other aspects of the systems are involved. Nobody is really in charge of
infrastructure. (Star, 1999, pp. 381–382)
Has a pedagogical approach. In the analysis of educational and learning practices,
the presence of (or even the lack of) a pedagogical approach will serve a central
role, as the object of such practices is related to some instructional or learning
activity. (Guribye, 2015, p. 190)

To help scholars visually understand the interplay of these different dimensions,
Bowker, Baker, Millerand, and Ribes (2009) arrayed eight of these dimensions along
technical/social & global/local axes (Figure 1). According to this model, some dimensions of
information infrastructure tend to be more shaped at the local or global levels and at the
technical or social levels. Bowker et al. (2009) write:

14

In building cyberinfrastructure, the key question is not whether a problem is a “social”
problem or a “technical” one. That is putting it the wrong way around. The question is
whether we choose, for any given problem, a primarily social or a technical solution, or
some combination. It is the distribution of solutions that is of concern as the object of
study and as a series of elements that support infrastructure in different ways at
different moments. (p. 102)
These different dimensions of information infrastructure, and their interrelationships,
collectively compose a theory of information behavior. This theory is premised on the idea that
information systems and information users co-evolve.

Figure 1: Information infrastructure as distributions along technical/social and global/local axes. From
Bowker, Baker, Millerand, & Ribes, 2009.

The social processes through which information infrastructure evolves over time are
often not visible to those who create or rely on it (Star, 2002, p. 116). Bowker (1994) calls the
process of making information infrastructure visible through research an “infrastructural

15

inversion” (p. 10), in which social practices are inverted to understand how infrastructure
supports them. Without infrastructural inversion, we cannot understand how information
infrastructure shapes our social world (Bowker & Star, 1999). All social practices have an
infrastructural component, but we rarely attend to infrastructure in the course of daily life, even
though our lives depend on it. It is only through infrastructural inversion that the invisible can
become visible.
Gaps in our understanding of the information infrastructure of marginalized
populations. In LIS, the theory of information infrastructure has had its biggest impact in
research on how scientists and specialists use information and information systems (Palmer &
Cragin, 2008; van House, 2003). Past research on information infrastructure has analyzed
science (Bowker et al., 2009), ICT for Development (Ure et al., 2009), government (Edwards,
Bowker, Jackson, & Williams, 2009), health care (Sahay, Monteiro, & Aanestad, 2009), and
workplaces (Pipek & Wulf, 2009). Some of these scholars have started a new field they call
Infrastructure Studies (Edwards et al., 2009; Jackson, Edwards, Bowker, & Knobel, 2007).
This field has struggled to attend to the information infrastructure of marginalized
populations. In a special issue on infrastructure studies in the Journal of the Association for
Information Systems, Edwards, Jackson, Bowker, and Williams (2009) found that:
Questions of distribution, power, and justice need to be addressed urgently and
systematically by our field. How can claims on, through, and against infrastructure be
formulated, organized, and heard? What constitutes adequate representation or
participation in the process of infrastructural change and development? Under what
conditions can rival interests in infrastructure (large and small, modest and profound)
be acknowledged, addressed, and accommodated, in ways that enhance the legitimacy,
appropriateness, and long-term efficacy of infrastructural change? (p. 372)

16

This statement suggests that issues of social justice and equity are not currently being addressed
in scholarship on information infrastructure. This work can only be achieved by examining the
infrastructure of people who face injustice and inequity in their daily lives.

Older adults learn and practice digital literacy in institutions
Some scholars have found that institutions condition how older adults learn technology.
However, the relationship between information infrastructure and the digital literacy of older
adults has not been systematically analyzed. Most research on this topic quickly passes over the
roles of institutions in the digital literacy of older adults. This suggests that an infrastructural
inversion of older adult digital literacy could add to our understanding of this phenomenon.
In a study of older adults in the USA and in China using technology, Xie (2005) found
that: “the patterns and characteristics of SeniorNet and OldKids users' online and offline
interactions are influenced by the history, mission, and available resources of these
organizations” (p. 177). Sayago and Blat (2010) conducted a longitudinal ethnographic study of
computer labs in senior centers. They found that older adults adapt these spaces to how they
want to use technology. Ito, O’Day, Adler, Linde, and Mynatt (2001) also found that older adults
adapt a social networking site to meet their needs. Gardner, Kamber, and Netherland (2012)
found that the organizational context of technology support services in senior centers shapes
how older adults learn technology there:
In the typical arena of organizations and agencies providing services to older adults,
technology programming often plays a marginal role (i.e., a service appended to
providers’ core competencies such as meals provision and case management and
provided through volunteer or non-specialist staff). As a consequence, technology
programs are often delivered in fragmented, or ad hoc fashion, and falter due to erratic
staffing, inappropriate curriculum, technology breakdowns, poor funding, and limited
capacity. (p. 13)

17

These findings illustrate how older adult digital literacy and learning are shaped by the
institutions and organizations where these practices take place.
Many other studies of older adults using technology take place in local institutions, but
without attending to the institutional contexts of that use. For instance, in studies of older
adults learning and using technology in senior centers (Davidson, Santorelli, & Kamber, 2012;
Lee, Chaysinh, Basapur, Metcalf, & Mandalia, 2012; Saunders 2004), senior computing clubs
(Burgess, Hasan & Alcock, 2013; Naumanen & Tukiainen 2009; Wood, Lanuza, Baciu, MacKenzie,
& Nosko, 2010), and assisted living facilities (Linton 2012), the focus has been on the older
adults themselves. The institutional contexts of their digital practices are passed over quickly.
Public libraries have also been studied in relation to the digital practices of older adults.
As public libraries endeavor to adapt to their aging communities, support for older adult digital
literacy has become a role many public libraries have taken on (Rothstein & Schull, 2010; Schull,
2013). For instance, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions’ (IFLA)
bibliography of library literature on disadvantaged persons published between 2001 and 2008
shows that approximately one-third of the literature on library services for the elderly focuses
on technology (Locke, Panella, & Girolami, 2010). Xie and her colleagues have found that public
libraries in the USA help older adults learn digital technologies (Xie & Jaeger 2008), particularly
in relation to health information (Xie & Bugg, 2009). Wicks (2003) also found public libraries
innovating to support older patrons who desire to learn computing. Kumar, Ureel II, King, and
Wallace (2013) found that computer science students who volunteer in a rural public library to
help older adults learn technology contribute to the digital literacy of older adults. In Romania,
Cimpoieru (2011) found that partnerships between public librarians and senior centers enable

18

senior centers to better support older adult digital literacy. This finding suggests that senior
centers and public libraries can work together to support older adult digital literacy.
Nonetheless, there are gaps in our understanding of how public libraries are
reconfiguring themselves to support the digital literacy of older adults. In her survey of public
libraries in New York City and Atlanta, Perry (2014) found that, in general, public libraries have
not yet fully reconfigured themselves to serve their aging communities. Similarly, in her survey
of the public libraries in US capital cities, Bennett-Kapusniak (2013) found that very little
programming exists for older adults. In particular, computer technology services were found to
be lacking. Charbonneau (2014) found that public library websites do not adhere to seniorfriendly website guidelines. These findings suggest that public libraries do not always provide
robust support for the digital literacy of older adults, but more research is needed of this topic.
Past research has relied on surveys of librarians or the analysis of library websites. Less studied
has been how older adults, as active agents in their communities, shape the technology support
services they use in public libraries.
In summary, the theory of information infrastructure provides conceptual tools for
understanding how information users and information systems co-evolve. The emerging field of
infrastructure studies has focused primarily on scientists and specialists. Our understanding of
the information infrastructure of marginalized populations is minimal. Scholarship on how
institutions shape the digital practices of older adults suggests that using the theory of
information infrastructure to understand older adult digital literacy could enrich scholarly
understanding of this topic.

19

B. Older adult digital literacy is a social phenomenon
Increasingly, scholars recognize that digital literacy is a social phenomenon. That is to
say, people use and learn to use technology in social contexts. This conceptualization of digital
literacy is not universally held in the academy. For instance, some theories of information
literacy in library & information science assume that literacy is a process that takes place solely
in the individual’s mind (e.g. Mackey & Jacobson, 2014). Digital literacy does have cognitive
dimensions, but increasingly scholars in the fields of education, computer supported
cooperative work, library & information science, and elsewhere find that literacy in the
information age is best understood as a social phenomenon, not limited to the mind of any one
individual (Belshaw, 2012).
Theoretical understanding of the digital literacy of older members of society is limited.
Research up to now has focused primarily on young people and on students (Bowen, 2011).
Nonetheless, an emerging body of research literature investigates how older adults learn
technology, although this literature has tended to focus on how older adults use digital literacy
to improve their health (Bowen, 2012b; Heart & Kalderon, 2013; Morris, 2007; Neves, Amaro &
Fonseca, 2013). It is undeniably important that older adults live healthy lives, but the same is
true for all sectors of the population. As a result of this focus on health in the research on older
adult digital literacy, we lack a robust understanding of older adult digital literacy in general.

Digital literacy is social
In recent years, digital literacy has been studied by many scholars. This literature has led
to the growth of ever-more-complex typologies of what it means to be literate in the digital age
(Belshaw, 2012). Historically synonymous with the ability to read and write, what it means to be

20

literate has changed as the communications landscape has changed. These new literacies
(Lankshear & Knobel, 2011) include information literacy, computer literacy, media literacy,
digital literacy, and a host of others. For theoretical clarity, this dissertation encompasses all of
these different literacies within the concept of digital literacy, since they all require being able to
use digital technology with some fluency.
Two bodies of literature shape how the concept of digital literacy is used in this
dissertation: (1) Education literature that theorizes digital literacy to be shaped and enacted in
society (Bowen, 2011; Gee, 2010; Ito et al., 2010; Prior & Shipka, 2003), and (2) computer
supported cooperative work (CSCW) literature that theorizes digital learning as a social
accomplishment among groups of people (Epperson, 2006; Guribye & Wasson, 2002; Randall,
Harper & Rouncefield, 2005; Twidale, 2005). Both traditions utilize interviews and ethnography
to study digital literacy and learning, but where education scholars study digital literacy in
society and in individual lives (Bowen, 2011; Flower, 2008; hooks, 1994; Prior & Shipka, 2003;
Selfe & Hawisher, 2004), CSCW scholars focus on the particularities of digital learning as it
emerges in real-time in situated spaces (Guribye & Wasson, 2002; Twidale, 2005). In both fields,
digital literacy and learning are theorized as emerging out of the social situations of the
individuals and groups studied.
Scholars in library & information science also contribute to the development of social
theories of digital literacy. In her discussion of the information literacy literature, Pawley (2003)
called for research that attends to the political, economic, and institutional contexts of literacy.
Based on research on how the Chicago Public Library supports digital literacy, Williams (2012)
and her colleagues (Duffy, Jennings, & Williams, 2012) adapted the traditional logo of the

21

American Library Association, which focused on the individual, to foreground the social
dimensions of digital literacy and learning (Figure 2).

Symbol, the American Library Association; new National Library Symbol, American Library Association;

& Williams, 2012.

Older adult digital literacy is also social
A growing number of scholars have studied how and why older adults learn and use
digital technologies. Nonetheless, we lack theoretical understanding of older adult digital
literacy as a social phenomenon. This review of the literature on older adult digital literacy
reveals two primary gaps in our understanding of this phenomenon. First, scholars have
assumed that older adults use technology in ways that mirror how young people use technology
(Bowen, 2011). Second, scholars have assumed that older adults use technology primarily to
contribute to their health (Heart & Kalderon, 2013). As these scholars point out, these
assumptions hinder our ability to understand how older adults learn and use technology in daily
life.
Much of the research literature on digital literacy focuses on youth and students. The
studies of Ito et al. (2010), Jenkins, Purushotma, Weigel, Clinton, and Robison (2009), and Gee

22

(2010) on the digital literacy of youth have influenced scholarly understanding of older adult
digital literacy. For instance, in a study of how older adults use technology, Bloch and Bruce
(2011) used a youth media literacy framework to understand how older adults learn to use
digital technology. Bowen (2011; 2012a; 2012b) critiqued this approach to older adult digital
literacy, which she calls an “age bias in digital literacy research” (2011, p. 586). In her review of
the digital literacy literature, Bowen (2012a) found that leading literacy theorists:
Favor (and make generalized assumptions about) the literate expertise of young people
…. These theorists place young people at the cutting edge, and place older people
struggling (and failing) to catch up, perhaps finding it impossible to “get it” at all. (pp. 6–
7)
Bowen argues that until scholars bring the same fine-grained sociological analyses to older
adults they brought to young people, theories of digital literacy will continue to exhibit an “age
bias” that renders invisible the digital practices of older adults (Bowen, 2011).
The second gap in our understanding of older adult digital literacy emerges from the
fact that much of the research on this topic assumes that older adults will use digital literacy
primarily to improve their health. For instance, in their study of how and why older adults adopt
digital technologies, Heart and Kalderon (2013) theorized that digital literacy among older adults
will naturally lead them to use technology primarily for health related reasons. The objective of
their paper was to “assess use by older adults of technology … in order to evaluate their
readiness to adopt health-related ICT” (Heart & Kalderon, 2013, p. 209). Here the focus is not on
digital literacy per se, but rather on digital literacy for health.
This coupling of older adult digital literacy and health appears throughout the literature,
including in Library and Information Science. Asla and Williamson (2015) analyzed the
information behaviors of older adults living in what they call the Fourth Age, or the “ill-derly or

23

disability zone” (p. 1) occupied by those very old individuals coping with physical and mental
disabilities. It is true that older adults suffer cognitive and physical disabilities at rates that
exceed the larger population. But the number of older adults suffering from disabilities is still
proportionally small: Only 20% of older adults in the USA have chronic disabilities (Freedman,
Martin, & Schoeni, 2002). In the Journal of the American Medical Association, three prominent
scholars of geriatrics stated unequivocally that “disability and underlying physical, cognitive, and
sensory limitations are not inevitable consequences of aging” (Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni,
2002, p. 3137). It is important for older adults to lead healthy lives, and digital technologies may
play a part in this process—but this is true for people of all ages.
These gaps suggest we need more research that analyzes older adult digital literacy as it
unfolds in the lives of older adults. A growing number of scholars have in fact studied how older
adults use and learn to use technology in daily life. These scholars come from multiple
disciplines, including gerontology, education, media studies, computer science, and library &
information science. One of the largest and most important sources of literature on older adult
digital literacy is the journal Educational Gerontology. This journal features many research
articles analyzing training programs focused on helping older adults become digitally literate
(Kim, 2008; Saunders, 2004; Wood et al., 2010; Xie, 2007; Xie, Watkins, Golbeck, & Huang,
2012). These and other gerontologists have pioneered the study of older adult digital literacy.
These scholars have found that social support is crucial for older adult digital literacy.
Without social support, older adults lack both the motivation to learn technology and the
technical resources necessary to learn. As early as 1988 gerontologist Lesnoff-Caravaglia (1988)
found that among older adults the “absence of relatives and significant others may reduce the

24

motivation for adopting a technology” (p. 276, cited in Richardson, Weaver, & Zorn, 2005). In a
mixed-methods study in the United Kingdom, Selwyn (2004) found that:
Older adults tended to rely on a variety of informal and social strategies—most notably,
the informal acquisition of computers through the extended family …. Family and
friends are therefore very important elements in many of our interviewees’ adoption of
ICT. (p. 374)
Selwyn (2004) called this the “constant process of ... recycling and informal redistribution of
computers from the workplace to the family and from family member to family member” (p.
375). These findings illustrate that older adult digital literacy depends on social support found
among close contacts.
Many scholars have found that older adult digital literacy is structured and supported by
families (Hardill, 2014). Nonetheless, the family is not enough to sustain the digital literacy of
older adults. Summarizing the findings from the Sus-IT project, which included 750 older adults
from throughout England and Scotland, Hardill (2014) wrote that:
Sustaining digital engagement is linked to the significant, indispensable and crucial ICT
support role of (extended) family members, who provide intergenerational support,
along with motivational factors, acting as drivers for digital engagement …. But not all
older adults received the help and support needed to become confident users from
family members, and for such older adults support from the community, often involving
young people, organized formally by neighborhood and community groups is providing
a vital resource supporting older people sustain their use of digital technologies. (p. 280)
Older adults draw on diverse sources of support as they use digital technologies, and the family
plays a crucial role. But the family, by itself, is not sufficient; extra-familial support is required.
Intergenerational support in local communities contributes to older adult digital literacy.
Bowen (2012a) discussed how older adult digital literacy emerges out of “the social networks of
expertise distributed among friends and loved ones” (p. 115). Selwyn (2004) found that older
adult technology usage is supported by family and friends of all ages. In their research on older

25

adults using cybercafés in Jamaica, Bailey and Ngwenyama (2011) found that through
participating in these intergenerational public computing spaces older adults feel connected to
the broader society.
Sometimes this support is also found among other other older adults. The Digital
Inclusion Initiative of Senior Service America (2014) found that peer-to-peer computing
environments create the supportive conditions necessary for older adults to acquire and extend
digital literacy. In a study of an online community populated by older Japanese adults,
Kanayama (2003) found that peer-to-peer support formed among older adults learning
technology is important because older adults learn together “without experiencing fears or
discouragement” (p. 280) they experience in intergenerational settings. Scholars have come to
similar conclusions in research in the USA (Boeltzig & Pilling, 2007; Wood et al. 2010), China
(Freddolino et al. 2010; Xie, 2007), and Europe (Sayago & Blat, 2010). These case studies show
that older adults can and do support each other’s digital literacy. Collectively, these findings
demonstrate that support for older adult digital literacy can take many forms. Some find
support in the family, others in the intergenerational local community, still others in peer-topeer settings populated by other older adults.
In addition to analyzing how best to support older adult digital literacy, scholars also
analyze what older adults do with digital literacy. Attention has focused in particular on how
older adults participate with others online. Xie, Watkins, Golbeck, and Wang (2012) found that
many older adults prefer the more private space of email to the more public space of social
media. Sayago and Blat (2010) also found that older adults prefer email. Bloch and Bruce (2011)
came to similar conclusions. On the other hand, a growing percentage of older adults in the USA
now use social networking sites on a regular basis (Smith, 2014). Waycott et al. (2013) found

26

that even those in the “oldest old” group (aged 85 and older) enjoy expressing themselves
online in public settings. In my research (Lenstra, 2014a; 2014b), I also found that older adults
enjoy creating and sharing content on social media. This evidence suggests that given the right
conditions older adults are as capable and as willing to contribute to digital public spheres as
any other demographic group.
In summary, social theories of digital literacy represent an alternative to research that
assumes older adults will use technology like young people do, or for medical reasons. A
growing number of scholars have studied the digital literacy and learning practices of older
adults. These scholars find that social support is necessary for older adult digital literacy.
Familial, peer-to-peer, and community support are all important. With this support, older adults
contribute to digital public spheres. Nevertheless, despite this research and its important
findings on how and why older adults use technology, we lack theoretical understanding of the
older adult digital literacy as a social phenomenon.

C. Older adulthood is a stage in the human lifecourse
Scholars using the lifecourse approach to study aging find that human life proceeds
through a series of stages that are socially shaped and evolving (Cole, 1992). As such, what it
means to be old, and thus the boundaries of older adulthood, changes from historical moment
to historical moment and from culture to culture. People become old in society—society shapes
how and when one perceives oneself, and is perceived by others, to be old.
This section first discusses conceptual ambiguity about old age in past research, then
introduces the concept of ageism to illustrate how prejudice against old age shapes how older
adulthood is understood. Finally, I introduce and discuss the theory of older adulthood as a

27

stage in the lifecourse. I focus in particular on research that uses this theory to study older
adults using technology.
Terms like older adult and senior citizen have no consistent definition in the scholarly
literature. Xie (2011) found that “currently, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the
definition of ‘older adults’” (p. 936). Xie also found little social consensus regarding when one
becomes an older adult. In a study of an e-Health literacy program for older adults in public
libraries, Xie (2011) operationalized older adulthood as beginning at age 60. Nonetheless,
individuals as young as 52 asked to participate. Similarly, in a study of Canadian public library
patrons, Wilkinson and Allen (1991, cited in Williamson & Asla, 2010) found that a significant
number of patrons between the ages of 50 and 64 self-identify as seniors.
The ambiguity around the concept of older adulthood influences how scholars of older
adults and technology refer to what they are studying. Terms active in the literature include:
senior citizens (Burgess, Hasan & Alcock, 2013), seniors (Ito et al., 2001), the grey population
(Morris, 2007), older people (Sayago & Blat, 2010), older adults (Xie et al., 2012), the older
population (Laguna & Babcock, 1997), the elderly (Kiel, 2005), the retired (Buse, 2009),
pensioners (Cimpoieru, 2011), grandparents (Quadrello et al., 2005), the oldest old (Asla,
Williamson & Mills, 2006), and those living in the third age (Schull, 2013) or the fourth age (Asla
& Williamson, 2015). In addition to being understood through multiple terminologies, older
adulthood has also been operationalized in multiple ways. In a systematic review of the
international literature on older adults using social networking sites, Nef, Ganea, Müri, &
Mosimann (2013) found older adulthood sampled in the following age ranges:
•
•
•

41-65
50-64
50-75

28

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

55+
55-90
58-66
60+
60-82
61-75
61-83
61-89
63-86
64-91
65-72
65-97

These heterogeneous samples illustrate the complexity involved in studying older adulthood.
Gerontology, the academic field of study focused on older adults, has grappled
extensively with the question of how to define older adulthood. Experts in the field find that this
question cannot be answered objectively. Bytheway (2011), a gerontologist with nearly 50 years
of experience, found no consensus in the field about when older adulthood begins, even in
groups such as the International Association of Gerontology. Similarly, one of the most widely
used gerontology textbooks in North America, Hooyman and Kiyak’s (2011) Social Gerontology:
A Multidisciplinary Perspective, now in its ninth edition, states that:
Although the terms elders, elderly, and older persons are often used to mean those over
65 years in chronological age [in a USA context], this book is based on the principle that
aging is a complex process that involves many different biological, psychological and
social factors and is unique to each individual. (p. 7)
Scholars of these social factors show that changes in politics, the economy and society
shape how this stage of life is perceived and experienced. Gullette (2004) discusses how the
political category of senior citizen emerged as a result of intense political debate about
entitlements during the Great Depression. Senior citizenship historically began in the USA at age
65. Over time, other official definitions of older adulthood have emerged. The 1967 Age
Discrimination in Employment Act barred discrimination on the basis of age for individuals older

29

than 40 years of age (McCann & Giles, 2004, p. 177). Another Great Society initiative, the Senior
Corps program, is open to adults aged 55 or more. The American Library Association (2008) also
defines older adulthood as beginning at age 55. Since 1992, the National Institute of Aging has
administered the biannual US Health and Retirement Study, which surveys adults in the
contiguous USA aged 50 or more (Silver, 2014).
Changes in the economy also influence changes in social and scholarly perceptions of
older adulthood. Many adults now work past industrial-era retirement ages (Riggs, 2004),
suggesting that retirement no longer operates as a stable boundary between midlife and old
age. In this new economy, many older adults participate actively in the formal economy, and
many more also actively participate in non-profits. A 2014 survey of American Human Resource
professionals found that two-thirds of American companies employ at least one “older worker
who retired from other organizations or careers before joining their organization” (Society for
Human Resource Management, 2014, p. 4). For an increasing number of older adults, retirement
either does not happen, or is no longer the end of work (Buse, 2009; Gergen & Gergen, 2000).
Societal ageism also shapes how older adulthood is perceived and experienced. The
concept of ageism was coined by Butler (1969), the first director of the U.S. National Institute on
Aging. The term refers to discrimination against any and all age groups. In research and policy,
however, it has been used primarily to understand structural and social discrimination against
older adults and against the process of growing old (Wilkinson & Ferraro, 2002). Ageism is
ubiquitous in the USA. Nelson (2004) stated:
There is a whole industry in the greeting card business built around the ‘over the hill’
theme. Such cards are often portrayed as humorous, but the essential message is that it
is undesirable to get older. (p. x)

30

Through discourses such as this one, many people of all ages internalize this message that it is
undesirable to age.
Owing to the stigma of being old in our ageist society, many adults do not wish to be
seen as older adults (Cox, Abramson, Devine, & Hollon, 2012). Older adults often say they “don’t
feel old” (Thompson et al., 1990, p. 1), implying there is something wrong with aging and being
old. In a culture where old age is symbolically linked to decline, death and obsolescence (Cole,
1992; Gullette, 2004, p. 220), few embrace older adulthood as an identity. Surveys find that
fewer than 10% of Americans self-identify as old (Gergen & Gergen, 2000).
Ageism also shapes how older adults use digital technologies. Ageist stereotypes imply
that older adults cannot learn new technologies. Birkland & Kaarst-Brown (2010) found that
“older adults ... refuse to use a device they see as stigmatizing, even if they comprehend the
benefits of using a device” (p. 348). If a device marks them as old, older adults resist using it.
This desire to be seen as a normal user of technology may relate to fears of institutionalization.
Chatman (1992) found in her information seeking study that residents of a retirement
community fear to be seen asking for information. They fear that if their needs are made visible
they will be institutionalized. Scholars continue to research the development of assistive
technologies to help older adults without an awareness of the stigmatizing effects of these
interventions on the older adults these technologies are designed to serve (Bowen, 2012b).
Older adults also cope with ageist discourses that imply that old people cannot use
technology fluently. McKee and Blair (2006) found that older adults involved in a computing
class at New York City senior center are affected by ageist media portrayals of older adults and
technology: “You don’t see grandma dancing with an iPod … and the message that technology is
for the young is something that many older adults seem to have internalized” (p. 25). In Malta,

31

Formosa (2013) similarly found that “one prominent barrier to engaging with ICTs included the
belief that the internet is the preserve of the young and how they were now ‘too old’ to use ICT”
(p. 25). These findings illustrate that ageism affects how older adults use and learn to use
technology.
In the context of this social ageism, both activists and academics challenge prejudicial
stereotypes of aging with actual empirical experiences of aging. In a collective biography of
older African Americans, Higgins (2000) quoted a man stating that:
Years ago when I was still in my 30s, an older relative told me “in my twenties, I was
clueless as to who I was. In my thirties, I began to understand who I was, but I didn’t like
myself. In my forties, I accepted myself. In my fifties, I began to celebrate myself. In my
sixties, I have blossomed. It can only get better.” (p. 5)
In this framework, becoming old is something to value, not something to deny or to hide.
Scholars have also contributed to these projects to purge ageism from our understanding of
older adulthood. Bowen (2012a) framed her study of individuals in their 80s successfully
appropriating digital technologies into their lives as a project to correct ageist images of older
adult digital literacy. In her ethnographic work with community elders, Barbara KirshenblattGimblett (1989) found that “the elderly are more than custodians of heritage. They are people
in their own right, active in the present, and experts on what this period in the life cycle is all
about” (p. 138). If we want to know something about old age, we need to closely attend to the
actual experiences of aging individuals in their communities. By making these experiences
visible, we counter social ageism.
The lifecourse approach to the study of older adulthood can be used to make these
experiences visible. Since the early 1970s scholars in sociology, anthropology, history, and
psychology have developed the lifecourse approach as a theoretical framework for

32

understanding “how historical time, social location, and culture affect the individual experience
of each life stage” (Hutchison, 2014, p. 11). The lifecourse approach is premised on the
assumption that a human life consists of a “sequence of socially defined events and roles that
the individual enacts over time” (Giele & Elder, 1998, p. 22).
In Western cultures, the events and roles that mark a human’s entry into older
adulthood include life stage transitions like retiring, becoming a grandparent, joining a senior
center, exhibiting health-related physical or cognitive declines, taking on the role of a wise elder,
and other roles and events (Cole, 1992). Each generation experiences old age in different ways
(Gullette, 2004; Hutchison, 2014), and the boundaries and experiences of older adulthood are
always changing.
The lifecourse approach has been used to study older adult digital literacy. Up to now,
however, these studies have focused on the individual in isolation, and not on the individual
rooted in his or her community. Bowen (2011) studies how the digital literacy of a woman in her
80s builds on a lifetime of literate activity. Silvast (2015) uses an oral history methodology to
understand how the digital literacy of Finnish adults relates to exposure to programing
education in youth. Birkland (2013) finds that patterns in technology use among older adults
relate to their experiences earlier in life, and Selfe and Hawisher (2004) come to similar
conclusions in their life history study of adult literacy. Silver (2014) uses national survey data to
show that older adults’ socio-economic statuses at different stages in the lifecourse relate to
how the internet is used in the present. These disparate findings show that the lifecourse
approach to older adulthood can productively explain how and why older adults use digital
technologies. In this dissertation I contribute to this literature by studying how the digital
literacy of the individual relates to the communities in which the stages of life are lived.

33

In summary, older adulthood does not have one definition, either in scholarship or in
society. How older adulthood is experienced and studied is shaped by politics, the economy, and
by society. Ageist stereotypes shape what it means to be old, and how technology is used in
older adulthood. Scholars and activists challenge these stereotypes through empirical studies of
older adults. The theory of the human lifecourse is premised on the idea that older adulthood is
a stage of life that emerges in society. The lifecourse approach can be productively used to
understand how older adults use technology. This dissertation contributes to this literature by
situating the lifecourse of the individual in his or her local community.

D. Community informatics, community agency, and digital divides
Scholars working in the field of community informatics study how local, geographically
based communities incorporate digital technology into daily life (Williams & Durrance, 2009).
This field emerged over the last thirty years from case studies of the informatization of local
communities around the world (Williams, Lenstra, Ahmed, & Liu, 2013). A central concern in the
field is to understand and ameliorate digital inequalities. Williams and Durrance (2009) describe
the field thusly:
The field of community informatics, by studying the interaction between transformation
and continuity, between information technology and local community, is building up a
picture of how the social, historical places we live in are evolving as we move from the
industrial age to the information age, with particular attention to social and digital
inequalities. (p. 1203)
In this section, I discuss central findings of this field related to the topic of this dissertation. I
then discuss research on community informatics and older adults. This review shows that
research is indeed emerging on community informatics and older adults, but more research is
needed to understand how communities support the digital literacy of their older members.

34

A consistent finding in the field of community informatics is that socially excluded and
marginalized communities have and exert agency in the information society. Clark (2003) found
that low-income youth who come to an after-school public computer lab do not use the lab as
its funders envisioned. They instead appropriate the space to do with it what they want. Postill
(2008) found that people living in a suburb of Kuala Lampur adapt information technologies to
fit within an existing repertoire of local social practices. Hampton and Wellman (2001) similarly
found that residents of suburban Toronto adopt new technologies through an iterative interplay
of online and offline social practices. Alkalimat and Williams (2001) found that public computing
resources are used by an African American community to continue the African American
freedom struggle. Williams and Alkalimat (2008) then found that other local communities are
also using digital technologies to advance community cyberpower. Similar findings have
emerged from other fields. In his critical assessment of ICT for development projects, Toyama
(2015) found that the communities in which these projects are implemented determine whether
or not an ICT project will succeed, and in what form. This research shows that local communities
have agency. Local communities shape how digital technologies are appropriated in particular
places.
Community informatics scholars also find that public computing empowers communities
to learn and to practice digital literacy. In a study of the cybernavigator system in the Chicago
Public Library, Williams (2012) found that having supportive people in the library ready and
willing to help with technology contributes to enhanced digital literacy in the community. The
interactions between these technology helpers and library patrons occurs through what
Williams (2012) calls informatics moments, or “the moment when a person seeks help in using

35

some digital technology that is new to him or her” (p. 47). The local communities in which these
informatics moments take place structure and shape them (Figure 3).

Figure 3: The informatics moment in the public library. Reproduced from Williams, 2012.

Scholars of community informatics also find that digital technologies are unevenly
appropriated into local spaces. Through the concept of the digital divide, scholars have analyzed
the obstacles that prevent some sectors of society from powerfully integrating new technologies
into their daily life (Williams, 2001). More recently, the concept of digital inequalities has also
become a common way to discuss and analyze the myriad inequalities of the still emerging
information society (DiMaggio & Hargittai, 2001; Williams & Durrance, 2009). Both concepts
continue to be widely used in community informatics scholarship (Friemel, 2014).

36

Community informatics and older adults
Older adults live in communities. Gerontologists have found that local communities
shape the lives of older adults (Holstein, Parks, & Waymack, 2011; Scharlach & Lehning, 2015).
In contrast, the field of community informatics has been slow to attend to older adult digital
literacy and learning in a community context. In 2012, The Journal of Community Informatics
published a special issue on Community Informatics and Older Persons with 23 research articles
on this topic. Gurstein (2012), the editor of the journal, found that:
Even in the response to our call for papers … we found that the bulk of the papers
received were focused on “Informatics” as applied to the circumstance and condition of
individual older persons in relation to the health care system, rather than towards older
persons in and with their communities. (p. 1)
This focus on older adulthood as a problem to be solved through informatics obscures scholarly
understanding of the community informatics of an aging society in general.
Nevertheless, a growing number of scholars in community informatics have begun to
study the processes through which digital technologies are appropriated into aging
communities. Rosson and Carroll (2003) found that digital technologies can bridge generational
divides in local communities. Aziz (2009) found that college students in urban Oman mobilize
connections to the communities of their youth to bring technology support to elderly members
of rural villages. Xie and Jaeger (2008) found that the community spaces of public libraries
support older adult digital learning. Other scholars analyze how digital technologies are
appropriated into community spaces populated primarily by older adults. Sperazza,
Dauenhauer, and Banerjee (2012) and Linton (2012) found that the cultures of retirement
communities shape how residents there use digital technologies. Gardner et al. (2012) found

37

that technology support services in senior centers help older adults form new friendships and
social ties. Chang, Heh and Lin (2012) found that a nursing home in Taiwan shaped the
implementation of an eHealth pilot at that facility. Kok, Williams, and Yan (2012) also found that
the cultures of an assisted living facility in the USA and a senior center in China shaped how
older adults in these two spaces used Skype to communicate across national boundaries. These
findings illustrate how digital technologies are integrated into aging communities.
In addition to studying how older members of communities use technology, community
informatics also studies the exclusion of older adults in the information society. Brabazon (2005)
compared obstacles to older adult digital literacy in Australia and in the United Kingdom to
begin an international discussion of what she calls the grey digital divide. Millward (2003)
studied the obstacles older adults at a British senior center cope with as they learn technology.
Lam and Lee (2006) analyzed how and why older adults in Hong Kong choose to not use public
computing facilities.
Recent research on older adults and the digital divide finds that as people age they are
at risk of falling behind with technology. Olphert and Damodaran (2013) call this concept digital
disengagement. The concept of digital disengagement adds a temporal dimension to the digital
divide literature. This concept emerged in the United Kingdom, where in 2004 a governmental
Digital Inclusion Panel stated there is a:
Real risk that in the medium to long term significantly more citizens will migrate from
being digitally engaged to being unengaged than the other way round. (UK Cabinet
Office, 2004, p. 79).
Olphert and Damodaran (2013) found that digital disengagement occurs among older people in
communities throughout the United Kingdom, and possibly elsewhere around the world.

38

In summary, scholars in community informatics find that local communities structure
how technologies are adopted by their members. Communities help their members learn digital
technologies, and thus cross the digital divide. Community informatics scholars have only
recently started attending to older sectors of communities. More research is needed to
understand how local communities support the digital literacy of their older members.

E. The case study methodology and the extended case method
In addition to contributing to the theoretical discussions introduced above, this
dissertation also contributes to methodological discussions about how to conduct case study
research in community informatics. This section first discusses how case studies have been used
in community informatics. Next, I discuss how the particular methods I use in this dissertation
have been used in past research. Finally, I introduce and discuss the extended case method
approach to case study research.
Since the field of community informatics emerged, the case study has been its dominant
methodology (Williams et al., 2013). In community informatics research the case typically
studied is the uneven informatization of local communities (Best, Kollaynyi, & Garg, 2012; Castro
& Gonzalez, 2009; Clark, 2003; Kvasny, 2006; Odendaal, 2011; Sreekumar, 2011). Within this
tradition a wide variety of methodological and theoretical frameworks from multiple academic
disciplines have shaped the field (Stillman & Linger, 2009). As a result, many methods and
theories have shaped community informatics case studies (Veinot & Williams, 2012).
Throughout these case studies, researchers in community informatics actively
participate in the local communities they study. This involvement in communities takes the form
of, among others, involved observation (Alkalimat & Williams, 2001), action research (Gurstein,

39

2003), and community inquiry (Bishop, Bruce & Jones, 2006). As the field of community
informatics has grown, scholars also have sought to extend research beyond single cases, to
comparative and multi-case studies. These comparative case studies have emerged at the local
(Postill, 2008), national (Williams, 2007), and global (Williams et al., 2013) levels.
The case study methodology draws on both qualitative and quantitative methods
(Creswell, 2012). Handbooks discuss how researchers use quantitative data in case studies
(Boellstorff, Nardi, Pearce, & Taylor, 2012, pp. 126-127; Cerwonka & Malkki, 2007; Hammersley
& Atkinson, 1995, p. 130; Lofland & Lofland, 1995, p. 21). Even though case studies are
sometimes framed as an exclusively qualitative methodology (Creswell, 2012), quantitative
techniques have also been used extensively in case study research (e.g. Ferguson, 1990; Stack,
1975).
The case study methodology draws on diverse methods. Scholars select particular
methods based on the perceived utility of these methods to aid in understanding of the case or
cases studied. The specific methods used in this dissertation are participant observation,
interviews, and document review. Participation observation allows the researcher to see and
experience how life is lived in real-time (Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995). Participant observation
and ethnomethodology have been used extensively in studies of computer supported
cooperative work and computer supported cooperative learning. Since Suchman’s (1987)
canonical work on situated action, scholars have found that in-depth and up-close analyses of
how people use technologies in naturalistic social settings reveal how technology is
incorporated into work and into life. Discoveries made with this method are not possible to
arrive at through other methods (Blomberg & Karasti, 2013; Hutchins, 1995; Nardi, 1996; Nardi
& O’Day, 1999). Participant observation also enables a rich understanding of the digital literacy

40

of older adults (Ito et al., 2001; Linton, 2012; Sayago, & Blat, 2010). Primary limitations of
participation observation are that it is both time intensive, in that it requires many hours of
fieldwork in order to perceive recurring patterns and trends in a given culture or setting, and
time sensitive, in that it requires working around the schedule of the fieldsite and of those who
inhabit it (Boellstorff et al., 2012).
Interviews provide opportunities for in-depth, analytically structured conversations
between the researcher and an interviewee. Interviews enable the researcher to analyze the
perspectives, feelings, experiences and knowledge of individuals (Holstein & Gubrium, 1995;
Kvale & Brinkmann, 2009) and also allow the researcher to understand the backgrounds of
individuals interacted with during participant observation (Wood et al., 2010). Interview-based
research reveals the complex ways in which older adults learn and practice digital literacy across
time (Bowen, 2011; 2012b; Selwyn, 2004). A limitation of interviews derives from the fact that
they are actively created in the context of the interview situation. Each interview is unique,
making generalizability tricky to achieve.
Document review involves reading and analyzing institutional documents to understand
social processes as they play out over time (Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995, pp. 121–140). The
benefits of document review derive from the ability of documents to record and transmit
information from the past to the present, and the approach has been used to understand how
ageist discourses shape social conceptualizations of older adult digital literacy (Bowen, 2012a;
Richardson et al., 2005). Documents, however, never totally and transparently represent the
social practices they purport to document (MacNeil & Mak, 2007). Created by humans in
particular contexts, documents are incomplete and need to be used with as much care as any
other data source.

41

Extended case method approach to case study research. In some case study research,
the end product of research is a descriptive analysis of the case (Creswell, 2012). In other case
studies, theory is the result of research (Burawoy, 1998). To conduct the latter type of case
study, I draw on Burawoy’s extended case method approach. Unlike in grounded theory, where
scholars create theory out of cases, in the extended case method researchers extend preexisting
social theory based on what is learned from one or more cases (Burawoy, 1991; 1998). In Global
ethnography: Forces, connections, and imaginations in a postmodern world, Burawoy and his
students (Burawoy, Blum, George, Gille, & Thayer, 2000) employed the extended case method
to broaden and add granularity to theories of globalization, labor, and feminism, among others.
In a summation of the extended case method, Burawoy (1998) elaborates on the
uniqueness of this method in relation to other approaches to using theory in empirical research:
The extended case method applies reflexive science to ethnography in order to extract
the general from the unique, to move from the “micro” to the “macro,” and to connect
the present to the past in anticipation of the future, all by building on preexisting
theory. (p. 5)
In the extended case method, all theory changes as it is scrutinized in light of the reality the
researcher analyzes. Through research, scholars build on existing theory, elaborating and finetuning our understanding of the world. In the extended case method, both research and writing
consist of dialogic processes:
Like other handicaps, the ethnographic condition can be dealt with in one of two ways:
containing it or turning it to advantage. In the first strategy, we minimize our
predicament by limiting our involvement in the world we study, insulating ourselves
from our subjects, observing them from the outside, interrogating them through
intermediaries. We keep our feet on the ground by adhering to a set of data collecting
procedures that assure our distance. This is the positive approach. It is best exemplified
by survey research in which every effort is made to suspend our participation in the
world we study. We try to avoid affecting the situation we study, standardize the
collection of data, bracket external conditions, and make sure our sample is
representative.

42

In the alternative strategy we thematize our participation in the world we study. We
keep ourselves steady by rooting ourselves in theory that guides our dialogue with
participants. Polanyi elaborates this idea in detail, rejecting a positivist objectivity based
on ‘sense data’ in favor of a commitment to the ‘rationality’ of theory—cognitive maps
through which we apprehend the world. This ‘dwelling in’ theory is at the basis of what I
call the reflexive model of science—a model of science that embraces not detachment
but engagement as the road to knowledge. Premised upon our own participation in the
world we study, reflexive science deploys multiple dialogues to reach explanations of
empirical phenomena. Reflexive science starts out from dialogue, virtual or real,
between observer and participants, embeds such dialogue within a second dialogue
between local processes and extralocal forces that in turn can only be comprehended
through a third, expanding dialogue of theory with itself. Objectivity is not measured by
procedures that assure an accurate mapping of the world but by the growth of
knowledge; that is, the imaginative and parsimonious reconstruction of theory to
accommodate anomalies. (Burawoy, 1998, p. 5)
This extended case method approach to case study research shapes this dissertation. Drawing
on the long tradition of ethnographic participant observation (Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995), in
this study I am an active, involved (Clark, 1965) participant in the fieldsites where I conducted
my fieldwork. Ethnographers describe the researcher as one of the study’s most important
research instruments (Cerwonka & Malkki, 2007). Far from compromising the data, being in
dialogue with fieldsites in fact enriches and adds to the scholar’s ability to understand the
community studied. This understanding, in turn, enables the scholar to make more powerful
contributions to social theory.
In summary, the case study is the dominant methodology in the field of community
informatics. Many studies include active participation with communities as part of the case
study. The particular methods I use in this case study are participant observation, interviews,
and document review. The extended case method is the overall analytical approach used in this
case study, a method that enables and requires dialogue both with study participants and with
academic theory. Through these dialogues, the scholar extends social theory to add to our
understanding of the world.

43

F. Summary
Theoretical understanding of older adult digital literacy is under-developed in part
because the institutional dimensions of this phenomenon have not been systematically
analyzed. This dissertation intervenes into this situation by drawing on the theory of information
infrastructure to understand how older adults as information users contribute to the
information systems they use to learn and to practice digital literacy over time. The theory of
information infrastructure has been used to understand governance, scholarly communication,
and corporate organizations. Our understanding of the information infrastructure of
marginalized and vulnerable communities is less robust. Some scholars do find that institutions
condition how older adults learn technology, but the relationship between information
infrastructure and the digital literacy of older adults has not been closely examined.
Scholars increasingly recognize that digital literacy is a social phenomenon. Nonetheless,
although a growing number of scholars have studied how and why older adults learn and use
digital technologies in social contexts, assumptions in the literature based on the ideas that (1)
older adults should use technology like young people and (2) that older adults should use
technology for medical purposes hinder our understanding of older adult digital literacy.
Complicating further this issue is the fact that little scholarly and social consensus exists
around the meaning of older adulthood. I draw on the lifecourse approach to suggest that older
adulthood be understood as a socially evolving stage of the human lifecourse. This approach has
been used to study how older adults, as individuals, use technology. However, more research is
needed to understand how digital literacy across the human lifecourse is shaped by the local
communities where life is lived.

44

In order to study older adult digital literacy in this way, I introduce the field of
community informatics. Community informatics scholars find that local, historical communities
shape how people use and learn to use digital technologies. Although research is emerging on
community informatics and older adults, more research is needed to understand how
communities support the digital literacy of their older members.
In summary, this dissertation contributes to the research literature in multiple academic
disciplines by analyzing the community and institutional dimensions of older adult digital
literacy. The extended case method approach to case study research provides the
methodological tools necessary to carry out this analysis. Through this investigation, I add to our
understanding of how local communities support the digital literacy of their members.

CHAPTER 3. METHODS
In this chapter I describe the methods used to address this dissertation’s question. First,
I introduce my overall approach to this research project, as well as the background research that
led to this approach. Next, I describe how data collection and analysis proceeded. Finally, I
discuss the strengths, limitations, and ethics of this research.

A. Research approach
Pilot study
The approach used in this dissertation evolved through a pilot study undertaken in
spring 2014.1 During this pilot, study volunteers and I conducted verbal surveys with older adults
before and after we assisted older adults who were interested in learning technology. This pilot
study had two rounds, the first occurring in February and the second in May (Lenstra & Williams,
2015).
During the first round, a Seniors and Technology Day was hosted at a local public library.
There, 40 older adults participated in one-on-one technology support sessions with library &
information science students. After the sessions, students verbally administered a
questionnaire. They wrote the older adults’ responses on pieces of paper that I then transcribed
for subsequent analysis. I identified a few problems in this study. First, some of the questions
were not clear to older adults and thus needed to be revised. Second, the method of handwriting responses was not ideal. The students could not record responses verbatim, and in some

1

This pilot study would not have been possible without the support of The Community Informatics
Research Lab and the InfoCityCU initiative. Volunteers and leaders of these projects offered their time and
assistance for the data collection and analysis. Both stages of the pilot study received approval from the
University of Illinois Institutional Review Board.

46

cases the written responses were not legible. More positively, this pilot study revealed that
older adults are enthusiastic and dedicated learners. Despite minimal recruitment, I had no
trouble filling the workshop slots. Furthermore, all participants who had signed up showed up
on time. These findings informed the choice I made in my dissertation to study self-motivated
older adults who in the course of daily life seek and find technology support in public libraries
and senior centers.
Based on the results of the first round of this pilot study, I organized a follow-up pilot
study in May 2014 at a senior center and at a different local library. Thirty older adults
participated in this second round of the pilot study. In the second round, the workshops were
organized around videochat software. Older adults were asked questions before and after the
workshops, and their responses were recorded digitally in a document created for that purpose.
The second round confirmed that the method of typing older adults’ responses directly into a
digital document is a feasible way to conduct interviews.2 I also identified two problems during
this study that I resolved in the final design of this dissertation: (1) too many questions were on
the questionnaire; and (2) not enough information was collected on the processes through
which older adults learn technologies in their communities.
Too many questions. Only 20 minutes were reserved for the completion of the
questionnaire during the pilot study. The February interview script had 24 questions. The May
script had 42 questions. I found that there were far too many questions on the script. Trying to
get through all these questions made it difficult to elicit and to record the reflections of older
adults. When more time was available for older adults to answer questions, they provided richer

2

This method requires one to be a fast typist.

47

responses. For instance, this individual who took an exceptionally long time to answer the
questionnaire—45 minutes—provided more reflective answers than other participants:
Question: Have you ever taken a computer class or participated in a workshop like this
one before? Yes No [If yes] Where and when did this workshop or class take place?
Answer: Yes, a long time ago when I was at work, when computers first came out. When
they started using computers at work. They had workshops to show employees how to
use them at work. And that’s one reason why I retired when I did because you were
getting into a lot of technology and at the time I didn’t want to learn all this new stuff,
so I said “let the young people do that.” So in 2001 that’s when things were breaking
ground to take off, and there was all this new stuff you had to learn. And I just decided I
did not want to get into all of that.
In order to ensure there was time for this type of open-ended response, the final interview
script used in this dissertation has only 12 questions (Appendix B). These questions evolved from
questions first used and tested during the pilot study.
Not enough information about learning technology in communities. The pilot study
also showed that additional methods would be needed to study the community-based
information infrastructure that supports older adult digital literacy. The surveys revealed a
wealth of information about the backgrounds and help-seeking strategies of older adults, but
they did not provide a great deal of information about the relationship between older adult
digital literacy and community-based information infrastructure. This limitation led to the multimethods approach of this dissertation.

Dissertation approach
The research question shaping this dissertation’s methods is: to what extent and how
does community-based information infrastructure support older adult digital literacy? This
question includes two interrelated concepts: community-based infrastructure and older adult

48

digital literacy. Nonetheless, for theoretical clarity this dissertation separately analyzes these
two concepts, and then examines the relationship between them in chapter 6.
This study approaches community-based information infrastructure using the
information institution as the unit of analysis, specifically publicly funded senior centers and
public libraries in a medium-sized metropolitan area in the Midwest. Since I am especially
interested in understanding how and why older adults practice digital literacy, I focused
attention on technology support services within these institutions. The units of observation for
community-based information infrastructure are a) interactions in the institutions among staff,
volunteers, older adults, other individuals, and myself; b) interviews with older adults; c)
interviews with staff; and d) the documents from the institutions that I reviewed.
This study defines older adult digital literacy as how older adults use and learn to use
digital technologies over time. Here the unit of analysis is the individual older adult. The units of
observation are: a) the older adults with whom I participated in fieldwork and b) the older
adults I interviewed, a sub-sample of those with whom I participated.
Digital technologies are then understood as digital devices used by older adults in the
past and in the present. These include: wifi, printers, desktop computers, laptop computers,
mobile phones, tablets, flash drives, mobile hot spots, and a wide range of audio-visual devices
(mp3 players, digital cameras, digital camcorders, digital photo frames, etc.). Technology
support services are understood as computing facilities and technology helpers that support the
public’s use of digital technologies.
Although as discussed in Chapter 2 “older adulthood” has poorly defined boundaries, for
the purpose of this dissertation it is defined as beginning at age 50. This decision was made
based on the fact that all but one of the sites themselves define older adulthood as beginning at

49

age 50 (the exception has no official age-based boundary for older adulthood).3 For the
purposes of understanding all of the dimensions of older adult digital literacy, the concept of
older adulthood is further analyzed in relation to the social class, age, ethnicity, and gender of
the individual. Details about these procedures appear in Chapter 5.
Different methods were used to answer different parts of this research question. The
specific methods used were:
Method 1: Participant observation (i.e. ethnographic fieldwork) in senior centers and
public libraries, with a primary focus on technology support services used by older
adults;
Method 2: Interviews with older adults who participate in technology support services
in senior centers and public libraries;
Method 3: Interviews with senior center and public library staff responsible for
technology support services; and
Method 4: Document review of senior center and public library records.
Table 6 locates each method used in this dissertation under the part of the research question it
was used to answer.

B. Data collection
Data collection occurred from September 2014 until August 2015. During this one-year
period, sampling was carried out at two levels: institutional and individual. Institutions were

50

sampled first, followed by individuals from within those institutions. Institutional sampling was
comprehensive: all publicly funded senior centers and public libraries located within the
metropolitan area where this study took place were included. This sampling strategy led to
three public libraries and three senior centers, for a total of six cases.
The administrators of these sites agreed to allow me to conduct research at their
institutions because I would be offering services to them. During meetings in summer 2014 with
staff from the sites, we agreed I could conduct research at the sites if I volunteered to assist the
institutions in technology support services.
My role during fieldwork varied by site. At the three public libraries, I participated in
technology volunteer programs managed by librarians. During field sessions I worked alongside
staff at reference desks located adjacent to library computer labs to assist patrons with
technology. At the senior centers, I helped staff administer drop-in computer classes. At two of
the sites, I joined and eventually helped to lead preexisting classes. At one of the senior centers,
I worked with staff to start a new technology support program, since none were in place there
at that time.
Method 1: Participant observation. From September 2014 to August 2015, I conducted
participation observation across the six sites. The only break in fieldwork occurred during a
three-week period around the winter holidays. I offered assistance to older adults as I
participated in technology support services. I also observed what older adults did with
technology at the sites. Field sessions were recorded using a structured fieldnote guide
(Appendix B), and fieldnotes were written immediately after leaving the fieldsite. How long it
took to write a fieldnote depended on the complexity and duration of a particular field session.

51

Some field sessions required as many as five single-spaced pages to describe. Others required
only one page. My participation in the sites is further analyzed in Chapter 4.

Owing to different structures in place at different sites, the number and length of field
sessions at each site varied from site to site (Table 7). I joined preexisting programs at all but
one of the sites. As such, I tailored my field sessions to these programs. Tubman Senior Center4
had a program in which older adults could come twice a week for an hour at a time to learn
technology. Midway through fieldwork, the frequency of this program switched to three times a
week. As a result, the number of hours I spent at Tubman exceeds the amount of time I spent
elsewhere. I conducted 127 hours of fieldwork at Tubman Senior Center. The technology
support program at Smith Senior Center was held once a week for two hours. Disruptions to
classes were caused by the building being shut down for renovations for a two-month period
midway through fieldwork. I conducted 62 hours of fieldwork at Smith Senior Center. The staff
coordinator at Metro Senior Center decided that the new technology support program there
would be twice a month for three hours at a time. I conducted 66 hours of fieldwork at Metro
Senior Center.

Because of a protracted approval process, fieldwork at Metro Library did not begin until
November 2014. I volunteered in the library’s technology volunteer program once every other
week for three hours at a time. I conducted 62 hours of fieldwork at Metro Library. Main Library
and Branch Library also had an approval process that delayed the start of my fieldwork. At Main
Library, field sessions were 2.5 hours; at Branch Library, sessions were 2 hours. I conducted 92.5
hours of fieldwork at Main Library, and 58 hours of fieldwork at Branch Library. In total, I
conducted 467.5 hours of fieldwork across the six sites.
Individuals self-selected to participate in fieldwork. This sample consists of older adults
who in the course of daily life come to senior centers and public libraries and who seek support
with digital technologies there. The sample that resulted consists of 209 individuals. Fieldwork
also involved building relationships with staff and with older adults who come regularly to the
sites. These relationships were drawn upon to recruit individuals to participate in interviews.
In addition to participating in technology support services at the six sites, I also
participated in the sites in general.5 At the senior centers I attended potlucks, meetings of senior
center groups, exercise classes, and holiday programs. At public libraries I came to the libraries
during a variety of open hours to observe how library patrons use technology there. These less
formal field sessions were not written up using a structured fieldnote guide.
Method 2: Interviews with older adults. In November 2014 I started interviewing
participants in technology support services across the six sites. The interviewees tend to be
more regular participants in technology support services at these sites. It was logistically easier
to interview those who come to the sites on a regular basis. Interviews took place as I had time

This portion of participant observation was less formal than my involvement in technology support
services. As such, it is not included in the hours recorded in Table 7.

53

to schedule them and at the convenience of interviewees. The interviews were held on site at
the public libraries and senior centers. To expedite data collection and analysis, the interviews
were not audio recorded. Instead the responses were recorded verbatim using a laptop and a
spreadsheet with one row for each question. The average length of these interviews was 25
minutes. A sample of 54 individuals participated in interviews. The interviewees are not evenly
distributed across the six sites (Table 7). Since the primary purpose of these interviews was to
study older adult digital literacy, this uneven distribution is not problematic. In this text I refer to
the individuals interviewed as interviewees, to differentiate them from the participant sample,
which consists of 209 individuals.
Method 3: Interviews with staff. In addition to interviewing older adults, I also
interviewed my primary staff contacts at the six sites. These interviews were guided by the semistructured questionnaire included in Appendix B. Interviews focused on how staff understand
their roles, and the roles of their sites, in supporting older adult digital literacy. These interviews
were audio recorded and transcribed. Staff interviews tended to be longer than those with older
adults. The average length of interviews was 45 minutes. Seven staff participated in interviews.
Method 4: Document review. Finally, throughout fieldwork documents were collected
and analyzed. The purpose of document review was to understand the evolution of these
institutions over time. As I visited the sites I collected any documents I found related to
technology support services at the sites. I also regularly checked the websites of the institutions
for information on this topic. I further relied on staff and older adults to help guide me to
historical documents on these topics. The documents analyzed varied from site to site. At the
senior centers, I reviewed volunteer-maintained scrapbooks that document the history of the
senior centers and records of senior center meetings. At the public libraries, I reviewed the

54

minutes of library boards, as well as statistical reports on the libraries. I also reviewed published
and unpublished histories of the libraries. Finally, I regularly reviewed the websites of the six
institutions.
In sum, during one year of fieldwork I conducted 467.5 hours of participant observation
across 267 field sessions at six institutions. During fieldwork, I interacted with 209 older adults
using technology support services. The details of this fieldwork were written up in 559 pages of
fieldnotes. I also conducted interviews with 54 older adults, and with seven staff. Physical and
digital documents from the sites were also reviewed.

C. Data analysis
During the course of preparing this dissertation, two stages of data analysis took place:
Data analysis Stage 1 (guiding model, Denzin & Lincoln, 2008)6
Phase 1 (February – August 2014) – During this phase, I analyzed the pilot study data,
which led to this dissertation’s data collection approach.
Phase 2 (September 2014 – August 2015) – While collecting data I wrote analytical notes
about trends observed across the field sessions and across the interviews.
Phase 3 (September – November 2015) – During this phase I inductively sorted all the
data I had collected. I carried out open coding of all of the data. The focus here was on
searching for and identifying trends. Early draft chapters formed by these inductive
analytical methods were shared with my adviser and with the University of Illinois
community informatics research lab, who provided commentary.
Data analysis Stage 2 (guiding model, Burawoy, 1998)
Phase 4 (November 2015 – January 2015) – Here the analytical methods shifted from
induction to deduction. Using theories of information infrastructure (Star & Ruhleder,
1996) and digital literacy (Prior & Shipka, 2003), I reviewed the a) data, b) codes, and c)
early draft chapters. Through this analytical work I developed theoretically informed
findings. During this stage, I wherever possible sorted the data into tables that enabled
me to illustrate findings quantitatively.
6

Denzin and Lincoln (2008) describe their approach to data analysis thusly: “The researcher first creates a
field text consisting of field notes and documents .... The writer-as-interpreter moves from this text to a
research text: notes and interpretations based on the field text. The text is then re-created as a working
interpretive document that contains the writer’s initial attempts to make sense of what he or she has
learned” (p. 34).

55

Phase 5 (February – May 2015) – In this final phase of analysis, my focus was on
analyzing the data through the process of writing. Here, the theoretically informed
deductive findings were sharpened through writing. This work involved collaborations
with colleagues in the field. I shared preliminary findings with the community
informatics research lab, at conferences (Lenstra, 2016),7 at meetings with schools
where I was applying for jobs, and with my doctoral dissertation committee.
The particular processes involved in data analysis included coding, reducing and sorting
the data, and then using both induction and theoretically informed deduction to understand
what this data had to say about community-based information infrastructure and about older
adult digital literacy. First, I sorted the data into separate spreadsheets organized a)
chronologically, b) by individual participant, and c) by fieldsite. Then, I reduced the data by
looking for trends that could be reported in tables. For instance, columns in the “chronological”
spreadsheet included data on what digital devices were used for what digital projects by which
people on what days at which sites. In addition to reducing the data, I also identified trends
through the open coding of the data. Here I used inductive, qualitative methods to identify
findings across the disparate sources of data collected.
This sorting and reducing of the data in Excel enabled me to identify trends, both
inductively and deductively, across the fieldsites. To illustrate how the field session data were
both collected and analyzed, Appendix C contains an excerpt from a fieldnote recorded at one of
the senior centers in November 2014. Following this fieldnote are tables that illustrate how this
fieldnote, and others like it collected during field sessions, were reduced and coded to enable
sorting across time, site, and participant.

This research was also informally presented as part of my participation in the 2016 iConference Doctoral
Colloquium.

56

D. Strength and limitations of study design
This study design has three primary limitations, but these limitations are compensated
by three strengths. The three primary limitations are:
•
•

•

This study only analyzes one metropolitan area;
Not all older adults participate in public libraries and senior centers, and not all
older adults who participate in these institutions also participate in technology
support services there; and
A limited amount of time could be spent at each site and with each participant.

The three primary strengths of this study design are:
•
•
•

Multiple methods were used, enabling the triangulation of findings;
The findings are grounded in historical time; and
The findings emerged from within situated relationships.

Only one metropolitan area. This study only analyzes two types of institutions in one
metropolitan area. The metropolitan area where this study took place, like all cities, has its
particularities. Chief among its particularities is the influence of the local university on culture
and politics. However, in many ways the area is typical. It is a college town like others found
throughout the country (Gumprecht, 2010). It is a medium-sized metropolitan area that, like
many other metropolitan area in the USA, experienced population growth, suburbanization, and
exurbanization in the second half of the twentieth century (Elazar & Rothman, 1986; Salamon,
2007). It is also a typical metropolitan area in America’s emerging service economy (Buera &
Kaboski, 2009), with healthcare, education, and research/technology being the primary
employers. Like many other metropolitan areas, this area is characterized by multiple,
overlapping governmental units (Hamilton, 2014), such as the different park districts and public
library districts that are organized semi-independently from city government itself. Finally, like
many other American metropolitan areas, this urban area has experienced multiple waves of
migration into the area, both from within the country and from around the world (Blocker,

57

2008; Salamon, 2007). As a result, the findings from this urban area may be generalizable to
other locales.
Not all older adults. A second limitation derives from the fact that this study only
analyzes the experiences of older adults already engaged with technology support services at
these sites. As discussed in the introduction, public libraries and senior centers do not reach all
older adults. Nonetheless, because the study of aging communities in library & information
science is still emerging, this study sheds light on the issues faced by local communities as they
support the digital literacy of their older members.
Limited amount of time. Finally, limitations to this study derive from the limited time I
had available to spend at each study site, and to talk and to work with each older adult. The
sites studied are public institutions open to the public for between 30 and 74 hours a week.
Working in six fieldsites with 209 older adults demanded that I move regularly but rapidly
throughout each site.
Triangulation. This study design also has strengths that compensate for these
limitations. First, multiple methods were used to study multiple sites over an extended period of
time, enabling the triangulation of findings. Techniques were used throughout data collection
and analysis to ensure the validity and reliability of this data, and its analysis. Informal
discussions about the research during data collection and during data analysis with participants
at the fieldsites give this project validity and authenticity. Furthermore, while analyzing the data,
whenever possible I quantified the findings into tables. This mixed-methods approach to
analysis gives the findings from this study more reliability (Creswell & Clark, 2010). The reader is
presented not only with a qualitative distillation of findings, but whenever possible a
quantitative summation as well.

58

Historical understanding. These findings are situated in a historical understanding of the
sites as they evolved over time. The review of documents enables this historical grounding.
Furthermore, interviews with older adults focused on their backgrounds with technology. These
interviews enable findings on older adult digital literacy to be similarly situated in a historical
context.
Situated understanding. Finally, the findings emerged through a situated understanding
of the sites. Fieldwork spanned an entire year, enabling me to situate the findings in space and
time (Blomberg & Karasti, 2013; Suchman, 1987). This in-depth and up-close ethnographic
analysis of how people use technologies in naturalistic social settings reveals how people and
institutions incorporate technology into daily life in ways that other methods cannot replicate
(Hutchins, 1995; Nardi, 1996; Nardi & O’Day, 1999).

E. Ethics of data collection and analysis
As in all research involving human subjects, careful procedures were followed to ensure
the privacy and anonymity of study participants. In this dissertation, and in all publications
discussing this research, pseudonyms are used to refer to individuals and institutions. Since
these six sites are the only publicly funded senior centers and public libraries in the urban area
where this study took place, the identity of this metropolitan area is also anonymized. Details
about the urban area are deliberately left vague in order to protect the identity of fieldsites.
This study also followed ethical principles during the course of data collection. All
individuals and institutions that participated in this dissertation provided voluntary and
informed consent (Appendix A). Letters of commitment from these administrators were
included in the Institutional Review Board (IRB) application approved for this study.

59

Owing to the complexities of conducting fieldwork in public institutions, older adult
participants had the option of giving consent orally or in writing. Oral consent was the default,
but if participants wished to receive paper documentation about the consent procedure, that
documentation was available to them. No pressure or coercion was used to keep individuals or
institutions in this study after they agreed to start participating. In the end, no individuals or
institutions declined to participate in this study, and no individuals or institutions ceased
participation after they started.
Finally, an additional ethical principle for this study derives from the fact that it is
community informatics research. In community informatics, research often takes place in
marginalized communities. In this field it is the norm for researchers to provide services to
communities while conducting research (Williams & Durrance, 2009). This dissertation continues
this tradition, and calls it “research reciprocity.” In a situation of resource scarcity (e.g.
technology support), an ethical researcher gives to the community studied during the process of
taking data and knowledge. During fieldwork I not only studied community-based information
infrastructure and older adult digital literacy but also provided services to public libraries, senior
centers, and the communities they serve. For instance, during fieldwork at public libraries I was
a volunteer in library-sponsored technology support services. As such, I offered assistance not
only to older adults, but also to individuals of all ages seeking technology support at public
libraries.

F. Summary
The methods used in this dissertation developed across two pilot studies organized in
public libraries and senior centers in spring 2014. In this dissertation, I study public libraries and

60

senior centers as community-based information infrastructure. I study older adult digital literacy
by analyzing how the older adults that seek and find technology support in these institutions use
and learn digital technologies over time. Through this research, I am able to understand to what
extent and how community-based information infrastructure supports older adult digital
literacy.
This mixed-methods dissertation relies on interviews, participant observation, and
document review. I draw on the extended case method approach to integrate inductive and
deductive analysis of the data collected through these methods. Like any study, the methods of
this dissertation have both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, the situated, in-depth
understanding of community-based information infrastructure and older adult digital literacy
afforded by these methods outweighs the limitations of this approach. Finally, in addition to
following standard ethical procedures, this dissertation further practices the principle of
research reciprocity, making a contribution to the marginalized community studied.

CHAPTER 4. COMMUNITY-BASED INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE
This chapter analyzes community-based information infrastructure, here
operationalized as publicly funded senior centers and public libraries in a medium-sized urban
area in the Midwest. The unit of analysis is the information institution. My attention focuses on
technology support services within these institutions, in particular, how and why older adults
participate in and shape these services. The units of observation for this analysis are a) field
sessions at the institutions in which I recorded interactions among staff, volunteers, older
adults, other individuals, and myself; b) interviews with older adults; c) interviews with staff;
and d) the documents from and about the institutions that I reviewed.
To study community-based information infrastructure, this chapter uses the theory of
information infrastructure developed by Star and Ruhleder (1996), extended by Star (1999), and
most recently extended by Guribye (2015). To reiterate, information infrastructure consists of
the evolving and multiple relationships between information users and information systems.
Table 8 displays the findings of this chapter in terms of the theory of information infrastructure.
For clarity, in this table two dimensions of information infrastructure are not included: (1) the
dimension “becomes visible upon breakdown” is not included because breakdowns in
community-based information infrastructure are discussed and analyzed throughout the other
findings; and (2) the dimension “has a pedagogical approach” is also not included because this
dimension is similarly discussed and analyzed throughout other findings.
The overall findings from this analysis are that:
•
•
•

Community-based information infrastructure emerges out of and evolves through
individual and social struggle;
Community-based information infrastructure extends across space and time; and
Ageism structures community-based information infrastructure.

Table 8: Findings about community-based information infrastructure.

Community-based information infrastructure emerges out of and evolves through
individual and social struggle. The public libraries and senior centers studied emerged and
evolved because, organized together and with other sectors of their local communities, older
adults created, led, and advocated for these institutions. In the present, older adults, both as
individuals and as part of groups, struggle and succeed to adapt technology support services to
meet their needs.
Over time, social struggle has become less common in this community-based
information infrastructure. The digital divide leads to older adults being framed in these
institutions as service recipients, instead of as community leaders. In the past, older adults led
many aspects of these institutions, particularly in senior centers. Second, as senior centers and
public libraries became institutionalized, bureaucratic procedures were implemented by

63

overpressured staff to cope with the challenges of administering these complex institutions. As
a result of these two trends, the roles of older adults in shaping these institutions has over time
become less pronounced.
Nonetheless, the agency of older adults continues to shape this community-based
information infrastructure. Through their communities of practice (e.g. senior center groups),
groups of older adults adapt technology support services. Furthermore, individual older adults
struggle to find and to form the technology support services and supportive relationships they
need to learn technology across time.
Finally, older adults and information systems together cope with the disruptions caused
by the still-emerging information society. One manifestation of these disruptions is the changing
technological standards released by the consumer electronics mass marketplace into local
communities.
Community-based information infrastructure extends across space and time. As they
participate in technology support services in the present, older adults draw on and add to
memories of these institutions and of the roles these institutions have played in their
communities over time. These institutions are rooted in the community, as well as in the lives of
older adults. I further found that public libraries and senior centers are not the only sources of
technology support older adults rely on. The community-based information infrastructure
extends spatially to include other sectors of the local community, including family and friends,
businesses, and other public and non-profit institutions.
Ageism structures community-based information infrastructure. Ageism in this
community-based information infrastructure appears in practices and policies that:

•

Render older adults invisible or unimportant;
Conceive of older adulthood exclusively as a time of disability and decline;
Express ambivalence and antipathy toward older adults; and
Naturalize the idea that young people are the natural tutors of old people.

Community-based information infrastructure, like information infrastructure more generally, is
constantly evolving through the changing relationships between information systems and
information users. In this chapter I discuss and analyze the dominant tendencies found during
this study. I also discuss and analyze counter tendencies that may in the future become
dominant. These counter tendencies illustrate the agency of both older adults and staff.

A. Community-based information infrastructure emerges out of and evolves through
individual and social struggle
I. Organized together and with other sectors of their communities, older adults create and
sustain information infrastructure
As discussed in chapter 1, public libraries and senior centers are institutions in the public
sphere. By participating in these institutions, older adults participate in locally-based public
spheres. Robust public services require an engaged public sphere that, through struggle, creates
the momentum necessary to secure and expand public services (Buschman, 2003). This public
sphere that forms in public libraries and senior centers shapes the form of publicly funded
services. However, the administrators of publicly funded local institutions are part of local
government. Local government is not the same as the public sphere. Local government is
composed of professionals making decisions about where and how to allocate resources on
behalf of taxpayers. This section shows that older adults organized together and with other
sectors of their communities were able to create and sustain senior centers and public libraries.

65

All six of the public institutions studied were formed out of community organizations
that created the structure and momentum for these public institutions (Table 9). Older adults
participate in and sometimes lead these community organizations; they played a particularly
important role in the community organizations that led to the creation of senior centers in the
1970s.
Organized together and with other sectors of their communities, older adults continue
to struggle for robust public services. At senior centers, older adults are organized into
membership-based groups. These groups organize to keep the centers going. At public libraries,
older adults are a central part of Friends of the Library groups and of community advisory
committees. These groups provide public libraries with the community mobilization and
advocacy needed to maintain and expand their funding base.

The forms of social struggle in community-based information infrastructure have
changed over time. As the senior centers and public libraries became institutionalized,
community organizing shifted from instigating for publicly funded community spaces and
services to advocating for and supporting professionally staffed institutions. Furthermore, as the
local population has aged, more private and non-profit institutions have also emerged to serve
local older adults. There are now multiple private and non-profit retirement communities in the
local area. Unlike the publicly funded senior centers, these retirement communities require
substantial financial resources to join. The paid staff of these retirement communities organize
for public services on behalf of their older adults, putting publicly funded senior centers in
competition for a limited pool of funds.
This section introduces each of these institutions in the context of these changes. The
next section analyzes the emergence and evolution of technology support services in each of
these six institutions. In the remaining sections I analyze how in the daily operations of
technology support services social and individual struggle shapes this community-based
information infrastructure.
Tubman Senior Center. In the early 1960s, a group of older African Americans began
meeting at the Tubman Community Center, a multi-purpose institution formed in the 1940s
through organizing by the local African American community. The activism of this group of
organized older African Americans led to the foundation of the Tubman Senior Center. During
the early 1970s, this group of older adults, now calling themselves the “Tubman Seniors”
because they met at the Tubman Community Center, became more officially organized. They
started electing officers and holding business meetings. The park district hired one of their
leaders for a part-time position to administer programs at the Tubman Community Center for

67

the growing group, and the Tubman Seniors organized events for themselves, such as monthly
trips to the grocery store, crafts, and cultural programs. They also organized events for their
community, such as an annual community reunion still held every August at a local park.
As the Tubman Seniors grew in size, they struggled for a space of their own. In 1971, the
park district acquired a building next to the Tubman Community Center, and the Tubman
Seniors pressured the park district to turn it into a senior center. This organized advocacy
continued until the Tubman Senior Center officially opened in 1978. When the Tubman Senior
Center opened in 1978 there were 86 active members, and by the time of my fieldwork in 2014
and 2015, there were 155 active members. Then and now, African Americans constitute almost
the entirety of the group’s membership.
Formed out of the social struggle of the Tubman Seniors, Tubman Senior Center is the
only senior center in the metropolitan area with its own building.8 The Tubman Senior Center
also has the largest budget of the three senior centers in this study, and the park district funds
one full-time and one part-time employee for administration. These facts are a testament to the
organized power of the Tubman Seniors in the 1960s and 1970s, a time of intense community
organizing and activism in the African American community, locally and nationally, across all
ages.
Over the years the park district and the Tubman Seniors have jointly administered the
senior center. The Tubman Seniors meet monthly to organize programs. They elect officers
annually. The funding from the park district does not provide enough resources for the Tubman
8

All other senior centers are located in multi-purpose shared facilities. In addition to the three publicly
funded senior centers in the local urban area, there are two privately funded senior centers: one of these
is located in a hospital clinic and receives funding from the hospital. The other is located in the
headquarters of a local printing press and receives funding from a philanthropic organization affiliated
with the press.

68

Seniors to do all they wish to do, so the group organizes to supplement these public funds; every
year, the Tubman Seniors hold a Senior Fashion Show to raise funds for the senior center.
More recently, however, the park district has taken more control over the senior center.
One woman discussed how in the past the Tubman Seniors were more actively involved in the
administration of the senior center:
Back then the Tubman Senior Center was ours. We ran this place! [Laughs] Anything
that happened here, we decided. Now the Park District decides they want to do
something. Well, we just kind of have to follow along.
Beginning in the early 2000s, the park district started merging the operations of its two senior
centers—Tubman Senior Center and the Smith Senior Center. Historically the two were
administered separately, and the two continue to have separate community groups. However,
in print and online the park district does not acknowledge that two different groups of senior
citizens exist. The park district instead advertises what it calls a 50 Plus! program for local
citizens aged 50 and older. Through this top-down integration of the two senior centers, the
agency of the older adults who created and who continue to sustain Tubman Senior Center is
marginalized. Despite the integration of the administration of the two senior centers, the
Tubman Seniors continue to operate as an independent community group.
Smith Senior Center. Smith Senior Center has its origins in a group of older adults who
in the mid-1960s informally started meeting at a community center on the west side of the city.
Although this group, then and now, is predominately European American, the social struggle of
the Tubman Seniors in the African American community directly led to the foundation of the
Smith Senior Center in the mid-1970s. The funding for both senior centers came from a 1976
referendum organized by the Tubman Seniors to fund their senior center. The referendum
passed only because the park district included in it the allocation of funds for facilities in parts of

69

town that had larger European American populations. Thus, funds from the referendum were
used to create the Smith Senior Center.
Related to this lack of organized advocacy in the past, the Smith Seniors remain
informally organized in the present. The group continues to meet informally in the same
building where they have met since the mid-1960s, with no elected officers and no independent
fundraising. Discussing the history of the group, one member stated that:
Here at Smith, it was great that the park district created the Smith Seniors. Seniors had
been meeting here before, you know, but the referendum made it a part of the center.
Now the park district was creating programs for us. You know, the seniors were going
on trips and the like. Before the seniors just met here.
Both then and now, key events at Smith Senior Center include potlucks, crafts, cooking, and
travel. The group meets weekly for a potluck with an average attendance of 25. The group at
Smith Senior Center lets the Park District manage their programs; members simply come
together at the center to enjoy shared activities. The park district funds one part-time employee
to administer the senior center.
In 2015, the Smith Senior Center had 65 dues-paying members. Participation in the
senior center has waned over the last 10 years as aging baby boomers have not joined the
center to the degree that earlier generations joined. In its annual reports, the park district notes
this declining membership. One effect of declining membership, and of the lack of organized
advocacy among the Smith Seniors, has been a marginalization of the senior center within the
building where it is located. In early 2015, the park district decided to consolidate all programs
and services for people with disabilities (special recreation) into this building alongside the
senior services. The Smith Senior Center is now the last trace of the building’s past role as a
neighborhood community center.

70

Metro Senior Center. Like Tubman and Smith, Metro Senior Center also emerged out of
a group of older adults who started meeting informally at a community center in the 1960s.9
However, this group of older adults became a senior center through a different route from the
other two senior centers: Metro Senior Center was formed through collaboration between the
park district and older adults. This process began when the Metro Seniors group officially
organized themselves, and they continue to elect officers annually and hold their own programs
and business meetings. However, unlike the Tubman Seniors, the Metro Seniors did not need to
pressure the park district to create a senior center. The park district was eager to support this
community organization.
Metro Seniors continue to meet at the community center where they formed. The core
event of the group is a monthly potluck attended by 80 to 90 older adults. The potluck is
followed by a cultural program organized by the group, and then a business meeting. The park
district manages their budget, organizes trips, and handles outreach. The park district funds one
part-time employee to administer the senior center.
Metro Seniors tend to be wealthier than those that at Tubman and Smith. Over time,
the leaders of the community organization have been mostly white-collar individuals such as
retired bankers and university faculty. The Metro Seniors have organized trips to places like
Germany and Australia; no international travel has ever been organized by the other senior
centers. Furthermore, among the past members of the Metro Seniors are a wealthy couple who
owned a local bank. When the couple passed away, they left a large endowment to the park
district “for a senior adult center and programs.” This funding enabled the park district to build

9

Metro Senior Center is located in a separate park district than Smith Senior Center and Tubman Senior
Center.

71

an addition to the community center, where the senior center is now located. The wealth of the
individual Metro Seniors means that less funding from the park district is required for their
programs. These older adults use their own financial resources to fund programs they desire.
Nonetheless, as a public institution open to all the Metro Senior Center also includes
many of more modest backgrounds. The group is very large. During fieldwork, the membership
was over 600. As a result, the group is larger and more diffuse than the other two senior
centers. The park district makes it very easy for anyone to join the senior center. However,
fewer than 100 of these individuals actively participate in programs at the senior center. The
remainder participate in trips or joined to receive discounts on other park district programs.
Metro Library. Prior to Metro Library’s official beginning, a community organization
formed in 1865 to create a reading room. This association depended on annual membership
fees and citizen donations. The association donated its books to the city, which founded Metro
Library in 1874. With funding from both local businesses and public funds, the library has
expanded over the years.
The Friends of Metro Library community organization has been a major platform
through which older adults have shaped the history of Metro Library. This organization formed
in the mid-1960s. Then and now, retired individuals have been a major part of the Friends of the
Library group. One member stated that:
We are mostly retired people who love the library and want to do what we can to make
sure everyone else can share our love.
These Friends advocate for the library. For instance, over the years the Friends have helped to
mobilize the local community to pass referenda needed to expand the library building.

72

The primary library service explicitly for older adults at Metro Library focuses on older
adults suffering from disabilities that render them homebound: the library’s Home Delivery
Service. Even though this service is for homebound patrons of all ages, it has a primary focus on
older adults. Promotional materials for the program state that
Volunteers select books, audiobooks, music, or movies for home delivery participants,
and also provide regular delivery to individuals, nursing homes, and retirement centers.
(italics added)
Promotional materials also prominently feature images of older adults.
As the library developed this program it built partnerships with three privately funded
retirement communities, where volunteers and staff deliver and pick up books on a weekly
basis. At one of these retirement communities, the library has a very close relationship. Here, a
librarian visits the retirement community weekly.10 This retirement community has also become
the library’s unofficial partner for all things related to older adults. Staff from the library have
made presentations about library services at this retirement community, but not at any other
sites or organizations formed around older adults. Similarly, in organizing the library’s strategic
plan for FY2014–2016, a representative from this retirement community was invited to
participate. No other representatives from older adult organizations participated.
Main Library. The history of Main Library has many parallels to the history of Metro
Library. A library association formed a small reading room in 1868. In 1876, this association
donated its resources to the city to create a public library. Over the years, donations from local
businesses and from referenda led to library expansions and new library buildings.

10

Only volunteers visit the other two retirement communities with which Metro Library partners.

73

As at Metro Library, the Friends of Main Library group, formed in 1965, is composed
primarily of retired older adults. This group has been an important advocate for the library in
the local community. The Friends have been especially active between 2008 and 2016. In 2008,
the library opened a new library building. The new library has three times the space and four
times as many computers as the previous building. However, shortly after the building was
completed the economic recession of the late 2000s occurred. This recession led to declining
property values. The library struggled, as a result, to pay its debts. To cope with these issues, the
library has left 18 full-time-equivalent staff positions unfilled. The library has also reduced its
open hours. Three times the library has successfully appealed to the local city council for
emergency funding. The Friends of Main Library have filled the city council chambers during
these funding appeals. The mobilization and advocacy of these older adults have enabled Main
Library to continue functioning.
As at Metro Library, the primary service explicitly for older adults at Main Library is its
Home Delivery Service. The service is available to all, regardless of age. Nonetheless, the explicit
focus in the program is older adults. Promotional materials prominently feature an older woman
with a walker, and state that services are available at nursing homes. A promotional video
emphasizes the connection between this library service and older adults, stating that “the home
delivery program delivers books to the elderly who are unable to leave their homes to check out
their own books and videos.” No other users beyond the elderly are mentioned in the video.
During the last ten years, Main Library has started to expand its services for older adults.
The library’s five year plan for 2007 to 2012 states that a strategic goal is to ensure that “Adult
Services will meet the needs of seniors in our community by scheduling at least four programs

74

per year of interest to older populations.”11 As a means of reaching this goal, the library
organized what it calls a Fun After 50 committee. This committee organizes programs both at
the library and at a local retirement community.
In developing these programs and services, Main Library has partnered with a privately
funded retirement community located in the city’s downtown. The retirement communities that
Main and Metro libraries have partnered with cost a large amount of money to live in. These
private facilities have been better able to secure library services than have publicly funded and
non-profit groups such as senior centers and the community groups that meet there.
Branch Library. Like Tubman Senior Center, Branch Library formed out of the Tubman
Community Center located in the local African American community. When the Tubman
Community Center was organized in the 1940s, one of the center’s programs focused on
building a library of donated books. The Tubman Seniors were among those in the community
who organized to expand and improve this community library. This library was formed because
neither the Main Library nor the Metro Library provided adequate library services to the local
African American community. In 1970, the library’s slogan was “A Black Library for the Black
Community.” Then and now the library has focused its programs and services on the youth of
the community.
Over time, Branch Library has become more fully absorbed into Main Library. In 1975,
the independent library officially became Branch Library, a unit of Main Library. In 1996, the
Branch became more integrated into Main Library. The branch manager is now a member of
Main Library’s management team. In the mid-2000s, many programs at Branch Library were

11

To protect the privacy of these institutions, the specific documents referred to in this text are not cited.

75

integrated with Main Library. During this time period Main Library occupied a temporary facility
while its new building, opened in 2008, was being constructed. As a result, many Main Library
programs were held at Branch Library. Today, some programs, such as toddler storytime, are
still only offered at Branch Library, not at Main Library. Programs such as these attract a
majority European American and Asian American population. In contrast, regulars at Branch
Library tend to be almost entirely African American. Branch Library continues to be
geographically rooted in a majority African American neighborhood. Branch Library has also
been affected by the budget crisis shaping Main Library’s recent history. In 2015, the library’s
hours were reduced to save money for the library system as a whole.
Since Branch Library’s incorporation into Main Library’s system, older adults have
organized and advocated for Branch Library through their participation in a community advisory
committee. Older adults have been important leaders in this committee. For instance, in the
early 1980s, older adults on the committee organized a community oral history project at the
library that recorded the memories of older African Americans. These tapes, now digitized,
remain accessible at Branch Library. In recent years, however, this advisory committee has gone
into decline. In 2015, the advisory committee had only two members, one of whom was a
European American city council member and the other a retired African American woman. The
committee did not meet once from September 2014 to August 2015.

II. The digital divide leads to older adults being framed as service recipients, instead of as
community leaders
Starting in 1984, technology support services began to emerge in this community-based
information infrastructure, first in public libraries, and later in senior centers. Technology

76

support services have included access to computers and other digital technologies, access to
wifi, and access to individuals willing to help members of the public use technology. The primary
agents in the creation and evolution of technology support services have been external: the
local university; local, state and federal government; and local businesses, as well as the staff
and administration of these institutions.
The digital divide causes older adults to be framed as passive service recipients instead
of as community leaders in these technology support services. Older adults were in the past and
continue in the present to be active agents in these institutions. The senior centers would not
exist in the first place were it not for the organized efforts of older adults, and through
involvement in senior center and friends of the library groups, older adults continue to shape
both of these institutions. For instance, I found that older adults lead almost all programs at
senior centers, organizing potlucks, exercise classes, craft groups, coffee clubs, and many other
recurring and special events.
Despite their leadership in the foundation and maintenance of these community
institutions, in technology support services older adults are positioned as passive service
recipients. This shift has occurred in part because of the digital divide. Older adults cope with
digital inequalities that hinder their full participation in the information society and find it
difficult to lead technology support services in their communities. This finding illustrates how
disruptions caused by the still-emerging information society affect power dynamics between
information systems and information users in community-based information infrastructure. I
illustrate this finding through narrative histories of the development of technology support
services in these institutions.

77

Tubman Senior Center. The incorporation of technology support services into Tubman
Senior Center has relied on external funding and support from the local university. Reliance on
the university caused technology support services to not become integrated into the daily
rhythms of the senior center. As part of a community networking initiative, in 1997 university
students installed four desktop computers at the senior center in a room that has since become
known as the computer lab (Table 10). From 1997 to 2005, students from the university came
intermittently to the senior center to assist Tubman Seniors learning technology in this lab.
When students did not come to help, few older adults used the computers. In 2005, students
stopped coming entirely. From 2005 until 2010, the computer lab was largely unused.
A second actor that has shaped technology support services at Tubman Senior Center is
park district IT staff. This staff is based in the park district’s administrative building. The staff is
responsible for managing all technologies in the building. The IT staff have been the primary
partners of the university in its community networking initiatives. With funding from the state
government, the university worked with the park district IT staff to revamp the computer lab in
2010, and the senior center now has six desktop computers. The Tubman Seniors were not
involved in this project.

The installation of wifi in the building in 2010 also bypassed the Tubman Seniors. As a
result, the wifi was not used by the Tubman Seniors until 2014. The wifi was installed as part of
a municipal broadband expansion project that received federal funding, and was administered
by the local university working with local government. When the wifi was installed at the senior
center, none of the Tubman Seniors were aware of its existence. The IT staff did not work with
the Tubman Seniors, or even with the Tubman Senior Center’s staff, to ensure they could use
the wifi. The IT staff further chose to place the wifi behind a password, although when I brought
this issue to the senior center director’s attention, he convinced the IT staff to remove the
password. Furthermore, the speed of the wifi was slower than it should have been because the
IT staff chose to use older routers that could not handle the speeds made possible over the highspeed broadband network. This story illustrates how struggles over technology support services
at Tubman Senior Center took place behind the scenes, without the involvement of the Tubman
Seniors themselves.
Nevertheless, the Tubman Seniors have actively struggled to shape technology support
services. It was the Tubman Seniors who organized to bring computer classes back to the senior
center in 2012 after a seven-year hiatus. When the center’s director retired in 2011, she was
replaced by a man in his mid-20s. The Tubman Seniors appealed to him to re-start computer
classes, and this pressure led the center’s new director to start what he calls a “Computers 1-on1” program in early 2012. Since 2014, university students, led by me, have staffed this program.
The Tubman Seniors have also struggled to reconfigure their computer lab. When the
university students installed the new computers in 2010, they did not install a printer. A group
of quilters that met regularly at the center decided in 2011 to install a printer in the computer

79

lab. This incident is the only instance I found older adults customizing the technical set-up of
these six sites. Unfortunately, this accomplishment was not supported by the park district IT
staff. When the printer stopped working in 2014, the IT staff refused to support it because it was
not owned by the park district. Another Tubman Senior offered to donate a printer he had at his
house, but the IT staff would not provide him with the technical access needed to install the
printer in the computer lab.
Smith Senior Center. The local university and the park district IT staff, supported by
state and federal funds, also established technology support services at Smith Senior Center.
The same state grant that enabled university students to revamp the computer lab at Tubman
Senior Center in 2010 also enabled university students to install three public computers at Smith
Senior Center (Table 11). One of the three computers is an accessibility machine, with a special
monitor, keyboard, and mouse to support individuals with physical disabilities. Because no one
was trained to use this special machine, no one at Smith Senior Center ever used it.

Table 11: Evolution of technology support services at Smith Senior Center.

From 2010 to 2014, the three public computers were located in a room that became
known as the senior center computer lab. This room was often locked despite a sign on the door
stating the lab was open during hours the building was open. As part of administrative changes

80

in the park district, in 2015 the computers were moved out of the computer lab to make room
for more special recreation staff. The computers were moved to the back wall of a meeting
room in the rear of the building.
The wifi at Smith Senior Center was installed in 2010 through the same federally funded
program that brought wifi to Tubman Senior Center. As at Tubman, because it was behind a
password not shared with the Smith Seniors, the wifi at Smith Senior Center remained
inaccessible to older adults until 2015. Older adults at Smith Senior Center were not involved in
these decisions.
From 2010 until 2013, the director of Smith Senior Center provided technology support
once a week for one hour. These technology support services started because the director was
interested in starting them, and not because the Smith Seniors advocated for technology
support services. When the director left the senior center in early 2013, technology support
services were discontinued. This period of dormancy lasted until mid-2014, when I approached
the new director with the idea of re-starting them. When fieldwork ended in mid-2015, a
recently retired woman in her late 50s who had recently joined the Smith Seniors decided to
continue the program. This incident is the only instance found during fieldwork of a member of
a senior center leading technology support services. Unfortunately, this woman has not received
much support from the park district. When I talked with her and with the senior center director
in November 2015, I found out that the program may be discontinued because of a lack of
interest among the Smith Seniors. The older woman who volunteered to continue the program
was left to her own devices to figure out how to administer it.
Metro Senior Center. As at the other senior centers, the emergence of technology
support services at Metro Senior Center relied on the local university and on external funding.

81

The building does not have any public computers. The first public technology at the center was
wifi, which was installed in 2010 through the same program that brought wifi to the other senior
centers.
When I approached staff in summer 2014 with the idea of conducting fieldwork at the
senior center, staff did not even know wifi had ever been installed at the building. When the
staff at the building needed wifi for meetings, they used a mobile wifi hotspot. The park district
paid AT&T for this service. During fieldwork, this wifi hotspot was the device I used to make the
technology support services functional, since the wifi was not working. The wifi was not made
accessible in the building by park district IT staff until summer 2015, five years after high speed
broadband was connected to the building. When wifi became available, the park district kept it
behind a password.

No technology support services had been held at Metro Senior Center prior to this
study. During fieldwork, I organized a twice-monthly drop-in technology support service (Table
12). The times for these services were after the monthly potluck, and after the monthly folding
of the senior center’s newsletter, when Metro Seniors gather to send out their newsletter.
Because Metro Senior Center does not have any public computers, the sessions were
organized around a roundtable in the senior center lounge. All technology support took place on
the digital devices owned by older adults, or on equipment brought to the senior center by

82

other volunteers and by me. The director of the senior center promoted the program and
ensured that the park district’s mobile wifi hotspot was available until wifi became available in
2015. Older adults were not involved in the administrative decisions related to starting and
managing these technology support services.
Metro Library. At both Metro and Main Libraries, technology support services explicitly
for older adults emerge out of the assumption that older adulthood is synonymous with
disability (Table 13). In the late 1990s, the head of adult services at Metro Library participated in
a pilot project organized by a university community networking initiative that focused on
understanding the needs of older adults in relation to assistive technologies. As a result of this
project, since 2000 the library has had what it calls Senior Computer Stations, three computers
with large monitors and assistive technologies, such as ZoomText, designed for people with
disabilities.

Older adults who come to the library do not only use these Senior Computer Stations.
They also use library computers that have been available in some form at Metro Library since
1984. The expansion of technology support services at Metro Library has relied on donations
from local businesses. The library’s computer area is named after a prominent local business.
Currently, the library has 64 public computers located in the building. The library also has free
wifi. The wifi does not require a password, but the computers do. One needs a library card or
special permission from staff to use library computers.
Library staff provide technology support to patrons using library computers. This
support is augmented by a technology volunteer program in which volunteers from the local
university help patrons using technology. This program has been in operation since 2010. During
fieldwork, volunteers were available on average 12 hours a week, primarily between 9 a.m. and
6 p.m. on weekdays. Volunteers provide patrons with more intensive support than staff, who
tend to limit support sessions to a few minutes at a time.
Older adults use technology support services regularly. Although people of all ages
request support with library computers, older adults request this assistance with greater
frequency than the general population. During fieldwork, 2/3 of those asking for technology
support were older adults.
Older adults also participated actively in a Saturday afternoon drop-in class called
Computers 101. This class was staffed by volunteers from the local university. According to a
student who led the class, over 90% of the people who came to the class were older adults. Two
of the most regular participants were in their early 90s. When the class started in 2010 it was
offered once a week. Over time, the frequency of the class dropped to once a month. At the end
of 2014 the class was discontinued indefinitely because the library could not find volunteers

84

from the university able to staff it and librarians did not want to take on the responsibility of
continuing it. As of spring 2016, Computers 101 has not resumed. Older adults have not been
involved in the administrative decisions that shaped Metro Library’s technology support
services.
Main Library. The history of technology support services at Main Library has many
parallels to the history of Metro Library. As at Metro Library, technology support services
explicitly for older adults center on assistive technologies (Table 14). Two senior computer
stations were installed at the library in 2009.

Table 14: Evolution of technology support services at Main Library.
This table only includes technology support services available to older adults. Other technology support
services, such as youth technology programs offered by the library, are not included.

Older adults also use technology support services available to the general population.
The Main Library has had these services in some form since 1988. Currently, the library has 51
public computers available to adults. Twenty-six of these computers are located in an open area
next to the library’s adult services desk. Twenty-five of these computers are located in an
adjacent room, named after a local banker who donated money to the library to fund

85

technology services at the library. Free wifi is available throughout the building. A library card or
permission from staff is required to use library computers.
Librarians at the adult services desk are available to help patrons with library
computers. This support is augmented by volunteers from the local university. An adult services
librarian stated that middle-aged and older patrons are the primary users of technology support
services at the library. She said younger adults usually only need briefer assistance with things
like the printer or flash drives, but “older customers are the ones who need more intensive help
from librarians with technology. I would estimate maybe 75% of those needing a lot of help are
45 or older.”
In addition to supporting patrons with library computers, Main Library also hosts
programs to help patrons use the library’s eCollections (e.g. eBooks) on their personal devices.
These eCollections programs have been offered at the library since 2008. Large annual
eCollections programs are supplemented by drop-in eCollections programs held regularly during
fieldwork on the weekends. Most of the participants in these eCollections programs are older
adults. In recognition of this fact, promotional materials for eCollections programs feature an
older couple using a tablet device together. Nevertheless, as at the other sites, older adults have
not been involved in the administrative decisions that shape technology support services at
Main Library.
Branch Library. Unlike the other two libraries, Branch Library has no senior computer
stations. Older adults do use public computers at the library, however. Branch Library is open 54
hours a week, and it has had public computers available in the library since 1994 (Table 15). The
library currently has 20 public computers, accessible with a library card, along with free wifi. All
the technology in Branch Library is administered by Main Library. Like the other libraries, Branch

86

Library has a technology volunteer program. The program at Branch Library is smaller than at
the other two libraries. Only one or two students participate in this program at a time.
With funding from a state grant, in 2011 Branch Library expanded its computer lab. The
lab more than tripled in size, expanding from six to 20 computers. The new, larger lab has an
explicit focus on helping individuals learn technology to secure employment. Programs on
resumes and job applications are offered at Branch Library through a partnership with a local
community college. As at the other public libraries, older adults have not been involved in the
administration of technology support services at Branch Library.

III. Bureaucratic limits fetter agency of older adults
The staff of the senior centers and public libraries studied cope with the many
responsibilities they have in their communities by instantiating bureaucratic limits on
technology support services. These limits emerge out of the well-meaning goal of providing
professional services to all individuals during the institutions’ open hours, but the unintended
effect of these policies and practices is to fetter the agency of older adults. As older adults seek
support with technology in their community, they navigate a complex set of rules that vary from
institution to institution. They do this work as individuals seeking help, not as agents in their
communities ready and able to shape community-based information infrastructure.

87

The bureaucratically imposed limits on technology support services include:
•
•
•
•
•

Limits on who can volunteer to help others with technology;
Limits on times when support is available at the sites;
Limits on access to equipment;
Limits on outreach; and
Limits on staff’s ability to support technology not managed by the institution.

The next two sections analyze how both older adults and staff struggle to create practices that
circumvent these limits. These counter tendencies may, over time, create new forms of
community-based information infrastructure that transcend the limits discussed in this section.
Limits on who can volunteer to help others with technology. In different ways, all six
institutions place restrictions on who can help others with technology in an official capacity.
Public libraries largely restrict their technology volunteer program to students from the local
university, and in particular to graduate students from the university’s library science program.
The most restrictive site is Metro Library, which explicitly bars all from volunteering except for
graduate students from the university’s library science program who submit an application, and
who go through an interview. Main Library and Branch Library also require applications, and
favor graduate students—a sign next to the computer area in Main Library states “Thanks to our
volunteers from the university library & information science program.” Main and Branch
Libraries, however, are also willing to accept into the technology volunteer program any
individual who has skills to share. The result of this more open policy is that two recently retired
individuals now volunteer once a week at Main Library to help patrons with technology. One of
these individuals, a man in his early 60s, stated that:
For me, it is just a way to give back. I used technology all the time on the job [as a
paralegal professional.] On my job, you know, I just saw the need. I saw people needing
help with technology. So I was looking for ways to give back when I retired and I saw

88

that here at Main Library one way you can help the library is to help people with
computers. So I decided that was for me.12
Individuals such as this man are rare. During fieldwork I found that almost all volunteers at Main
and Branch Library are students from the university’s library science program. These volunteers
are favored by staff, and the university is the only place where staff recruit volunteers (Table
16). At the senior centers, volunteers are not actively recruited. Although technically anyone can
volunteer in senior center technology support services, in practice the lack of recruitment
means that all volunteer opportunities are filled by students from the local university.

Among possible volunteer roles in the library, Main Library states that volunteers can assist in “helping
computer users at the library.”

89

This reliance on university students, and on highly trained graduate students at that,
limits the volunteer pool at all six institutions. As a result, the sites continually cope with the
challenge of not having enough volunteers available to support all the individuals seeking
assistance with technology. Table 16 shows that none of the sites have enough volunteers
available to ensure that someone seeking help will find a receptive volunteer during the
institutions’ open hours.
Limits on times in which support is available at the sites. Since the institutions do not
have as many technology volunteers as they need, and since the staff have competing
responsibilities, the institutions impose limits on the times in which technology support is
available at the sites. The institutions also limit how much time staff will provide to people
seeking support, and so technology support is not reliably and consistently available.
At the three public libraries, there exists an expectation of excellence in information
services. This expectation leads librarians, library staff and volunteers to provide hands-on
support to those using library computers whenever the library is open to the public. At Main
Library, even security guards and IT staff—that is, library staff one would not expect to be
providing direct assistance to the public—occasionally will help patrons in the computer area
when no other staff is available. On the other hand, public librarians also limit the duration of
any particular helping episode. If a librarian or library staff member identifies a patron as
needing intensive assistance, that is more than a few minutes of help, they will direct the patron
to a technology volunteer. Technology volunteers, however, are not always available.
Furthermore, the schedules of volunteers are unpredictable, which means that in some
instances a staff member may not be able to say with certainty when one will next be available.
So staff will often request that patrons needing technology support for more than a few minutes

90

at a time come back at a later, sometimes unspecified date when someone with more time to
help them may be available.
In contrast, at the senior centers, a different convention of practice operates. Here the
focus is on excellent programs, and not on excellence in terms of access to information systems.
In this model, technology support services are limited to particular programs. Outside of these
programs, staff do not regularly provide technology support to older adults. For instance, during
the 2014 winter holidays, technology support services were not held at Tubman Senior Center.
During this time, a part-time staff member, a young African American woman who grew up in
the local area, said that regulars from the technology support services started coming to her for
help. She resisted this role. Talking to me about this phenomenon, she said, “I am going to start
writing people prescriptions telling them to come see you when you are back next Thursday
[laughs], because I do not want to be asked this technology stuff all the time.” This staff
member’s attitude is similar to that of other senior center staff. Furthermore, older adults learn
to expect technology support to be erratically available at the senior centers. In this underresourced environment, new volunteers are constantly joining and leaving, and support sessions
are frequently cancelled when volunteers are unavailable, or when the building is closed. In the
past, technology support services have stopped entirely for periods of time at both Tubman and
Smith Senior Centers.
The effects of these limits on times in which support is available can be devastating for
older adults learning technology. In January 2015, an older African American woman in her early
70s told the director of Tubman Senior Center that she was excited to start learning technology.
She had arranged her schedule, which was full of medical appointments and family obligations
(she was the only person in her extended family who owned a car), so she could come to

91

technology support services on Monday afternoons. Unfortunately, in February 2015 the time of
the technology support service shifted to Tuesday. No volunteers were available on Monday in
the spring. As a result of this scheduling shift, this woman was only able to make it to one field
session. The director did not offer to help the woman with technology at the times when she
was available. Instead, he insisted that the only times in which technology support would be
available at Tubman Senior Center were during the officially demarcated technology support
programs. The director at Smith Senior Center also turned away older adults who had not signed
up in advance for technology support programs at the center.
Limits on access to equipment. The second technique the institutions use to maintain
control over technology support services is to limit access to equipment. Mobile devices and
peripherals are kept locked away, rules are rigidly enforced, and time limits are imposed. At
Tubman Senior Center the director purchased three headsets to better enable Tubman Seniors
to listen to music, watch videos, and do videoconferencing in the computer lab. Out of concern
for the security of these objects, he kept them in a locked file cabinet, which was in turn in his
locked office. As a result, the headsets were never used. Restrictions also shape the accessibility
of mobile technology available at public libraries. Main Library has Chromebooks available, but a
complex check-out process made this resource virtually inaccessible. When I helped an older
patron navigate the check-out process it took over 30 minutes to complete the forms before she
was able to start using the device. Similar bureaucratic processes made laptops available at
Metro Library mostly inaccessible.
Rules also shape how technology is accessed across the six sites. At Main and Branch
Libraries a culture of surveillance sometimes creates an antagonistic atmosphere between staff
and users in the library’s computer areas. Security staff and librarians use staff computers to

92

check the names of patrons logged into library computers against the actual individuals sitting at
those computers. If any discrepancies are discovered (such as a female patron using what
appears to be a man’s name), security staff investigate the issue and the patron may be asked to
leave. Main and Branch Libraries have a zero-tolerance policy for using someone else’s library
card to get on the computer. They also insist that patrons have a library card or a temporary
computer access card to use a library computer. At Main Library would-be computer users
lacking library cards have to go through a complex process to start using a library computer.
They have to talk to library staff on two different floors of the library, fill out a form, and display
proper identification. The whole process takes between 10 and 15 minutes, sometimes longer,
and did not always end in success in those instances when an individual lacked the required
photo identification. These procedures took even longer for older adults with mobility issues. An
older woman with a walker had to go up and down between the floors multiple times before
she could access a library computer. In the middle of winter, another older patron had to go
outside to the parking lot to retrieve her photo identification card before the library would let
her use a computer.
Another technique used at libraries to regulate access is time limits. The idea behind
time limits on public computers is to ensure that those computers are widely available to all. In
practice, however, I found that time limits lead to arbitrary limitations on the amount of time
older adults and others have to use library computers. At Branch Library an older African
American man reported experiencing hostility from librarians because of his non-utilitarian use
of technology. He came almost every morning to the library to use the computers. He was new
to technology, so spent much of his time exploring how to search the internet and routinely
wanted to use the computer beyond the two hours per day allocated to him.

93

The official policy at all three libraries is that patrons with library cards can use library
computers for two hours a day, with extensions granted at the discretion of staff. In practice,
extensions are almost always granted at Main Library and Metro Library, but this is not the case
at the Branch Library. Oddly, it was also at Branch Library where computers are least used.
During field sessions I never saw Branch Library’s computers more than 50% occupied, and at
certain times during winter mornings there was only one patron using the computers. When
asked about the policy of not granting extensions, a librarian at Branch Library confirmed that
extensions are reserved for people doing work-related projects, like resumes and job
applications. As a result, this older man was repeatedly told that his time on the computer was
up, even though there were ample computers available and no one waiting to use them.
Finally, limits to technology at senior centers are imposed by bureaucratic rules about
who is a member and who is not a member. At Tubman Senior Center and at Smith Senior
Center, technology support services were technically only open to members of the park district’s
50+ senior program. Membership costs $20 a year. Non-members are supposed to pay $3 per
technology support session. This rule was never enforced at Tubman Senior Center, but at Smith
Senior Center the director rigidly enforced the rule. If she spotted someone in the computer lab
who was not a member, she would insist they either pay the $3 fee, become a member, or
leave.
Limits on outreach. Another means of controlling technology support services is to limit
the amount of outreach done about them. The more outreach is done, the more people know
that technology support services are available. From the perspective of overpressured staff, this
is not always a good thing. The only form of outreach that takes place in all six institutions is
face-to-face outreach within the building (Table 17). Staff inform individuals who come up to

94

them in the building that technology support is available there. The next-most-common
outreach is also site-based: flyers or signs located within the building that inform adults of
technology support available there. These modalities of outreach only function for those older
adults already participating in senior centers and public libraries.

Table 17: Modalities of outreach for technology support services, by site.

In general, senior centers put more effort into pushing technology support services than
public libraries. As mentioned earlier, the institution of the senior center orients staff time
around programs. As a result, at senior centers outreach is highly routinized and integral to the
administration of the sites. The third-most-common modalities of outreach are all only used at
senior centers: monthly print schedules, seasonal print program guides, and local television. In
addition to printing and distributing schedules and program guides, the senior centers push

95

technology support services on television. Metro Senior Center also places notices about
technology support services in the “For the Retirees” column of a local newspaper.
Public libraries put less emphasis on pushing technology support services in the local
community. Because of budgetary stress, Main Library chose to leave the position of
outreach/publicity coordinator unfilled. The library saw this position as expendable, one that
could be (and was) cut in order to maintain the library’s core function of providing access to
information systems. During fieldwork, the outreach done by public libraries tended to be ad
hoc, not routinized. On one occasion, staff at Branch Library decided to put the hours in which
technology volunteers would be available on its website, but staff only posted these hours for
three months, after which the practice ceased. Similarly, an adult services librarian at Metro
Library occasionally placed notices in the “For the Retirees” column of the local newspaper
about its Computers 101 class, but without the regularity of Metro Senior Center. Whether or
not outreach took place at public libraries depended on whether or not a librarian remembered
and had the time to do it. Outreach is not routinized in the way it is in the work schedules of
staff at senior centers.
As a result of this lack of outreach, older adults who do not in their normal course of life
use library computers are unaware of technology support services available at libraries. During
field sessions at Metro Senior Center I mentioned to older adults that if they wanted technology
support beyond the limited hours available at the center (only twice a month) they could go to
Metro Library, which is located a half-mile away. None of the older adults I talked to at Metro
Senior Center knew technology support was available at Metro Library. Older adults also found
what limited outreach public libraries did to be confusing. At Main Library, one man was
confused by the library’s quiet computer room. To enter the room, one has to go through a door

96

that has the name of a local bank (which gave the library money for technology) above the
words “Quiet Room.” This man told me that he went to Main Library to check out some CDs. As
he walked through the building, he noticed a sign for technology support by the quiet room. He
did not inquire about the technology support service because he thought it was only for people
who did business at the local bank.
Limits on staff’s ability to support technology not managed by the institution. Finally,
these institutions control technology support services by limiting staff to locally managed
information systems. This limitation keeps staff from building networks with other institutions,
and also with older adults. Each site independently administers its own technology support
services, functioning as an island, the only bridges emerging across institutions that share a
parent entity (e.g. Main & Branch Libraries; Tubman & Smith Senior Centers). This isolation
occurs in the context of close geographic proximity.

Table 18: Geographic distances among sites.

Table 18 shows that all six sites are located very near to one another—Tubman Senior
Center is located just 50 feet from Branch Library. Older adults do go to both institutions; an
older adult may go to the senior center, and then stop at the library to see what is going on
there. No similar links connect staff between the two institutions, however. The director at
Tubman Senior Center had no idea that librarians helped older adults with technology at Branch

97

Library, and Branch Library staff did not know that technology support services had been in
place at the senior center since 1997. A similar disjuncture exists between Metro Senior Center
and Metro Library, located 0.5 miles from each other. The staff at Metro Library also were
unaware of technology support services at Main Library.
The institutions focus staff time on managing systems owned by the institution. This
institutional priority prevents staff from supporting older adults on technology they own and
bring into the library. At public libraries, training for technology volunteers explicitly states that
volunteers and librarians should not help patrons on personal devices unless the volunteer or
librarian considers themselves to be an expert with that device. Volunteers and librarians are
also instructed to never touch a patron’s personal device. These policies emerge out of two
concerns: (1) that the library will be held liable for anything that happens to a patron’s device
during such a help session; and (2) since patrons’ personal devices are not owned by the library,
the library cannot promise the same level of support offered for equipment and information
systems owned and managed by the library.
Concerns about maintaining professional excellence keep libraries from supporting
older adults learning to use their own personal devices. An older woman brought a new laptop
to Metro Library to learn how to use it. She initially asked for help at the circulation desk, on the
first floor. There she was directed to the adult services desk, on the second floor. There, a
librarian told her that she could help the patron get online, but only on the library’s computer,
not on her laptop. The patron asked the librarian to help her with the laptop, but the librarian
refused.
At the libraries, a convention of practice focuses on exposing patrons to library
information systems but not always providing them with the support they need use these

98

technologies. An adult services librarian at Metro Library wants to provide what she calls
“technology experiences” for older adults. She wants older adults to know about recently
acquired technologies in the library, such as a 3-D printer and other new technologies available
in the library’s makerspace. Similar conventions of practice focus on exposing older adults to
technologies owned by the library, but without helping them figure out how to use them, at the
other libraries. Main Library is developing what one librarian described as “a book club but with
technology” that would focus on “exposing seniors to new technologies, focused on cuttingedge technologies like QR codes and fab-labs.” The goal of the project was to “raise seniors’
awareness and exposure” to new technology, but not to teach them how to use them.
Budgetary stress has led to an entrenched focus on library information systems at Main and
Branch Libraries. Library staff at the adult services desk there are expected to juggle reference
duties with work on library collections. At the beginning of their shifts, adult services staff wheel
out carts full of books, CDs and DVDs they will process while working the adult services desk. In
some cases, librarians are so immersed in these collections that they lose track of what was
going on around them. Patrons seeking help would sometimes have to stand in front of the
adult services desk for a full minute before they could get the librarian’s attention.

IV. Information infrastructure evolves through struggles of individual older adults in information
systems
These limits on technology support services are not passively accepted by older adults,
nor do all staff embrace them. Changes emerge in community-based information infrastructure
through the complex give-and-take that characterizes daily negotiations in these institutions.
Some of these negotiations happen behind the scenes among staff, and some occur in the public

99

spaces of these institutions, and involve older adults. Older adults do not passively use services
created for them. They actively seek to adapt these services to meet their needs. Through these
negotiations and struggles rules change, and new policies and practices emerge. This section
analyzes how struggle in community-based information infrastructure leads to evolving
technology support services.
Negotiations in a library eBooks program. Examples of both public and private
negotiations appear in this story about the development of a public library program. Since the
late 2000s, Main Library has had a series of programs focused on helping patrons use
eCollections (such as eBooks) for which the library has purchased licenses. The librarians that
administer this program are aware that older adults are the program’s primary audience.
Librarians are also aware that many of the older adults coming to the programs seek support
with their personal devices more generally. They want help figuring out how to use tablet
devices, not just to be able to download eBooks, but in general.
On at least three occasions during fieldwork older adults came to eCollections programs
seeking general assistance with technology and were turned away by librarians. On the first
occasion, an older adult did not own a personal device, but wanted to learn more about tablet
devices. On the second occasion, an older adult owned an iPad, but said she needed help getting
started with it before starting to use digital library collections. A third woman also went to an
eCollections program with her new iPad to figure out how to use it. All three of these individuals
were told by librarians that they would have to limit their participation in the programs around
learning how to access the library’s eCollections.
Aware that the program was not meeting the needs of participants, one adult service
librarian attempted to change the focus of the programs. In October 2014, this librarian

100

attempted to re-brand the program as a “drop-in technology help” program that would help
patrons learn whatever they wanted to learn in relation to digital technology. The head of adult
services at Main Library rejected this proposal, and the restrictive focus on eCollections
continues. Although in this particular instance change did not occur through these negotiations,
perhaps a different community-based information infrastructure could emerge in the future.
Staff bend the rules in response to the agency of older adults. Staff who have not fully
become socialized into the professional norms of the institutions sometimes develop innovative
techniques that nimbly respond to the needs of users. For instance, despite official limits on
how much librarians can help patrons with their personal devices, at Main Library a library
technician—significantly, not a full librarian—always supports patrons on their personal devices
in whatever form they want whenever she works at the adult services desk.
In another case, one part-time employee of the park district who worked at Tubman
Senior Center for six months spontaneously started supporting the Tubman Senior Center’s
quilting group with their smartphones. As they quilt, these women sometimes use their
smartphones to show each other things they have found online, and so the part-time employee
offered assistance to the women, especially with iPhones, which was the device she owned.
Unfortunately, in April 2015, the employee left the senior center, and her practices were not
institutionalized. Her replacement did not continue the tradition of offering technology support
to the quilters; technology support was not part of her job, so she did not provide it.
Nonetheless, through transgressive actions like these, limits are broken and new forms of
community-based information infrastructure may emerge.
Older adults endeavor to form supportive relationships with technology helpers. As
individuals, older adults also exert their agency by trying, and sometimes succeeding, to form

101

relationships with technology volunteers. Older adults rely on these relationships to learn
technology across time. At the Main Library an older man referred to one of the technology
volunteers as “the one I always go to for help. She knows what I need.” Similar relationships
form at all six institutions.
One of the reasons why older adults develop these relationships with particular
technology helpers is that it takes time to identify someone willing and able to provide ongoing
technology support. Once such an individual is found, they return to these people over and over
again. At Branch Library, one staff member (whose official job title is children’s librarian) said
that for the last two years she has worked with an older African American woman who comes in
every Monday afternoon to work with her to learn to use the computer:
I can’t even remember how that started! She was just coming in all the time asking
questions, and I guess after a while we just kind of settled into that routine. Now I know
to leave some time on Monday afternoon free because I know she will be in with more
questions [laughs].
These relationships result from the agency of older adults.
Unfortunately, these relationships are not always supported or nurtured by the
institutions in which they form. Staff at Metro Library stated that these relationships emerge
very regularly, but problems arise when a favored volunteer leaves and the patron then
becomes frustrated trying to find someone else who will work with them. As a result of this
problem, the library is trying to make technology support more anonymous. The library wants
patrons to develop relationships with the library as an institution, and not with individual
technology volunteers. To achieve this goal, Metro Library has decided to not give volunteers
name tags; technology volunteers simply wear a badge that says “volunteer” on it. Nonetheless,
older adults continue to endeavor to form relationships with technology volunteers. The library

102

wants technology support services to operate in one way, older adults want them to operate in
a different way. Through situated negotiations the actual technology support services emerge.
Older adults seek support on their personal devices. Change in community-based
information infrastructure does not come only from the top-down, it also comes from the
bottom-up. In addition to working to form relationships with supportive helpers, I also found
older adults increasingly seeking technology support on the personal digital devices they own.
Over time, these help-seeking strategies led to changes in how technology support services
operate, especially at senior centers. Table 19 demonstrates that a large difference exists
between senior centers and public libraries in terms of the technologies older adults use in
technology support services. Older adults are more than three times more likely to use lab
computers at public libraries than at senior centers. In contrast, older adults are four times more
likely to use their personal devices at senior centers than at public libraries. When support for
personal devices is available, then, older adults use it.

Technology support services have changed over time at the senior centers. When
technology support services started at Smith Senior Center and at Tubman Senior Center, the
services focused exclusively on the senior center computer labs. At both senior centers, a
primary obstacle to supporting older adults on their personal devices, as opposed to on lab
computers, was the lack of accessible wifi. Even when wifi became available, the staff who
administered the technology support services did not feel prepared to help older adults use it.
This lack of support for wifi relates to a lack of staff identification with the information
society at senior centers. No senior center staff, when asked, said they feel like a netizen, or a
citizen of the information/internet society (Table 20). As a result of their own insecurities with
technology, staff at senior centers do not always feel comfortable offering assistance with
technology to older adults.

Table 20: Staff identification as a netizen, by site. n=7.

The ages of the staff had little to do with this phenomenon: the director at Tubman
Senior Center was in his mid-20s, and the director of Smith Senior Center was in her late 50s.
Both said in interviews that they felt like they barely knew how to use their own personal
devices. During fieldwork, both approached me for help with technology. As a result of these
insecurities, they did not initially feel comfortable supporting older adults on their devices.
Even after wifi became more accessible at the senior centers, older adults did not
suddenly start bringing their personal devices to technology support services. The centers had
established a convention of practice focused on the computer lab, and that convention took

104

time to change. As Table 21 below shows, the percentage of older adults using lab computers at
the Tubman and Smith Senior Center dropped during fieldwork as they learned that they could
receive support on their personal devices.

Table 21: Use of lab computers at Tubman and Smith Senior Centers, during first and last three months
of fieldwork.

When older adults learn that someone will help them with their personal device, they
enthusiastically take advantage of this opportunity. On four different occasions, older adults
came for the first time to technology support services at senior centers without a personal
device. They returned later with their device after learning that someone there could help them
figure out how to use it. A newcomer to a technology help sessions at Tubman Senior Center—
whom I had seen also seeking support at both Main Library and Branch Library—initially
assumed that, as at the libraries, he would have to use the lab computers to receive technology
support. When he found out that he could get support on his laptop, he started bringing his
laptop and never touched a lab computer again.
Nonetheless, the lab computers continue to be vitally important for those older adults
who either lack any personal devices or whose only personal device is a stationary desktop
computer. Table 21 also shows that even during the last three months of fieldwork between 12
and 14% of older adults who participated in technology support programs continued to use lab

105

computers. In other words, computer labs remain important for older adults even as the
majority shift to using their own personal devices.
Public computers also continue to be important at public libraries. On one occasion, an
older woman came to Main Library to receive assistance filling a form out online. She said she
could have done it at home on her desktop, but it would have taken her “at least four times
longer.” Having support at the library, and having access to library computers, was very
important to her. Older adults seek support on devices they own, as well as on computers and
equipment owned and managed by libraries and senior centers.
Through the situated negotiations and struggles that take place between older adults
and the staff responsible for information systems community-based information infrastructure
evolves and changes over time. Older adults express their agency in this infrastructure by
attempting, and succeeding, to secure the support they need, even if this support is not
something the institutions want to provide.

V. Groups of older adults shape information infrastructure
Although older adults have not been involved in the creation and administration of
technology support services at the six sites, they nonetheless have shaped this information
infrastructure. They have done so in part by adapting technology support services to their
group-based communities of practice, especially at senior centers. Senior centers are groupbased institutions. One joins a senior center and then becomes part of the group. With support,
these organized groups of older adults learn to help each other with technology.
The presence of group-based communities of practice in senior centers can be seen in
the fact that older adults are more than three times as likely to socialize while using technology

106

support services there, compared to public libraries (Table 22). At Metro and Tubman Senior
Centers, older adults socialized together while using technology during 94% and 78% of field
sessions, respectively. At Smith Senior Center, 42% of field sessions featured older adults
socializing.13 This type of socializing is much rarer at public libraries. At public libraries the norm
was the individual patron using library technology by themselves, only talking when asking a
librarian or a volunteer a question.

Table 22: Older adult socializing in technology support services, by site.

Newcomers to senior centers learn they are expected to become part of the group. In
March 2015 a European American man who had recently retired from a blue-collar job at the
university starting coming to technology support services at Tubman Senior Center. He came
back 27 times during fieldwork. In an interview he stated:

13

The lower frequency of socializing at Smith Senior Center relates to the fact that the computer lab was
smaller, having only two regular desktop computers (and one special computer with assistive software
and peripherals), and thus on some occasions only one older adult participated at a time.

107

You know, when I first came I didn’t know what to expect …. So, I got here and everyone
was talking. Everyone seemed to know everyone, and they were talking about things,
like, you know, growing older [laughs]. And that one guy, he said he worked for the
university, in my unit! I didn’t know him. I don’t think our times overlapped. But, we
knew a lot of the same people. And, we talked. And it was great, you know, making that
connection. It really helped me feel like this is a place I could belong, even though I’m
not Black, you know. This place is really welcoming to everyone.
In this quote, this man reveals the process by which he moved from being a peripheral
participant to a full member in this community.
Those already part of the group refresh and reinforce membership while participating in
technology support services. Two older African American men participated in more than 50 field
sessions at Tubman Senior Center. The two asked questions about how to do things with their
devices, while also socializing together about their lives and experiences. Visits to senior centers
for technology support services also overlap with social visits to the center. At Smith Senior
Center older adults often came to the computer lab for a few minutes after another program
ended, such as a potluck or a game of cards. Others would come to the computer lab and then
stay around the center until another program began.
The expectation of being part of the group also extends to technology helpers at the
senior centers. Older adults invite volunteers to join them at their potlucks. Older adults also
invite volunteers to their homes, and to other events in their lives. At Tubman Senior Center one
of the regular participants in technology support services is an older musician in his late 70s. He
formed a strong relationship with one volunteer. This relationship was strengthened when this
volunteer and her husband attended one of the musician’s concerts. When the director at
Tubman Senior Center got engaged, he invited the Tubman Seniors to his engagement party,
saying, “You are all my family.” He later held his wedding reception at the senior center.

108

The group-based culture of senior centers is related to but distinct from the
phenomenon of being a regular at an institution. This distinction can be seen in the comparison
between Table 22, above, and Table 23, below. This comparison reveals that even though
Branch Library has the highest percentage of regulars among the six institutions (88%, Table 23),
it also has the lowest rates of socializing while using technology (3%, Table 22). At Branch
Library regulars routinely greet librarians at the door, in some cases even hugging them, but
they did not socialize with other patrons. In other words, regulars at Branch Library have strong
relationships with librarians, but not with each other. There is no group of patrons in the same
way there are groups at the senior centers. At the other public libraries, which had lower
percentages of regulars than the senior centers, interactions both among patrons and between
patrons and librarians tended to be anonymous.

The total n in the “All” column exceeds 209 because older adults participated in multiple sites. Due to
rounding, columns do not sum to 100%.

Nevertheless, in some cases groups of older adults do use public libraries together. On
Tuesday mornings an informal group of 3 or 4 older women meets at Metro Library to get
coffee, catch up with each other’s lives, look at new books, and use library computers. They go
to the computers together and quietly discuss some of the things they look at. Occasionally one
of the women will ask a librarian for help, but usually they work together on their own.

109

Collaborative learning in senior center groups
At Metro Senior Center, the group-based community of practice formed there led to the
development of collaborative learning of technology among older adults. I only found this type
of learning at this institution. In this section I analyze how this unique phenomenon emerged.
Table 24 shows that Metro Senior Center had both the highest level of socializing among
older adults using technology (94%) as well as the highest level of older adults helping each
other with technology. During 89% of field sessions at Metro Senior Center, older adults helped
each other with technology. At no other institutions was collaborative learning so common.
During 20% of the field sessions at Tubman Senior Center, and 19% of the field sessions at Smith
Senior Center, older adults helped each other with technology. At the public libraries, less than
10% of field sessions found older adults helping each other with technology.

The reason that Metro Senior Center fostered more collaborative learning among older
adults than the other institutions relates to the history of technology support services there. At
all the institutions except Metro Senior Center, technology support services were organized
around the model of one-to-one teaching and learning. In this model, a staff member or a
volunteer would assist an older adult learning technology. At Metro Senior Center, on the other
hand, technology support services were instead started with the idea that older adults could
help other older adults learning technology. During announcements for the program at the
monthly potluck, the director of the senior center said that older adults could receive assistance
from me but that older adults could also come and help each other.
Nevertheless, collaborative learning among older adults did not spontaneously start
taking place at Metro Senior Center. It needed support. When I came to the senior center for
field sessions I found older adults patiently waiting for me. It was only after I arrived that older
adults got out their digital devices and started asking me questions. After they had asked me
questions, they started talking amongst themselves, and eventually started helping one another.
The older adults only felt comfortable helping each other with technology when a young person
was in the room they could turn to if and when obstacles arose. One participant said that she
liked knowing that I was there in case they needed someone to “bail us out if we get in over our
heads [Laughs].”
Collaborative learning at Metro Senior Center took two forms: (1) older adults helping
older adults on their devices, and (2) open discussions about technology involving all
participants. In terms of the former, older adults visibly struggling with a new device unfamiliar
to them were supported by other older adults in the room. Older adults saw someone in need
and spontaneously started helping them. In some cases, older adults even offered support on

111

devices they had never used before. An older European American man brought his iPhone to a
technology support service. He had owned the device for a year, but said he could not use it for
more than making and receiving phone calls. Seeing the man having difficulty operating his
iPhone, an African American woman sitting adjacent to him spontaneously started supporting
him. This woman had an Android smartphone and had never touched an iPhone before.
Nonetheless, the two of them started figuring out the unknown device together.
Older adults would also overhear what others were doing during technology support
services and then start discussing the issue together. After someone said they were thinking
about buying a new phone, the group of older adults discussed the benefits and limitations of
their own phones, as well as what they had heard about other phones. Through these
discussions older adults learn together how to navigate the information society. Other
spontaneous small group conversations at Metro Senior Center focused on how to secure one’s
device, how to avoid digital scams, how to find books that explain how to use technology, and
the frustrations of children who are not patient enough with them as they learn technology.
The physical set-up of technology support services facilitated this collaborative learning.
Unlike Tubman Senior Center and Smith Senior Center, where the rooms are set up in such a
way that older adults naturally look away from each other and towards their desktop
computers, Metro Senior Center simply has a round table and chairs for technology support
services. In this open environment, older adults sit around the table, face each other, and help
each other. Group-based communities of practice already exist at senior centers. Senior centers
form around community groups that meet regularly. These groups can facilitate the
development of collaborative learning of technology among older adults. This collaborative

112

learning does not emerge on its own, but it can be supported through thoughtful policies and
practices that empower older adults to help each other.

VI. Older adults and information systems cope together with changing technical standards
This section concludes this analysis of how community-based information infrastructure
emerges and evolves through struggle by widening the focus of analysis. Thus far the focus has
been on older adults (information users) and local government (information systems). In
addition to these local forces, community-based information infrastructure is shaped by global
forces. In particular, both information users and information systems cope with the changing
technologies released in the global electronics consumer marketplace. This coping occurs when:
•
•

Information systems work to maintain and extend the accessibility of public
technologies; and
Information systems and information users work to stay up-to-date with the myriad
devices, models, and applications available in the global marketplace.

Information systems cope with changing technological standards. All six institutions
cope with challenges related to maintaining wifi networks and/or public computers. After wifi
became available at the three senior centers, the staff there did not know how to make it
accessible to older adults, and so years elapsed between the time the wifi was installed and the
time when older adults started using it at the senior centers. The time it took to make this wifi
accessible relates to the challenges senior center staff face as they reconfigure their institutions
to support older adults using and learning technology. Many employees at both senior centers
and public libraries are ambivalent about being asked to cope with the challenges of this role.
Discussing the fact that much of her time at the adult services desk is spent helping patrons use
library computers, a librarian stated that this type of work “is not why I came to library school.”

113

Times in which systems had to be upgraded proved to be especially difficult for staff.
During fall 2014, all 70 public computers at Metro Library ran on the Windows XP operating
system. Microsoft had stopped supporting Windows XP on April 8, 2014. The library had not yet
upgraded its public computers because staff could not figure out how to make library software
run on the new operating system. The library further lacked the technical support necessary to
launch into a lengthy upgrade process.14 Because the public computers were using out-of-date
standards, many programs (especially Internet Explorer) did not run well, or broke down
without explanation. Staff coped with these challenges as best they could, helping patrons work
around these problems by suggesting alternative programs. This example illustrates how the
staff at these institutions cope with the challenges of maintaining public access to technology in
the context of frequently changing technological standards. Importantly, this work is done
behind the scenes, prior to the arrival of the public into these spaces. The other institutions
coped with similar, if less extreme challenges when technological standards changed.
Information systems and users cope together. As more and more older adults bring
their personal devices into public libraries and into senior centers, the staff of these institutions
cope with the challenge of supporting all the diverse technologies available in the electronics
marketplace. Table 25 displays the types of devices older adults brought to technology support
services. Laptops were brought by 49% of the older adults in this sample. Other devices brought
include: tablets, 29%; smartphones, 26%; A/V devices (e.g. digital cameras, mp3 players), 19%;
flash-drives, 17%; flip-phones, 8%; and even printers, 1%.

14

This in-house expertise has since become part of Metro Library. In Spring 2015, and in part because of
the challenges related to upgrading public computers, the library hired its first Technology Manager.

Table 25: Personal devices used in technology support services. n=209.
Total percentage exceeds 100% because older adults brought multiple devices.

Many of the devices and/or software belonging to the older adults were quite old. The
oldest technology encountered during field sessions was an Apple PowerBook from 1997, which
the owner continues to use on a weekly basis to check her email. She brought the laptop to
Smith Senior Center because she wanted help using it to browse the internet. Laptops, mp3
players, and digital cameras more than 10 years old were also brought in for support. Some
older adults also wanted help using programs like Microsoft Works and WordPerfect X3,
software which has not been updated or supported by its developers since 2007 and 2008,
respectively.
When staff and volunteers attempt to provide support for these diverse devices,
obstacles arise because of incompatibility among devices and operating systems. One man
wanted to migrate his music collection from an older Windows XP laptop to a new Windows 7
laptop. In this process, he and a volunteer confronted numerous obstacles: (1) some of the
Windows Media Player audio files (WMA) would not play on the new laptop because Microsoft
identified the files as pirated (they were not); (2) he could not integrate his older music files into
a growing mp3 collection he had started to manage in iTunes; (3) he had further difficulty

115

incorporating new mp3 files he purchased through Amazon into his music collection. A
volunteer at Tubman Senior Center tried to help him cope with these challenges over a period of
months, but some of the obstacles (such as getting the older WMA files to play in the new
operating system) could not be surmounted.
In addition to coping with diverse devices and applications available in the electronics
marketplace, older adults and information systems also cope with diverse log-in systems.
Passwords proved to be particularly challenging. The fact that so many sites and services have
different password requirements compound this challenge. One woman said, “My fridge is
covered in passwords! I have post-it notes everywhere. Otherwise I would be lost. I am hoping
to find a better system. Surely, there is a better way!”
In addition to helping older adults with password creation and management, staff and
volunteers frequently help older adults navigate password recovery systems. In this process, the
staff and volunteers learn alongside the older adults. In an email to me, one volunteer discussed
a technology support session she had with an older adult at Main Library: “When she shared her
method for creating and remembering passwords. I wrote it down and thanked her multiple
times for the tip! It was really great …. We hugged at the end.”

Coping together with technological change: An autoethnographic reflection
During fieldwork I found that older adults and technology helpers can cope together
with these and other challenges involved in navigating the still-emerging information society. I
include here an autoethnographic reflection on my experience coping with older adults during a
year of fieldwork in technology support services. During this time, I worked with older adults on

116

devices and programs I had never used before. Together we tried new things and learned
together about the diversity of programs and devices available in the marketplace.
I first met Ledora in October 2014 at Tubman Senior Center, where she was a regular.
She said that she wanted help transferring pictures from her smartphone to her Windows 7
laptop but did not know where to start in this process. Her children had bought her a
smartphone earlier in the year, and she had since used it primarily to take photographs in
addition to making and receiving phone calls. When I first met her she had more than 800
photographs on her phone, and the number of photographs increased during the time we
worked together. She had owned the laptop for two years, but she said she almost never used
it. There were many other things Ledora wanted to learn about technology during the
technology support sessions in which we interacted, but she kept coming back to the problem of
how to get the photographs off her phone. She was concerned that if she could not transfer
them to another device she would lose them if her phone broke.
From October 2014 to March 2015, she, other volunteers, and I worked together to try
to figure out how to transfer these photographs. We tried connecting her phone to her laptop,
we tried connecting her phone to a lab computer, we tried connecting her phone to a
volunteer’s laptop, we tried using Dropbox, we tried syncing the phone and the laptop via wifi,
we tried special apps designed to sync phones and laptops. We could not get any of these
procedures to work. After doing some research we found out that many other people
encountered similar problems with this type of phone.
Finally, in March 2015 we found something that worked. After researching the problem
online, we decided to try transferring the photographs via Bluetooth. Through trial-and-error we
were able to establish a Bluetooth connection between the two devices and transfer the now-

117

more-than-1500 photographs from her smartphone to her laptop. Ledora wrote detailed notes
about how to use Bluetooth so that she could continue to transfer new photographs as she took
them. This story illustrates the challenges older adults, volunteers, and staff face as they cope
together with frequently changing technological standards. I was not tutoring Ledora in how to
use the technologies she learned to use. Rather we learned together, on the fly, over an
extended period of time how to do things neither of us had attempted before.
During fieldwork I found that many staff and volunteers do not share this attitude
toward technology support. Public libraries have policies that restrict staff and volunteers from
helping patrons with devices with which they do not have expertise. Although there are no rules
against it, senior center staff are not always willing to work with older adults learning new
technologies, instead re-directing them to times when volunteers from the university are
available.
Unfortunately, university students are also uncomfortable supporting older adults on
devices unfamiliar to them. During the pilot study that led to this dissertation, library science
students participated in a Seniors & Technology Day at a local library in which they helped 40
older adults with whatever they wanted to learn about technology. The workshop was
structured around the personal devices of older adults. For many students, this day was their
first experience interacting with the devices older adults brought to the library. In anonymous
feedback students vented their frustration about being asked to support devices and
applications that were unknown to them. This complaint appeared in 70% of the students’
comments.
My experience during fieldwork shows that older adults and information systems can
productively cope together with challenges that arise because of the changing technologies

118

released in the consumer marketplace, and this experience suggests an alternative way to
structure community-based information infrastructure. In this alternative, older adults, staff,
and volunteers would work together collaboratively to learn technology. While in the current
model, staff and volunteers support older adults learning technology new to the older adults,
but which staff and volunteers feel like they have some expertise using, some staff are already
embracing the new collaborative model, such as the library technician discussed above who
always provides support on whatever devices older adults want to use. Community-based
information infrastructure continues to evolve through the identification and nurturing of these
counter tendencies, which emerge in part through the individual and social struggle of older
adults.

B. Community-based information infrastructure extends across space and time
As they participate in technology support services in the present, older adults draw on
and add to memories of these institutions. These institutions are rooted in the community, and
in the lives of the older adults who use them. As such, the community-based information
infrastructure extends across time. I also found that public libraries and senior centers are not
the only sources of technology support older adults rely on. The community-based information
infrastructure extends across space to include other sectors of the local community, including
family and friends, businesses, and other public and non-profit institutions.
Institutions rooted in lives of older adults. Many older adults have been going to public
libraries throughout their lives. Many also have lifelong connections to senior centers formed
through networks of family and friends. The rootedness of these institutions in the lives of older

adults shapes how older adults use these institutions as sources of support with digital
technologies in the present.
More than two-thirds of older adults interviewed have lived for more than 30 years in
the local metropolitan area (Table 26). Half of all participants have lived their entire lives in the
regional area, and over a quarter have lived their entire lives in the urban area. This tendency is
more pronounced at the senior centers than at the public libraries, and is strongest at the
Tubman Senior Center, where 100% of those interviewed have lived in the urban area for the
last 30 years, and nearly 50% have lived their entire lives in the metropolitan area. This is a
population deeply rooted in the local community. Public libraries and senior centers are
institutions rooted in these communities, and in the lives of these older adults.

Table 26: Length of time older adults have lived in local area, by site.

Some older adults have been going to these particular public libraries throughout their
entire lives. Memories of past library participation structures participation in the present. One
older adult at Metro Library stated that “I can’t remember a time I didn’t come down here to
the library for one reason or another.” Another older adult who comes regularly to the Main
Library describes herself as a “lifelong library patron.” Having used the library throughout their
lives, these older adults now turn to the library to support their digital literacy in the present.

120

Even though older adults now use these spaces differently than they did in the past, fond
memories of past participation lead them to continue coming to them. Older adults often
discuss memories of bringing their children to the libraries when they were younger. One man
said:
When my son was little I brought him down to Metro Library for storytime all the time. I
guess you could say it was important to me that he be learning something in the
summer, and not just doing nothing. Anyhow, whenever I come in I remember that,
remember when he was young. And I was young too!
Memories and community connections also shape how older adults engage in senior
centers. To reiterate, all three of these senior centers grew out of multi-purpose community
centers. At Metro Senior Center, one woman discussed how comfortable she felt learning
technology there because of memories she has of the space. During a field session she and
another woman shared memories of the center. They talked about bringing their children to the
community center’s gym, and about the changes in the building and the surrounding community
over the years. Older adults draw on and add to these memories as they participate in
technology support services in the present.
The institutions cultivate and draw on multi-generational community ties for their
continued vitality. At all three senior centers, older adults mentioned that they decided to join
the senior centers because they had older relatives who had been part of the senior center in
the past. Others said that they joined because they have friends who joined the senior centers
and who encouraged them to join as well. Multiple generations of families also participate
within senior centers: I found mothers and daughters participating together at all three senior
centers.

121

Even those older adults who have not lived extensive periods of time in the local area
draw on fond memories of public libraries and senior centers as they turn to them for support
with technology in the present. An older couple new to the local area turned to Main Library for
help with technology because of a generally positive attitude toward public libraries. Similarly,
some members at Metro Senior Center were new to the area. They joined because they had
participated in a senior center in their former home and were looking for a similar environment
in their new home. These particular institutions thus connect to a public sphere formed in public
libraries and senior centers across the nation.
African American counter-public sphere. For some African American older adults,
participation in public libraries and senior centers constitutes participating in an African
American counter-public sphere. One woman in her late 80s talked about how her mother was
one of the founders of the Tubman Seniors back in the 1960s. She remembered that when she
was younger
Mama always had me help down at the center. She put me to work [laughs]. I was
always down here at the Tubman Center for something, serving food, calling people. I
always helped Mama with the Tubman Seniors. And now I’m a Tubman Senior!
Similarly, an older African American man remembered working with the Tubman Seniors in the
early 1970s, when he himself was in his 30s. As part of his participation in the African American
community he volunteered to help with the Tubman Seniors’ annual Thanksgiving dinner. These
memories led him to join the senior center later in his life.
Shaped explicitly by local activism in the African American community during the 1960s
and 1970s, Tubman Senior Center and Branch Library are sites that trigger potent memories of
community organization and struggle. An African American woman who comes regularly to
Branch Library said she chooses to go there instead of Main Library, geographically closer to her

122

home, because of memories she has of the library. She said, “When I am here I just feel like:
‘This is ours.’” Similarly, a woman in her late 80s who has been coping with health issues
nonetheless came to an event sponsored by the Tubman Seniors. She explained that “I would do
anything for the Tubman Seniors.” This level of participation is formed through deep investment
in the sites, and thus in the African American counter-public sphere they embody.
These stories collectively illustrate that when older adults participate in technology
support services in public libraries and senior centers, they actively draw on and add to
memories of these institutions. The rootedness of these institutions in this community took
years to form, and it is an asset of this community-based information infrastructure that enables
it to support the digital literacy of older adults.
Public libraries and senior centers complement other sources of technology support.
This study operationalized the concept of community-based information infrastructure as public
libraries and senior centers. I found that this community-based information infrastructure
extends across space to also include families, friends, businesses, and non-profit institutions.
From these people and in these places older adults also seek and find technology support. Public
libraries and senior centers supplement and complement these other sources of support.
Institutions rooted in broader support networks. Some older adults who go to one of the
six institutions for technology support also sometimes go to other institutions. I interacted with
16% of the 209 older adults at multiple institutions (Table 27). Since I was only at these
institutions for a limited amount of time, it is probable that the actual cross-linkages formed
across the institutions by older adults seeking technology support is in fact much denser. This
table nonetheless illustrates the fact that many older adults seek support for technology from
multiple institutions in their community. In particular, older adults who seek technology support

123

at Branch Library, Metro Senior Center and Metro Library are more likely than those who seek
support at Tubman Senior Center, Smith Senior Center, and Main Library to also seek support
from another public institution.

Table 27: Older adult participation in technology support services at multiple institutions.

Older adults learn about and are reminded of technology support services through their
connections in the community. At Tubman Senior Center, a man came to a few support sessions
in fall 2014, and then stopped coming for a few months. He decided to come back after a
woman from his church reminded him that technology support was still available at the senior
center. Friends sometimes coordinate with each other to ensure they will be at technology
support services together.
Older adults also encourage their friends to start coming to technology support services.
After coming to two technology support sessions at Metro Senior Center, a man brought his
friend to learn with him. At the Tubman Senior Center’s annual senior fashion show and dinner,
I sat at a table with a man who came regularly to technology support services there. He was
sitting with friends, none of whom were members of the senior center. During the dinner one of
the men started talking about difficulties he was having with his new smartphone. The regular
from the computer class strongly encouraged him to start coming down to the senior center to

124

learn how to use it. He said, “Everything I know, I learned at the center.” A month later the man
with the smartphone came to the senior center to participate in a technology support session.
Later he and his wife joined the senior center.

Older adults' consistent source
of technology support (n=54)

Table 28: Consistent sources of technology support, among interviewees.

Older adults who participate in technology support services at public libraries and senior
centers also find other sources of support in their community. Family and friends are especially
important sources of support (Table 28). Forty-three percent of interviewees said that a family
member or a friend was a consistent source of technology support for them. Seven percent
found consistent support from a company or in a public institution. One older adult always
receives technology tips from his barber. Another always asks for help from the employees at
McDonald’s, where she regularly goes to drink coffee and use the wifi. Retired employees from
the local university continue to go to campus for help using their university email accounts.
Most older adults who have a consistent source of technology support, however, find it among
their family and friends.
No one source of support is enough. Although older adults frequently turn to family and
friends for technology support, these experiences are not always positive. Indeed, discussing the
topic frequently evoked feelings of frustration and shame among older adults. A frequent
complaint centered on children giving older adults technology, but not providing them with the
support they needed to use it. An older woman in her late 60s who participated regularly at
Smith Senior Center said that her children

125

get frustrated if I don’t pick it up the first time …. My one daughter is pretty good but
she explains once and she’ll say “well I showed you that!” She’s not very patient [laughs]
…. My daughter thinks I should get it on the first try, and if not, oh she just gives up!
Many older adults seek technology support in their families, but not all find what they
need there. As a result of this fact, some see technology helpers in public libraries and senior
centers as surrogate children. One woman at Smith Senior Center described me to her friend as
“like a patient grandson.” Similarly, a woman at Metro Senior Center suggested I start a
company called “grandsons” that would provide technology support for local older adults. She
said older adults like her would be willing to pay for the support they want from their families,
but were not finding there. These incidents show that older adults sometimes frame supportive
helpers they find outside of the family in familial terms. These incidents further illustrate that
older adults assume that technology support should be part of positive, loving, and intimate
relationships.
Community-based information infrastructure includes families, friends, public libraries,
senior centers, and other sectors of local communities where older adults seek and find
technology support. When older adults do not find all the support they need in one place they
look for it elsewhere. In this way, through their diverse help-seeking strategies older adults
construct a community-based information infrastructure that is in fact more connected than the
isolated information systems managed at each individual public library and senior center.
Through their actions and memories, older adults extend this community-based information
infrastructure across space and time.

126

C. Ageism structures community-based information infrastructure
Ageism shapes both community-based information infrastructure and older adult digital
literacy. This section analyzes how public libraries and senior centers frame both older adult
digital literacy and older adults in general in ageist ways. This will also be addressed in Chapter
5, which analyzes how older adults internalize ageist values that shape how they see themselves
and their own digital learning and literacy.
To reiterate, ageism refers to the stereotyping of and discrimination against individuals
and groups on the basis of their age. Ageism shapes this community-based information
infrastructure in four ways:
•
•
•
•

Rendering older adults invisible or unimportant;
Conceiving of older adulthood exclusively as a time of disability and decline;
Expressing ambivalence and antipathy toward older adults; and
Reinforcing the idea that young people are the natural tutors of old people.

These ageist values, however, are not uncontested. I identified two counter tendencies: (1)
older staff working with older adults in technology support services, and (2) older adults
insisting on visibility in community-based information infrastructure.
Rendering older adults invisible or unimportant. One manifestation of ageism in these
institutions are policies and practices that render older adults invisible or unimportant. At
Branch Library, no programs or services of any sort are explicitly for older adults. Furthermore,
policies and practices actively work against older adults seeking support with new technologies.
In summer 2014, Branch Library acquired six new iPads, which it decided to reserve exclusively
for youth. A sign at the circulation desk encourages patrons to “ask about checking out an iPad,”
but if a patron were to ask about this service they would learn that only those under the age of
18 can use them. This focus on youth and innovation at Branch Library also appears in program

127

statistics. On an average month, only 30 adults participate in adult library programs at Branch
Library. By comparison, in an average month 730 youth participate in programs. Although older
adults do come to Branch Library to use computers and wifi, their presence is not marked or
acknowledged at an institutional level.
Conceiving of older adulthood exclusively as a time of disability and decline. When
older adults are made visible in these sites, ageism often shapes this institutional portrayal. At
Metro Library and Main Library services for older adults are a) homebound delivery services, b)
assistive technologies in the computer lab, and c) partnerships with retirement communities. All
three services frame older adulthood as a time of disability and decline. It is of course important
that public libraries serve the disabled and the shut-in, but to conflate these situations with
older adulthood is ageist. Confirming the idea that these libraries see older adulthood as a time
of disability and decline, during a discussion about this dissertation with an adult services
librarian, she said the primary thing the library wanted to know was what assistive technologies
should be purchased to make it easier for older adults to use library computers.
Expressing ambivalence and antipathy toward older adults. The staff of these
institutions also express ambivalence and even antipathy towards older adults. These attitudes
shape how staff interact with older adults. The director at Metro Senior Center discusses
changes she has seen at the center over the years:
I would say the biggest change I have seen relates to the baby boomers. I hate to say
this, but they are just more pleasant to work with. Before the boomers started retiring,
and I hate to say this but it is true, those seniors used to be, well, grumpy, and
sometimes just not pleasant to be around. They just wanted to play cards all the time,
or crochet, and were very resistant to change. They just wanted things their way. Now
the boomers they want to stay active and engaged in society. I like being around them.
They are fun!

128

Similarly, a librarian at Metro Library vented her frustration about what she calls
“curmudgeonly” older adults complaining about unwelcome changes they see in the library.
These ageist attitudes sometimes lead staff to discontinue programs used by older
adults. At Smith Senior Center the director complained that older adults use the computer lab
for what she sees as trivial purposes. Discussing why technology support services were
discontinued there before I started my fieldwork, she stated that “just a few people used the
technology, and they mostly just wanted to look up trivia for things like crossword puzzles. It
just wasn’t worth our time to continue the program.” That is, she and other staff in the park
district decided that what older adults were doing with the senior center’s computer lab was not
important enough to support and foster. A similar incident occurred at Metro Library when the
Computers 101 class was discontinued in December 2014, despite being very popular and
widely used among older adults. In both cases, ageist assumptions about the digital literacy of
older adults led to the cessation of technology support services used by older adults.
Reinforcing the idea that young people are the natural tutors of old people. All six
institutions rely on young university students to serve as technology volunteers, a structure that
reinforces the idea that young people are the natural technology tutors of old people. This
reinforcement is illustrated in one older woman’s discussion of why she does not help other
older adults with technology outside of technology support services at Metro Senior Center:
I’m old! They [other older adults] don’t want help from me! I get by with technology ….
And if I get stuck I can figure it out. Usually. [Laughs] When it works it works. But when it
doesn’t. [Laughs] Help someone else here at the center? No, no, no. That is for you
[young people] to do. You know this stuff in and out. What could I add?
The structure of relying on young technology tutors for older adults leads to bottlenecks
when the number of older adults seeking support far exceeds the number of young people

129

available to assist. During an average technology support service at Tubman Senior Center, five
older adults participate. In contrast, on average only two volunteers are available. Since older
adults are socialized by the structure of technology support services to seek support from a
young person, this situation leads to bottlenecks in which the supply of volunteers does not
meet the demand. On especially busy days, when up to ten people came in for support from
only two people, help sessions devolved into chaos as volunteers rushed from person to person,
trying to make sure everyone received at least some support during the hour. In contrast, on
one slow day at Tubman Senior Center only one older adult participated. She exclaimed “Thank
God I have you to myself today!” I heard similar remarks at other senior centers, and at public
libraries, when on slow days older adults did not have to compete for the time of young
technology volunteers.
Counter tendency 1. Older staff working with older adults. A counter tendency occurs
when older library staff support older patrons with technology. At Metro Library an older
woman came to the adult services desk and started chatting with a librarian, who was herself an
older adult who had retired from the local university and now works part-time as a reference
librarian. During their conversation, the two older women discussed the frustrations they have
had trying to stay up-to-date with phones. The librarian shared with the patron some of the tips
she has used to learn to use her new smartphone. At Main Library a similar interaction took
place between an older library technician (who retired mid-way through fieldwork) and an older
patron. These examples illustrate how the aging library workforce (American Library Association,
2009) could in fact play a pivotal role in changing ageist attitudes through participation in
technology support services.

130

Counter tendency 2. Older adults insisting on visibility. A second counter tendency
emerges when organized older adults insist on visibility in community-based information
infrastructure. This insistence can be seen in the organized agency of older adults who formed
senior centers in the 1960s and 1970s. Through their actions, these older adults advocated for
their interests at the level of the local municipality. They organized for equal public services
against an ageist narrative that rendered them invisible.
All three senior centers grew out of multi-purpose, multi-generational community
centers that, in practice, focused primarily on the needs of local youth. Older adults frequented
these spaces because they too need public space. A newspaper article on the Tubman
Community Center from 1971 quotes a leader of the Tubman Seniors stating that “we have all
ages—8 to 80—crammed into this building. And when the youngsters arrive hollering and
screaming, sometimes the senior citizens have to cut their activities short.” This leader goes on
to discuss how older adults feel pushed out of the building as young people enter and take it
over. Similar tensions led to the creation of Smith Senior Center and Metro Senior Center. In
these actions, older adults organized themselves against an ageist narrative that renders older
adults and their needs invisible. Even though ageism shapes community-based information
infrastructure, this structure is contested through the actions of older adults and others in their
community who in large and small ways resist and counter ageist stereotypes.

D. Summary
In this analysis of community-based information infrastructure I found that older adults
organize together and with other sectors of their local communities to create, advocate for, and
participate in senior centers and public libraries. Far from passive users, older adults are active

131

agents in community-based information infrastructure. Older adults adapt technology support
services at senior centers to their group-based communities of practice, and they insist upon
support for personal devices at public libraries and at senior centers. In contrast, the staff of
these institutions attempt to control technology support services by imposing bureaucratic
limits that fetter the agency of older adults. Compounding this issue, older adults coping with
digital inequalities find it difficult to lead these institutions into the information age.
Community-based information infrastructure is not limited to technology support
services in these six institutions. It extends spatially to encompass other sectors of local
communities where older adults find technology support and temporally to encompass the
memories older adults have of these institutions. Over time, older adults have led and
advocated for these institutions. The diminution of this leadership and advocacy in the present
may lead to less robust public institutions. The effects of this transformation could affect not
only older adults, but the entire communities in which they live.
The roles of older adults as leaders in their communities are rendered partially invisible
by ageist structures that shape this community-based information infrastructure. Ageist
structures led staff to frame older adults and their needs as unimportant. The structure of young
people helping older adults with technology further reinforces the idea that young people are
the natural technology tutors of old people.
On the other hand, Information infrastructure is forever evolving through the evolving
and multiple relationships between information users and information systems. Counter
tendencies I identified in this study, and which may become dominant tendencies in the future
include:

132

•
•
•
•
•
•

Older adults customizing computer labs;
Older adults helping other older adults with technology;
Older adults learning collaboratively with staff and volunteers;
Staff bending and breaking rules in response to the agency of older adults;
Older adults insisting on visibility against ageist narratives and structures; and
Staff and older adults coping together with new technologies released in the global
electronics marketplace.

These negotiations over community-based information infrastructure are important
because through them a different form of community-based information infrastructure may
emerge in the future. By recognizing and articulating these counter tendencies, shaped by older
adults, this dissertation challenges deficit models of aging premised on the assumption that
older adults need services created for them by younger individuals. In contrast, I found that with
the right support, older adults are ready and eager to contribute to the development of
technology support services. This eagerness extends the past involvement of older adults in
these community institutions. I discuss the theoretical import of these findings in more detail in
chapter 6.

133

CHAPTER 5. OLDER ADULT DIGITAL LITERACY
In this study of older adult digital literacy I found that older adults are determined and
creative learners who with support integrate technology into the diverse rhythms of their lives.
This reality can best be understood as what I term an informatics lifecourse. Referring to how a
person learns technology through the stages of his or her life, this concept advances our
understanding of digital literacy among older adults, and in general.
The informatics lifecourse is a portmanteau concept that combines the concept of the
informatics moment (Williams, 2012) with the concept of the lifecourse (Hutchison, 2014). To
reiterate, the informatics moment is “when a person seeks help in using some digital technology
that is new to him or her” (Williams, 2012, p. 47). The lifecourse is “how historical time, social
location, and culture affect the individual experience of each life stage” (Hutchison, 2014, p. 11).
The informatics lifecourse is populated by many informatics moments, episodes of seeking,
getting and offering help with technology. The accumulation of these moments over time affect
how individuals experience each stage of their lives, and thus how life is lived.
Many informatics moments take place throughout life because digital literacy requires
learning a changing array of technologies and digital applications. In the pre-digital age one
could learn to read and write, that is, practice literacy, and then continue to read and write
many years after having initially learned these procedures. In the digital age, however, literacy
requires learning technology over time. An individual who learns Windows 3 in the workplace in
the 1990s and then stops using technology upon retiring may then find that using a smartphone
in the 2010s is quite challenging. Even those older adults who do not stop using technology for a
period of time cope with the challenges associated with learning new digital technologies as
they emerge.

134

The concept of the informatics lifecourse also informs our understanding of digital
inequalities and the digital divide. For some individuals, informatics moments are a routine part
of daily life. These individuals have digital literacy: They have integrated technology into their
lives to the point that they are able to learn new technologies as they emerge by finding and
getting whatever help they may need to learn how to use them. Other individuals, in contrast,
have fewer informatics moments throughout their lives. For these individuals, digital literacy is
more halting. They may use a particular technology with some fluency, for some period of time.
When technologies change, or when their lives change, digital literacy is not maintained. Still
others have not had the opportunity to learn technology until late in their lives. The concept of
the informatics lifecourse illustrates the temporal dimensions of digital literacy and digital
inequalities. To be digitally literate during one stage of life does not guarantee digital literacy at
a subsequent stage.
To analyze older adult digital literacy as the informatics lifecourse, this chapter begins
by discussing the commonalities found in the informatics lifecourse of participants in this study.
I then discuss the diverse demographics found in this sample, and how this diversity affects the
informatics lifecourse of older adults. I then discuss how in the many informatics moments of
their lives older adults construct learning styles that they use to learn technology across time;
these digital learning styles testify to the determination, creativity, and agency of older adults.
Finally, I discuss how the informatics lifecourse is shaped by the stage of life called old age,
arguing that retirement and ageism condition how technology is used in this stage of life.
This analysis of the informatics lifecourse concludes in chapter 6. There I answer this
dissertation’s overarching research question by illustrating how the informatics lifecourse is
shaped within community-based information infrastructure. When community-based

135

information infrastructure is robust, older adults find ways to continue, or to begin learning
technology. When this infrastructure is less robust, periods of digital disengagement occur,
creating difficulties both for older adults and for social inclusion more generally.

A. Common tendencies in the informatics lifecourse of older adults
The sample in this study of older adult digital literacy consists of 209 older adults (Table
29), all of them participants in technology support services in three public libraries and three
senior centers in one Midwestern metropolitan area. Through participant observation recorded
in fieldnotes, I studied how older adults learn and use technologies in these spaces. I also
interviewed 54 of these 209 older adults. Those interviewed are here referred to as
“interviewees” to distinguish them from the full sample. The data from interviewees enables me
to contextualize what I learned during participant observation within the life histories and
backgrounds of these individuals.

Table 29: Sample of older adults.

The course and shape of the informatics lifecourse of older adulthood found in this
sample features many commonalities, including:
•
•
•

Most older adults own at least one digital device;
If an older adult has a consistent source of technology support, it tends to be a family
member or a friend; and
Communication and cultural practices shape the digital practices of older adults.

136

Most older adults own at least one digital device. Older adults own and use a diverse
array of digital devices. Table 30 displays the devices that the sample owns and used at senior
centers and public libraries during fieldwork. In addition to owning desktop computers located
in their residence, at least one quarter (26%) of the sample owns a laptop, 15% own tablets, and
14% own smartphones. Others own audio-visual devices such as mp3 players or digital cameras
(10%) and flip-phones (4%), while 9% own flash-drives. At least 1% owns a printer. Table 30
represents a conservative estimate of the devices these 209 older adults own; it only represents
the digital devices that older adults used during field sessions at the six institutions studied. This
sample most likely owns other devices not used during fieldwork.

access to and ownership of technology is not a hurdle to participation in the information society.

If an older adult has a consistent source of technology support, it tends to be a family
member or a friend. Family and friends are the most consistent source of technology support
among older adults. Forty-three percent of interviewees say they have a friend or a family
member they can consistently turn to for support with technology (Table 32). Companies (e.g.,
technology support divisions of companies like Best Buy, AT&T, and Verizon) and public
institutions (e.g., senior centers, public libraries, and community colleges) are primary sources of
support for 7%. Forty-three percent of interviewees say they have no consistent source of
technology support.

Communication and cultural practices shape the digital practices of older adults. The
most common digital practices observed among older adults in this sample center around
communication and culture (Table 33). Fifty-one percent of the sample uses digital technologies
for communication purposes. The second-most-common digital practices are cultural pursuits
(42%), such as photography, travel, and cooking. The third-most-common practices center on

138

economics (17%), including finding jobs, managing finances, and buying and selling online.
Finally, the least common practices center on medical issues (3%), such as looking for
information on nutrition and diabetes, as well as browsing personal medical files made available
online through hospitals and clinics.

Tables 34 illustrates the most common ways this sample integrates technology into their
lives. These frequencies are conservative estimates and represent observational data collected
during fieldwork; it is likely that larger percentages of older adults use technologies for these
purposes. Nonetheless, the trends revealed show some of the more and less common
tendencies in the digital practices of older adults. The most popular practice, email, was found
to be used by 41.1% of participants. More than twice as many older adults use technology for
email than for any other purpose. This finding affirms other scholars, who have found that email
is very popular among older adults (Sayago & Blat, 2010). After email, the next most popular
practices involve photography (17.2%), word processing (14.8%), Facebook (14.8%), jobs and
employment (10.0%), buying and selling online (10.0%), music (8.1%), and managing finances
(7.2%). In addition to these practices, older adults were found to use technology for a diverse
array of other activities. Other digital practices found among older adults during fieldwork
include:
•

E-mailing a home-made Christmas card;
Creating a book of favorite recipes;

Photography was the second most popular digital practice found among older adults. I
found that older adults enjoy taking, sharing, and accessing digital photographs. One older
woman uses a digital camera she has meticulously maintained since she purchased it in the mid2000s. When she does not use it, she places the camera back in the box it came in. She initially
bought the camera to take pictures at a relative’s wedding, but has since used the camera to
document many facets of her daily life. She took many photographs of her dog, the only
companion at her house for the last ten years. When her dog passed away, she wanted to learn
how to organize her photographs so she could see all the photographs of her dog together.
After learning to tag photographs, she launched a slideshow of photographs of her dog that she
watched over and over again. She especially enjoyed seeing those photographs that included
both her dog and her great-grandchildren together. For this woman, photography connects her
to her family and adds to her memories of the past. In this way, photography helps her maintain
connections to her culture over time.
Photography also plays a role in her communication practices. Now that she has learned
to manage her digital photographs, she brings her laptop to the house of an older sister, who
does not use digital technology, to show her images of family and friends. Other family and
friends regularly email her new photographs, which she then integrates to the digital
photography collection she maintains on her laptop. Through these practices, this woman has
found creative ways to integrate technology both into her own life, and into the lives of those
around her. This narrative illustrates the common theme of older adults finding creative ways to
integrate technology into cultural and communication practices.

B. Older adults are diverse
Both in this sample and in the USA in general, older adults are diverse. The American
Library Association (2008) states that: “The current population of older adults is the most
heterogeneous in U.S. history” (p. 1). Older adulthood in the USA includes individuals of diverse
ages, ethnicities and social class backgrounds. These different backgrounds shape how older
adulthood is experienced and lived. As a result, these differences affect the shape and texture of
the informatics lifecourse.
In the field of library & information science, the dominant approach to understanding
diversity in older adulthood has been to segment this population by age and ability. Williamson
& Asla (2010) study what they call the fourth age, those very old individuals coping with issues
of dependency and disability. Schull (2013) instead studies active, aging baby boomers born
between 1946 and 1964. Rather than focus primarily on these dimensions of older adulthood, I
instead focus on how social class and ethnicity, along with age and gender, shape the
informatics lifecourse.
Both in the sample, and among interviewees, there were more women than men.
Women accounted for 69% of the full sample, and 70% of those interviewed. This fact may
relate to the fact that women live longer than men in the USA (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). The
gender balance in the sample and among those interviewed reflects the demographics of public
libraries and senior centers. According to membership lists, women constituted 79% of the
membership of the senior centers studied. In a study of how gender affects public library use,
Applegate (2008) found that women constitute 68% of the library-going public. This baseline
suggests that the gender balance of this study reflects the gender balance of those who
participate in public libraries and senior centers.

142

In the sample, 59% were European American, 38% were African American, and 3% were
Asian American (Figure 4). No people of Hispanic or Native American descent participated. Since
the primary ethnic difference found was between African Americans and European Americans,
that difference is focused on in this chapter. In the sample, European Americans were older
(average age 74), and African Americans younger (average age 70).15 The overall average age
was 72. Most participants (74%) were in their 60s and 70s, with the largest part of the sample
(27%) composed of those aged 75–79. A smaller number of individuals aged 85 and older (4%),
and aged 59 and younger (9%), also participated in this study. To understand how age relates to
other dimensions of diversity among older adults, I follow researchers in the Pew Internet &
American Life Project (Smith, 2014) and for analytical purposes divide the sample into the young
old, those aged 50 to 74, and the older old, those aged 75 and older.

Due to the complexities of fieldwork, the ages of participants were not collected from all in the sample.
“Age” was only collected from 135 of the 209 individuals who participated in fieldwork. The averages
reported in this paragraph, and in figure 4, report on the 135 individuals who provided me with their ages.

143

Sub-dividing the population of older adults by age needs to be done with caution. In a
parallel study conducted by the Community Informatics Research Lab in fall 2015, we found that
residents in a local retirement community tend to be older than the sample in this dissertation.
Most individuals there were in their 80s and early 90s (Figure 5). Figure 5 shows that especially
between the ages of 75 and 85 there is substantial overlap between the two samples,
suggesting an overlap between the population of older adults who live in retirement
communities (who tend to be older) and the population of older adults who participate in public
libraries and senior centers (who tend to be younger). More research is needed to understand
the different life stages that may be emerging within the older adult population in the USA.

Figure 5: Ages in samples of two studies of older adults. Dissertation sample, n=135, against sample
from retirement community study, n=76.

National level data suggest that social class is also a key determinant of how older adults
access and use digital technologies (Silver, 2014; Smith, 2014). Using the framework of
intersectionality (hooks, 1994), I frame social class as intersecting with and overlapping with
other dimensions of social difference. For instance, ethnic differences intersect and overlap with
class differences. In this study, I operationalize social class as the work background of the

144

individual. In interviews, older adults said what their job was. All 54 interviewees worked in the
paid workforce. Their answers were reduced to the categories of blue-collar, pink-collar, and
white-collar, based on the typology used by Van Horn and Schaffner (2003) to discuss work and
social class in the USA. Blue-collar jobs are those that center on skilled and unskilled manual
labor, including manufacturing, other factory work, custodial, construction, and cooking. Pinkcollar jobs are those that center on the service industry, usually involving interpersonal
interactions in office, educational, retail, and nursing environments. White-collar jobs are those
that involve professional, managerial, or administrative work.
Seventeen percent of interviewees have blue-collar backgrounds, all but one of them
African American (Table 35).16 Thirty-one percent of males, but only 11% of females, have bluecollar backgrounds (Table 36). Table 37 shows that blue-collar workers tend to be younger than
those of other backgrounds: all but one of the blue-collar workers is in the younger old group.
The absence of older blue-collar individuals among interviewees may relate to a lower life
expectancy of these individuals. Researchers have found that people with blue-collar
backgrounds tend to die before their peers (Geronimus, Bound, & Colen, 2011). In the USA,
furthermore, the average life expectancy of African Americans is 74 years, against 79 years for
European Americans (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). The intersection of these two trends (social
class and ethnicity) may have contributed to the absence of older blue-collar individuals in this
study: There were less of them to interview because of differences in how long people live in the
USA.

16

Discussions with older adults during fieldwork suggest there were at least a half dozen European
Americans in the sample of 209 that also had blue-collar backgrounds. For instance, some discussed
careers in construction, the manual trades, and in the military. One older European American man was
also looking for a part-time job as a delivery person for a pizza chain.

Table 37: Age by social class, among interviewees.

Fifty-four percent of interviewees have pink-collar backgrounds (Table 35). Among
interviewees, 71% of women had pink-collar backgrounds while only 13% of men had such
careers. Historically, pink-collar jobs have been filled by women, which is why the term “pink”
has been applied to this type of work (Van Horn & Schaffner, 2003). African Americans and
European Americans are equally likely to have a pink-collar background.
Thirty percent of interviewees have white-collar backgrounds. There were slightly more
white-collar workers in the older old group than in the younger old group. Only 8% of African
Americans had white-collar careers, while 44% of European Americans had this background. The
one Asian American interviewed, a woman, had a white-collar job. Fifty-six percent of men, but
only 18% of women, had white-collar careers. These findings suggest that among older adults

146

there is class disparity both in terms of gender and ethnicity. White males are the most likely
among interviewees to have had white-collar backgrounds.

C. Diverse lives lead to differences in the informatics lifecourse
Patterns of diversity in the lives of older adults lead to differences in the informatics
lifecourse of this sample. Three areas of difference emerged as particularly salient:
•
•
•

Diverse patterns of device ownership;
Diverse patterns of technology support; and
Diverse digital economic and medical practices.

Diverse patterns of device ownership. Among interviewees, African Americans tend to
have more audio-visual devices (mp3 players, digital cameras), while European Americans tend
to have more tablets (Tables 38). This finding may relate to the fact that European Americans
tend to have greater financial capital than African Americans in the USA. It is possible that
European Americans have been better able to transition from the increasingly obsolete
technologies of audio-visual devices to the increasingly standard multi-purpose tablet
technologies (Smith, 2014), which include the functions of diverse audio-visual devices.

Table 38: Device ownership by ethnicity, among interviewees.

Age, gender, and social class also relate to patterns of device ownership. Across all
device types (except audio-visual devices), the younger old have more technologies than the
older old (Table 39). This tendency suggests that baby boomers have been better able to stay
up-to-date with technology than older cohorts. Men tend to have more phones and computers

147

than women (Table 40), but women tend to have more audio-visual devices than men. Bluecollar individuals have the least access to tablet technologies (Table 41) and are also less likely
than both pink-collar and white-collar individuals to own computers.

Table 41: Device ownership by social class, among interviewees.

Diverse patterns of technology support. Although all older adults interviewed have
access to technology they own, they do not all have access to consistent support with that
technology. Forty-three percent of older adults do not have someone they can turn to
consistently for help with technology, with men being less likely than women to have someone
who fulfills that role (Tables 42). This discovery may relate to the fact that older men live more
socially isolated lives than older women (Steptoe, Shankar, Demakakos, & Wardle, 2013).

Table 43: Primary source of technology support by social class, among interviewees.

Those with blue-collar backgrounds are the least likely to have someone they can
consistently turn to for support with technology (Table 43). No major variations emerged in
relation to ethnicity and age. These findings suggest that older adults navigating digital
inequalities cope with the challenge of finding technology support. Among older adults,
accessing technology support is more of an issue than accessing technology. Furthermore, the
diverse lives of older adults relate to the accessibility of technology support. Those with bluecollar backgrounds, and men, are less likely than those of other social class backgrounds, and
women, to have consistent sources of technology support.
Diverse digital economic and medical practices. Although less than culture and
communication, economics and medicine also shape the digital practices of older adults. No
major variations based on ethnicity, class, gender or age were found to shape how older adults
use technology for culture or communication. Variations were found, however, in the digital
economic practices of older adults. How these practices develop relate to differences in gender,
class and ethnicity. Older African American women, mostly of blue-collar backgrounds, were
found to look for, and to need, paid work in retirement. In contrast, older European Americans,

149

mostly of white-collar backgrounds, were found to use technology to manage personal finances
(Table 44). Eighty-one percent of those in the sample using technology to search for jobs were
African American, while only 7% of those using technology to manage finances were African
American.

Table 44: Economically oriented digital practices by ethnicity, in sample.

Older women with blue-collar backgrounds play important roles in extended families
that continue to rely on them for economic and social sustainability. One African American
woman aged 69 is the only person in her extended family who owns a car. She is responsible for
transporting multiple generations of her family to appointments and to work. A 74-year old
African American woman is the primary caregiver for her 11-year-old grandchild. A third African
American woman, aged 73, is the only person in her extended family who owns her home.
When economic pressures become insurmountable for those in her family, they turn to her for
temporary housing. All three of these women have blue-collar backgrounds. In contrast, those
managing finances tended to have white-collar backgrounds, and tend to be European American
men.
Issues related to medicine and engagement in the healthcare system also shape the
digital practices of some older adults. After communications, culture and economics, medical
practices were the least common practices found among older adults. Some older adults search
for information related to conditions like diabetes. Two older adults were told they could access
medical files from a local hospital’s website. They wanted help accessing these medical files. At

150

Main Library, an older couple new to the area came there for help searching on the classifieds
website Craigslist for an apartment to rent. They said they would be living in the urban area
temporarily for at least six months because the husband had a stroke and would need intensive
monitoring and physical therapy. They were currently staying at a motel but could not afford to
stay there the entire time they would be living in the city. They needed an inexpensive
apartment that was accessible for people with disabilities, but they did not know how to find
one online.
Although the research literature related to older adults and digital technology focuses
on developing assistive technologies to help older adults cope with their supposedly declining
minds and bodies (Bowen, 2012a), most older adults in this sample are capable of using
technology without assistive technologies. Assistive technologies include devices such as special
mice for people with difficulties controlling their hands and special software for people with
difficulty interacting with digital interfaces.
Although not common in this sample, some older adults do require assistive
technologies. Three individuals had caregivers accompany them to the sites. A man in his early
90s came to Smith Senior Center with his full-time caregiver. Another man in his late 60s came
to Metro Senior Center with a part-time caregiver. A third older man in his early 90s came to the
Main Library with his caregiver. All three required assistive technologies to help them use digital
technologies. They used special mice and keyboards, as well as ZoomText software, to make
standard consumer technologies easier to use. No other individuals in this sample of 209 older
adults, however, were found to require any assistive software or peripherals.
That being said, many older adults do not require but utilize and benefit from nonobtrusive assistive technologies. Especially common and popular were styluses designed to

151

make it easier to interact with touchscreens without having to use one’s fingers. One woman
who had recently been given an iPad by her children for Christmas purchased a stylus as soon as
she heard about it. She said that the stylus made it much easier for her to use the device. This
finding also illustrates how older adults integrate technology into their diverse lives. A small
minority of older adults in this study required and utilized assistive technologies. Other older
adults no not require, but nonetheless decide to use some assistive technology, such as styluses,
that enable them to use new technology with greater fluency. With support, older adults find
and learn to use the assistive technologies that make sense to them in the context of their lives.

D. Through informatics moments older adults develop digital learning styles
Older adults are determined and creative learners. They learn technology on diverse
devices, and through diverse procedures. Older adults draw on notes and manuals to
supplement the many informatics moments of their lives. They use these tools to remember and
to repeat procedures. Furthermore, as the informatics lifecourse proceeds, older adults apply
learning practices developed earlier in life to learning technology in old age.
Learning technology by learning tasks and activities. Older adults learn technology by
learning a diverse array of tasks and activities. Table 45 displays the tasks and activities older
adults learned to do during informatics moments in which I participated. The most common
activity was simply starting with a new device the older adult had not used before, or had used
minimally. This activity was seen among 43% of the sample. No major variations emerged based
on gender, age, ethnicity, or social class.
After older adults start using a new device, they learn to do a diverse array of computing
processes on them (Table 45). Twenty-five percent of the sample learned how to search and

152

browse for information online. Sixteen percent learned about passwords and account
management issues. Other common tasks and procedure learned include how to connect to wifi
networks (12%), how to manage files (11%), and how to manage programs and applications
(11%). Others learned about syncing devices (8%), texting/voicemail (6%), computer vocabulary
(5%), how to type and use a mouse (3%), cybersecurity issues (3%), data plans (1%), and
calendars (1%). Table 45 is a conservative estimate of the frequency of these types of tasks and
activities learned among older adults, as it only reports on what was observed during field
sessions. The table does not report on all the learning activities older adults undertake in daily
life. Nonetheless, this table suggests some of the more common computing tasks and activities
older adults learn as they integrate technology into their lives.

Table 45: Tasks and activities older adults learned in informatics moments, in sample.

153

In general, learning to find information online, connect to wifi, and manage passwords,
files and programs are common digital learning activities among older adults. Also notable is the
fact that only 3% of older adults were learning basic procedures like typing or using a mouse,
suggesting that many older adults have moved beyond these basics and are now coping with
issues involved with device and account management and ownership.
Notes and manuals supplement informatics moments. As older adults transition from
one device to another device, they cope with the fact that most recently released digital devices
do not come with print manuals. In the past, older adults frequently utilized print manuals when
learning something new. Technology manuals and handbooks are highly valued among older
adults. During 46 field sessions I heard older adults say they wished their devices came with
print manuals. In an interview, one participant said:
Sometimes I make notes and I love the manuals. But now the manuals are all online. But
then you have to turn off the instructions to do things on the computer. And that’s
crazy! Who can do that? I love the paper in front of me and I love the little manuals.
Older adults cope with the fact that new devices do not come with print manuals by seeking
substitute manuals. When they cannot find these manuals they create them through their notetaking practices. At Metro Senior Center older adults discussed techniques they use to find
handbooks when devices do not come with their own manuals. These strategies included going
to bookstores and libraries to look for them. One woman said that, based on the
recommendation of a friend, she started looking for handbooks in the children’s department of
her library. She said that she finds handbooks in the adult department assume too much prior
knowledge of technology. These older individuals value print instructions that explicitly spell out
step-by-step procedures, without assuming any prior knowledge of the topic discussed.

154

Older adults also take notes as they learn technology in informatics moments. When
asked what helps them learn technology, 30% (Table 46) said that taking or having notes is
helpful. Six percent also find that understanding the conceptual foundations of processes helps
them. To understand these conceptual foundations older adults also frequently turn to books,
and make notes on new concepts discussed during informatics moments.

Table 46: What helps older adults learn technology, among interviewees.
Percentages exceed 100% because multiple answers were given. Categories reduced from open-ended
responses of interviewees.

Beyond seeking and creating print instructions for technical procedures, older adults
also value the opportunity to practice using technologies in safe and supportive places. Sixty
percent of interviewees said that being able to practice processes helps them learn. Fourteen
percent also said one-on-one support aids their learning process. One woman stated that:
Before someone sat down and helped me with my iPad, it just sat in the closet. My
daughter bought it for me. She went over some things over Christmas, but then she left,
and I couldn’t do anything. I wanted to, but the thing you have to realize is that for
seniors… We need to go over things multiple times. Once isn’t enough. It is great having
someone to practice with.
One man said that he thought it would be a great idea to start a group of older adults who could
practice together with new technologies:
I wish there was some kind of network of seniors, people like me. If we could get
together and practice these skills. It is great to have the opportunity to learn how to do
things like Skype, but if you don’t practice it, it’s gone. Use it or lose it. That is true, you
know. And my kids just don’t have patience.

155

Six other interviewees also independently said “use it or lose it” in response to a question about
their approach to digital learning, suggesting this idea has become a common part of the
repertoire of popular thinking among older adults about digital learning.
Older adults value print instructions, and when they do not exist, they create them
through note-taking practices. Older adults also value being able to practice with technologies,
and they are especially appreciative of supportive spaces in which to practice these processes.
Informatics moments lead to the development of digital learning styles. Through
practice, older adults integrate pre-digital learning practices into digital learning styles. One of
the most frequent participants in this project, a 78-year-old African American man who came 69
times to technology support services at the Tubman Senior Center, developed over time a notetaking style that worked for him. He would first ask a volunteer to help him understand a new
task, such as how to create a table of contents in a digital document. He would have the
volunteer show him the process, usually at least twice. Then on his own he would write down all
the steps involved in a notebook. He would use his own language in a form that made sense to
him. After confirming that his instructions worked by trying them out, he would then type these
instructions into a document on his laptop. This document contained all his instructions for
procedures he had learned. He would then, on his own, follow the instructions he had typed
into the document to confirm that they made sense to him. If he could not figure out how to do
a procedure based on his notes, he would call a volunteer over to him. He developed this notetaking strategy because he said that when he first started coming to technology support services
he would forget everything he learned between sessions: “If I don’t write it down, it’s gone.
Tomorrow I will wake up and try to do what we discussed, but I won’t know where to start.”

Other frequent participants in technology support services developed different learning
styles. Larry is a man in his early 60s with a blue-collar background who started learning
technology for the first time in his life in retirement. He came at least 45 times during fieldwork
to Main Library and to Tubman Senior Center to learn how to use a smartphone purchased for
him by his daughter in winter 2013. When Larry started learning to use his smartphone his
approach to learning was similar to that of Monty, a man who used to use a desktop computer
on the job, but who stopped using technology when he retired. Describing Monty’s learning
style during his first field session at Smith Senior Center, I wrote in my fieldnotes that
At one point he said he wanted to know what EVERYTHING in internet explorer
symbolizes, every button and every option on the drop-down menus. We then talked for
a bit about needing to see selectively online - tune out ads, tune out irrelevant things, to
just focus on what he wanted to do, didn’t need to know what EVERYTHING did to be
able to successfully use computer.... But that left him feeling a bit anxious and
disoriented. (Appendix C)
When Larry first started coming to technology support sessions, this description of Monty’s
learning style encapsulates his approach to learning technology then. Larry’s learning style
evolved over time as he learned to trust his own ability to figure things out without having
someone walk him through every step and without having mastery over the entire technological
environment. During a three-month period in early 2015, he came more than twice a week to
Tubman Senior Center and to Main Library to work with volunteers and with staff at the library
to learn how to use his smartphone. He made a trip out of town for a month in early April, and
when he came back he said that the break away from technology support services really helped
him learn. He said, “You know, that time when y’all was not available because I was out of town,
that time was really important. I learned to figure some things out for myself. I couldn’t before,
but now I feel like I can do what I need to do.” Previously, whenever Larry got stuck he would

157

turn to the sites. Now, Larry feels comfortable enough to figure things out mostly on his own. He
still comes to the sites for support, but he has also developed a digital learning style that
enables him to learn independently as well.
Developing these learning styles takes a long time, many informatics moments, and
considerable trial-and-error. An older adult in his late 50s often came to Branch Library in the
mornings to use the computers. He describes himself as “semi-retired, but looking for a job to
make ends meet.” While working on a project to print and compile track-listings for albums he
owns in his record collection, he tried over and over again to come up with a definitive list of
instructions. He had very little experience with internet browsers, word processing, or the
computer in general. As a means of coping with this unfamiliar environment, he tried to record
all the steps involved. When I first met him, he had a handwritten list of instructions a staff
member at the library had helped him put together the previous week. Whenever an obstacle
arose that required him to diverge from the list of instructions, he did not know what to do.
Over time, and with lots of practice and reassurance from myself and from other staff
both at Branch Library and at Metro Library (where he also went regularly), he became less
reliant on his notes. Through trial-and-error, he learned that no one list of instructions would
definitively prepare him for the challenges of finding track-listings online, copying-and-pasting
them from the internet into a word document, formatting the information to fit on a single page
without any extraneous information, and then printing it. Over time, as he became more
familiar and comfortable with browsing the web and word processing he became less reliant on
his notes and more capable of performing his project on his own. The notes, combined with the
support he finds at the libraries, provide the reassurance he needs to continue integrating
technology into his life.

158

Another story illustrates the diverse learning styles older adults develop. Similarly to
Larry, Emma started learning technology for the first time in her life in her early 60s after she
retired from a blue-collar career as a cook. Learning that technology support was available at
her senior center, she came to three field sessions in fall 2014 to learn the keyboard and mouse.
Having learned these basics, she felt satisfied and did not return to another technology support
session until March 2015, when she decided to start learning more. After an open discussion
about what she could do with technology, she decided to try using Facebook. Facebook is now
the one and only thing she does with technology. She enjoys getting on Facebook at the senior
center, and she relies on volunteers to turn on the computer for her and to log her in. Once on
Facebook, she has learned that by pressing the “down” button on the keyboard she can scroll
through recent information posted to the social networking site by her friends. Emma learned
the minimal skill needed (how to press “down” on the keyboard) to be able to use technology in
a way that fits into her life. She is content with this level of digital literacy, and has decided that
for the time being this activity is what she wants to do. This story reminds us that digital learning
does not need to lead to a pre-conceived outcome, but will rather take diverse forms based on
the backgrounds and interests of older adults.
Informatics moments in the informatics lifecourse: The story of Delores. To illustrate
and extend the findings discussed above, this section on informatics moments and learning
styles concludes with an in-depth analysis of the informatics lifecourse of a particular individual.
Delores is an African American woman aged 73. This narrative formed across 35 interactions I
had with her during field sessions at Tubman Senior Center and at Branch Library. I also
interviewed her in July 2015. I continued to hear updates about her life during informal visits to
the senior center in fall and winter 2015.

159

Delores worked as a secretary in a local school district until 2005. As part of her job she
learned how to use a Windows desktop computer, primarily for word processing and for data
entry. This learning was structured by on-the-job training, beginning in 1995. Her learning of
computers was structured by her use of a typewriter prior to the introduction of digital
technologies into her workplace. She said she used computers as part of her job “almost every
day” from 1995 to 2005.
During this time period, Delores never purchased a computer or used technology
outside of her paid employment. When she retired from her career in 2005, she stopped using
technology entirely. She said she “wanted to put that part of my life behind me.” For her,
technology was not a source of pleasure. She said that between 2005 and 2014 she “never
touched the computer, didn’t wanted to touch the computer, didn’t want anything to do with
the computer.”
In her retirement, Delores lives alone in a senior public housing building. She is active in
a residents group based in her apartment building as well as in the Tubman Seniors, in a book
club based at Branch Library, and in her church. She also volunteers throughout her community,
including as an elections monitor. She has no living children; her one daughter died in her early
20s.
In early 2014, Delores learned that in the fall she would have to use a laptop to fulfill the
duties required of an election monitor. This work involves checking people in to vote at polling
places. Worried about her inability to use the laptop, she started coming to Tubman Senior
Center in September 2014 to learn what she called “the basics. I felt like I had to start over.” I
wrote in my fieldnotes during the first field session I had with Delores:

160

Delores said she remembered using the keyboard and the mouse when she worked. But
that was years ago. She said she didn’t feel ready to do the monitor duties. She said
wanted to start over from the beginning. I could not assume any prior computer
knowledge. We had to go over everything - how to hold the mouse, how to type, how to
turn on the computer. She wanted to go over it all.
Because it had been so long since she used technology, Delores felt like she had to learn
technology as a novice. Over a two-month period, she came once a week to the senior center.
She did not own a car, so she got a ride from a friend or took the bus. During that two-month
period she focused exclusively on online typing exercises. She used an online typing program for
an hour during each session. Once in the program, she could work independently. However, she
found the procedures required to access the program difficult to implement. I wrote in my
fieldnotes after one session:
Delores was having great difficulties getting logged in - the procedures continue to
confuse her and she was having trouble typing in the passwords as written. Once she
gets into the typing program she does just fine - I don’t need to offer any help really.
After another session I wrote:
Delores needed a lot of hand-holding to get logged in and it was a bit frustrating and
trying when she continually failed to enter the right password or figure out how to type
an address into the browser.
The experiences of these informatics moments were frustrating for Delores as well. One day
when I arrived I found Delores and her friend talking “about the importance of having an
attitude of wanting to learn and keep pushing forward with technology.” In order to push past
the frustration that came from having to learn technology all over again, Delores summoned
and sustained a determined attitude as part of her learning style.
In November 2014, Delores used her digital literacy when she fulfilled her duties as an
election monitor. I talked with her during a field session after the election and wrote in my
fieldnotes that

161

Delores was extremely pleased with herself for being able to use the computer at the
election polling place she worked - and indeed her typing was quite good - she had really
learned a lot about typing.
Bolstered by this success, she decided to purchase her first electronic device. She went to Best
Buy and bought a laptop a week after the election. However, after the purchase she felt
paralyzed. She said, “I did not know where to start. I just could not get the courage to open that
box. It sat in my closet for months.”
It was not until March 2015, four months after she purchased the laptop, that Delores
started learning to use it. The turning point came when Delores heard about a seniors and
technology workshop to be held at her senior center and run by students in a community
informatics course at the local university. The students would work one-on-one with the
Tubman Seniors for two hours to help them with whatever they wanted to do with technology.
When Delores heard of this workshop, she said to herself “OK, now is the time. I need to do this.
And I will do this.” After working with a student for two hours to get started learning her laptop,
Delores started coming regularly again to the senior center to learn how to use it.
This learning process was difficult and full of frustration. She had trouble accessing the
wifi available in her apartment building. She was not able to access that wifi until May 2015. She
also wanted to learn how to set up and use email, how to search for information, how to print,
and how to play DVDs and music on her laptop, as well as other applications.
As a well-connected woman in her community, Delores turned to many sources of
support as she learned to use her laptop. One friend from church came to her apartment to help
her get on the wifi. This friend also helped her set up her printer. Another friend from church
put together a CD full of mp3s of music she liked, and helped her figure out how to use
Windows Media Player to listen to it. This friend could not give her all the support she needed to

162

use the CD, so Delores brought the CD to the senior center for more help. Nonetheless, despite
all this support Delores did not feel like she was making progress. She felt that the people trying
to help her were not willing or able to sit down with her and go slowly multiple times over how
to do things with her laptop. She said that she needed “someone to just sit down with me and
help me go over things. I can’t get it just in an hour. I need more than that.”
After one of the informatics moments I had with Delores in spring 2015 I wrote that:
She had brought in a piece of paper she had printed from her email (a spreadsheet) that
came out all wonky - She had a printer at home but was having trouble printing the file I tried to explain that she first needed to download the file and open it in excel before
printing it – I walked her through the steps of downloading from email, opening the file,
and printing it - but she needed to go very very slow and write down all the steps - and
she was having trouble absorbing it all. She needed to know step by step or she was lost
-- it was pretty overwhelming for her - after going over it a few times and she writing
down the steps she seemed to get it and said would practice it at home. She did know
how to shut down and seemed excited about continuing to learn how to use laptop. But
she was also clearly feeling overwhelmed and like there was a lot to learn.
At that particular field session six older adults came to participate in a one-hour technology
support session. There was one other volunteer, but even still, with eight people in the room
the atmosphere was chaotic.
Delores was back the following week, still working to learn how to print her email:
With Delores the first thing we did was run through a few times how exactly to open and
print the spreadsheet - it was not easy. The first hurdle was the fact that the internet
was going insanely slow on her computer. I wasn’t sure if it was the wifi, or her
computer, or Internet Explorer, or what... Worked fine on other computers.... Anyhow
when we finally got it to work I walked her through the steps (she did the clicking) then I
had her do it again - and then we did it two more times later in the session [again the
room was packed so the other volunteer and I were working across multiple
participants] .... She said something about feeling like she was in kindergarten. The
process took a long long time, and was exacerbated by the internet issues.... She was
quick to blame herself and/or the laptop for the slow-downs (her first impulse is to think
she did something wrong, not to blame the tech!!). She also asked a few times if the
slow speed of the internet could be because the laptop was not plugged in. She also
thought James’s [another older adult in the room] laptop’s wifi may have been working
while hers was not because maybe he had a better computer (even though her computer

163

was newer and probably faster!) She said her internet worked fine at home - had never
had a problem there... Anyhow she had written out detailed steps for how to download
the file and print it [from last week]. But apparently was having trouble following the
steps she had written out, so today she was trying to do it without referring to the steps to internalize the process… She was having a lot of trouble. She emphasized to me that it
had been nearly a decade since she used computers regularly - and she was clearly
struggling to make sense of it all.
This issue of learning to print an email attachment was one of dozens of procedures Delores
wanted to learn all at once during technology support sessions. There was so much to learn, and
Delores wanted to learn it all.
During this time period, Delores became very frustrated by the busyness at the senior
center. In spring 2015 the number of older adults in technology support sessions exceeded the
number of volunteers, often by a ratio of 3 to 1. As discussed in Chapter 4, the older adults at
Tubman Senior Center generally do not help each other with technology during technology
support sessions, instead turning only to the university students for assistance. As a result of this
situation, Delores looked elsewhere in the local area for technology support. She turned first to
a local community college, which has a beginning computer class. She found the pace there to
be too fast. She could not keep up with the instructor or the other students. She said it was “too
much. What I really needed then was someone to sit down with me for a long time, and that is
not what they do there.” Second, she turned to the Best Buy Geek Squad. This option, however,
did not work for her because she was “afraid to have people come into my apartment.”
Furthermore, because she does not own a car it made it extremely difficult for her to bring her
laptop to the area of town where Best Buy was located.
Finally, she found a helper that fit her needs at Branch Library. One of the students who
had volunteered at the Tubman Senior Center in fall 2014 was now serving as a technology
volunteer at Branch Library. Delores found out that the student had shifted from the senior

164

center to the library, and decided to go there to get support throughout summer and fall 2015.
At the library, few people come for technology support services (in part because very little
outreach is done about the program—Delores found out about the program from a friend, and
not from the library). As a result, Delores found that she could work with the student at the
library for one to two hours, almost completely uninterrupted. When the student left in
November 2015, Delores struggled to keep learning without her.
Delores did not feel that she had yet integrated her laptop into her life. She knew she
needed more support to keep learning. One of the librarians offered her a little assistance after
the volunteer left in November 2015, but Delores said the librarian was not able to give her
more than a few minutes of support at a time.
Describing her determination to learn to use her laptop, Delores said that:
I am committed. And when I commit I do not give up. I stopped using technology once
before. But now I see that this [technology] is, it is where things are at. You need it for
everything. I am struggling but I am determined. I am determined I can do this.
Her background in earlier stages of her life conditions the digital learning style she has
developed and nurtured across the informatics moments she has participated in. First, she
worked in education, and she continues to have strong support for education. This firm belief in
the power of education shapes the perseverance and dedication Delores brings to her own
digital learning. Second, Delores was involved and connected to the civil rights and Black power
movements in the 1960s and 1970s, when she was a young adult in her 20s and 30s. Her
participation in this social movement adds momentum to her learning in the present. Delores is
a proud person who believes she can learn technology, and this pride in her capability grew
through involvement with civil rights and Black power activism earlier in life.

165

Discussion of Delores’s informatics lifecourse. This story reveals a great deal about
informatics moments, the informatics lifecourse, and community-based information
infrastructure. The first informatics moments of Delores’s life took place at her workplace.
Through these informatics moments, Delores developed a learning style built on the premise
that technology learning is utilitarian and task-oriented. In retirement, Delores could not count
on the external pressure of the workplace to help her continue digital learning. As a result, she
stopped using technology.
She brought this workplace learning style to the informatics moments she participated
in at Tubman Senior Center in fall 2014. There she came once a week to use a typing program.
She did not want to do anything except get into this typing program and systematically move
through its lessons. This learning style served her goal of refreshing herself with the keyboard,
which she had not used for nearly a decade.
At the same time, this task-oriented learning style did not prepare Delores for the
challenges of navigating online applications, passwords, and programs in a Windows 7 laptop
environment. Delores found that she had to develop a new learning style to continue her digital
learning. This new digital learning style is premised on persistence and determination. It consists
of an attitude to learning that Delores maintains as she seeks diverse sources of support, despite
the many frustrations she has encountered along the way.
It took Delores months to summon the determination to begin learning to use her
laptop. In this vulnerable state, she found the hectic atmosphere of technology support services
at Tubman Senior Center overwhelming. That atmosphere worked for her when she worked
mostly independently on a single task, but no longer proved conducive to her digital learning
when her goals became more intensive, open-ended, and diffuse. Delores found herself wanting

166

and needing to know a great deal of procedures all at once. She wanted to do a lot with her
laptop, but was having trouble figuring out how, or even where, to begin. She said she felt like
she was in kindergarten.
As a result of this situation, Delores looked elsewhere for support, eventually finding a
conducive environment at Branch Library, and in particular working with a technology volunteer
there whom she knew from earlier work at the Tubman Senior Center. As a result of the slowerpace of technology support services there, the volunteer at Branch Library had more time to
dedicate to Delores.
Delores’s story is not finished. Delores has lost her favored helper, and is not sure if she
will find another. She may have to now learn technology more independently than she has in
the past. On the other hand, Delores may draw on multiple sources of support for less frequent
informatics moments, as opposed to coming once a week to work with the same person over
and over again. As a persistent and determined learner, Delores’s learning style has already
evolved and will continue to evolve as she continues to integrate digital technology into her life.
The evolution of her learning style has not been an internal process taking place solely within
her mind. Rather it has been a social process, unfolding across many informatics moments in
senior centers, in public libraries, and elsewhere in her community.

E. The informatics lifecourse is shaped by the stage of life known as old age
Two social structures and arrangements, retirement and ageism, shape the informatics
lifecourse of old age. Retirement leads to a certain rhythm of life, which leads to different
patterns of using and learning technology than those patterns found earlier in life. For instance,
travel in retirement shapes many of the digital practices found among older adults in this

167

sample. Retirement also leads to losing workplace-based technology support; as a result, older
adults must look elsewhere for that support. Ageism affects the informatics lifecourse because
many older adults deny and devalue their own digital literacy. Ageism also leads older adults to
deny their own aging process as they seek to avoid stigmas associated with being old. I also
identified a counter tendency of older adults resisting these ageist values through the
development of confident approaches to digital learning and literacy.
Retirement conditions the informatics lifecourse of old age. For most older adults, the
rhythm of daily life is shaped by retirement. For many older adults, digital learning is one of a
variety of projects they undertake in retirement. For instance, in March 2015 I talked with a
woman at Main Library whom I had worked with during December 2014, but whom I had not
seen since then. I asked her if she had been able to use any of the things we went over during
our previous technology support service. She said she had been too busy with her quilting
projects and with other commitments in her family and in her community to devote time to
using technology. The rhythms of daily life in retirement are shaped by the many self-motivated
activities of older adults.
For some older adults, digital practices unfold over years. Cynthia has been working
intermittently since 2012 to create video slide shows of her international travels to places like
Senegal and South Africa. She knows that many of her friends in the Tubman Senior Center
cannot afford such international travel, so she started the project to share her travels with
others in the community. She started the project with a staff member at the Tubman Senior
Center and has since been working with volunteers to create the videos in Windows Movie
Maker on her laptop. After an intensive period of weekly support for two months in which she
needed assistance getting started on the project, she now comes to the senior center irregularly

168

when she encounters a hurdle in her work. She said she works on the project whenever she has
free time: “sometimes I will spend all afternoon on it [laughs]. Other times, I may not touch it
for a month. But I get into trouble then [laughs]. Oh, it takes a while to get back into it after
taking that much time off. I try not to, but sometimes I get so busy. But I know I will always
come back to it.” She completed DVDs for her trips to South Africa and Senegal in spring 2015
and donated the DVDs to the senior center. She is now working on a DVD of her trip to New
Zealand. Asked why she didn’t focus more time on the project, she said, “well you know, I have
other things in my life. The thing you need to know is that seniors have busy lives [laughs]. I
have so much going on [laughs]. I get side-tracked and forget about it. Out of sight out of mind, I
guess [laughs].”
This story reveals two things about the informatics lifecourse of retirement. First, the
pacing of life in retirement leads older adults to extend projects over a large period of time.
Second, retired individuals have rich lives. The individuals that participated in this study lead
active lives, much of which has been spent in the local community. As such, they are densely
woven into multiple institutions and social networks. The rootedness of these individuals in their
communities shapes how they use technology in the present.
Older adults tend to use digital technologies for travel. Although densely woven into
their local communities, older adults also value opportunities to travel and to explore new areas
of the nation and world. As the story of Cynthia above illustrates, some older adults then share
their travels in their communities, enabling others to vicariously participate in their explorations.
Table 47 shows that, beyond the residence and beyond the community-based
information infrastructure, travel is the most common “place” where older adults use digital
technology. When asked where, beyond the home and beyond public libraries and senior

169

centers, they use digital technologies, 39% of interviewees said they use technology while at
hotels, on the road, on buses, on ships, and in related places. Forty-one percent do not use
technology in other places beyond their residence and beyond public libraries and senior
centers. Eight percent use digital technology in the homes of family and friends. Six percent use
technology at businesses. These people use their digital devices at restaurants and at cafes. Six
percent said they use their devices at their church.

The frequent use of technology for travel illustrates how older adults integrate
technology into the rhythms of life in retirement. For many older adults, retirement is a time of
life in which travel occurs more frequently than earlier in life. During earlier life stages, work and
family commitments precluded the possibility of travel for many older adults interviewed.
Furthermore, older adults enjoy travelling—trips are among the most popular activities at the
senior centers—and also documenting their travels through technology. They want to share
these experiences with others, as well as remember them. Digital technology in general, and
photography in particular, adds to these cultural and communication practices.
At senior centers older adults talk together about their trips and travels. Members of
Tubman Seniors and the Smith Seniors traveled to New York City and to Niagara Falls during the
fieldwork period. After the trips ended, older adults came in with their smartphones and digital
cameras to learn how to manage and share their photographs. At Metro Senior Center, the big

170

trip of the year was to Australia. Before the trip, one woman came in to learn how to use a
digital SLR camera she purchased for the purpose of documenting her trip. Afterwards, older
adults came to Metro Senior Center to learn how to manage and share their digital
photographs.
I also found that, in addition to photographing trips, older adults use technology as an
aid to travel in general. Some individuals use GPS devices in their cars. Others use mapping apps
on smartphones. For instance, although she has lived most of her life in the local city, Ruby has
relatives and friends spread throughout the country, and primarily in California, Michigan, and
Tennessee. She said that now that she is retired she is “on the road more than I am not, it seems
like.” During field sessions at Smith Senior Center, Ruby learned how to use the maps app on her
smartphone to better coordinate her travels. Describing an informatics moment I shared with
her during one field session, I wrote in my fieldnotes:
Ruby said she had successfully printed her labels [a project from a previous week we
worked on together] and wanted to know if she could use the same process to print
other things (such as tickets for airplane trips). I said yes and we ran down the process
again - she seemed satisfied with that.
But she was still having trouble using the “maps” app on her phone. So we worked on
that for a while - the interface is not very intuitive - full of pictures without much text so
can be hard to figure out what is going on or orient yourself, but we went over a few
times how to map directions to someplace from current location and also changed her
“home” address from Chicago. She wasn’t sure how that got put in because she had
never lived in Chicago - to her actual home address in the southeast of the city...
She tried searching for a few addresses. Another thing that threw her off was where to
put in the place she wanted to go. I explained that she needed to press “google” to start
inputting her address. She was expecting something that said “search” or was more
intuitive...
I figured it out just by poking around. But she did not seem comfortable with that...
She did, however, state that on one of her recent trips she and a friend were able to use
the phone to find a nearby restaurant. They found out after poking around on the app
that the restaurant was very near to where they were. She laughed about that. She said
they figured it out by accident, and afterwards she wasn’t sure what happened, so
couldn’t do it again to find another place.

171

She also used the app to find out where a particular street in the city she had not heard
of before. She said she thought she knew all the streets since she had lived here so long,
but she found a new one.
For this woman, technology serves as an aid while planning trips (printing airplane tickets),
looking for known locations (the restaurant she and her friend were looking for), and for
exploring her community (discovering an unknown street). In older adulthood, many individuals
seek to travel both to experience new places and to visit family, friends, and locations from
one’s past. Digital literacy is used among older adults to contribute to reaching these goals.
Transition from work to retirement. A third factor shaping the informatics lifecourse of
retired individuals is the transition from work to retirement. For many older adults, the process
of learning technology began years, even decades ago. Some older adults learned technology
first on the job. Others started learning in retirement. After learning started, it has not always
proceeded continuously without interruption. Periods of digital disengagement punctuate the
informatics lifecourse of many, causing difficulties when digital learning is resumed at a later
stage of life.
Among interviewees, 39% first started using digital technology between 1960 and 1989
(Table 48). Only 11% started technology usage after 2010, and 50% started with technology
between 1990 and 2009. This pattern varies by social class. All the participants who started
using technology since 2010 have blue-collar backgrounds. Among pink-collar and white-collar
participants, around 45% started using technology between 1960 and 1989 and 55% started
using technology between 1990 and 2009.

These differences make sense in relation to different patterns of technology usage on
the job. Only 11% of blue-collar workers used technology on the job (Table 49). The opposite is
true among pink-collar and white-collar workers, where almost all (97%) of pink-collar and a
large majority (88%) of white-collar workers learned and used technology on the job. For many
interviewees, paid employment structured their introduction to and learning of digital
technologies. On the other hand, some older adults have just started learning technology for the
first time in their lives. This population includes even those who are in their 50s, especially if
they have had blue-collar careers.

What unites these interviewees is the fact that they are searching for support with
technology in community-based information infrastructure in retirement. But even among these
persistent learners, who take the initiative to seek support with technology in their
communities, periods of digital disengagement occur. Digital disengagement refers to a period
of life in which there is a cessation of learning and using technology (Olphert & Damodaran,
2013). The factors causing digital disengagement are many, and include life stage transitions
such as retirement. The effects of digital disengagement are also myriad, and include difficulty
later in life when the learning of technology resumes, which it did for all older adults in this
sample.

For many participants, digital learning is a sporadic feature across the lifecourse.
Episodes of digital learning are followed by episodes of digital disengagement, followed by
further episodes of digital learning. As table 50 shows, digital disengagement is a social
phenomenon that shapes the informatics lifecourse of many older adults. Fully 48% of the
interviewees stated they had stopped using technology for some period of their lives. The
phenomenon is more common among pink- and white-collar individuals than among blue-collar
individuals (Table 50). The reason for disparity relates to the longer life histories of white- and
pink-collar workers with technologies (Table 49). They have used technology for longer periods
of their lives, so are more likely to have had episodes of digital disengagement. No major
differences emerged related to ethnicity. Digital disengagement is more common among the
older old (75+) than among the younger old (50–74): 62% of the older old experienced digital
disengagement versus 36% of the younger old (Table 51).

Digital disengagement is less a product of the declining minds and bodies of older adults
and more a product of our society. A major reason for differences found among interviewees
relates to their life histories. The older old, especially those of pink- and white-collar
backgrounds, learned technology on the job, and as such learned to associate technology with
workplace culture. When they retired, many older adults had never used technology outside of
a workplace, and as a result, leaving the workplace meant leaving technology. Sixty-two percent
of those who disengaged from technology gave retirement as a reason for ceasing technology
usage for a while (Table 52). When asked why he stopped using technology, a 73-year-old white
man stated that after retirement, he “didn’t want to be bothered with the computer anymore. I
didn’t want to be attached. I had been attached for 20 years. It was enough.”

The changing nature of digital technologies also contributes to digital disengagement in
the informatics lifecourse of older adults. The second-most common reason offered to explain
digital disengagement are changes in technology (38%), such as the shift from mainframes to
personal computers (PCs), and, more recently, shifts from desktops to

175

laptops/tablets/smartphones, as well as from one operating system to another. When
discussing this issue, one woman stated simply that it “feels like I am always starting over with
technology” as new devices and upgrades to applications cause her to continuously learn new
procedures. The cost of technology (35%) also leads to digital disengagement among older
adults. Staying up-to-date with technology requires purchasing new digital devices over time.
Some older adults stop purchasing new technologies, and as a result over time disengage from
technology. Older adults also stated that health-related issues (12%) and moves from one place
to another (8%) led them to stop using technology for a while. Those that gave health as a
reason for stopping technology usage indicated that things like scheduling dialysis appointments
or caring for an ailing loved one consumed so much of their time that they did not feel they had
the time to stay up-to-date with technology.
In any case, when asked if she had constantly used technology or stopped for a while,
this 67-year-old European American woman gave a detailed answer that expresses her and
other older adults’ frustration with changes in technology and with the cost of staying up-todate with technology:
I stopped using the iPod [the primary technology she used after she retired] because
they upgraded them and I could not keep up with the upgrades. They also added too
many features. I read that people want to buy devices with more features but then they
don’t know how to use them. I know which features I need but they give you all these
extra features I don’t want and I don’t think anyone wants. But that makes them more
prone to having problems. So then you need to keep buying new stuff to fix the
problems they have!
The copier had all these features, but it was mostly used to run copies. But it broke
because people would hit the wrong button. I felt like I could not use it. The librarian
helped me but she was hitting all these buttons and I felt like I could not use it. It’s
ridiculous that I can’t simply make some copies. I can’t use my iPod only for music; it has
to have internet, etc. etc. It’s nice that the iPad [she bought an iPad to replace her iPod
shortly before this interview] has picture and video features and I would like to make a
video of my dog, but I don’t know how to make it. And I would like to upload things to
YouTube, but I don’t know how to do that either. They make it so complex so that you

176

have to hire someone to come and help you. Those geek squad people. I see them on
TV. If they made technology better you wouldn’t need them.
Everything I know about computers I owe to my dogs. [Laughs] I have kept up and
learned to use listservs because I wanted to talk to other people who have the same
type of dogs as I have. I would like to be able to make videos and share them. I have
gotten books to learn to do things but they [the books] just sit there. I find visual
learning more helpful. I usually need someone to help me.
In discussing an episode of digital disengagement, this woman rejects the ageist narrative that
the problems she has learning technology emanate from her supposedly declining mind and
body. Instead she states that “if they made technology better you wouldn’t need” all this
technology support. Unfortunately, as I will show momentarily, this attitude is not common
among older adults, who tend more often than not to blame themselves when things go wrong.
Ageism conditions the informatics lifecourse. This section discusses some of the ways
in which ageism shapes how older adults think about and discuss the informatics lifecourse of
retirement. Ageism, as it is internalized by older adults, leads them to denigrate and devalue
their own digital literacy. Ageism further leads some older adults to express ambivalence about,
and to avoid the social stigma of, being “old.” On the other hand, when older adults successfully
practice digital literacy and learning they feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, which
contributes to overturning ageist ideas about older adults and digital technology. Furthermore,
some, like the woman quoted above, resist the planned obsolescence of the contemporary
technology economy, situating problems with technology in society instead of in her own mind
or body.
Devaluing and denying their own digital literacy. Throughout fieldwork I again and again
found older adults devaluing and denying their own digital literacy. How ageism shapes the
informatics lifecourse can be seen in the following story from the Tubman Senior Center. This
story involves two members of the Tubman Seniors: one in her late 60s helping another in her

177

late 80s with technology. The younger woman retired from a job as an instructor at a
community college. She helped the older woman type her biography for a community
celebration of local African American women aged 80 and older. This help-giving episode took
place because the two women have known each other for years. The episode took place outside
the senior center. When the two women participated in technology support services at the
senior center, they did so as older individuals seeking assistance from young university students.
The younger older adult did not offer to help other older adults learning technology there.
When I asked her why she does not also help other older adults with technology, the woman
said she does not feel like she knows enough to help others. She said she helped her friend
because her friend asked for assistance. But she does not feel like she knows enough to offer
assistance to others outside of occasions when close friends informally ask for her support. I
found this woman to be highly competent with technology, with a lot of skills to offer. Through
our conversations at the senior center I determined that internalized ageism leads her to deny
and devalue her own digital literacy.
Ageism also shapes the interactions of older adults. Two regulars at Smith Senior Center
maintain a running joke in which they laugh about how ridiculous it would be for them to help
each other with technology. Their joke, a variant of the “blind leading the blind,” centers on the
assumption that older adults do not, and never can be good enough with technology to help
others. Nonetheless, both men are in fact quite proficient with a number of programs and
procedures on their laptops and smartphones. The two could have shared their skills with each
other, and with others, but the ageist idea that they would forever be backwards in their
technology skills stood in the way.

178

Even those older adults who do feel confident with their own capacity to use technology
express ageist stereotypes. When I asked a woman at Metro Senior Center who I had seen
helping other older adults with technology if she thought she could lead technology support
services at the senior center on her own, she responded:
No, I’m old! They don’t want help from me! I get by with technology …. And if I get stuck
I can figure it out. Usually. [Laughs] When it works it works. But when it doesn’t.
[Laughs] Help someone else here at the center? No, no, no. That is for you [young
people] to do. You know this stuff in and out. What could I add?
Many older adults have internalized ageist stereotypes that assume young people know more
about technology than older people. This ageist belief shapes how older adults conceptualize
their own digital literacy.
One of the consequences of this ageist belief is that many older adults interpret
breakdowns that arise when they are using technology as emanating out of their supposedly
declining minds. One of the challenges older adults face while learning technology is that when
they see others doing something with technology they say that it “seems like magic,” as one
woman stated. Another woman remarked on “how easy it was to do something after you figure
it out, but before you know how to do it, it is terrifying.” Family members add to these feelings
by making technology seem mystifying and out of reach, and by acting in ways that shame older
adults for their lack of understanding about contemporary digital technologies. When asked
about people in his life who help him with technology, an older man in his late 70s stated that:
Sometimes I got my daughter or one of my grandkids who know what I’m doing … like
my little granddaughter who is about 6 years old …. She said “Y’all don’t know that? I
know that!” And she’s only 5 or 6 years old! So these younger kids know a whole lot of
this stuff and what these apps mean. We don’t.

179

The man said that he does not spend much time learning technology in retirement because he
feels it is a losing venture. He said he feels like he will always be behind, so he would rather use
his retirement for other purposes.
Ambivalence about aging. A second way in which ageism shapes the informatics
lifecourse of older adults has to do with ambivalence about the aging process. Five of the six
institutions have policies and procedures that officially define older adulthood as beginning at
age 50 (Table 53). Table 53 also shows that many eligible to participate in senior centers do not
join them. The average age of participants in technology support services in senior centers was
74, and no individuals younger than 58 participated in technology support services.

In contrast, more of the younger older adults took advantage of technology support
services at public libraries, where one did not have to declare oneself “old” and thus one was
able to avoid the stigma of being an older adult. At public libraries, the average age of
participants was 66, and individuals as young as 50 participated in technology support services.
During four separate field sessions at public libraries, when I explained my research to older
patrons who would beconsidered older adults by the official designations they were surprised
and slightly offended to hear that the libraries consider them to be older adults. This finding
illustrates the social complexity involved in identifying oneself, and identifying others, as older

180

adults. Far from an objective social category, this term is loaded with ageist assumptions.
Because of the stigma of aging, older adulthood is an identity many seek to avoid.
Counter tendency: empowerment and confidence. A counter tendency to these ageist
ideas appears in instances of older adults developing confidence and pride in their digital
literacy. Older adults express excitement about showing children digital skills they have learned.
At Metro Senior Center an older woman received an iPad from her son for Christmas. She said
her son became frustrated because she could not figure out what to do with it. After coming to
Metro Senior Center for technology support on six occasions, she said she could not wait to
show her son what she had learned to do. For this woman, a key motivation driving her
acquisition of digital literacy was being able to show her children, and her son in particular, that
she could use digital technologies.
A woman at Tubman Senior Center had a similar experience. For her birthday she
received an iPad from her children, who lived in Texas and California. She said they tried helping
her get started with this technology over the phone, but she could not follow their instructions,
and they were getting frustrated with her. She said that she wanted to learn how to use these
technologies to show them she was capable of being digitally literate, and more generally to
show them, and herself, that she was still a valid, capable individual. After five technology
support sessions she felt comfortable doing things like opening her email on her iPad, sending
text-based emails, and taking and sending pictures. She said it makes her feel good to know that
she can communicate with her family through the iPad, both because it is nice to be in
communication with them, and because she is pleased to be able to participate in digital society.
Digital literacy also contributes to the self-confidence of older adults. At Main Library, a
woman in her early 80’s said she felt “proud to have done it herself” after she used the library’s

181

online catalog for the first time to find items relevant to her interest. On another occasion, a
woman at Smith Senior Center said that in-between technology support sessions she had
independently installed iTunes on her windows laptop. She said “I am proud of myself because I
have never installed a program.” Another man at the Tubman Senior Center spent
approximately two months learning the word processing, digital photography, and email skills
necessary to create and send a pdf Christmas greeting to his contacts. When the card finally
went out, he said: “People like my card. I feel proud … That was rewarding to see.” The pride of
digital literacy contributes to breaking down the interlinked ageist stereotypes that being old is
synonymous with a) being on the wrong side of the digital divide, and b) being in a period of
decline. These examples illustrate that digital literacy has multiple benefits for older adults. It
contributes to their ability to integrate technology into the diverse rhythms of their daily lives,
and it contributes to their sense of self-sufficiency in the information age. At a broader social
level, the digital literacy of older adults contributes to ameliorating ageist stereotypes held by
older adults and by others in their communities.

F. Summary
This chapter showed that older adults are determined and creative learners who with
support integrate technology into the diverse rhythms of their lives. To understand these
findings, I coined a new concept, the informatics lifecourse. The informatics lifecourse refers to
how a person learns technology through the stages of his or her life. Digital literacy requires
learning technology over time, since the technology taken to be normal in the information
society has thus far tended to change often and dramatically. This learning proceeds through
informatics moments, or seeking, getting and providing help with new technology over time.

182

Common tendencies identified in the informatics lifecourse of this sample include: (1)
most older adults own at least one digital device, (2) consistent sources of technology support
tend to be found among family and friends, (3) digital practices tend to orient around
communication and culture, and (4) the structures of retirement and ageism shape the
informatics lifecourse of old age. As older adults participate in informatics moments across time,
they construct digital learning styles that build on how they have learned in the past. With
support, older adults develop new and powerful ways to learn technology in the present.
Digital inequalities among older adults relate to differences in the informatics lifecourse
of this sample. Diverse patterns of device ownership and technology support, and diverse digital
economic and medical patterns in this sample relate to differences in terms of age, ability,
ethnicity, gender, and social class. These digital inequalities form over time through the
informatics lifecourse. Older adults of blue-collar backgrounds have had less opportunities to
learn technology than those of white- and pink-collar backgrounds.
n the next chapter, this chapter’s findings on older adult digital literacy are
contextualized in relation to chapter 4’s analysis of community-based information
infrastructure. Through this analysis, this study’s overarching research question—to what extent
and how does community-based information infrastructure support older adult digital literacy—
is answered. This dissertation concludes with a discussion of the implications of this answer in
relation to theory, practice, and teaching.

183

CHAPTER 6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This dissertation asks to what extent and how does community-based information
infrastructure support older adult digital literacy. Chapter 4 analyzed community-based
information infrastructure, operationalized as three public libraries and three senior centers. In
that chapter I focused in particular on technology support services in which older adults
participate. Chapter 5 analyzed older adult digital literacy, operationalized as 209 adults using
and learning digital technologies over time. In this chapter I now integrate the findings from the
previous two chapters to answer this dissertation’s research question.
In answering this question and discussing the implications of this answer in terms of theory,
practice, and teaching, this chapter has the following structure:
A. A summary of the findings from Chapters 4 and 5.
B. The answer to the research question.
C. A discussion of this answer in relation to theories and models introduced in Chapter 2’s
review of the literature.
D. Future research directions suggested by this study.
E. The implications of this study for practice and teaching.

A. Summary of findings
The findings from Chapters 4 and 5 are that:
•
•
•
•

Community-based information infrastructure emerges out of and evolves through
individual and social struggle;
Community-based information infrastructure extends across space and time;
Ageism affects both community-based information infrastructure and older adult
digital literacy; and
Older adults are determined and creative learners who with support integrate
technology into the diverse rhythms of their live; this reality can best be understood
as the informatics lifecourse: how a person learns technology through the stages of
his or her life.

Community-based information infrastructure emerges out of and evolves through
individual and social struggle. Organized together and organized with other sectors of their

184

local communities, older adults create, lead, and advocate for community-based information
infrastructure. Older adults played important roles in the community organizations that started
all six of the institutions studied in this dissertation.
As senior centers and public libraries moved away from their community roots to
become institutionalized, overpressured staff implemented bureaucratic procedures to cope
with the challenge of administering these complex public institutions. This institutionalized
bureaucracy has limited the agency of older adults as, over time, they have been marginalized
from the administration of these institutions. On the other hand, older adults continue to be
responsible for portions of these institutions. Older adults lead senior center and friends of the
library groups. Through these community organizations, older adults continue to shape and
advocate for these public institutions.
Digital inequalities affect these power dynamics. Older adults coping with new
technologies are framed by the institutions as passive service recipients instead of as
community leaders capable and ready to contribute to shaping these programs. When older
adults seek support with technology in these institutions, these help-seeking episodes, or
informatics moments (Williams, 2012), are often structured by what Durrance (1983) criticizes
as the “anonymous professional-client encounter” (p. 278). As a result of this structure, older
adults are not recognized in relation to their experiences in the local community. They are
rather seen as anonymous individuals requiring professionally administered technology support.
Nonetheless, both as individuals and as part of community organizations, older adults
continue to shape this community-based information infrastructure. For example, older adults
adapt technology support services to the group-based communities of practice that exist at

185

senior centers. Furthermore, through individual agency older adults attempt and often succeed
in adapting technology support services.
Information infrastructure reflects the ever-evolving relationship between information
systems and information users. In community-based information infrastructure that relationship
is shaped by social struggle. The dominant tendencies discovered in this study, summarized
above, co-exist alongside counter tendencies that could in the future become dominant, given
the right support. For example, one counter tendency consists of older adults and information
systems coping together with the challenge of staying up-to-date with new technologies
released by the marketplace into their local community. Other counter tendencies identified in
this study include:
•
•
•
•
•

Older adults customizing computer labs;
Older adults helping other older adults with technology;
Staff and volunteers learning technology alongside older adults;
Staff bending and breaking rules in response to the agency of older adults; and
Older adults insisting on visibility against ageist narratives and structures.

By making these counter tendencies visible, this dissertation showcases the agency of older
adults and staff creatively reconfiguring senior centers and public libraries.
Community-based information infrastructure extends across space and time. The
community-based information infrastructure of public libraries and senior centers extends
across space to include older adults’ other sources of technology support. Older adults seeking
technology support in these institutions also seek support elsewhere in their communities and
families. This broader network of technology support shapes how older adults participate in
technology support services based in public libraries and senior centers.
This community-based information infrastructure also extends across time since older
adults have participated in these institutions, or institutions like them, throughout their lives.

186

These institutions are rooted in the lives and in the communities of older adults. This rootedness
shapes how and why older adults participate in technology support services in these institutions
in the present.
Ageism affects both community-based information infrastructure and older adult
digital literacy. To reiterate, ageism includes prejudice and discrimination against older adults,
and, more generally, against the process of growing old. Public libraries and senior centers
reinforce ageist values when they: a) frame older adulthood as invisible or unimportant, b)
conceive of older adulthood as a time of disability and decline, c) express ambivalence and
antipathy toward older adults, and d) naturalize the idea that young people are the tutors of old
people learning technology. These ageist tendencies are resisted, however, by older staff
working alongside older adults in technology support services and by older adults insisting on
visibility in these public spaces.
It is not just the infrastructures that reflect ageism; many older adults have also
internalized ageist values, which affect how they conceive of their own digital literacy. Ageist
values appear when older adults deny or denigrate their own digital literacy. This phenomenon
occurs when older adults who use technology with some fluency express the belief that they are
incapable because of their age of helping others with technology. Ageism also leads older adults
to express ambivalence about the aging process, which occurs when they avoid self-identifying
as old because of stigmas associated with being an older person in the USA. On the other hand,
when older adults learn technology they experience empowerment and confidence, discovering
they are as able as any other individual to participate in the information society. This discovery
and its dissemination contributes to dismantling ageist values.

187

Older adults are determined and creative learners who, with support, integrate
technology into the diverse rhythms of their lives; this reality can best be understood as the
informatics lifecourse. Digital literacy emerges through technology learning across time. Unlike
with traditional literacy, reading and writing, if one does not continue to learn new technologies
as they emerge, one falls behind and may eventually find oneself unable to participate in the
information society. To understand the digital literacy of older adults, I found it necessary to
coin a new term. The informatics lifecourse is a portmanteau concept, combining the concept of
the informatics moment with the lifecourse approach to studying society to describe how a
person learns technology through the stages of his or her life.
To reiterate, scholars of the human lifecourse study “how historical time, social location,
and culture affect the individual experience of each life stage” (Hutchison, 2014, p. 11). Each
stage of the lifecourse is shaped by a “sequence of socially defined events and roles that the
individual enacts over time” (Giele & Elder, 1998, p. 22). The most basic stages of life are: early
life, adult life, older life, though a given culture may have more fine-grained stages based on the
particularities of its culture, for example, student, worker, and retired.
The “informatics” half of this concept builds on the concept of the "informatics
moment" (Williams, 2012). The informatics moment is “the moment when a person seeks help
in using some digital technology that is new to him or her” (Williams, 2012, p. 47). The
informatics moment is also:
A phase in the transition of a society or a social sector to the information age, with all
the dislocations and transformations that are entailed in introducing digital tools and
infrastructure. (Williams, 2012, pp. 47–48)
The concept of the informatics lifecourse extends the concept of the informatics moment, in
that it comprises the accumulation of informatics moments across time. It consists, in other

188

words, of learning technology across time, through the stages of life. Ageism and retirement are
two social structures that shape the informatics lifecourse of old age in the USA. More generally,
the concept of the informatics lifecourse adds to our theoretical understanding of digital literacy
the idea that digital learning and literacy emerges across time, and in the diverse lives and
communities of diverse individuals.
In this study of older adult digital literacy, I identified common tendencies in the
informatics lifecourse of old age. These tendencies include: (1) Communication and culture
shape the digital practices of many older adults; (2) email and photography are the most
popular digital practices; (3) all the older adults who participated in interviews own at least one
digital technology; and (4) the structures of retirement and ageism condition the informatics
lifecourse during this stage of life.
Older adults are highly diverse, and so, too, is older adult digital literacy. Older adults
integrate technology into their lives in diverse ways. Some older adults have used technology
intermittently since the 1960s; others are starting to use technology for the first time in their
lives. Some older adults own the latest technologies as soon as they are released, while others
use older devices that, although no longer supported by their manufacturers, are still functional
in their lives. One example illustrates how older adults integrate technology into the diverse
rhythms of their lives: Some older adults (more white-collar, more European American, more
men) have money they are managing with technology; other older adults (more blue-collar,
more African American, more women) are trying to find ways to make money through
technology.
As older adults learn technology in the present, they draw on learning techniques
developed in the past, such as consulting handbooks and manuals as they learn something new.

189

On the other hand, the learning styles of older adults evolve. With support, older adults develop
creative new ways to learn technology in the present. When older adults find a sustainable
source of support, they turn again and again to that individual, institution, or group. This
support enables older adults both to learn technology and to develop new ways of learning
across time.

B. Answering the research question
The overall finding from this investigation is that community-based information
infrastructure is indeed supportive of older adult digital literacy. Nonetheless, this support is not
as robust as it could be. To provide a detailed answer to this dissertation’s research question—
to what extent and how does community-based information infrastructure support older adult
digital literacy—I first analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this infrastructure in terms of
how it supports the digital literacy of older adults. I then use findings from this study to extend
the concept of the informatics lifecourse to encompass community-based information
infrastructure. This discussion illustrates how the digital literacy of the individual relates to the
community-based information infrastructures the individual participates in over time.

Strengths and weaknesses of community-based information infrastructure in terms of how it
supports older adult digital literacy
I first analyze aspects of this infrastructure found to support older adult digital literacy. I
then analyze aspects of this infrastructure that are sometimes supportive, but not consistently. I
finally discuss aspects of a supportive infrastructure not found to be present in this particular
community-based information infrastructure but that would support older adult digital literacy.

Table 54: To what extent and how does community-based information infrastructure support older
adult digital literacy?

Strengths of this infrastructure. All six sites support individual older adults who learn
technology alone and within the limitations set by the sites (Table 54). Older adults use and
benefit from this support. This finding relates to the fact that all six institutions are rooted in the
lives of older adults. Older adults come to these institutions for technology support because
they and people they know in their communities have been participating in these institutions for

191

years, if not decades. The rootedness of these institutions in the community contributes to how
they support the digital literacy of older adults.
Somewhat supportive, but not consistently. The next three aspects of supportive
community-based information infrastructure in Table 54—adapts in response to agency of older
adults, supports development of digital learning styles, and supports diverse ways of using
digital technologies—all relate to how the sites respond to the agency of the older adults that
come to them for support with technology. I found that all six sites partially support this agency.
In an ad hoc fashion, individual staff members and volunteers go beyond official processes and
procedures to flexibly support older adults on their terms. For instance, at Main Library a library
technician helps older adults on personal devices unfamiliar to her because they ask for that
help, even though the library officially prohibits this type of assistance. Older adults form
relationships with volunteers and staff willing to bend the rules. These relationships in turn
enable older adults to develop digital learning styles. These learning styles take time to develop,
and this process is aided when digital learning emerges in the context of supportive
relationships. Furthermore, technology volunteers support whatever older adults want to do
with technology and in general spend more time with older adults than staff do. These
tendencies illustrate how this infrastructure partially supports older adults adapting the
institutions to learn and to practice digital literacy. Nonetheless, this support is not consistently
available at all times from all people.
In some aspects, public libraries are more supportive than senior centers, while in
others, I found senior centers more supportive than public libraries. Public libraries are more
supportive in terms of maintaining and supporting public access to information systems. Senior
centers are more supportive in terms of maintaining and supporting organized groups of older

192

adults. All three public libraries have long hours, and staff will provide at least some level of
technology support during all open hours. All three public libraries also support well-maintained
information systems with dedicated staff responsible for maintaining public computers and wifi.
As a result, at public libraries an older adult can expect to be able to access wifi without a
password, log into a library computer (if they have a library card or a photo ID), and use the
printer and scanner. An older adult can also count on someone being available to help for at
least a minute or two with these procedures.
Despite the availability of technology, supporting older adult digital literacy is not an
institutional priority across public libraries. In contrast, senior centers have made this topic more
of a priority. Senior center staff use diverse media (television, internet, newspapers, mailings,
word-of-mouth) to spread the word about technology support services at senior centers; no
comparable levels of outreach exist at public libraries. Nonetheless, older adult digital literacy is
not always an institutional priority at senior centers. Although staff enthusiastically do outreach
for technology support services, they are less willing to offer these services themselves. Senior
centers instead rely on volunteers to offer technology support during officially demarcated
times. Outside of these times, technology support is not routinely available in senior centers.
Senior centers also support older adult digital literacy by supporting groups of older
adults who learn technology together there. This collaborative learning of technology happened
the most at Metro Senior Center, but also occurred with less regularity at Smith and Tubman
Senior Centers. I also found one group of older adults who learn and use technology together at
Metro Library, suggesting this phenomenon may organically arise in public libraries. In any case,
two senior centers also support older adults leading technology support services. The director of
Tubman Senior Center allowed a group of quilters to install a printer in the computer lab,

193

although he and other park district staff did not provide support for the printer. The director of
Smith Senior Center allowed a woman who had recently joined the Smith Seniors to start
leading technology support services there, but this volunteer was not provided by the senior
center with the support she needed to sustain the services across time.
In general, then, public libraries provide more robust information services, managed by
professional staff and professionally-trained volunteers. Senior centers, in contrast, rely on
volunteers and donated equipment that is not always kept up-to-date. They are, on the other
hand, more open than public libraries to supporting the agency of older adults interested in
shaping and leading technology support services.
Support not available. Through my study of older adult digital literacy, I identified three
aspects of a supportive community-based information infrastructure not present in any of the
institutions. These include: (1) connects to other sectors of community-based information
infrastructure, (2) counters ageist narratives of older adult digital literacy, and (3) sustains
relationships between technology helpers and older adults learning technology.
Older adults rely on multiple sources of support as they learn technology across time.
Sources of support include family members, friends, businesses, public institutions, and nonprofit institutions. None of the six sites studied connects to, or has tried to connect to, this
broader community-based information infrastructure. The institutions have not devoted energy
or time to building or connecting to networks around technology support.
Neither do any of the sites counter ageist narratives of older adult digital literacy. In
fact, some sites reinforce ageist stereotypes through “senior computer stations” that differ from
regular computers only in that they have assistive technologies for people with disabilities, thus
reinforcing the idea that old age is synonymous with physical decline. Furthermore, the

194

structure of young people helping old people with technology may reinforce the ageist idea that
young people are the natural technology tutors of the old.
Finally, none of the institutions endeavor to sustain relationships between technology
helpers and older adults. In fact, these relationships are sometimes actively discouraged by
policies. When these relationships do emerge, they tend to be ephemeral and ad hoc, lasting as
long as the technology helper has time to sustain it. These ephemeral relationships are
supportive while they last, but they do not add up to a community-based information
infrastructure that supports learning technology throughout the stages of life.

The informatics lifecourse: connecting digital literacy and information infrastructure
Having discussed the strengths and weaknesses of this community-based information
infrastructure in terms of how it supports older adult digital literacy, I now answer this
dissertation’s research question at a more conceptual level. Community-based information
infrastructure supports older adult digital literacy only to the extent that it is rooted in the
informatics lifecourse of older adults (Figure 6).
In Chapter 5 I analyzed the informatics lifecourse of the individuals that participated in
this study. Here, I analyze how the informatics lifecourse of these individuals relate to the
community where they live. Breakdowns in the digital learning of the individual relate to
breakdowns in community-based information infrastructure. Therefore, individual lives and
communities are intertwined and interdependent.
To be able to continue to do things with technology across time, older adults need to
learn new technologies as they emerge. When this learning stops, so too does the ability of the
older adult to do things with technology. Older adults are mostly retired from the paid

195

workforce. In the context of retirement, older adults turn to the public institutions of senior
centers and public libraries to start or to continue learning technology. Through technology
support in these and other institutions, older adults learn technology across time.

Figure 6: A model of the informatics lifecourse in community-based information infrastructure. Figure
adapted from the model of the informatics moment, Williams, 2012.

The informatics lifecourse is not always supported or even recognized in communitybased information infrastructure. The institutions studied do not recognize that decisions they
make about starting, stopping, or adapting technology support services affect how the
informatics lifecourse of older adulthood proceeds. The dotted line in figure 6 represents the
fact that digital disengagement often occurs in the informatics lifecourse of older adults. These

196

periods of digital disengagement relate to periods in which community-based information
infrastructure is not as supportive as it could be.
This process is shaped by struggle, both at the level of the individual and at the level of
the community. Older adults insist that people in their community help them with technology.
This process is also shaped by the structure of community-based information infrastructure. This
structure includes, at the local level, the helpers and spaces available in community-based
information infrastructure. At the global level, community-based information infrastructure is
structured by the changing digital technologies released in the consumer marketplace. Ageism
shapes all aspects of this structure. We live in a world where innovation and technology are
virtually synonymous with youth. As a result, the innovations and creativity of older adults
learning technology are not always recognized or valorized.
The informatics lifecourse in the community-based information infrastructure. I now
illustrate these findings through an example of how the informatics lifecourse intersects with
community-based information infrastructure. Hester is an 89-year-old African American. This is
the story she gave in response to questions about her life history using technology:
Noah: Do you remember the first digital device you ever used?
Hester: Yes, I used the mainframe [computer] at the county government office. It was
one of the very first ones! I took classes at the university, learning to program, you
would say, tapes and punch [cards] way back when. I learned how to wire a mother
board! The professor drew diagrams and we put it together in back of the employment
offices at night in the early 1960s. But I lost track of [computers] when they switched
from mainframes to PCs. I quit using all of that when I retired in 1986.
Noah: When did you start up again with digital technology?
Hester: Well, I took a course on the PC in the, I can’t remember when, sometime in the
early ‘80s, before I retired. They wanted everyone to know how to use the PC. But it was
too different, and I was about to retire. I did do a little with the PC then, but not very
much. But I still have the notes from those classes!
Noah: You didn’t use the PC after you retired?
Hester: No, not that I can remember. But then–oh yes, back in the late 1990s, I can’t
remember exactly when or so… I bought a digital camera. My granddaughter, she was

197

getting married! I got it just to take pictures and I wanted to take pictures of my
granddaughter’s wedding. But I could not figure out how to use it [laughs]. What to do
with the pictures after I took them! I got some help from some university students here
at the Tubman Senior Center. I figured out I better buy a computer so I had some place
to put my pictures. [Laughs] I just didn’t realize you needed a computer if you used a
digital camera. [Laughs] They never tell you what all you need, and it seems like you
always need something else. So, anyhow, I bought a desktop, with XP, in 2000, 2001,
something like that. I can’t remember exactly when. I still have that computer. It is at
home. I still use it. But it is getting old. I guess I’m getting old too [laughs]. Some of the
university students at the senior center helped me figure out how to use it. I have my
notes from those classes too! [Laughs] I just keep everything. I’m a packrat, I guess.
Noah: Tell me about what you have been doing with technology since then.
Hester: Since then? [Laughs] Not much. I was using my desktop a little bit, now and
then, but less and less as time went on. The university students stopped coming to the
senior center, I can’t remember when, but sometime. And then without them here to
ask questions, I guess I just used the computer less and less. Oh, I got on it from time to
time. And I take pictures now and then with my digital camera. I took a lot of pictures of
my dog. I am glad I have those now that he is dead. But it just became less of a priority
for me, I guess.
Noah: When did you buy your laptop? [Hester brought a laptop into the senior center to
learn how to use it during fieldwork, beginning in winter 2014.]
Hester: Oh, this? [Refers to the laptop] I got it in 2013, I think. My son bought it for me.
He thought my desktop was getting too old. It has Windows 7. Now that I have this
laptop I am figuring out how to use it. I can print, finally. You don’t need to connect a
wire to your computer anymore to print. It always changes. [Laughs] I guess that is how
it is.
This life story illustrates how the informatics lifecourse of the individual intersects with
community-based information infrastructure. During the stage of life in which she was working
full-time, Hester relied on her employers to provide her with the training she needed to practice
digital literacy. This process lasted from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. After Hester retired from
her job, and embarked on a new stage of life—retirement—she lost her technology support. She
now had to find technology support in her community.
In retirement, a stage of life that has already lasted nearly 30 years, Hester found
technology support in her family and in her senior center. Her family motivated her to acquire
her first digital device in the mid-1990s. Her family also purchased a laptop for her in 2013.

198

Nonetheless, her family has not always provided Hester with the support she needs to learn to
use these technologies. For this support, Hester has turned to her senior center. She joined the
senior center shortly after she retired because the senior center was rooted in her community.
Many of Hester’s friends participated in the senior center; her mother was a leader in the group
in the 1970s. Through participation in this senior center, Hester started participating in
technology support services. Beginning in 1997, university students volunteered intermittently
at her senior center to help older adults learning technology. When this support stopped,
however, Hester’s technology learning did too. Her digital practices also stopped. When support
was present, though, Hester continued to learn technology and continued to find creative ways
to integrate technology into the rhythms of her life.
Gaps in Hester’s digital learning relate to gaps in the supportiveness of this communitybased information infrastructure. These gaps in digital learning have made it difficult for Hester
to use technology fluently throughout the stages of her life. When I first met Hester in winter
2014 I had no idea she had this rich background with technology. She was then coping with the
challenge of learning the diverse functions and programs on her laptop. She was learning how to
use the touchpad and USB ports, as well as word processing programs, internet browsers, and
email. Hester described herself as “just beginning” with her laptop, and not knowing where to
begin. When I first met her she said she was so happy to have someone help her with her
laptop. In my fieldnotes from that first meeting I wrote, “She was so appreciative and at the end
she said she wanted to know how long I will be coming.” During a year of fieldwork, Hester came
to 55 technology support sessions at the senior center. Through these sessions, Hester worked
with other volunteers and with me to learn how to use her laptop.

199

Hester fitted technology learning into the richness of her life. Hester lives a very active
life in retirement and as a result could not always adjust her personal schedule around the
senior center’s schedule of technology support services. Hester came to as many technology
support sessions as she was able, but during one month Hester did not come to a single session.
She said afterward that during this period she had to babysit for her great-granddaughter
because the child’s mother could not afford daycare. This instance serves as a reminder of the
fact that older adulthood is not a stage of life in which one lacks familial and community
obligations. Hester continues to contribute to her community, both through her family, and also
through her church and senior center. She relies on her community for support learning
technology, and they in turn rely on her. She is also often called by reporters during Black
History Month to talk about local African American history. Hester’s life is rich, and she has
much to offer, and it is unfortunate that she has not always found the support she needs to be
able to use technology in retirement to contribute to her community. Furthermore, Hester is not
a passive user of technology support services. Rather, she is an active agent. The persistence of
individuals like Hester inspired other technology volunteers, the staff of the senior center, and
me to work hard to support her digital learning across time.
Hester’s story illustrates how the informatics lifecourse of older age intersects with
community-based information infrastructure. The two phenomena are interconnected and
intertwined, just as individuals and communities more generally are. In other words, the
informatics lifecourse reveals something new and important about digital literacy, about old
age, and about the communities where life is lived throughout time. The concept suggests that
rather than study these phenomena independently, we instead seek to holistically understand
how digital literacy and learning emerge across time in the communities where daily life is lived.

200

C. Contributions to theory
Having answered this dissertation’s research question, this section now discusses the
contributions this research makes to the theories and concepts introduced in Chapter 2’s review
of the literature. I first discuss the contributions this dissertation makes to theories and
concepts in the field of community informatics. I then discuss the contributions made to multidisciplinary theories and concepts of older adulthood, digital literacy, and information
infrastructure. Although each of these four areas—community informatics, older adulthood,
digital literacy, and information infrastructure—is discussed individually, the contributions this
dissertation makes span these and other areas. As such, across these four sub-sections I weave
together concepts and theories to illustrate the contributions this dissertation makes to theory
in general.
Community informatics. This dissertation shows that older adults adapt digital
technologies and technology support services to the diverse rhythms of their lives. This is an
important finding for the field of community informatics. Michael Gurstein (2012), the editor of
The Journal of Community Informatics, wrote in his introduction to a special issue of that journal
on older adults:
We found that the bulk of the papers received were focused on “Informatics” as applied
to the circumstance and condition of individual older persons in relation to the health
care system, rather than towards older persons in and with their communities. (p. 1)
This dissertation contributes to developing the community informatics of an aging society by
closely analyzing how older adults learn technology in their communities. I found that older
people are active agents in their communities. Most older adults do not need (or particularly
want) informatics solutions applied to them. Rather, they want support with technology in their
communities so that they can continue to contribute to those communities in old age.

201

A second contribution of this study to the field of community informatics is the concept
of the informatics lifecourse, which builds on the model of the informatics moment (Williams,
2012). The informatics moment has a double meaning, referring both to that moment when a
person seeks and gets help with technology and to the moment in society when we transition
from the industrial age to the information age. The informatics lifecourse extends the
informatics moment concept by illustrating that life in the information age consists of an
accumulation of informatics moments. Participation in the information society requires learning
new digital technologies as they emerge and become normalized parts of society.
The informatics lifecourse, like the informatics moment, also has a double meaning. At
one level, the informatics lifecourse refers to the learning of technology through the stages of
one’s life. At a more abstract level, the concept illustrates that the transition from the industrial
age to the information age is not a moment in time. The information revolution began in the
1960s, and continues today, with no clear end in sight. This revolution and its long duration can
be seen in the informatics lifecourse of individuals who have lived through it.
These lives are not lived alone. Rather, life is lived in communities. The informatics
lifecourse of an individual older adult is structured and shaped by the relative supportiveness of
community-based information infrastructure. This finding affirms community informatics
research that shows that local communities shape how their members use and learn to use
technology (Alkalimat & Williams, 2001; Clark, 2003; Postill, 2008).
Older adulthood. Older adulthood is not an absolute state of being. It is a relative one.
One grows old in particular social and cultural contexts. These contexts shape how old age is
experienced, as well as its boundaries (Cole, 1992; Gergen & Gergen, 2000; Giele & Elder, 1998;

202

Hutchison, 2014). This dissertation contributes to our understanding of the social shaping of
older adulthood by illustrating how this stage of life is shaped in local communities.
Older adults negotiate the boundaries of old age through their participation in
community-based information infrastructure. The institutions studied presume that older
adulthood begins at age 50. Many adults do not agree with this definition of old age, and delay
participation in senior centers until they are 60, or older. For many, older adulthood is less tied
to an absolute age, and more tied to lifecourse transitions, such as retirement, that are not tied
to a particular age. I found some individuals who had fully retired in their mid-50s; I found
others who continued to work full- or part-time jobs in their late 70s. Furthermore, increasingly
retirement is not the end of work. I found some older adults who had retired from one job, and
were looking for another. I also found other older adults who had retired, and who continue to
work through unpaid leadership positions in community organizations. In any case, this
lifecourse transition shapes the informatics lifecourse. Retirement was the most common
reason interviewees disengaged from technology for a period of time.
The incorporation of digital technology into community life also affects the social
shaping of older adulthood. As a result of the disruptions of the still-emergent information
society, older adults are recast by these institutions from community leaders to passive service
recipients who receive help with technology from individuals 30 to 70 years younger than them.
This structure reinforces ageist ideas about the capacity of older adults in the information
society. Through its practices and policies, community-based information infrastructure
contributes to shaping both how older adults see themselves and how society sees older
adulthood.

203

These findings suggest a different way to think about and to study older adulthood. In
library & information science, the dominant approach to the study of older adults has been to
think about older adults as a “user group,” that is, a group of users presumed to practice similar
types of information behavior. For instance, Asla and Williamson (2015) studied the information
behavior of information users in the fourth age, or those oldest individuals suffering from
disability. In contrast to this approach to studying old age, I instead show that it can be
productive to study older adults as active agents in their communities, and in their communitybased information infrastructure. Here the focus is on agency rather than on use. From the
vantage point of intergenerational communities, older adults do not consist of a collection of
information users. Rather, older adults are those occupying a stage in the lifecourse all members
of communities pass through, if life is not cut short. We are all either old or on our way to
becoming old.
Some scholars have started to use this lifecourse approach to study how literacy at one
stage of life relates to digital literacy at subsequent stages (Birkland, 2013; Bowen, 2011; Selfe &
Hawisher, 2004; Silvast, 2015; Silver, 2014). This dissertation contributes to this literature by
situating the informatics lifecourse of older adults within the local community. Understanding
older adulthood in the information age requires attending both to the informatics lifecourse of
the individual, and to the social shaping of that lifecourse in the communities where life is lived.
Digital literacy. This dissertation contributes to theories and concepts of digital literacy
in two ways. First, the findings from this dissertation counter trends in the literature: a) that
older adult digital literacy is reducible to declining minds and declining bodies, and b) that the
digital literacy of youth is synonymous with digital literacy in general. Second, through the
concept of the informatics lifecourse this dissertation contributes to our general theoretical

204

understanding of digital literacy. This concept suggests that digital literacy emerges across time.
To understand digital literacy requires attending to how it emerges through the diverse rhythms
of people’s lives.
a) Countering the idea that older adult digital literacy is reducible to declining minds and
bodies. The study of older adult digital literacy has been partially shaped by ageist assumptions
that older adulthood is synonymous with declining minds and declining bodies (Bowen, 2012a).
Studies from research groups such as MIT’s AgeLab learn about how older adults may use
technology by placing young students into immersive environments with artificial handicaps.
These projects are based on the assumption that if young people understand the disabilities
assumed to take place in old age they can design technological tools to help old people
compensate for their supposedly declining minds and bodies (Bowen, 2012b). This assumption
also appears in research literature premised on the idea that older adults will (or should)
naturally use technology primarily for medical purposes (Heart & Kalderon, 2013). In these
formulations, older adulthood is virtually synonymous with patient-hood.
This dissertation counters this conceptualization of old age by highlighting the active
agency of older adults. Older adults are creative and determined learners who, with support,
integrate technology into the diverse rhythms of their lives. Older adults also are active in their
communities, contributing to and shaping community-based information infrastructure.
b) Countering the idea that older adult digital literacy is a lesser form of digital literacy.
This dissertation also contributes to countering what Bowen calls the “age bias” in digital
literacy research (Bowen, 2011). Past work on digital literacy has assumed that how young
people use technology is how all people use or will use technology. This assumption sometimes
shapes the research literature on the digital literacy of older adults (e.g. Bloch & Bruce, 2011). In

205

this dissertation I counter this idea by showing the richness and diversity of digital learning and
literacy among older adults.
It is a truism that much can be learned from listening to one’s elders. Nonetheless, we
do not look to our elders to understand digital literacy. Many older adults have been using
technology for longer than many of the young people helping them have been alive.
Furthermore, even those who are just now starting to learn technology have lived through the
disruptions of the still-emergent information society. Through their experiences in this society,
older adults have much to teach us about what it means to be digitally literate. By learning with
and alongside older adults navigating this new society, we can create more inclusive
communities that work for us all.
The informatics lifecourse and digital literacy. At a more general level, the concept of
the informatics lifecourse coined in this dissertation contributes to developing theories of digital
literacy. How we use and learn to use technology over time is conditioned by the stages of our
lives, which are diverse, and differ from culture to culture. By studying digital literacy in the
informatics lifecourse we resist ideas that people in a given stage of life (e.g. youth) are
inherently more digitally literate than people at a different stage of life (e.g. retirement).
Furthermore, with this concept we can begin to explore how people in different stages of life
integrate technology into their lives. We can, in other words, begin to study how digital literacy
is shaped by the diverse and changing rhythms of our lives.
In past work on older adults learning technology, research has focused on what types of
environments best support learning. Some find that intergenerational environments are
supportive (e.g. Bailey & Ngwenyama, 2011). Others find that peer-to-peer environments are
supportive (e.g. Kanayama, 2003). This dissertation finds that this question is not an either/or

206

one. Rather it is a both/and question. Older adults seek and find multiple sources of technology
support in their communities. These communities include multiple generations. Older adults
sometimes find support among other older adults. At other times, older adults find support
from both younger and older generations.
Many theories of digital literacy are premised on the assumption that digital literacy and
learning are social and collaborative (Gee, 2010; Prior & Shipka, 2003; Twidale, 2005). This
dissertation contributes to these theories by showing that digital literacy extends beyond a
particular situation to encompass entire lifetimes lived in communities. The concept of the
informatics lifecourse encapsulates this finding.
Information infrastructure. Finally, this dissertation contributes to theories and models
of information infrastructure. This dissertation carried out what Bowker and Star (1999) call an
infrastructural inversion, which they describe as:
A struggle against the tendency of infrastructure to disappear …. It means learning to
look closely at technologies and arrangements that, by design and by habit, tend to fade
into the woodwork (p. 34)
In this infrastructural inversion of older adult digital literacy, I found that older adults actively
create and contribute to the technology support services they rely on in old age to begin and to
continue learning of technology through the stages of their lives.
These findings contribute to work already underway to study and to create a socially
just information infrastructure. In the opening article of a special issue on Infrastructure Studies
in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Edwards, Jackson, Bowker, and
Williams (2009) found that:
Questions of distribution, power, and justice need to be addressed urgently and
systematically by our field. How can claims on, through, and against infrastructure be
formulated, organized, and heard? What constitutes adequate representation or

207

participation in the process of infrastructural change and development? Under what
conditions can rival interests in infrastructure (large and small, modest and profound)
be acknowledged, addressed, and accommodated, in ways that enhance the legitimacy,
appropriateness, and long-term efficacy of infrastructural change? (p. 372)
In this excerpt, Edwards et al. (2009) asked, “What constitutes adequate representation or
participation in the process of infrastructural change and development?” (p. 372). I found that
answering this question requires making space in our theories to understand how information
“users” actively shape the information infrastructure upon which they rely.
Edwards et al. (2009) further ask questions about legitimacy and appropriateness in
information infrastructure. They ask, in other words, what constitutes an ethical and socially just
information infrastructure. This dissertation adds to these discussions by bringing a sharper
focus on social struggle in the shaping of information infrastructure. As it has developed up to
now, the concept of information infrastructure has been used to understand the work of
governance, science, and corporations. Past literature mentions in passing that social struggle
contributes to information infrastructure, but this insight has not led to social struggle becoming
central to our understanding of information infrastructure. For instance, in their work on
information infrastructure in museums, Star & Griesemer (1989) mention in passing that
marginalized populations, such as lower-income backwoodsmen, contribute to shaping the
museum (p. 396). In general, though, when the concept of information infrastructure is used to
study environments outside the workplace, focus has primarily gone to those in positions of
social power, and not to marginalized populations (Bowker & Star, 1999).
By closely analyzing how diverse older adults contribute to shaping their communitybased information infrastructure, this dissertation suggests a different way to think about
information infrastructure in general. Much is to be gained through research that considers

208

people in their daily lives as active agents in information infrastructure. Older adults do not
simply use services created for them. By seeking support on their own devices at public libraries
(even when librarians resist this trend), and by organizing to create and to sustain senior centers
in relation to the invisibility of older adulthood in public services, older adults actively shape
information infrastructure to meet their needs. These findings suggest that our
conceptualization of information infrastructure could better address issues of social justice by
theorizing information infrastructure as a product of social struggle.
Information infrastructure is an evolving theory. To this theory, this dissertation
contributes the idea that social struggle, which emerges out of structural inequalities in society,
shapes information infrastructure. This struggle takes place first at the level of the local
community, where daily life is lived.

D. Implications for future research
This dissertation opens many new directions for research on the community informatics
of an aging society. Two directions are discussed in this section. First, our understanding of aging
in the information society could be enriched by understanding the informatics lifecourse of
other individuals, at other stages of life, in other communities. A second direction opened by
this study is the analysis of other community-based information infrastructure, in other places.
Study the informatics lifecourse. Future research could study how technology learning
and literacy at one stage of life shapes technology learning and literacy at other stages. For
instance, future research could investigate in more depth how technology learning on the job
relates to technology learning in retirement in community-based information infrastructure.

209

Research could also investigate how technology learning among young people at school relates
to technology learning at later stages of life.
Such a research project could have intergenerational components. Aging societies
consist of multiple generations; it is becoming more and more routine to live into the 80s, 90s,
and even beyond. As a result, one may find as many as five generations of a given family coexisting in a particular community. One could study how the informatics lifecourse of one
generation in a particular local community differs from the informatics lifecourse of different
generations. This research could illustrate how and why different generations relate to different
computing paradigms in different ways over time.
In the library & information science and in the adult education literatures, the concept
of lifelong learning has recently become an important topic of investigation (Borg & Mayo, 2005;
De la Peña McCook & Barber, 2002). By studying the informatics lifecourse of diverse
populations, one could study learning as it takes place over time. As this study showed, digital
literacy and the informatics lifecourse are built on learning technology over time. One cannot be
digitally literate without practicing learning across the stages of life, since the digital
technologies taken to be normal in society have up to now been constantly changing. As such,
future research on lifelong learning could be built around the informatics lifecourse concept.
In addition to understanding technology learning, studies of the informatics lifecourse
could enrich our understanding of the information society in general. Theorists of the
information society like Manuel Castells (1989) base their analyses on the operations of
governments and the economy. Studying the informatics lifecourse in this way could amount to
a people’s history of the information society. Through the collective and comparative analysis of
the informatics lifecourse of diverse populations a new vision of the information society from

210

the bottom-up could emerge. Such a project could include an archival component. Oral histories
could document the informatics lifecourse of diverse populations. These recordings could add to
the archival record in an important way and illustrate that ordinary people through their digital
learning and literacy over time have actively shaped, and continue to shape the information
society.
Study other community-based information infrastructure. This study analyzed a year in
time in the complex, publicly funded institutions of senior centers and public libraries in a
particular city in the USA. I found through this study that public libraries and senior centers
indeed support the digital literacy of older adults. This support is not perfect, and more could be
done, but there is a solid base in these institutions upon which future work could be built.
Future research could extend this study by using similar methods to analyze how public libraries
and senior centers in other communities support the digital literacy both of older adults and of
individuals at other stages of life.
Not all older adults participate in senior centers and public libraries, and even fewer
participate in technology support services. This study focused on older adults already engaged in
technology support services in senior centers and in public libraries. Future research could
extend this research by continuing the tradition in library & information science research on
nonusers (Lange, 1988), or of individuals who do not participate in public libraries or in senior
centers. Do these individuals find other means of learning technology across time? Or are they
disengaged from technology? Why? Extending this dissertation by asking these and other
questions could enrich our understanding of to what extent and how community-based based
information infrastructure supports digital literacy.

211

Future research could also examine these publicly funded institutions in relation to
other sectors of community-based information infrastructure identified in this study. These
other sectors include families, local businesses, non-profits, and other educational institutions
like community colleges and universities. Furthermore, in addition to the place-based
information infrastructure that has existed in local communities for decades, new virtual
information infrastructure is also emerging because of the affordances of digital technologies. In
past research (Lenstra & Alkalimat, 2012a; Lenstra, 2014b) I found that social networking sites
like Facebook are becoming vital community-based information infrastructure for aging
populations. In future research, scholars could extend our understanding of the community
informatics of aging societies by attending both to physical and to virtual community-based
information infrastructure. How do these physical and cyber-spaces collectively compose the
information infrastructure that sustain local, intergenerational communities across time?

E. Implications for practice and teaching
This study adds to practical work already underway that seeks to:
•
•
•
•

Reframe older adults from passive service recipients to active agents;
Counter ageism;
Develop library services for aging communities; and
Develop embedded librarianship.

Furthermore, this study adds to curricular work already underway that seeks to:
•
•

Prepare students to integrate technology support into their lives and careers; and
Prepare students to lead our aging society.

212

Implications for practice
Reframe older adults from passive service recipients to active agents. In projects
around the USA older adults lead technology support services. The federally-funded Digital
Inclusion Initiative (Senior Service America, 2014), the Computer Club hosted by the Otsego
County (Michigan) Commission on Aging (Woodward et al., 2011), and the ShepNet Computer
Center for Seniors in Greensboro, North Carolina (ShepNet, 2016) all have older adults leading
programs for other older adults learning technology. These projects illustrate work underway to
reframe older adults from passive service recipients to active agents in their communities.
More work of this sort could be done in and around public libraries and senior centers.
Such practice could start with those organized older adults already deeply engaged in these
institutions, such as friends of the library groups and senior center groups, and then extend
outwards. By better utilizing the agency of older adults, these overpressured public institutions
may find they can do more with less money while simultaneously empowering older adults to
contribute to their communities.
This research found older adults have much to offer their communities. Some of these
skills could be used in technology support services. Other skills could be mobilized in other ways.
For instance, one regular at a senior center is a jazz guitarist who has performed regionally for
the last 60 years. His experience is an incredible asset that could be better utilized in his
community. Figuring out how to more fully support the agency of older adults could lead to a
more resilient community-based information infrastructure, and thus to more resilient
communities.
Counter ageism. In the 2000s Chicago Public Library started a “Not What You Think”
campaign to counter stereotypes of public libraries. One of the images released features an

213

older woman operating a turntable with the words “Not What You Think (Get Your Beats Where
Granny Gets Hers)” under it (Figure 7). Through humor, this campaign reminds us that both
public libraries and older adulthood are not what we think they are. They require revision from
the stereotypes we associate with them.

Figure 7: ‘Not What You Think’: Countering ageism at Chicago Public Library. Chicago Public Library,
2008.

One implication of this dissertation is that public libraries, senior centers, and other
institutions could do more to counter ageism. Ageism is deeply ingrained in community-based
information infrastructure, older adult digital literacy, and society more generally. Ageism
affects how we study older adulthood, and it also affects how older adults are framed in the
policies and practices of senior centers and public libraries.

214

At a practical level, ageism could be countered in multiple ways. First, public campaigns
and programs could bring attention to the diverse and changing experiences of growing old in
the USA and around the world. Second, public libraries could hold more dialogues about aging,
fostering intergenerational conversations about what it means to grow old. Intergenerational
programs of this sort have been found to counter ageism in communities (Peacock & Talley,
1984). The value of this type of work can be seen in the fact that the American Library
Association (2008) includes intergenerational programs as part of its recommended library
services for older adults. Third, continuing education could be organized to retrain the library
and senior center workforces to be sensitive to ageist attitudes that they may unthinkingly draw
on as they design and implement policies and services.
Develop library services for aging communities. Locally and nationally, some vanguard
institutions and individuals are reconfiguring libraries for aging communities (Rothstein & Schull,
2010; Schull, 2013). These efforts could be supported by more attention to this topic within the
American Library Association (ALA). Currently only one body within the ALA hierarchy discusses
issues related to aging and older adults. That group is the Library Services to an Aging Population
Committee, part of the Reference Services Section (RSS) of the Reference and User Services
Association (RUSA), which is in turn a division of ALA (American Library Association, 2015). In
other words, the only national body for librarians interested in discussing library services for
aging communities is a committee nested within a section, nested within a division. In contrast,
the national infrastructure for discussing and supporting library services for young people is very
robust. The American Library Association maintains two entire divisions focused on library
services for young people: The Association for Library Service to Children and the Young Adult
Library Services Association.

215

Public libraries, like other public educational institutions formed in the modern era, are
premised on a large number of young people and a small number of older people. As global
aging continues into the future, more work will be needed to reconfigure library services, and
public libraries more generally, for aging communities. Working within the American Library
Association to create a more robust space for discussing this topic could be one means of
developing this area.
At the local level, more work could also be done to develop partnerships and
collaborations between public libraries and other institutions that serve and are composed of
older adults. One implication of this dissertation is that more could be done to build networks
between senior centers and public libraries. In a time of declining public funding, we as a society
cannot afford to ignore the overlaps of our public institutions, which include public libraries and
senior centers, as well as schools and universities. Work to knit together senior centers and
public libraries, as Cimpoieru (2011) found already taking place in Romania, could lead to library
services that better support their aging communities.
Develop embedded librarianship. A final practical implication of this dissertation is that
more could be done to develop embedded librarianship. In the field of public librarianship, the
concept of embedded librarianship refers to integrating librarians into community organizations
based outside of the library (Long, Galston, Huber, & Johnson, 2012). This dissertation found
that public libraries and senior centers are already deeply rooted in the lives of many older
adults. Unfortunately, I also found that the staff of these institutions struggle to get beyond the
systems they are charged to administer. Much of their time is focused on managing and
providing access to library systems and to senior center programs. As a result, staff cannot easily
get outside of the buildings in which they work.

216

In the context of the multiple pressures associated with managing public institutions,
developing embedded librarianship is not a trivial matter. One means of developing this model
of librarianship is to empower older adults, and others in local communities, to take a more
active role in the libraries in which they participate. Currently, many older adults already
advocate for public libraries through their involvement in and leadership of friends of the library
groups. This energy could be mobilized to develop embedded librarianship by encouraging and
supporting these older adults to become official liaisons of the library in senior centers and in
other community organizations. Through these “citizen librarians,” the library could become
more embedded and rooted in the community it serves.
A second means of developing embedded librarianship suggested by this dissertation
could be to develop practices and policies that work to eliminate what Durrance (1983) criticizes
as the “anonymous professional-client encounter” (p. 278). I found that older adults through
their determination form and maintain relationships with individuals they find to be supportive
in public libraries and senior centers. Public libraries and senior centers could work to better
support these relationships through different policies than those that are currently in place.
These supportive relationships, if sustained across time, could contribute to reducing the
phenomenon of digital disengagement and could also contribute to the library and the senior
center becoming more embedded in the communities they serve.

Implications for teaching, and for educational institutions more generally
Prepare students to integrate technology support into their lives and careers. The
findings of this dissertation suggest that we as teachers need to better prepare our students to
integrate technology support into their professional and personal lives. I found public

217

institutions imposing bureaucratic limits to reduce the amount of time and forms in which they
help members of the public learning technology. I also found library & information science
students resisting the idea of supporting an older adult on a technology they themselves had
never used before.
One lesson to be learned from the informatics lifecourse of older adults is that digital
technology has changed continuously, and will most likely continue to change continuously into
the future. As a result, we all need to learn new technology across time to remain active citizens
in the information society. We could prepare our students both to practice and to teach this
learning of technology across time by immersing them in experiences where they are expected
to support diverse people learning diverse digital technologies, some of which they have never
used before.
This work is already emerging in courses on community informatics at the University of
Illinois (Williams, 2014), as well as in library & information science courses at other universities
(Roy, Bolfing, & Brzozowski, 2010), and in programs outside of library & information science
(Bowen et al., 2014). Through experiential learning assignments that place students as
technology volunteers in local libraries and in other community institutions, students learn what
it means to support the informatics lifecourse by supporting the informatics moments of daily
life. Students also learn how persistent and pervasive digital inequalities continue to be in our
society.
Preparing students to integrate technology support into their professional and personal
lives will also prepare our students to create a more inclusive information society. Students
could learn to do this work not only as part of their careers, but also as part of being a
responsible citizen in the information society. At the University of Illinois, undergraduate and

218

graduate students volunteer every Friday to help residents at a local retirement community
learn technology. This volunteer work helps students realize the challenges and benefits of
integrating technology support into their personal lives. In other words, this type of teaching
could and should be practiced in any environment.
Prepare students to lead our aging society. Students could also be better prepared to
lead our aging society. This work could be accomplished through curricular modules that inspire
students to interrogate ageist assumptions they may hold about older adults, and about aging
more generally. Students could undertake projects that have them working alongside older
adults in local communities. For instance, students learning about technology support in
libraries could work with older adults at a senior center to develop and foster a culture of
collaborative learning of digital technology across the two institutions.
Through projects like this one, students could learn to see older adults in their
communities as active agents, ready and capable of contributing to their communities. Older
adults need and want support with digital technology. They also want and need to support each
other, and other sectors of their local communities. Being a leader in an aging society involves
being able to recognize and mobilize this agency. Through projects that involve students
working and learning alongside older adults in their communities, students could learn to
become leaders in our aging society.

F. Conclusion
The information society is also an aging society. This means that as digital technology
becomes densely woven into the fabric of everyday life, the median age of humanity continues
to rise. The participation of older adults in the information society is often seen as dependent on

219

how they cope with their supposedly declining minds and declining bodies. In this study I
reframed this phenomenon by studying the digital literacy and learning of older adults in the
context of the communities where they live.
By studying older adults in their communities, I found that digital literacy unfolds across
time. Learning to read and write is, at a basic level, analogous to learning to ride a bike. One can
learn to read and write at a young age and be able to read and write throughout life, even if
long periods of life occur in which reading and writing does not take place. The same is not true
about digital literacy. Digital literacy requires learning new technologies and new technological
applications as they emerge and become integrated into social life. The stage of one’s life
shapes how this learning process takes place. How someone working full-time learns technology
is different from how a retired older person learns technology because their stages of life are
different. This dissertation introduced the concept of the informatics lifecourse to analytically
describe this phenomenon.
The informatics lifecourse is shaped by the relative supportiveness of community-based
information infrastructure. Older adults who are retired cannot count on technology support at
school or in their workplaces. When this infrastructure is not as supportive as it could be, older
adults sometimes disengage from technology. Older adults actively endeavor to change this
situation. Through their agency, older adults created senior centers, and they continue to
advocate for both senior centers and public libraries.
When older adults find support learning technology in community-based information
infrastructure they are able to contribute to their communities. Public libraries and senior
centers are overpressured, publicly funded institutions. By embracing the agency of older adults,
these institutions could reconfigure themselves for an information society that is also aging.

APPENDIX A. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD DOCUMENTATION

Oral consent script (waiver for written consent)

237

[Note: This script was used as a template for informal interactions with older adults at public
libraries and senior centers with whom I interacted during fieldwork, to ensure they were aware
of my presence as a researcher.]
Hello! My name is Noah Lenstra and I am a technology volunteer here at [name of site]. I am
also a PhD student in library & information science from the University of Illinois. While
volunteering here I also research how local institutions help people, such as you, with
technology. I particularly want to know how local institutions help older adults with technology.
With your permission I would like to write a few notes after this help session ends about how it
went. These notes would not include your name or any identifying information. If you don’t
want me to take any notes, or if you don’t want to participate in this research, that is totally
fine, I am still more than happy to help you with whatever you’d like to learn. If you have time
later today, or on another day convenient to you, I would also like to ask you a few questions
about your background and your experiences with technology. This interview is totally optional,
and in no way required for you to receive technology help today or in the future.

APPENDIX C. AN EXAMPLE OF HOW DATA WERE COLLECTED, CODED, AND SORTED
Data recorded in response to fieldnote Prompt #5 “What happened during fieldwork? Write a chronological narrative in as much detail
as possible from moment arrived at site to moment left site.”
Note: Inductive codes developed from close reading of fieldnotes appear in bubbles next to relevant text. The codes that emerged from
the inductive analysis of this and other fieldnotes and interview transcripts were synthesized by assembling and sorting the codes using
Excel. For instance, codes on “troubleshooting strategies” and “note-taking strategies” were synthesized into the more general concept
of “learning techniques.”
… I talked with Gloria from 12:30-12:40
we talked about how much time older adults need. She said that in the past Computers 101 limited older adults to half-hour blocks, and
only one at a time
Gloria said sometimes ppl want other times beyond those scheduled, but it was difficult for the staff to be
available whenever older adults wanted help. kept things to the schedule. only certain times for help. she said
something about it is hard for seniors to stay on schedule - that they want to do things on their time, not on
anybody elses, but the senior center keeps a tight schedule to maintain order
she said she wasn’t sure how the 1/2 hour blocks came to be the norm for the Computers 101 program - she
agreed that hour makes more sense
she said ppl usually sign up for the computer class at the weekly potluck, and that next wednesday is a senior center trip (july 22) so
probably no one will come
....
Monty [a pseudonym] signed up for 1-1:30 today according to sign-up sheet [he ended up staying until 2]
[director] said probably no one would want to stay in the comptuer area after 2 because they have some
kind of event at the senior center
Monty came in right around 1 - while talking with [director] about the process and giving her his phone
number, he revealed that he also has a residence in kansas city - he lives part there and part here - he told me
he retired from honeywell and used their internal computers, but because of security couldn’t access internet
- he said he had used windows 98 for a while, and has a windows xp desktop, and got this windows 7 laptop
a few years ago, but had only used a few times - he said he signed up for geek squad but they said they could only give him 10 minutes of
help at a time, which was far less than he needed

245

he had a lot of questions and i found that he approaches the laptop as a total novice would - he didn’t know
how to get online or on wifi, or what these terms really meant, he didn’t know what start button/windows
orb did, didn’t know how to open or use internet explorer. On the other hand he did have a bit of computer
vocab - recognized the taskbar at the top of IE as a taskbar. He knows some digital terminology, but appears
to be totally lost with this operating system. he said since he bought the windows 7 laptop he had used it at
most a handful of times. he said he got disoriented and tried getting help from the geek squad, but it wasn't enough, so he just put it
away in a closet. when he found out about help at the senior center he decided to try it out.
he was also struggling with the touchpad on his laptop - it was hard for him to figure out - he thought his
screen was a touchscreen - a few times he tried touching the screen - he took notes for everything and
frequently used pictures to help him remember - for almost everything i had him actually do the steps - he did
not have projects he wanted to work on. he said he just wanted to figure out this laptop. i first i had him
connect to the wifi - starting with clicking on “connections” staircase box, then put in the password (he typed it
in wrong the first time so i did it for them) then i showed him how to open up internet explorer - he wanted to switch homepages from
msn to aol so i walked him through that and had him do that - then i helped him log in to his aol email - which
he had had since 2007 but he said he had not checked in years - there were almost 6000 unread messages,
mostly mass marketing from different companies - i was going to show him how to select all to delte without
doing individually - but after doing some poking i couldn’t find a way to limit the preview to, say, 20-100
messages - it was literallly selecting all 5728 messages... so i told him he could select all and then unselect
messages he wanted to keep - he said he would try doing it at home
in general he expressed feeling overwhelmed multiple times - but he had enough computer background to not be totally helpless... but
not enough to feel confident or capable
he also complained that when he got into the windows help program it was too small to read, and that the laptop didnt come with
instruction manual - i showed him how to get into windows help and i also showed him how to open up
control panel to change windows default font size
we also did quite a bit of introduction to the start menu - he also wanted to know best way to shut down
computer so we went over that - he was confused about difference between (start->shut down and just
pressing the power button).

246

...
at one point he said he wanted to know what EVERYTHING on internet explorer symbolize, every button and
every option on the drop-down menus. we then talked for a bit about needing to see selectively online tune out ads, tune out unrelevant things, to just focus on what he wanted to do, didn’t need to know what
EVERYTHING did to be able to successfully use computer... but that left him feeling a bit anxious and
disoriented
he said he would be back next week [Note: In fact, Monty did come back next week.] - i asked him how he heard about the class and he
said he had called around to try to find something like it (he was not a member of park district seniors or either senior center - but
sounded like may become a member to take advantage of classes) - before we started he emphasized that he needed someone to be
patient with him as he is learning
... around 1:30 connie [a pseudonym] came in. [she had been here twice before, so we said hi and then she
started telling me about what she was working on. connie had a computer for a while but it was broken and
she sent it to her son in georgia who said motherboard was fried - so she decided she could just do what she
wanted on tablet, but was overwhelmed by the # of emails she had] she wanted to use the lab computer at
the senior center because it seemed easier for her to go through her emails on the lab computer as opposed to
on her tablet (which she was just starting to learn). - it appeared to be signed up for a few lists that were daily
bombarding her - first i helped log her in - this was a challenge b/c although she said she knew her email
address and password it wasn’t working - she and monty than chatted for a while about the difficulties of
passwords - she tried a few times logging in - finally connie realized the problem was that she wasn’t entering
right email address - sbcglobal was her primary address - she was entering a different email address (att).
with this shift email worked fine - she said she hadn’t logged in in 3 months, but she seemed pretty adept - she
said she used computers/emails while working but now that she was retired and her friends were in their 70s,
80s and 90s, no one used email so there wasn’t a need anymore... almost her whole inbox seemed to be junk
mail - we spent most of the next 30 minutes deleting all her emails (while she scrolled down - she could do this
mostly on her own). she was capable on a desktop and worked independently after i helped her get into her
email - i also showed her how to unsusbscribe from the messages - i showed her once - she tried it once with my support and then she
unsubscribed from others by her own - she was pretty saavy with email and using internet explorer - she also had a handwritten piece of
paper in her purse with her log in information on it.
