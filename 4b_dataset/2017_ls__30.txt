ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Liquid Labor, Precarious Lives: An Urban Ethnography of Online Work and Digital
Inequality
By JESSICA KATHLEEN CROWELL
Dissertation Director:
Dr. Todd Wolfson

The primary purpose of this ethnographic study is to better understand the
economic lives of participants in Philadelphia’s KEYSPOT project, a network of digital
access and skills programs funded by the federal Broadband Technology Opportunities
Program (BTOP). Created as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
(ARRA) or “stimulus package,” the BTOP initiative intended to respond to the Great
Recession of 2008 by supporting and expanding U.S. broadband infrastructure,
particularly in distressed urban and rural communities. Implicit in this primary goal was
the understanding that technological development stimulates job sector growth and can
mitigate unemployment and underemployment. Yet, what job opportunities were
available to the poor and working class urban Americans targeted through these
technology programs? How did computer access and digital training practically shape
their economic lives?
In this dissertation, I argue that there is a disconnect between the policymakers
designing broadband programs and the “policytakers” to whom the programs are
targeted. Borrowing from Mosco (2004), this disconnect is due in part to the “digital

ii

myth” that suggests technology is a cheap, efficient and individual-targeted solution to
complex problems such as urban poverty. And whereas these programs endeavored to
connect low-income Philadelphians to jobs through a focus on imparting digital access
and skills, the types of formal sector jobs available to KEYSPOT job-seekers were parttime, low-skilled, low-wage and did not provide needed benefits like health insurance.
Notably, these positions were particularly inflexible for working parents and located in
fields like carework, domestic work or the service industries.
Given these formidable impediments to locating good jobs in the formal sector
outlined above, some struggling parents with digital skills instead pursued flexible, low
financial risk opportunities in the informal sector (Bauman, 2000). These informal digital
labor activities ranged from offering specific services such as modeling or caricature
drawing, to promoting handmade goods or digital goods online. In some cases, urban
street economies are merging with digital economies in unique and unanticipated ways.
Yet, while some might celebrate these new forms as “entrepreneurial,” I demonstrate that
this work is a type of highly precarious, highly exploited digital labor that did not
translate to increased economic stability or security. And KEYSPOT participants in both
the formal and informal sectors largely continued to rely on social programs because they
could not make ends meet.
I suggest that that the rise and frequency of these flexible, informalized
arrangements more broadly signals a changing relationship between capital and labor in
urban economies. I argue that the extant research in the digital labor field has overlooked
the ways in which online tools are utilized by the working class and likewise that the
dominant digital divide literature has been inattentive to the ways technology practically

iii

impacts the economic lives of the urban poor. Thus, rather than “digital labor” or
“immaterial labor,” I propose “liquid labor” as a framework for understanding the
emergence of these new highly precarious, mutable and flexible online practices. I
suggest that this space marks a new terrain of struggle in the fight for technological
development and, more importantly, economic equality and opportunity in low-income
urban communities struggling in the wake of neoliberal policies of retrenchment.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
It has been said that it “takes a village to raise a child” and it also takes a village
to support a doctoral dissertation. First, my deepest appreciation goes out to all my
participants in Philadelphia and everyone I worked with through the Freedom Rings
Partnership. When I felt deeply overwhelmed and that I couldn’t possibly write another
sentence, I thought of the Philadelphia coalition and their commitment to social justice
and to the “telling of untold stories.” I hope that I have told such stories in a way that can
inform others but – above all – inform change in local communities and national
technology policies. This is not a struggle that ends with this project.
I would like to thank my committee, Todd Wolfson, Philip Napoli, Jorge
Schement and Michelle Rodino-Colocino for their constant support and for making me a
better scholar. My adviser, Todd, brought me onto this project in only my second year as
a PhD student in 2011 and taught me everything I know about ethnography and about
being an engaged scholar and activist. My committee member, Phil, strengthened this
project and gave me my “first academic break” when he hired me as a graduate assistant
at the Donald McGannon Communication Research Center at Fordham University during
my master’s study in 2007. I was fortunate to arrive in the School of Communication and
Information (SC&I) PhD program during Jorge’s tenure as Dean; despite his busy
schedule, he always took time to mentor students like me. When Todd and I had our first
meeting about this as a potential dissertation in 2014, he asked me to go home and
research the outside member who could best guide this project. I was thrilled when that
scholar, Michelle, agreed to come onboard – I cannot imagine this project without her
expertise.

v

SC&I truly had the most caring group of PhD students one could ever ask for. My
special appreciation goes to Charles File, who had a front row seat to the highs and lows
of this project. My fellow Media Studies cohort member, Debra Glassco, became a fast
friend and a sounding board at every step in the process. Katie McCollough was generous
with her dissertation feedback and spent many hours coaching me through the final few
months. When Camille Reyes began her tenure as a PhD student in 2011, I served as her
“peer mentor” –yet, by the time I was finished, the roles were quite reversed. I also want
to thank some other program friends: Alexa Bolanos, Maggie Boyraz, Frank Bridges,
Jonathan Bullinger, Robyn Caplan, Danielle Catona, Josie Cudjoe, Ian Dunham, Jack
Harris, Muge Haseki, Marie Haverfield, Katie Kang, Emily Knox, Sean Leavey, Vyshali
Manivannan, Steph Mikitish, Rannie Teodoro, Andrew Salvati, Jacob Sanchez, Fredrika
Thelandersson and Aaron Trammell. I would also like to acknowledge Steven Miller,
Annie Gilbert and Khadijah White for making me a better instructor throughout these
years. I am appreciative that the Eagleton Institute of Politics gave me the opportunity to
serve as a Martin Fellow in 2014 – 2015.
Many family members and friends helped me during the PhD process and beyond.
My best friends (Elizabeth Ayerle and Pia Varma) and cousins (Chessa Budai and
Amanda Crowell) endured my PhD neurosis day and night, with constant love and wit.
At critical times, my sister and brother-in-law, Emily Crowell and Jiby Philip,
encouraged me to shed my writing uniform of sweatpants and t-shirts and go out into the
world for a little while. In the last year of writing this dissertation, I lost my dear
grandmother – “Gigi” –I will miss her. Finally, my deepest gratitude to my mother and
father, Nancy and Jim Crowell, for their love and constant support.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Meet Joanne and Mr. Wilson
On my first day of ethnographic fieldwork, I met Joanne and Mr. Wilson –two
“regulars” at an open access computer lab (“KEYSPOT”) located in a faith-based
community center in North Philadelphia. The computer lab assistant, Camille, termed
Joanne and Mr. Wilson “regulars” because each visited the lab several times a week,
typically on a predictable schedule. Mr. Wilson and Joanne both lived nearby and
therefore usually walked to the lab in the mornings. Joanne brought her son, Jaleel, while
Mr. Wilson came alone. I continued to see Joanne and Mr. Wilson regularly throughout
the next two years I spent studying the city’s KEYSPOTs, a network of digital access and
skills programs funded by the federal Broadband Technology Opportunities Program
(BTOP).
To return to my participants, Joanne is a 34-year-old African American woman
and because she did not have access to affordable childcare, I spent many days helping
Camille entertain Jaleel so that his mother could work in the lab. On a typical day, I
would read Jaleel stories or aid Camille in finding new videos of early locomotives on
YouTube for him to watch (his favorite). While Joanne did use some of the lab’s
resources – like printing and internet access – she owned a laptop and brought it with her
to the lab. In fact, Joanne had digital skills and experience with software like Microsoft
Word and Illustrator, knowledge of webpage creation, fluency in social media, and some
experience in graphic design.

2
When I asked Joanne why she visited the lab so regularly, remarkably, I learned
that she visited the lab to manage several informal endeavors that earned her a small
income. First, Joanne explained that she wrote digital books, which she sold on
Amazon.com and marketed on both social media and targeted online message boards.
Second, using the free color printing resources available to her at the KEYSPOT, Joanne
created political buttons that she sold on the street. She was also starting a handmade
jewelry business and used social media resources to promote her products. In Joanne’s
words, engaging in these informal ventures allowed her to be “more flexible,” giving her
more time to spend with Jaleel. Though she did not have the resources necessary to
establish a formal business, with her informal model, she kept financial risks to a
minimum and her need for capital was low (Bauman, 2000). However, Joanne admitted
that, unfortunately, she did not earn enough from any of these endeavors to survive, and
thus frequently scanned for other opportunities in both the formal and informal sectors.
In contrast to Joanne, Mr. Wilson, a tall, slim African American man in his midseventies, visited the KEYSPOT primarily for conversation. He rarely used the
computers and expressed no interest in taking the digital courses offered. About four
months into the project, I finally thought to question Mr. Wilson on his reluctance to use
the computers. He grimaced and responded flatly, “Everything is turning into
computers.” When I asked him why he found that so disconcerting, I half-expected Mr.
Wilson to reply that it was either diminishing face to face interaction, too expensive, or
too complicated to use and understand. Perhaps Mr. Wilson did not appreciate the
benefits the Internet could provide?

3
Strikingly, Mr. Wilson explained that for most of his life, he worked at a local
bowling alley in the community. His job responsibilities included moving bowling pins
into place and helping customers keep track of their bowling score. It was a “good job”
because he got to make friends, learned about bowling, and played for free occasionally
at nights or on weekends after the alley closed. He became a proficient bowler and later
joined a league with friends –their balls were inscribed with their names and they carried
them in “fancy” bags with zippers. However, in the late 1980’s the bowling alley became
mechanized; machines moved the pins into place and computers kept the scores. Mr.
Wilson lost his job. When I asked what type of work he did next, Mr. Wilson shrugged
and turned away – “Nah, don’t matter.”
Most broadly, Joanne and Mr. Wilson’s experience in the KEYSPOT program in
Philadelphia offers a window onto the ways in which policy, poverty, and digital
technology intersect on the ground. More specifically, these experiences reveal how
structural impediments to formal work, a growing digital workforce divide, and declining
social support in the wake of the urban crisis may generate a new set of digital work
practices for poor Philadelphians. Further, their stories reveal the complex economic,
social and cultural factors that can shape participant attitudes and interactions with
technology. Although at first glance Joanne and Mr. Wilson’s stories may appear unique
and highly contradictory, I will argue in this dissertation that both their experiences are a
consequence –and reflection –of a broader restructuring of the relations between capital
and labor in the contemporary information economy.

4
Stakes of the Project
Informed by an ethnographic study of participants like Joanne and Mr. Wilson,
this project explores the economic lives of poor and working-class families in the modern
informational city, as seen through the lens of the Broadband Technology Opportunities
Program (BTOP). To elaborate on BTOP, the program was created as part of the 2009
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the “stimulus
package,” that intended to respond to the Great Recession of 2008. The first objective of
the ARRA was as stated, “to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery”
(American Recovery, 2009, p. 123). Implicit in this primary goal is the understanding
that technological development stimulates job sector growth and can mitigate
unemployment. Yet, what job opportunities were available to poor and working-class
Americans assisted through the technology programs, like Joanne or Mr. Wilson? Why
are these new forms of digital labor – such as creating e-books and selling buttons on the
street –emerging in the context of a federally funded jobs skills and job training program?
Furthermore, why would a participant cite job loss as a reason not to adopt broadband?
Or more concretely: how can we better understand Joanne’s reliance on the informal
digital economy or Mr. Wilson’s attitudes on the role of technology in his economic life?
To expand on Joanne’s experience and economic life, while BTOP funded
training programs and computing centers like KEYSPOTs have focused on the role of
digital technology in stimulating job growth, many participants utilized digital resources
to create opportunities outside the formal economy. These activities ranged from offering
specific services such as modeling or caricature drawing, to promoting handmade goods
or digital goods online. In some cases, street economies are merging with digital

5
economies in unique and unanticipated ways. Participants used social media resources
such as Twitter or Facebook to promote a variety of individual services or products.
Notably, poor and working-class participants like Joanne explained that they are
attempting to achieve greater economic flexibility in what they perceived as a tenuous job
market by drawing income from multiple sources. However, unlike traditional
entrepreneurs who celebrate risk, liquid laborers like Joanne attempted to mitigate
financial risk (Nelson, 2012). Though many participants utilized these informal economic
opportunities only as supplemental income, some participants had given up on the formal
sector altogether, and relied only on informal economic opportunities to support
themselves. Others engaged in what informal economy scholars like Devey, Skinner and
Volodia (2006) have termed “churn,” or circulating between the formal and informal
sectors.
I will argue in this study that in a global information economy marked by the
breakdown of durable institutions like the welfare state, participants like Joanne must
increasingly navigate these informal sources to make ends meet. In short, in the wake of
retrenchment and the urban crisis in Philadelphia, the informal economy is offering poor
families a source of supplemental income many once received through welfare and social
programs. Thus, the informal economy should be viewed critically and seen as connected
to –and a consequence of – broader patterns of governmental and labor restructuring. I
would underscore that these informal practices are also shaped by childcare needs. To
explain further, the kind of formal opportunities available to KEYSPOT job seekers were
more likely to be low-status, low-paying and part-time positions located in fields like
carework, domestic work or the service industries. These positions did not offer a living

6
wage and were also the least flexible for parents, providing no benefits like healthcare
and requiring undesirable or nighttime working hours. Thus, low-income parents like
Joanne were seeking out new opportunities online. Whereas these flexible work options
and new digital activities could be viewed as expanding possibilities for low-income
Philadelphians, I will argue in this project that these practices should be understood as
operating within a larger set of urban survival strategies. Furthermore– alongside critical
immaterial labor scholars like Andrejevic (2008), Dyer Witheford (1999), Fuchs (2010,
2012, 2014) and Jarrett (2014, 2015)– I will demonstrate how their digital labor is
uniquely exploited in the non-wage digital economy.
To return to Mr. Wilson’s economic life and experiences, while many digital
divide scholars and federal policymakers have focused on digital “access” or “skills” as a
path to economic opportunity for low-income Americans, I will insist that Mr. Wilson’s
life story also reveals some basic complexities – and dangerous assumptions – that have
clouded our ability to analyze how technology fits into the everyday lives of poor and
working-class Americans. To explain my point, as our society has entered into a new
political phase in which government programs are increasingly shaped by the discourses
of personal responsibility (Bauman, 2000; Harvey, 2005), we as a nation have been
prompted to seek out cost-efficient and individual-targeted solutions to complex social
problems like urban poverty and inequality. Embracing the “myth of the digital sublime”
as Mosco (2004) conceptualizes it, we have often turned to ICTs (information
communication technologies) and private technology sector partnerships to attempt to
solve these challenges. In other words, digital technology is widely seen almost as a
magical toolbox we can deliver to an individual so that she or he can, alone, dig out of

7
poverty. I am not implying that broadband access and training programs have no utility or
social benefit but, instead, I insist that a failure to appreciate the on-the-ground economic
realities facing urban Americans like Joanne or Mr. Wilson has resulted in a problematic
disconnect between policy visions and program practices. Here in this study, I term this
as a gap occurring between the policymakers and the “policytakers,” or the populations to
whom broadband programs are targeted.
In this way, developing a more nuanced understanding of the economic lives of
BTOP participant and correspondingly their economic motivations for broadband
adoption is integral to a study of the digital divide, as it reflects the personal and varied
relationships program participants have with technology. So, whereas some low-income
Americans are unable to utilize technology based on a lack of “access” or “skills” –as
policymakers and many scholars assume –some like Joanne possessed advanced
technological skills yet structural barriers like lack of childcare have constrained
economic opportunity for her. In contrast, Mr. Wilson actively chose to reject technology
because of his personal life experiences. But more importantly, Mr. Wilson saw
technological advancements like computerization as directly responsible for the loss of a
job he found fulfilling. Although the usage of the informal digital economy or job loss
due to computerization and automation may seem trivial or confined to the fringe, I argue
that they are deeply interconnected and central to an analysis of the contemporary
information economy. To explain, the exploitative nature of the new economy may create
the conditions under which these new informal economic survival strategies have become
a necessity for the poor. In other words, because the types of good jobs available to urban
workers like Mr. Wilson in the previous generation have diminished or evaporated, now

8
contemporary urban workers like Joanne must cobble together part-time or informal
opportunities to support their families. I therefore suggest that “liquid labor” is poised to
become a potentially significant feature of the new urban economy among low-income
communities. Said differently, in this project I assert that the emergence of these informal
digital “liquid labor” practices should be understood, instead, as resulting from a
restructuring of relations between capital and labor. While this is an argument other
scholars I have made, digital labor as it relates to the working class has been hitherto
understudied and undertheorized. In this way, this project presents “liquid labor” as a
possible framework for understanding the changing relationship between work, class,
technology, poverty and policy in the modern informational city.
In order to provide appropriate context for this dissertation, first I will expand on
this concept of “liquid labor,” providing a frame for the larger study. Second, I will
sketch out the research questions guiding this project. Third, I will explain why
Philadelphia is a useful location for a study of these new digital work practices and
review my fieldsites. Fourth, I will discuss ethnography as a methodology, touching on
issues of rapport, researcher stance, subjectivity and the data collection procedures.
Finally, I will provide some key terms and offer an outline of the dissertation chapters.
Offering a New Framework: Liquid Labor
As discussed, the primary purpose of this study is to better understand the
economic lives of participants in the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program
(BTOP) in Philadelphia and how “liquid labor” strategies were utilized by participants
like Joanne. However, I also propose “liquid labor” as a framework for understanding the
transitioning relationships between work, class, technology and inequality. To elaborate,

9
when one considers the shift between how work was defined in the previous industrial
economic period (formal, waged, unionized) and the work in the modern information
economy (flexible, unwaged, self-directed), I suggest that the emergence of informal
digital strategies – especially among the working urban poor in advanced economies –
becomes more predictable (Sennett, 1998). So, why “liquid” labor? Drawing on Bauman
(2000) who insists that the modern era is characterized by the dissolution of social
support institutions and the rise of precarious living, I assert that these flexible, lowfinancial risk online work practices should be understood as a type of super precarious,
highly exploited labor. While I agree with scholars like Beck (2000) and Deuze (2006)
that “risk” is a defining feature of liquid life, I suggest that “liquid laborers” assume the
most risk, circulate in the most precarious survival circuits (Sassen, 2003), and contend
with the greatest life uncertainties. Moreover, I advocate for a materialist consideration of
risk in the context of digital work. For instance, whereas risk is celebrated as an
entrepreneurial value among the high-tech elite (Neff, 2012; Rumberger & Levin, 1985),
the poor and working class occupy a very different position in the economy and are thus
bound by a different decision matrix when it comes to risk. Said differently, the ability to
take risks in the new economy should be understood as ultimately yoked to an
individual’s economic or social resources.
Beyond Bauman’s framework, I have also selected “liquid labor” as a more
appropriate term than “immaterial labor” (Hardt & Negri, 2001, 2005, 2009; Lazzarato,
1996) or “affective labor” (Fortunati, 2011; Jarrett, 2014, 2015; Ouelette & Wilson,
2011) to describe this emergence and usage of the informal digital economy by poor and
working-class participants for a few other key reasons. First, borrowed from the language

10
of economics, “liquid” assets are those that can be easily converted to cash. Poor and
working-class participants like Joanne utilized the informal digital economy as it
provided a quick means to supplement income streams, often with unregulated or untaxed
cash transactions. These strategies were pursued so that individuals could maintain the
utmost flexibility and limit financial risk (Beck, 2000).
Second, liquid labor can illustrate how the so-called “immaterial” labor market
can also have material components in the informal digital economy. For instance, digital
goods created by KEYSPOT participants could circulate online and later change form
and enter the streets of Philadelphia as material goods. For example, a participant I
introduce later, Ron, utilized digital platforms to promote material goods whereas a
participant, Sky, used a similar platform to promote informal services. Joanne and
another participant, Deric, even utilized digital tools to create digital goods that they sold
online and never converted to a material form. Said differently, I suggest that as labor
takes on new arrangements along class lines, the divisions between material/immaterial
labor begin to dissolve.
Third, as Bauman (2000) and Castells (1989) argue, the expansion of digital
information technologies has allowed capital more freedom to move and flow. In other
words, in the contemporary information economy, fluid capital can flee union backed
workers in developed economies like the U.S. and easily seek new pools of unprotected
global workers. Drawing on Rodino-Colocino’s (2006) framework, this flight from
protected workers in advanced industrial nations has engendered a digital workforce
divide. In sum, while a small core of elite tech workers reap the rewards of the new
digital economy, they are increasingly supported by a sprawling network of precarious –

11
and exploitable – low-skilled and even high-skilled laborers (Rumberger & Levin, 1985).
I will expand on this last point in Chapter 3 as well.
Lastly, liquid is also a term that also resonates with Devey et al.’s (2006) concept
of “churn,” or the process whereby precarious workers enter and exit the formal and
informal labor markets. In other words, poor and working-class job seekers float in and
out of available opportunities, in both the formal and informal sector, yet never gain
stable economic footing. As Edin and Lein (1997) explain, in many poor and working
class urban communities, there is no longer a career “ladder” where workers can move
towards better wages over time (p. 131). Instead, the current economy functions for this
group more as a “carousel” in which jobs may change, but economic conditions do not
substantially improve (Edin & Lein, 1997, p.131). In short, the term “liquid” is able to
capture this process of churn impacting workers like Joanne.
Thus, in this dissertation drawing on Bauman’s (2000) concept of “liquid
modernity,’ I would propose the rise of informal digital labor – or liquid labor –as a
major framework for understanding the complex issues surrounding the information
economy in advanced capitalism. A Marxist feminist lens also helps explain the
emergence of these practices, as it emphasizes on how the necessity of reproductive labor
has generated new working arrangements across racial, gender and class lines. To
elaborate, KEYSPOT participants like Joanne were motivated to pursue flexible “liquid
labor” in large part due to their childcare responsibilities. As I referenced earlier and will
address in depth in Chapter 6, the types of formal sector opportunities available to
participants like Joanne were in the sectors that were the least conducive to parenting.
Mosco’s (2004) frame of “digital myths” helps to critically evaluate the workforce

12
discourses underpinning BTOP, in order to better understand the gap between digital
workforce policies and these on-the-ground online work practices. Building on this, this
project has four research questions that concern the economic lives of BTOP participants,
balancing the considerations of actual work practices with workforce policy.
Research Questions
Following from this, my research questions are defined thus:
R1: How is “work” – as it relates to poor and working-class Americans – discussed in
BTOP materials (e.g. policy documents, internal statements, press releases, web
materials)? More specifically, how are the “goals” of digital labor presented and
developed?
R2: For poor and working class urban Philadelphians, especially parents, what (if any)
impediments exist to finding formal work in the modern informational city? In what
fields and sectors are participants searching for and gaining jobs?
R3: Are there disconnects between how “work” is defined and what work is obtained,
particularly by urban parents? What “invisible work” or informal work exists and
how is it connected to digital technology in the contemporary information
economy?
R4: More broadly, how can we better understand – or contextualize –the economic lives
of BTOP participants, especially the relationship between informal work and the
contemporary information economy in advanced capitalism?
My Contribution
Having discussed my framework and research questions, where do I position this
project within existing scholarship? This study contributes to the literature on digital

13
labor and digital inequality within the field of critical media studies. To elaborate, first I
will argue in this project that bringing the extant digital inequality and digital workforce
divide literature into conversation with the dominant media studies literature on
immaterial and affective labor can offer a new critical vantage point to conceptualize
digital work practices. For example, I suggest that for poor and working-class parents like
Joanne, reliance on the digital economy as a survival strategy in a turbulent market is a
different type of interaction than, for example, middle and upper-class users generating
“immaterial labor” for online games or social media. Said differently, studies
investigating how middle-class users create economic value (for companies) or are
exploited through games, Facebook, or Twitter analyze different kinds of immaterial
labor. I locate a different type of interaction that is shaped by access to ICTs but also
social and class position. That said, it is important to note that in embracing the term
“liquid,” I do not mean to suggest that “immaterial labor” and “affective labor” are terms
without resonance or relevance. I only point out that these terms are insufficient to
describe the ways class and poverty can shape digital labor practices.
Second, I intend to contribute to the critical digital inequality literature,
complicating the “access” and “skills” policy focus. I hope to reveal the “digital myths”
(Mosco, 2004) embedded in policy more broadly, but also underscore that these programs
can unintentionally frame broadband as a means to further retrench the welfare state. The
access/skills concentration can also overlook the structural issues (like lack of childcare
access) that constrain economic opportunity. It likewise fails to consider the part ICTs
have played in diminishing opportunities for poor and working-class laborers like Mr.
Wilson in advanced economies. I also assert that these policies have focused on

14
dimensions of “prosperity” rather than how technology impacts political “participation”
(Schement, 2009). Finally, I hope to provide an on-the-ground view of the ways in which
the goals of digital labor are built through federal visions, refined by the local partners,
guided by the private sector, complicated by marketing efforts and revised by digital
trainers and BTOP participants. More broadly, I intend to offer insight into the economic
lives of BTOP program participants.
Third, I propose that the framework of “liquid labor” charts the rise of precarious
work in the contemporary information economy more widely. Said differently, this term
captures the changing shape of the urban economy and specifically how digital
economies are interacting with informal and street economies. It likewise refers to how
the breakdown of social support institutions has destabilized the working class who,
without jobs or security, must become “flexible” (Bauman, 2000) and float in and out of
the formal and informal economies. To better map my intended contribution in the field,
however, I will review the range of perspectives and scholarly debates in the fields of
digital labor, digital inequality, the digital workforce divide, and informal work in
Chapter 3. However, now I will introduce my research site and explain why it provides
an appropriate environment to capture these emerging digital labor practices.
Research Site
Why Philadelphia?
Philadelphia – and specifically the KEYSPOT open access computer centers and
digital skills training courses funded through BTOP – provided a rich research site for a
study of digital “liquid labor” practices a few key reasons. First, Philadelphia has the
highest rate of poverty and deep poverty of the top ten U.S. cities at 28.4% and 12.9%

15
respectively (Pew, 2012). In 2012 at the time of data collection, approximately 11.5% of
Philadelphians were unemployed –and when estimates are adjusted to include the total
number of unemployed persons who have actively stopped seeking jobs – the city rate
jumps to 20% (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). While this is an introduction to the
economic issues framing this study, I will address these factors in greater depth as well in
Chapter 5 on Philadelphia and the urban crisis.
Second, the KEYSPOT project specifically targeted populations living at the
economic margins, both by embedding the computer lab sites in the city’s existing social
service infrastructure and through direct marketing efforts to reach these communities
(Wolfson & Crowell, 2013). Given the location of KEYSPOTs, it was easy for me to
access social programs serving poor and working-class families. Coupled with the fact
that these programs were targeted towards job seekers, the number and diversity of
potential participants seeking formal (or informal) work was significant. This diversity
allowed me to better understand the impediments to finding work facing marginalized
communities throughout the city and the economic lives of programs participants.
Third, the pervasive issues of poverty and inequality in the city intersect with
ongoing struggles around ICTs and information access. For example, a 2010 Knight
Foundation commissioned study on Internet use at the time of the grant determined that
41% of Philadelphians were without home Internet Access (Knight, 2010). More recent
research reports such as a 2013 study conducted by the Pew Charitable Trusts
Philadelphia Research Initiative stated that 82% of Philadelphians had personal access to
Internet (Pew, 2013). Notably, however, this data also indicated that this growth is
largely due to the expansion of mobile broadband penetration – a medium not well suited

16
to formal job application activities or political engagement, as I will consider further in
Chapter 6 (Chew, Levy & Ilavarasan, 2011; Napoli & Obar, 2014).
Fourth, examining these liquid labor practices in a specific broadband training
program like KEYSPOTs situates them in a larger policy framework around digital
communication and economic opportunity. Using position papers and policy documents
to trace and understand the received wisdom which shapes the goals of digital labor – and
detailing how programs are utilized on the ground in a very precise context – reveals a
more complex picture of the relationship between poverty, digital inequality, and
economic opportunity. Said differently, this analysis can bridge BTOP policy with digital
practice, and reveal key program “unintended consequences.” These policy principles and
the goals of digital labor will be considered in more depth in Chapter 4.
Fieldsites
Having discussed Philadelphia, I will now turn to introduce specific fieldsites. As
mentioned earlier, this project is an ethnographic study and included participant
observation across multiple sites, semi-structured interviews with KEYSPOT participants
and staff, as well as document collection. As I have referenced and will address further in
Chapter 4 and 5, these KEYSPOT programs were made possible by two Broadband
Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) grants through the 2009 American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), one for public computing centers (PCC) and another for
sustainable broadband adoption i.e. digital training (SBA). The foundational goals of the
KEYSPOT program in Philadelphia were to: 1) Create or refurbish 77 public computer
centers; 2) Develop an awareness campaign around the digital divide and broadband
adoption; and, 3) Train 15,000 Philadelphians in educational programs to build digital

17
literacy and increase broadband adoption. The programs were managed by the “Freedom
Rings Partnership,” a joint venture headed by two lead partners, the City of Philadelphia
and the Urban Affairs Coalition, and supported by other entities such as universities, the
New America Foundation and a coalition of community-based organizations.
The data for this project was primarily obtained in the period between August
2011 and December 2013. I completed approximately 400 hours of participant
observation in both the public computer centers (PCC) and broadband adoption training
programs (SBA), 18 semi-structured interviews with participants and staff and I collected
150 documents pertaining to the KEYSPOTs (as I will describe later). A more detailed
overview of the partnership and program design is provided in Chapter 5. My primary
sites of research included:
1. Critical Path. Affiliated with Philadelphia FIGHT. The public computing
center was observed.
2. The Community College of Philadelphia Center for Business and Industry.
Affiliated with the Philadelphia Housing Authority and Drexel University.
Novice and intermediate computer training classes for PHA residents were
observed.
3. Families First. Affiliated with People’s Emergency Center. GED classes for
young mothers were observed.
4. The Media & Communications Institute. Affiliated with the Media Mobilizing
Project. Digital content creation workshops were observed.
5. Mercy Ministries. Affiliated with the Free Library of Philadelphia. The public
computing center (“Hotspot”) was observed.

18
6. The Village of Arts and Humanities. Affiliated with People’s Emergency
Center. Digital music production classes for youth were observed.
7. Waterview Recreation Center. Affiliated with Philadelphia Parks &
Recreation. The public computing center was observed.
In addition to these primary research sites, where applicable, participant observation was
also conducted at affiliated program activities, such as conferences, presentations,
workshops and open roundtable discussions. When possible, I also observed local events
of interest, such as church gatherings or community meetings. In adherence to Rutgers
Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols, participant names and identifying details
have been changed in this dissertation to preserve confidentiality. Some participants
received a $25 gift card for their interview participation. Notably, I was also a member of
the grant partnership’s “research working group,” so I attended planning meetings with
other partners conducting research on KEYSPOTs, including The New America
Foundation’s Open Technology Institute (OTI) and Drexel University. Where relevant, I
have included findings from their KEYSPOT reports as well.
Methodology: The Ethnographic Research Process
Having discussed my sites of research, I will now turn to my research
methodology –ethnography. Ethnographic research seeks to study people within their
environments and as a method does not encourage researcher detachment, but rather the
goal is to achieve deeper immersion and social interaction (Emerson, Fretz & Shaw,
2011). As I will demonstrate in this project, the social, economic and political issues
facing KEYSPOT visitors like Joanne and Mr. Wilson in the wake of the broader urban
crisis were very complex. Thus, learning about participants’ economic lives required

19
time, but more importantly, necessitated gaining the trust of participants. As a
methodology, ethnography allowed me time and space to attempt to capture this
complexity. Now, I will expand on how social interactions and establishing trust helped
shape the research process before moving into the practices and procedures utilized to
collect my data.
Researcher Stance
Although ethnographic research seeks to study people within their environments,
it is important to flag here that, “immersion is not merging” (Emerson, Fretz & Shaw,
2011, p. 43). In other words, I unavoidably brought my own life experience or “stance”
into the social process, and thus, the research process. To elaborate on this point, as
Emerson, Fretz & Shaw (2011) explain:
On a fundamental level, a researcher’s stance in fieldwork and note writing
originates her outlook on life. Prior experience, training and commitments
influence this stance, predisposing the fieldworker to feel, think and act towards
people in more or less patterned ways. Whether from a particular gender, social,
cultural, political or theoretical position or orientation, the fieldworker not only
interacts with and responds to people in the setting from her own orientation but
also writes her fieldnotes by seeing and framing events accordingly (p. 90.)
In other words, as an ethnographer I am not – and cannot be – an impartial observer.
Thus, in the writing process (and analysis phase), I was sensitive to my own position in
the social world I studied, and attempted to use this position as a tool for developing
complex reflections and understandings (Wolfinger, 2002). This is especially important
to note in a study of the economic lives of urban Philadelphians, as I shared very different

20
economic, educational or racial privileges from my participants (Liebow, 1967). Rather
than writing or editing these issues out while constructing fieldnotes, instead I made a
point to include them so that I could improve and deepen my analysis. As a practical
example of why this is so important, I would emphasize that my stance influenced the
ways in which I built rapport with participants, a subject I will turn to now.
Building Rapport
As discussed, I entered the BTOP Freedom Rings Partnership (FRP) KEYSPOT
sites and established relationships with participants during the two years of ethnographic
fieldwork. Developing a good “rapport” with my participants was critical for a few
reasons (Blumer, 1967). Many KEYSPOT visitors were members of marginalized
groups, such as former prisoners or homeless persons, and thus understandably wary of
new people that had not earned their trust. Through building rapport, I was permitted
more nuanced insights into participant’s lives. As issues around money and finances can
be particularly taboo with strangers, building connections was crucial to gain valuable
research data on both the barriers to formal work and the emergence of informal “liquid
labor” practices. In fact, I would argue that I was only able to see and learn of these
practices precisely because of the rapport and trust I earned from participants over time.
Otherwise, many would have been reluctant to describe these practices, as some were
engaging in them to avoid taxes or not reporting the income to social services. I would
also add here that my relationship with KEYSPOT lab assistants and digital trainers was
vital in building rapport, as I will explain in the next section.
Subjectivity Statement

21
Having just discussed the roles of stance and building rapport during ethnographic
fieldwork, I will now provide a more specific statement on my own subjectivity in my
research sites. This is important because my position and interaction with participants
was not only critical to building rapport, but as an ethnographic researcher, I was the
instrument through which the data was obtained. More specifically, my gender and racial
privileges not only impacted the interactions I had with participants, but also the type of
information I had access to regarding their economic lives and work practices. That being
stated, now I will discuss how I obtained data, as it relates directly to my subjectivity
statement.
As valued members of their respective communities, KEYSPOT digital trainers
were the primary access point through which I met and developed relationships with
KEYSPOT program participants. However, first, in order to gain the trust of trainers, I
had to demonstrate my helpfulness and ability to be a supportive presence in the field,
rather than a detached researcher burdening their time. I found this was necessary
because many trainers initially expressed their negative experiences with academic
researchers in the past, indicating that researchers often appeared aloof or acted as if they
were “above” others. Thus, I quickly learned that to gain trust, I would need to engage in
helpful roles in the site, demonstrating to both trainers and participants that I did not feel
I was of higher-status.
As it turned out, when I asked how I could be of the most use, trainers typically
directed me to assist in gendered roles such as helping with childcare, cleaning the lab,
and supporting them with simple tasks like making copies or coffee. Most notably one of
my primary “jobs” in my research sites was to care for young children so that their

22
parents could use the computers. Indeed, caring for children was one of the primary ways
I earned the trust of families visiting KEYSPOTs. This undoubtedly helped me build the
rapport necessary to learn about their economic lives, especially the liquid labor practices
they were engaging in to make ends meet. Some of the ways I supported parents with
childcare while they visited KEYSPOTs was by helping school-aged children with their
homework or reading books to them. Some parents were concerned about letting their
children browse the computers unattended, so I would occasionally also supervise their
children as they watched online content. For children ages three and under, I usually
entertained them with games or simply cradled them in my arms as they napped. Notably,
participants cited lack of childcare access as one of their primary obstacles to visiting the
labs and to participating in future digital training courses. In this way, my ability to
practically respond to childcare obstacles allowed me insight into participants’ economic
lives and kept participants in the lab. Yet, I would underscore that these findings were
made possible due to my own gender and gendered work in the field. As I will argue in
Chapter 2, reproductive labor was a major motivation for parents to pursue informal
digital work practices. And, quite remarkably, performing reproductive labor was how I
developed rapport in the field, as I will also consider in Chapter 7. Now that I have
reviewed the role of stance and support in the research process, I will provide more
background on the data collection practices and procedures that guided the research
process.
Writing Fieldnotes
In the initial phase of my research, I conducted participant observation. More
specifically, I observed KEYSPOT labs and training programs, recording notes or

23
“fieldnotes” that depicted physical spaces, interactions with participants, and participant
interactions with each other. In these fieldnotes, I utilized “thick description,” or detailed
descriptions that could better represent the micro-processes of participants’ everyday
lives (Geertz, 1973). While the broader research questions I reviewed earlier provided the
underlying structure for the study, I also attempted to discern local meanings, or the ways
in which the participants themselves understood and made sense of their economic and
social world (Garfinkel & Sacks, 1970; Geertz, 1983). In other words, I sought to better
understand how participants viewed their economic lives and how they articulated their
relationship to ICTs.
Semi-Structured Interviews
As the second research component, for interviews I revisited the initial research
questions and used both acquired knowledge of the fieldsites and the social relationships
I developed in the field to identify the best candidates for interview. In doing so, I
considered how particular participants could enhance –or complicate – the research
questions. While draft interview questions were developed (see Appendix I), I utilized a
semi-structured interview approach. To provide more background, semi-structured
interviewing is more open-ended, and allows for greater flexibility in the interview
interaction (Bernard, 2002). For example, in an interview, I could receive an
unanticipated answer from a participant. Rather than ignoring this response or simply
moving to the next question, I followed the detour through probing follow-up questions,
which permitted greater context and enriched my understanding of local meanings
(Bernard, 2002). In doing so, however, I was also attentive to the overarching themes of
the study and research questions (see Appendix II). As the objective of this project was to

24
better understand barriers to formal work and informal or invisible digital work practices,
this semi-structured technique was vital. Said differently, I needed to map out what these
practices were before I delved more deeply into what they meant, or, how they were
connected to each other.
Document Collection
As the third component, I collected documents available within the research
fieldsites throughout my two years in the field. Documents collected included: meeting
agendas, program reports, marketing materials, course materials, informational flyers,
sample resumes, job postings, handouts, creative materials (e.g., digital music produced
in sites), website screenshots and other documents. Some of these original documents are
included in Chapter 6 in a discussion of jobs advertised through KEYSPOTs. All
documents were dated and the site origin was also noted. When useful, descriptions of the
documents collected were incorporated into my fieldnotes. I also collected documents
connected to BTOP more broadly, including National Telecommunications Infrastructure
Association (NTIA) reports, BTOP reports, federal ARRA reports, and others which
addressed issues of work or digital labor for the poor and working class. A number of
these documents are analyzed in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.
Ethnographic Research Analysis
Following data collection, the fieldnotes from participant observation, transcribed
semi-structured interviews and scanned documents were entered into NVivo 10
qualitative research software. All data were subsequently “coded” through NVivo 10 for
themes or categories. This coding process followed two stages. First, data was reviewed
line-by-line for any general themes or ideas, or “open-coded.” In this phase, all meanings

25
were considered, “no matter how varied or disparate” (Emerson, Fretz & Shaw 2011, p.
172). In the second “focused coding” stage, the data was analyzed for themes connecting
directly to the initial research questions. Drawing on both open and focused codes,
individual research memos were then written to analyze and synthesize the research
findings (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). These individual memos were then revised, edited,
and integrated into a single thematic narrative (Emerson, Fretz & Shaw, 2011). When
possible, excerpts from fieldnotes, interview quotes or primary documents collected are
included to reinforce particular analytic points. I also want to note that I have bolded key
ideas in these quotes to help the reader follow my main points, as some of the blocks of
text from participants’ responses are long and therefore could be confusing for readers. I
will now turn to the larger challenges of conducting urban ethnography, specifically the
possible pitfalls to be avoided.
The Pitfalls of Urban Ethnography
Although I have addressed issue of subjectivity in fieldsites, it is pertinent to
include some of Loïc Wacquant’s (2002) “pitfalls” of urban ethnography, especially
considering that he makes an important critique of Mitchell Duneier’s (1999)
ethnographic study, Sidewalk, that focuses on the informal economy. To provide more
background on Duneier’s project, his book investigates the economic and social worlds
informal book dealers in New York City (as I will discuss later in Chapter 3 as well). To
return to Wacquant, he addresses Duneier’s study but also offers an important critique of
two other prominent urban ethnographies that I will not review later–Code of the Street:
Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City by Elijah Anderson (1999) and
No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City authored by Katherine

26
Newman (1999). Using these three texts as examples, Wacquant (2002) outlines some
common urban ethnographic “pitfalls.” Those most relevant to this study are that an
urban ethnographic researcher must be aware of producing research that does not
challenge the structural conditions that contribute to poverty and accordingly generates
overly romantic narratives of urban life. In other words, Wacquant (2002) argues that
these three ethnographic studies glamourized and sensationalized urban life, overlooking
the ways in which economic, social and political inequality shape urban communities and
constrain economic opportunity. As a result, these studies unintentionally reproduced
stereotypes of urban families and contributed to a political discourse that celebrates
“personal responsibility,” a subject I will also address in Chapter 2.
These concerns are extremely relevant to this study. For example, considering
these pitfalls, I endeavored to avoid romanticizing, for instance, the informal practices or
the participants. For example, Joanne’s informal online work practices undoubtedly
included components of creativity and ingenuity. Yet, I did not lose sight of the fact that
they were necessary for her survival in difficult economic circumstances and therefore I
situated them within a structural critique of advanced capitalism. Further, the theoretical
frames I will present in the following chapter –Marxist feminism, liquid modernity and
the concept of “digital myths” – provide a strong critical theoretical frame for analyzing
non-wage and informal labor and its unique exploitation in the information economy.
However, most importantly, I had to consider reproducing stereotypes of urban
life in significant ways in this project. My initial participants were working class single
mothers and caregivers, thus when I first proposed this project I wanted to focus on how
the reproductive labor of “single mothers” was motivating these digital work practices.

27
However, in the process of data analysis, I realized I had overlooked the ways in which
fathers were also engaging in these liquid labor practices to help care for their families.
While it was definitely true that male caregivers were more likely to have a partner to
share reproductive labor responsibilities than women, to exclude their economic lives
from the study would have trapped my research and participants in a raced and gendered
framework unfaithful to my data. In other words, though it may be true that “urban single
mothers” are a group deserving of exclusive attention and theorizing in other projects or
my own future research, given my questions and data collected in this study, I decided it
was appropriate to expand my focus to consider mothers and fathers. Thus, considering
Wacquant (2002), I repositioned this study to focus on the economic lives of the working
class and reproductive labor more broadly, therefore avoiding the pitfall of relying
heavily on a top-down frame of the “urban single mother” when it did not accurately
represent the full range of these practices observed at least in my particular fieldsites.
Key Terms
I also want to outline some key terms that I use throughout this dissertation to
offer a foundational vocabulary for the project. This is not an exhaustive list of key terms,
and I do not include my own key terms that I intend to contribute as core arguments–such
as “policytakers” which I define in Chapter 4. Instead, these are more general terms in the
field that are repeated often throughout the project. The terms that I will review include:
1) information economy; 2) digital labor; 3) informal economy; 4) digital divide; 5)
digital workforce divide; 6) labor; 7) work; 8) working class; 9) entrepreneur; 10)
reproductive labor; 11) neoliberalism; 12) globalization; and, 13) urban crisis. Notably,
these definitions are somewhat abbreviated as I will explore each in more depth later,

28
nonetheless, they can offer an initial roadmap for the reader to move more easily through
the project.
Information Economy
To begin, throughout this project, I refer to the “information economy” drawing
on Porat (1977) and Castells (1989). In utilizing this term, I refer to the ways in which the
current economy is increasingly driven by information creation and information sharing.
Further, the “information economy” is distinct from the industrial economy in that the
production and development of goods and services has been profoundly altered by the
introduction of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs). This is not to suggest
that the information economy has replaced the industrial economy or is unconnected to it;
I only refer to the “information economy” to capture these changing relationships
between capital and labor. I will discuss this concept in more depth in Chapter 2 in
relation to Bauman’s (2000) theory of liquid modernity.
Digital Labor
Aligned with Fuchs (2010, 2012, 2014) and Scholz (2013), in this dissertation I
use the broader term “digital labor” to refer to a range of emerging online activities that
may not immediately be recognized as “work,” but nonetheless generate profit for the
information economy. For example, creating open source software online is digital labor
as is creating a Facebook fan page or writing e-books as Joanne does. Notably, Lazzarato
(1996) and Hardt & Negri (2001, 2005, 2009) describe this as “immaterial labor”
however I do not use this term, because as mentioned earlier, I will argue in this study
that focusing on “immaterial labor” can ignore the ways in which digital and material
economies interact. One subset of immaterial labor practices is “affective labor,”

29
meaning when value is extracted from our social and communal labor on sites like
Facebook or Twitter (Weeks, 2009).
Informal Economy
As the literature review in Chapter 3 will demonstrate, “informal economy” is a
broad term that can refer to many practices, sectors, and categorizations. As Losby, Else
and Kingslow likewise (2002) point out, many terms are used to refer to these extra
market activities in academic literature. The informal economy has also been termed the
“irregular economy” (Ferman & Ferman, 1973), the “underground economy” (Simon &
Witte, 1982), the “shadow economy” (Frey, Weck & Pommerehne, 1981;); the “reserve
economy” (Swaminathan, 1991); and the “social factory” (Tronti, 1973). However, my
definition of the “informal economy” will be guided by Marxist feminist theory which
states that the informal labor is: 1) Unwaged or unsalaried; 2) Generating hidden surplus
labor that is linked to the formal sector; 3) Outside the scope of commodity production;
4) Generated without direct recognition from the state or private business, such as tax
identification; and, 5) Produced without union protection or connected benefits such as
health insurance (James, 2012).
Digital Divide
The metaphor of the “digital divide” is meant to describe discrepancies in
information access, specifically in terms of access to ICTs. In other words, this term
refers to a gap or divide between those with internet access and those without. As I will
discuss in Chapter 3, for some scholars the “digital divide” also refers to a gap of digital
skills. Others have conceptualized this divide as one of economic, social and political
inequality.

30
Digital Workforce Divide
Aligned with scholars such as Rodino-Colocino (2006), I will use the term
“digital workforce divide” to refer to the ways in which ICT access and the information
economy more broadly have reshaped the U.S. workforce. To elaborate on this point,
Rodino-Colocino (2006) suggests that overreliance on term “digital divide” may obscure
a growing digital labor force divide. As an example of how the “digital workforce divide”
operates, in Chapter 3 I will discuss Google’s usage of low-paid, low-skilled digital book
scanners who are isolated from the “Google campus” and are not permitted to interact
with the high-skilled tech employees.
Labor
It is also important to define the terms “labor” and “work” which are used
frequently throughout this dissertation. This project draws heavily on Raymond
Williams’ (1976) useful definitions (and distinctions) between these concepts. First,
whereas in early English the word “labor” was associated with pain or toil (e.g., labor of
tilling the earth or labor of giving birth), eighteenth and nineteenth century economic
theorists and scholars like Marx, Locke, Malthus and Smith used the term to apply to
capitalist relations. More specifically, though in early English the word “labor” referred
to all productive work and implied hardship and toil, political economy studies positioned
labor within the framework of commodity production (Williams, 1976). In other words,
“labor” in political economy –and correspondingly in this project –should be more
closely understood as resulting from the interaction between capital and materials to
produce material or immaterial commodities.

31
Work
In contrast to the above definition of “labor”, in early English the term “work”
carried a wider range of applications and was somewhat less strongly associated with
pain or toil, and referred to both paid and unpaid employment (Williams, 1976). For
example, “working” in the garden could equally mean for personal financial profit or for
personal enjoyment (Williams, 1976). Thus, as Williams (1976) points out, all laborers
would be considered workers but not all workers are laborers. Following from this, my
dissertation uses the term “work” to refer to a wider set of activities that may or may not
be related to commodity production whereas labor is tied more directly to capitalist
relations and the market. Williams also points out that in English a “job” is formalized
work for payment – another term utilized in this project in a similar capacity.
Working Class
Yet, drawing on Marxist theory, “working class” should be considered a separate
(though related) concept which refers to the productive class of workers in capitalist
societies who do not own the means of production and thus must sell their labor power
for wages. Though I do not draw heavily on the term in this project, Marx (1996) also
referred to this group as the “proletariat.” In other words, most broadly I intend “working
class” to describe an economic relationship between classes of workers in advanced
capitalism or an economic position in society. This is a subject that will be considered
further in Chapter 2.
Liquid Labor
As I mentioned earlier in this chapter, drawing on Bauman’s (2000) concept of
“liquid modernity,’ I propose the rise of informal online labor – or liquid labor –as a

32
framework for understanding the complex issues surrounding precarious work and the
information economy in advanced capitalism. More precisely, “liquid labor” recalls
flexible, low-financial risk work practices that function as kind of super precarious,
highly exploited online labor. This type of labor is uniquely shaped by social and class
position in addition to access to ICTs. Therefore, I have selected “liquid labor” as a more
appropriate classification than “immaterial labor” or “affective labor” to draw attention to
the ways in which class location and digital access interact to generate precarity.
Moreover, “liquid labor” advocates for a materialist understanding and interpretation of
risk and entrepreneurship, a term I will now consider.
Entrepreneur
As I will discuss later in this project, “entrepreneurial activity” is a term
frequently used in broadband programs, but one that is vague to the point of abstraction.
As Nelson (2012) points out, this lack of specificity makes it difficult to evaluate who is
and who is not an entrepreneur. For instance, he reports that Merriam Webster defines
“entrepreneur” as, “one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or
enterprise.” In contrast, dictionary.com explains the term to mean, “a person who
organizes and manages any enterprise, especially a business, usually with considerable
initiative and risk.” I assert that risk is the most important dimension when considering
who is or who is not an “entrepreneur.” As I will discuss in Chapter 7, liquid laborers like
Joanne are not entrepreneurs as they must mitigate financial risk and do not have formal
access to capital.
Reproductive Labor

33
I will use the term “reproductive labor” throughout this project and discuss it in
depth in Chapter 2. The term “reproductive labor” refers to the labor required to
reproduce the worker and the workforce. For example, the wage extracts work from a
housewife as well, who must daily reproduce the labor power of her husband by
preparing meals, folding laundry, cleaning the house, and caring for the children
(Federici, 2012, p. 8). In other words, capitalism requires the unwaged reproductive labor
of women (and men) –not only to contain the cost of labor power –but to also supply and
support a new generation of workers (James, 2012). Said plainly, unwaged reproductive
work enables and supports waged productive work.
Neoliberalism
In this dissertation, I will argue that broadband projects like BTOP are, in fact,
shaped by the discourses of “neoliberalism.” To explain, according to David Harvey
(2005), “neoliberalism” is a theory of politics and economics that argues human
wellbeing can be achieved through a focus on individualism and free market principles.
This philosophy accordingly holds individuals accountable for their welfare, rather than
society or the state (Harvey, 2005). Said differently, “neoliberalism” is focused on
themes like personal responsibility and self-sufficiency.
Globalization
Most broadly, “globalization” refers to the increasing global connectedness
between businesses, governments, economies, cultures and populations. In this project, I
am interested in the role that ICTs have played in globalization and its impact on the
economy. Furthermore, I focus on how – and why –globalization and automation together
have resulted in a restructuring of the relationship between capital and labor. For

34
instance, in Chapter 5, I will argue that post-industrial cities like Philadelphia have been
among the hardest hit by globalization and the shift to an information and service based
economy (Bell, 1976; Castells, 1989; Cohen, 1981; Harvey, 2006; Hodos, 2002; Sassen,
1991).
Urban Crisis
The “urban crisis” and how it has impacted the city of Philadelphia is a subject I
will take up in depth in Chapter 5. However, to provide an abbreviated definition, the
urban crisis refers to the economic, social and political crises facing many major U.S.
cities, particularly Rust Belt cities that once served as manufacturing or industrial
strongholds. Scholars have recognized that a confluence of factors –including the shift to
ICTs, deindustrialization, retrenchment, and depopulation –are responsible for the
problems of poverty and inequality plaguing many urban communities in the U.S.
(Jargowsky, 1996; Sugrue, 2005).
Limitations
Having created working definitions for this study, it is important to note that the
themes of the information economy, digital labor, and the digital divide are quite broad.
Thus, to narrow the scope of this study, it is important to discuss the limitations or
boundaries of the research. First, given the definition of the information economy and
informal economy previously discussed, I want to flag that this study will be confined to
intersections between economic practices and ICTs. Therefore, promoting informal
services such as housekeeping on a website or via social media would be discussed.
However, participants promoting these services through word-of-mouth only would be
outside the scope of this particular project. Second, this study is primarily focused on the

35
economic lives of KEYSPOT job seekers in the period when data collection began (2011)
to present. As such, I will examine possible barriers to formal economic opportunities
and informal activities only among this group of participants. Third, the study of policy
documents and discussion around the goals of labor will center on BTOP through ARRA.
When necessary, I will connect on a limited basis to broader patterns of legislation to
provide necessary history or background information contained in either BTOP or
ARRA, such as the Falling Through the Net series in Chapter 4. However, these
discussions will be included only to motivate the larger argument around BTOP and
KEYSPOTs. Finally, as an ethnographic project, I did not conduct surveys or other mixed
methods research on these digital labor practices within the sites. However, as I
mentioned earlier, other KEYSPOT partners including the New American Foundation
and Drexel University did conduct survey and focus group research on the same
population, so I will refer to those conclusions when useful.
Outline of Study
Having presented the stakes of the project, research questions, background on my
fieldsites and methodology, as well as key terms, I will now provide a brief overview of
each dissertation chapter, highlighting key ideas and insights. To more fully situate this
analysis, Chapter 2 offers a social-theoretical framework for positioning the economic
lives practices of poor and working-class participants in BTOP, drawing on Marxist
feminism, Bauman’s (2000) sociological arguments on “liquid modernity,” and Mosco’s
(2004) cultural arguments regarding “digital myths.” Current literature in the field is
reviewed in Chapter 3 to allow us to better understand the emergence of these new online
work practices, the larger socioeconomic context in which these practices have evolved,

36
and the policy discourses underpinning BTOP. Next, Chapter 4 examines the history of
BTOP and the evolution of thinking around economic opportunity to analyze how the
goals of digital labor were developed at the U.S. federal and local levels. To situate my
project within a precise social, economic, and political landscape, Chapter 5 traces the
history of technology programs in Philadelphia and the city’s urban crisis. Following this,
Chapter 6 examines the digital work skills participants obtained in KEYSPOT programs
and then addresses some of the formal economy barriers facing job-seekers. Finally, in
Chapter 7, I detail the “liquid labor” practices of four participants –Joanne, Sky, Deric
and Ron –to bring my framework to life. I will synthesize some key themes from their
stories, arguing that the participants engage in these liquid labor strategies because they
provide flexibility, minimize financial risk and are more conducive to reproductive labor
roles. Finally, I will offer some broader implications of these findings on the economic
lives of BTOP participants, consider areas of possible resistance and intervention, and
offer some concluding thoughts and potential areas of future research beyond this
dissertation.

Chapter 2
Reproductive Labor, Liquid Modernity and Digital Myth-Making
Introduction
Whereas Chapter 1 presented the broader stakes of this dissertation –outlining my
research questions and sketching out themes and terminology central to the project – this
chapter presents a social-theoretical framework for analyzing the economic lives of poor
and working class BTOP participants who engage in “liquid labor” like Joanne. Further,
this framework allows us to better understand the disconnect between BTOP policies and
practices, thus better accounting for Mr. Wilson’s experiences with technology. This
framework is rooted in a critical foundation and draws on three theoretical areas: Marxist
feminism, liquid modernity and digital myths. I have built this interconnected framework
to respond to the research questions detailed in the last chapter. These questions can be
condensed as investigating: 1) economic lives and online work practices (“practices”); 2)
the relationship between these practices and the contemporary information economy
(“social and economic context”); and, 3) the goals of digital labor as outlined in
broadband policy and programs (“policy discourses”). So, to be more specific on this
point, the Marxist feminist theory helps to better explain and explore these new online
work practices and precarious economic arrangements. The theory of liquid modernity
situates these practices and participants’ economic lives within the social and economic
context of the contemporary information economy. Finally, to address the emergence of
these practices within the context of the Freedom Rings Partnership and KEYSPOTs, the
theory of “digital myths” sheds light on some of the common policy discourses that
underpin broadband programs like BTOP and thus motivate the goals of digital labor.

38
This critical theoretical scaffolding also complements an inductive urban ethnographic
approach.
In summation, the first foundation draws on a Marxist feminist framework to
better understand the impediments working class parents face to finding well paid work,
tracing the connections between unwaged labor and social reproduction. Second, key
concepts taken from Bauman’s (2000) “liquid modernity” situate the research within the
context of the contemporary information economy, revealing how the rollback of social
programs coupled with discourses of neoliberalism have pushed workers to embrace
flexible, financially risk-averse “survival” strategies (Sassen, 2003). Third, I review
Mosco’s (2004) “digital myths” that offers a lens through which we can critically
evaluate the policy discourses which underpin BTOP and thus how the goals of digital
labor were presented and developed therein. Finally, the conclusion summarizes my key
theoretical planks, reviews their relationship to the research questions, and sets the stage
for the literature review chapter.
Marxist Feminism – Digital Labor Practices
To turn to my first theoretical plank, I argue that Marxist feminist theory sheds
light on the economic lives of BTOP participants and the emergence these new digital
work practices as it focuses on how the necessity of reproductive labor can generate new
working arrangements across gender, racial and class lines. To make this argument, first I
will define reproductive labor and discuss the broader significance of the theory. Next, I
will turn to the relationship between reproductive labor, ICTs and the dismantling of the
welfare state. Finally, I will detail other specific factors shaping labor practices, such as
the lack of affordable childcare access.

39
Reproductive Labor: The Wages for Housework Movement
To begin, what do I mean by “reproductive labor” and why is the theory
significant? Marxist feminists such as Selma James (2012), Mariarosa Dalla Costa
(1999), and Silvia Federici (2012) formed the international Wages for Housework (WfH)
campaign in the 1960’s – 1980’s to draw attention to this issue of reproductive labor in
modern capitalism (Altbach, 1980). WfH was a broad movement of feminists with varied
political identifications ranging from Marxist, liberal, and anarchist1 who simply used
housework as a starting point to protest – and highlight –the necessity of unpaid domestic
labor. To elaborate, what they intended to point out is that the wage extracts work from
the housewife as well, who must daily reproduce the labor power of her husband through
caring for the children while he is at work, preparing meals for the family, folding
laundry, cleaning the house and soothing the stresses of his day (Federici, 2012, p. 8). So,
this feminist inspired movement was not about “a lump of money” (Federici, 2012, p. 12)
or housewives specifically, rather, it is a political perspective on the foundational role of
reproductive labor in capitalist society. In other words, although reproductive labor is
foundational to the economy, it is degraded, made structurally invisible and
uncompensated – an argument I make throughout this project, but with a particular focus
on class issues.
1

It is important to note that WfH activists were divided on the role that unions should
play in their activism, particularly due to concerns that unions were dominated by
‘masculine interests’ and that domestic workers had faced an uphill battle in their attempt
to be recognized and receive union protections (da Motta, 1999, p. 127; James, 2012, p.
65). However, James (2012) later revises her position in 1972, saying that her, “critique
of the unions was too absolute. It takes no account of the possibility of a mass takeover
by members….we must remind ourselves that a great deal is at stake in unions….they
open the possibility of reclaiming our own unions” (p. 61). Federici (2012), however,
continued to maintain an anti-union position.

40
Before I move on, I should add here that the WfH movement was for the most
part associated with the autonomist Marxist movement and distanced itself from earlier
socialist feminist theories. To provide background, socialist feminism championed
traditional labor movements and organizations (such as unions) as the best mechanism to
protect the interests of working people. Conversely, autonomist Marxist movements
embraced a decentralized organizing approach and critiqued socialist feminism as overly
hierarchical, claiming that traditional Marxism promoted a top-down approach to
resistance rather than a more grassroots, bottom-up approach. I would point out that the
WfH movement’s critiques of the inadequacies of traditional labor unions in supporting
women workers were valid and important, specifically in their discussions of the failure
of unions to advocate for immigrant women and domestic workers (da Motta, 1999;
Federici, 2012; James, 2012). That being said, beyond the conclusion the subject of
labor’s political resistance and organizing strategies is outside of the scope of this project,
thus, I will also introduce some relevant socialist feminist scholarship later. Nonetheless,
as I am drawing from this framework, it is useful to highlight and draw attention to these
origins before proceeding.
So, to return the key theoretical points that I will draw on, the WfH movement
emphasized that this inability to conceive of value producing work outside of commodity
production was a blind spot in Marx’s analysis of capital. To explain Marx’s original
arguments on the subject, in his Introduction to Part III of Capital Vol. III that deals with
‘Reproduction and Circulation of Social Capital,” Marx (1992) describes the relationship
between the commodity and social reproduction. Here Marx claims that in capitalism, the
commodity form is produced and reproduced through the individual worker:

41
….the circuits of individual capitals intertwine, presuppose and necessitate one
another, and form, precisely in this interlacing, the movement of the total of social
capital. Just as in the simple circulation of commodities the total metamorphosis
of a commodity appeared as a link in the series of metamorphoses in the world of
commodities, so now the metamorphosis of the individual capital appears as a
link in the metamorphosis of social capital. (p. 357-358).
In this excerpt I have provided, Marx is suggesting that you cannot divide the living
individual from their labor power. Yet, he does not consider the role of non-workers
(wives) in reproducing the individual worker. Marxist feminists in the WfH movement
therefore point out that if you cannot divide the individual worker from their labor power,
it follows that it is impossible to sort out and isolate the components of “productive” and
“reproductive” work. Said differently, WfH contends that capitalism required the
unwaged reproductive labor of women –not only to contain the cost of labor power –but
to supply and support new generations of workers (James, 2012). Said plainly, unwaged
reproductive work enables and supports waged productive work.
In this way, whereas classical political economy defines a commodity as
something that is owned and can be legally exchanged, Marxist feminists in WfH pointed
out that housework – and the work of reproduction more broadly –was always necessary
to produce workers but not visible in the commodity form until the 1950’s – 1970’s when
women left the home in vast numbers to enter the formal labor market. As middle and
upper-class women left the home (and thus their reproductive roles) to enter the
workforce, poor and working-class workers (primarily women) shifted into their shoes,
acting as careworkers, nannies, cooks and maids. Therefore, this important reproductive

42
labor remained invisible to capital only up until the point at which it was no longer
performed for free (James, 2012, p. 45). Again, it was poor and working-class individuals
who came to occupy these reproductive roles vacated by middle and upper-class women,
signaling a “double movement” as they continued to reproduce their own families but
also the middle and upper-class families they now worked for (Weeks, 2009). In this
way, unwaged or low-waged workers from the most vulnerable populations became
responsible for helping reproduce waged workers – coincidentally one of the reasons why
opportunities for low-wage work in service and domestic sector opportunities abound, an
issue I will explore in Chapter 6 (Dalla Costa & Dalla Costa, 1999, p. 29; James, 2012).
Yet, what is more important here is that the necessity of reproductive labor following the
exit of middle and upper-class women from the home and entrance into the workforce
resulted in a reorganization of work across gender, racial and class lines. Said another
way, the profound shifts in reproductive labor generated and motivated a new set of
exploitative working arrangements, such as the liquid labor practices I identify in this
project.
Neoliberalism and the “Third Layer” –Degrading Reproductive Labor
I would point out here that the perspective of Marxist Feminism, like Feminist
Economics2, is not restricted to studies of women and gender, though it is interested in

Most broadly, feminist economics “challenges economic policies that treat women as
invisible” (Nelson, 2010, p. 96). Similar to Sandra Harding’s (1986) argument regarding
the nature of science, they contend that economics tends to be male-biased in its
definition and methods and thus ignores (or worse obscures) the work of women. Rather
than simply sorting “women” out as a variable in existing approaches to economics,
feminist economists place women at the center of the research question to attempt to
expose or uncover new insights regarding the nature of the economy, also investigating
issues of race and class – James’s (2012) “third layer.”
2

43
those of course. More broadly, the movement called attention to the important
reproductive labor that propels and props up the foundation of the capitalist system. Yet,
the WfH movement also revealed the function of the wage in striking divisions within the
working class, starting with the relation between women and men, but also in “third
world” and immigrant populations as well – groups James (2012) referred to as the “third
layer” (Altbach, 1980; Ascher, 1974; Benston, 1969; Caffentzis, 1999; Dalla Costa, 1999;
da Motta, 1999; Morton, 1970). In recalling the “third layer,” James (2012) proposed that
reproductive labor is degraded more generally by capital, however when it intersects with
other issues – such as racial and class disparities – its role is further diminished. This is a
key claim I am drawing on in this project. To elaborate on the point, as advances in
information technology and globalization worked together to open the markets to new
pools of exploitable workers, capital’s need to reproduce the workforce changed. In the
previous period – a period which Bauman (2000) refers to as “solid modernity,” as I will
turn to in the next section– capital was anchored to location and thus relied on the welfare
state and social support programs in advanced economies to sustain the working class and
keep them as a “reserve army” of cheap labor in any given territory (Dyer Witheford,
1999). Yet, in this new era of “liquid modernity” (Bauman, 2000), capital could easily
flee workers and seek that cheap labor elsewhere. As a result, the need to sustain the
working class in “advanced economies” diminished and thus public and governmental
support for social programs withered. In other words, as globalization offered U.S.
corporations access to cheaper foreign labor, governmental systems supporting and
reproducing the domestic labor force weakened. This is a line of argumentation that

44
Bauman (2000) develops in more depth and that I will address in the next section of this
chapter.
To return to the broader Marxist feminist theories regarding reproductive labor
and the working class, critical scholars have suggested that this is one of the goals of
neoliberal capitalism in the contemporary information economy: to diminish carework
and make the needs of social reproduction for the poor “invisible” (Abel & Nelson, 1990;
Folbre, 1994, 2001; England & Folbre; Fisher & Tronto, 1990, p. 35). For example, as
will be reviewed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5, Grabham and Smith (2010) argue that the
retrenchment of the welfare state and a new policy shift in the 1990’s away from
“welfare” programs for poor families and towards “workfare” programs in the U.S. that
required work as a condition of social support signaled this dismissal and degradation of
reproductive labor (Grabham & Smith, 2010, p. 84 -90). Therefore, building on Marxist
feminist thought, I will assert in this project that public policy no longer recognizes
reproductive responsibilities due to the values of neoliberalism, but also because trends of
globalization have eased capital’s access to cheap labor. This is the kind of labor my
participants visiting KEYSPOTs performed – and thus sustaining these workers through
social programs was no longer a priority. I would highlight here that the timing of these
welfare policy shifts in the 1990’s coincides exactly with the expansion of ICTs and the
advance of globalization. As a related point, in the contemporary information economy,
the very necessary work of parenting and reproduction is more likely to be degraded and
devalued in the type of low-skilled, low-status jobs performed by poor and working
parents like Joanne.

45
Many of the Marxist feminists of the period writing on the “crisis of social
reproduction” trained their sights on the “third world” impact or on how these
reproductive labor trends influenced immigrant populations (Dalla Costa & Dalla Costa,
1999; da Motta, 1999; Federici, 2012). For instance, these authors point out that
immigrant careworkers serving middle and upper-class families must spend time apart
from their own children (in some cases, their families may even be living overseas) and
often receive meager pay and no benefits. I, however, contend that this crisis of
reproduction and degradation of reproductive labor is more expansive than they have
theorized, as childcare issues also dramatically shape the fortunes of poor native-born
U.S. workers who can legally work in the country’s formal sector. As an example, I will
argue in Chapter 6 that many of the formal sector opportunities available to KEYSPOT
job seekers did not provide a living wage and were in no way conducive to parenting,
offering undesirable hours and inflexible family leave policies. Because these available
formal sector opportunities were unfriendly to parents, some job-seekers decided to
forego the formal economy altogether or to supplement their income with opportunities in
the informal sector. Therefore, these new liquid labor practices were borne out of the
necessity of reproductive labor: participants like Joanne sought arrangements that would
allow them to properly care for and support their families.
Considering Reproductive Labor in the Context of BTOP
As discussed earlier, whereas the WfH movement attempted to distance itself
from earlier socialist feminist thought, I would underscore that the subject of
reproductive labor was also important to socialist feminist scholars, though I am not
heavily pulling from these ideas due to their inattention to issues such as race. One

46
socialist feminist thinker who engaged with these issues of reproductive labor in early
1900’s Russia was Alexandra Kollontai (1984) who criticized the “free love” principles
of contemporary feminist movements of the period. Aligned with my research focus, she
suggested that only when state supported childcare was accessible would working women
be truly emancipated (Kollontai, 1984). In other words, more than fifty years before
WfH, Kollontai (1984) drew attention to the reproductive labor functions of women and
identified widespread imbalances in childcare support as a factor furthering inequalities
between men and women, but likewise, between the social classes. Draper (2011) argues
that as members of the working class, early feminists3 like Kollontai (1984) had a
different perspective on the feminist movements of their time and therefore were able to
begin to conceptualize the relationship between capital and social reproduction, a cause
later taken up and developed by autonomist feminists in the WfH campaign. In any case,
I bring up Kollontai’s (1984) contribution because it dovetails with my argument that
reproductive labor is not only necessary for capital production, but that it is degraded
along class lines. Moreover, her direct call for the state to recognize this necessity of
childcare is one that I will echo throughout this project and address in my conclusion
chapter as well.

3

Draper (2011) also traces the junctures and tensions between proletarian and bourgeois
feminist movements from the era of the French Revolution to present day, focusing on
early Marxist Feminists such as Claire Lacombe, Clara Zetkin, Rosa Luxembmcurg
(2008), and Alexandra Kollontai (1984). In contrast to such feminist contemporaries as
the British writer Mary Wollstonecraft, instead of advocating for women’s right, the
Marxist feminists took those rights by organizing in the street and setting up their own
political meetings. For example, Claire Lacombe’s pamphlets promoted her organized
protests demanding relief measures for the poor (Draper, 2011, p. 64).

47
But although Marxist feminism provides us with a toolkit to investigate the
relationship between reproductive work, and unwaged work and lack of childcare
support, it does not provide us with the compass needed to navigate all of the
contemporary issues framing this study, such as the rise of precarious work,
neoliberalism, globalization, and the pace of technological change. Therefore, as already
discussed, key concepts taken from Bauman’s (2000) sociological arguments on “liquid
modernity” will be utilized to better respond to my research question on the relationship
between the economic lives of participants and the information economy. I suggest that
Bauman’s (2000) concepts better position the research within current global and local
capital shifts that have produced the conditions in which informal labor is generated, for
example tracing the connection between neoliberalism and globalization to diminished
job opportunities for participants like Mr. Wilson. Additionally, this theory maintains that
the breakdown of durable institutions and the rollback of social programs have made
these new precarious working arrangements a necessity (Sassen, 2003). Ultimately,
though, my goal is to demonstrate that Bauman’s (2000) insights help better explain how
the needs of reproduction and childcare interact within a broader network of participant
choices and economic calculations, choices that attempt to maximize flexibility and
minimize personal economic risk.
Social and Economic Context: Liquid Labor in the Information Economy
To pivot to my second theoretical plank, in his book, Liquid Modernity,
sociologist Zygmunt Bauman (2000) explains that “modernity” has been marked by a
passage from solid structures to flexible, liquid structures. To provide more detail,
according to Bauman (2000), the defining features of the current “liquid” age are a

48
declining investment in stable and durable structures (such as institutions like libraries
and social support programs) and an increase in globalization, deregulation and
privatization. I contend that this theory can offer insight into the relationship between
these emerging liquid labor practices like Joanne’s that I have identified and the
contemporary information economy. Thus, first I will present Bauman’s (2000)
conception of “solid modernity,” otherwise known as the industrial period, focusing on
how social support systems were maintained to help reproduce the labor force and
furthermore how this safety net supported individual risk-taking. Second, I will turn to
“liquid modernity,” describing its defining characteristics and stressing connections that
establish the link back to Marxist feminism and reproductive labor. Finally, I will argue
that Bauman’s (2000) overarching insights about liquid modernity, especially his
arguments relating to flexible work and risk-reduction behaviors, help us to better
understand the economic lives of BTOP participants in the context of the information
economy.
Solid Modernity: Durable Structures, Support in Risk-Taking
To appreciate the relevance of Bauman’s discussion of liquid modernity, it is
important to first define the preceding period as well – solid modernity –as this concept
lays the groundwork for Chapter 5 where the economic transitions of Philadelphia and
the urban crisis are discussed in more depth. Bauman (2000) describes the period of solid
modernity –later referred to interchangeably in this project with the “industrial” period –
as an era characterized by erecting heavy and durable structures, territorial conquest, and
developing plans for social progress. Here “solid” is used to invoke the heavy machinery
of the industrial factories as well as the weight of expanding railways and other

49
transportation infrastructures. The term “solid modernity” also conjures the anchoring
properties of industrial time, as in this period, the clock began to measure labor and keep
track of a worker’s progress (or lack thereof) (Thompson, 1967). In this era, organized
labor in advanced economies was also robust, forming a strong counterweight to the
ruling class interests.
In sum, in the solid stage, both capital and labor were bound together in a specific
time and space in the United States. Therefore, connecting to the Marxist feminist
arguments presented earlier, the welfare state’s role was crucial, as it was needed to
maintain and support a healthy supply of inexpensive reserve labor for capital in
advanced economies. Likewise, social support institutions were vital to new businesses
and promoting innovations. In short, the welfare state was, “collective insurance against
misfortune [that] made [workers] resourceful enough to develop their potential in full and
muster the courage to take risks” (Bauman, 2000, p. 145). Bauman’s (2000) point on
“the courage to take risks” is one that I would emphasize, as it describes solid modernity
as an era in which poor families felt more supported in risk-taking because there was a
social safety net to catch him. Further, alongside Karl Polyani (1944), Bauman (2000)
additionally suggested that labor in this “solid” period was more fixed not only in time
and space, but to the physical body of the worker. This conception of a “solid” period can
help inform a study of the digital and informalized economy as it highlights the ways the
information economy has disrupted the relationship between productive and reproductive
labor, but also how ICTs have decoupled time, space, and the body of the laborer in
advanced economies. Said differently, this theory helps identify the economic and social
changes that have encouraged a new set of online work practices in Philadelphia.

50
Liquid Modernity: Reproductive Labor in the Information Economy
So, if the previous period was “solid,” how should our current era be described?
Similar to Hardt & Negri’s argument in Empire (2001), Bauman (2000) suggests that we
are now entering a phase of “liquid modernity.” According to Bauman (2000), the
emergence of the liquid era is, in fact, a response to the “solidification” of the previous
stage just described. For example, labor unions were built up by the poor and working
class in the industrial period as a rejoinder to the organization of capital. To flee these
constraints and build more profitable structures, it was necessary for capital to “melt
down” and “dissolve” the old forms and erect new forms. Thus, as Bauman (2000)
suggests, capital and labor are permanently locked in a series of strategies and counter
tactics (DeCerteau, 1984). In other words, capital is constantly executing new strategies
to obtain higher profits and connect to new markets; thus, new plans were developed to
respond to the constraints imposed on capital in the era of solid modernity.
Digital technology was one of the key forces aiding capital in melting down these
old social and economic systems for profit. This was in part because technology loosened
capital from the old constraints I identified: time, space, and the body of the worker.
Capital (and power) could now easily flee protected workers or unfavorable regulations
in advanced economies like the U.S. and seek out more profitable territories or countries.
To expand on my earlier point linked with the Marxist feminist critique, the seemingly
limitless global supply of cheap reserve labor – available either behind computer screens
or coordinated through them– rendered U.S. social support programs of the past less
useful to capital, as it did not have to consider reproducing a local workforce. The
subsequent rollback of social support programs destabilized working class communities

51
across the U.S. and poor families were particularly hard hit by these changes. To revisit
my earlier point on Marxist feminism, the necessity of reproduction among the urban
poor was thus degraded and welfare programs shifted to workfare programs. In this way,
I am arguing here that reproductive labor and liquid modernity are yoked together. I
therefore maintain that liquid labor practices emerged out of the necessity of reproduction
and childcare needs. As Bauman (2000) explains, another side-effect of the decoupling of
labor has meant that governments have little to no security about capital investment and
thus privatization and deregulation (including of telecommunications) is offered as an
incentive. This is a point Mosco (2004) makes as well, which I will turn to later in this
chapter.
Liquid Labor: The New Flexible, Risk-Averse Digital Worker
To return to liquid modernity, Bauman (2000) claims that this social and
economic transition is also a reaction to a fear – real or imagined– that solid structures
limit the power and movement of the free individual (Bauman, 2000, p. 5). As discussed
as a key term in Chapter 1, Harvey (2005) has termed this shift “neoliberalism,” or the
worldview that heavy governmental support and durable structures limit individual
choices and that the individual alone should be responsible for her/his own welfare and
wellbeing. So, in addition to the technological changes I have already mentioned, wider
cultural changes associated with neoliberalism have also ushered in the era of liquid
modernity. Said another way, because individuals like Joanne do not (or cannot in the
case of many KEYSPOT job seekers) rely on solid structures or steady incomes,
according to the values of neoliberalism, they must make economic opportunities for
themselves with any tools available, such as through engaging in digital “liquid labor”

52
practices. As a related corollary –and particularly germane to this project –the shift to the
cult of the individual and its overarching philosophy has meant that rather than see racial,
gender or class disparities as operating in larger entrenched patterns of structural
oppression, any disparities can instead be viewed as resulting either from a lack of
individual connection (digital access) or ability (digital skills). My point here is that the
values of neoliberalism also shape broadband policy, an issue Mosco (2004) addresses
and that I will turn to consider later in this chapter.
My conclusion regarding liquid modernity is that, as a response to this
constellation of socioeconomic changes, precarious U.S. workers in the new information
economy strive to be liquid and flexible, never relying on a single job or an institution to
provide long term support. In contrast to solid modernity, as Bauman (2000) explains,
work in the age of liquid modernity can be characterized by, “short-term contracts,
rolling contracts or no contracts, positions with no in-built security” (p. 147). Along the
same lines, Sennett (1998) describes this shift as one towards workforce “flexibility.”
Therefore, in this state of perpetual uncertainty and instability, U.S. workers have become
more like “tinkerers” (Bauman, 2000, p. 139) or “players” (Bauman, 2000, p. 147)
balancing their objectives and focusing on short-term goals. Or as one of my participants,
Deric, said about work in the information economy: “you’ve got to hustle.” In a similar
vein, sociologist Ulrich Beck (2000) submits that this new “world of work” is
characterized by uncertainty, precariousness and risk.
Whereas in solid modernity workers felt more protected to take some economic
risks, I contend that in the era of neoliberalism, those at the economic margins who have
the least protections have become financially risk averse. Or as Bauman (2000) clarifies,

53
when you have no social safety net to catch you, the “responsibility resting on one’s own
shoulders’ portends a paralyzing fear of risk and failure” (Bauman, 2000, p. 19).
However, this is an argument I am making that is contrary to a standard view in the field
of digital labor studies. While risk is embraced as an entrepreneurial value and
particularly celebrated among the high-tech minority (Neff, 2012; Rumberger & Levin,
1985), the poor and working class occupy a very different position in the economy and
are thus bound by a different decision matrix, particularly when it comes to risk. In other
words, I propose a materialist understanding of risk. For example, the liquid laborers I
will later introduce – Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron – were unwilling to take great financial
risks in their business ventures because they feared it would lead to economic ruin.
Instead, they pursued flexible strategies, relying on small cash exchanges (hence my term
“liquid labor”) and made only small up-front investments in their enterprises. At the same
time, liquid laborers assumed other risks: they invested considerable time into their
ventures without knowing if they would ever earn any income. In other words, while I
agree with Beck (2000) and Deuze (2006) that “risk” is a defining feature of liquid life, I
suggest that “liquid laborers” assume the most risk, circulate in the most precarious
survival circuits (Sassen, 2003), and contend with the greatest life uncertainties.
Also drawing on Bauman’s (2000) theories, media scholar Mark Deuze (2006,
2011) applies the concept of “liquid modernity” to analyze how media has catalyzed a
collapse between work and leisure, production and consumption (Deuze, 2006, 2011;
Jenkins, 2006). Following from this, he argues that in the modern media landscape, all
workers are subsumed into the precarity of liquid modernity:

54
This also means that the precarity of contemporary life through media extends to
each and every one of us, and cannot be said to be beholden to a particular group,
race, class or gender – even though life’s current precariousness means different
things to different people in different settings (Deuze, 2006, p. 12).
In this quote, Deuze (2006) rightly suggests that all workers are vulnerable to the
precarities of global capitalism, including the shifts to contracted, part-time and flexwork. While Deuze (2006) acknowledges that this means “different things to different
people” and that some segments of the population do not have access to ICTs, he goes on
to cite Wikipedia editors and open source software programmers as evidence that we all
engage in “participatory cooperation” online (p. 12). I would point out that much in the
same way as Jenkins (2006), these examples emphasize a classed type of online
engagement and, moreover, ignore the inherent power imbalances that surround the
acquisition of –and interaction with –technologies (Eubanks, 2011). Therefore, I am
asserting in this dissertation that how precarity is experienced by “different people” is, in
fact, of the upmost importance. So, in contrast to Deuze (2006, 2011), I highlight
Bauman’s (2000) discussion of the breakdown of durable social support institutions in
my dissertation, as I contend that the dissolution of the welfare state has played a very
significant role in the shift to precarious work, particularly for the American working
class.
In sum, where Marxist feminism clarifies and historicizes the relationship
between reproductive labor and precarious low/non-wage labor, Bauman (2000) situates
the trends of precarious work within the contemporary information economy, the
breakdown of social support, and discourses of neoliberalism. Additionally, Bauman

55
(2000) helps us better understand why liquid laborers value flexibility and avoid financial
risk-taking. Yet, how is it that these unusual online work practices are occurring in the
context of federally funded broadband programs focused on job skills and job training?
Why does Mr. Wilson cite his job loss as the reason he will not adopt broadband? Mosco
(2004) contributes some relevant concepts for thinking about the cultural and symbolic
significance of contemporary broadband programs intended to address economic
turbulence in the era of liquid modernity. Mosco’s (2004) theory is particularly useful in
helping us better understand these digital practices and attitudes, and following from this,
the program’s unintended consequences.
Work and Digital Myths: Policy Discourses of Broadband Programs
So, how do we understand the economic lives of BTOP participants not only in
the context of liquid modernity, but in the more specific context of the Freedom Rings
Partnership? What are some possible explanations for the gap between policy intentions
around digital labor and these on-the-ground digital labor practices, a gap I have termed
in this project as one occurring between “policymakers” and “policytakers”? In his book,
The Digital Sublime: Myth, Power and Cyberspace, Vincent Mosco (2004) provides a
useful template for analyzing the common policy discourses that underpin broadband
programs like BTOP and thus motivate the goals of workforce development. More
specifically, he argues that computer technologies should be understood not simply as
material (the technologies themselves) or political (accompanied by regulations,
programs and policies) but also as cultural because they occupy a realm of “myth” (p.
10). To explain, according to Mosco (2004), to analyze contemporary broadband
programs, it is necessary to consider the “central myths” of the digital sublime (p. 2) that

56
underpin them, such as the myth that digital technology can proffer a quick and easy
solution to a complex array of social problems like poverty and inequality (p. 2). Further,
Mosco’s theory can contribute something unique alongside Marxist feminism’s
arguments on reproductive labor and Bauman’s concept of liquid modernity as it
provides an explanation of how and why technology programs endure, even as discourses
of neoliberalism and individualism fuel policies of retrenchment and government funds
for programs are slashed.
What Are “Digital Myths?” - Why Broadband Programs Endure
Before I apply this theory to my analysis of BTOP policy and KEYSPOT
program participants, how does Mosco (2004) define a “digital myth”? It is important to
clarify that digital myths are not deceptions or falsehoods, rather, they are important
structuring principles that inform and shape our reality. Consequently, they provide a
sense of meaning – validating that our historical moment is special– and help us imagine
that the tools we build will be uniquely transformative. These myths, developing
Bauman’s (2000) insights on liquid modernity, are that all new major technologies
signify a new era and transcend power/material conditions (Mosco, 2004). Through
tracing the discourses surrounding the evolution of various technologies, such as
electricity and the radio, Mosco (2004) reveals that such “myths” remain consistent over
time. The grounding insight here is critical: although digital technology may reorganize
labor in liquid modernity in significant and measurable ways, it is important to
distinguish between the real, measurable changes from the more generalized (and inbuilt)
myths of constant progress and change. In this way, an ethnographic study of the real
ways digital technology is utilized in the economic lives of everyday people like Joanne

57
or Mr. Wilson is useful, as it breaks apart actual technological practices from
technological myths.
To return to Mosco’s (2004) point on how this relates to broadband policies
around workforce development, he argues that these myths directly shape our thinking
around the types of economic opportunity new technologies can (or cannot) provide. The
digital myth suggests that as ICTs help decouple capital from the constraints of time,
space, and the body of the worker in advanced economies, businesses will boom and
workers will grow rich (Mosco, 2004, p. 89). This is the myth of the internet providing
“riches” that I will further examine further in Chapter 4. Mosco (2004) explains that this
assumption of “riches” –as well as the celebration of “virtual corporations” (p. 15) and
“flexible specialization” (p. 89) (to echo Bauman, 2000) –is a consequence of our innate
belief that technological development is “linear” and therefore always represents human
progress. Said differently, the myth of linearity and progress impedes our ability to fully
critique the emergence of new technologies because their diffusion is viewed as both
inevitable and natural. As a practical example, in this framework, Mr. Wilson’s attitudes
and beliefs towards technology would be immediately viewed as “backwards” or “oldfashioned,” even though his beliefs have been shaped by his unique economic position in
the information economy and the loss of his job at the bowling alley.
Thus, while Bauman (2000) argues that durable governmental structures and
investments in social programs are dissolving in the transition to liquid modernity, Mosco
(2004) helps explain why programs like BTOP can endure. Mosco (2004) argues that
technology is one of the areas in which government can maintain relevance – as such,
politicians want to be associated “with the totems of cyberspace” (p. 43) and therefore “a

58
political photo opportunity often includes a computer” (p. 43). Why is this the case?
Mosco (2000) indicates that because ICTs are a tool that is seen to provide individuals
with unprecedented access to free and low-cost information for self-education and for
expanding their personal economic opportunities, digital technology is uniquely
compatible with the undercurrents of neoliberalism and individualism in our society. Said
differently, technology programs are so palatable to the public and policymakers
precisely because they fit with the overarching values of neoliberalism. In short, these
programs suggest that with the right technological access and skills, individuals can forge
new economic opportunities to lift themselves out of poverty. Of course, as an added
bonus, once individuals obtain said digital access and skills and have pulled themselves
up by their bootstraps (so to speak), the government can effectively retrench the welfare
state even further.
In this way, Mosco (2004) argues that cyberspace provides a “mythic gloss” (p.
15) to the individualism narrative. Under this dominant narrative, poor and working-class
liquid laborers like Joanne or Deric would be heralded as self-sufficient digital
entrepreneurs rather than viewed as struggling parents circulating in a set of precarious
dead-end survival strategies (Sassen, 2003). Therefore, these digital myths are
particularly powerful and enduring because as Mosco (2004) points out:
“It is a story about how ever smaller, faster, cheaper, and better computer
communication technologies help to realize, with little effort, those seemingly
impossible dreams of democracy and community with practically no pressure on
the natural environment.” (p. 31)

59
As Mosco explains above, governmental programs like BTOP are popular and easier to
sell to the public because digital myths tell us that broadband access is a “smaller, faster,
cheaper” solution for addressing a range of societal problems, such as promoting political
engagement or expanding economic opportunities for the poor. And, as I will address in
Chapter 4, this myth that technologies can overcome power structures and extant material
conditions is imbedded in many of the policy discourses around BTOP and the related
KEYSPOTs programs. Finally, while I am focusing on Mosco’s (2004) contribution for
my theoretical framework, in the next chapter where I map extant scholarship I will also
review the research of related scholars who build on these arguments to explain how
myths may also operate as ideologies in technology policy.
Conclusion
To better ground this analysis, this chapter presented a critical framework for
positioning the economic lives of poor and working-class participants like Joanne or Mr.
Wilson in BTOP. As discussed, this framework draws on three primary theoretical areas:
Marxist feminism, liquid modernity and digital myths. This framework has been built to
respond to the research questions presented in Chapter 1, with Marxist feminism
exploring the relationship between digital work practices and reproductive labor.
Bauman’s (2000) concept of liquid modernity grounds these practices within the social
and economic context of the contemporary information economy whereas “digital myths”
sheds light on the policy discourses that motivate the goals of digital labor as articulated
through ARRA policy and related broadband adoption programs.
In this chapter, first the primary framework –a Marxist feminist approach –was
presented. This section traced the connections between productive and reproductive

60
work, focusing on how the necessity of reproductive labor can generate new working
arrangements for participants like Joanne across gender, racial and class lines. Further, I
discussed how the needs of social reproduction are degraded in public policy in the era of
liquid modernity and likewise how childcare needs are dismissed and diminished in the
low-skilled, low-status jobs accessible to KEYSPOT job-seekers. Lastly, drawing on
Kollontai (1984), I argued that lack of affordable childcare access is a major obstacle for
working class families and shapes their economic lives and thus the type of work they
pursue, including opportunities in the informal sector.
Second, key concepts taken from Bauman’s (2000) sociological arguments on
“liquid modernity” were offered to position the research within the context of the
contemporary information economy, including the global and local shifts that create the
conditions in which liquid labor develops. As presented, Bauman (2000) argued that the
liquid era has been characterized by dismantling durable structures like the welfare state
as well as by a trending towards globalization, deregulation, privatization and
neoliberalism. Whereas in the industrial era (solid modernity), a worker was more fixed
to time and place, today capital – aided by digital technology – can easily seek cheap
labor globally, flowing through borders and boundaries. As a response to these social and
economic changes, American workers in liquid modernity must become more flexible
and adaptable, never relying on a single job or an institution to provide long-term
support. With no social support safety net, liquid laborers must also learn to mitigate
financial risk.
Lastly, Mosco’s (2004) concept of “digital myths” was discussed. I asserted that
this theory is useful for investigating the cultural and symbolic significance of

61
contemporary broadband programs, particularly in understanding how the goals of digital
labor are presented and developed. The digital myth – that technologies can transcend
power and material conditions – is especially relevant, as it implies that broadband access
(and associated programs) can break down structural and economic barriers. Said
differently, technology programs fit within the discourses of neoliberalism, suggesting
that if given the right access and skills, low-income individuals can pull themselves out
of poverty. Broadband programs receive wide governmental support, even in the era of
retrenchment, largely due to this belief. The myth of linearity and constant social
progress also impedes our ability to critically evaluate new technologies, as scholars are
more likely to focus on the benefits of digital inclusion rather than the ways technologies
may oppress poor communities or have constrained economic opportunities for
participants like Mr. Wilson.
While these three theoretical frameworks presented lend my dissertation shape
and purpose, the next chapter, Chapter 3, will provide a review of relevant literature in
the field. While the literature review chapter is intended to better orient and ground the
project, I also reinforce my possible areas of contribution to the current research in digital
labor and digital divide studies. Building on the theoretical framework I have herein
detailed, the areas of scholarship that I will now turn to are digital labor, the digital
divide, the digital workforce divide, informal work and relevant urban ethnographies.

62
Chapter 3
Previous Scholarship
Introduction
The three frameworks presented in Chapter 2 serve as the theoretical foundation
for this project, however this study is situated within –and informed by –a larger body of
scholarship as well. In short, extant research in the fields of digital labor, digital
inequality, the digital workforce divide, and urban economic survival strategies are
central to this study. Thus, it is necessary to delve into this wider body of literature which
can better categorize forms of digital labor; explain sources of digital labor exploitation;
contextualize digital inequality and policy implications; address barriers to employment
in the formal informational economy; and, closely explore informal economic survival
strategies.
Therefore, in this chapter, first I will review related research in digital labor
studies. This research helps to situate liquid labor and informal digital work within the
context of contemporary information economy. I will concentrate on digital labor
practices but also possible sources of exploitation. I will address feminist, autonomist
Marxist, structuralist Marxist and cultural studies critiques of “immaterial” and
“affective” labor. Considering possible user motivations for engaging in precarious
digital work is also relevant to my project, particularly reviewing the scholarship on the
ideology of “risk-taking” as it directly intersects with Bauman’s (2000) theory. Following
from this, I will explore research that argues that digital laborers accept their exploitative
conditions in the “hope” that such work can lead to more rewarding work or better formal
opportunities.

63
Second, I will review the digital inequality scholarship, as it provides a roadmap
to trace how the goals of digital labor have evolved in U.S. broadband policy and
programs like KEYSPOTs. Thus, to interpret the larger goals of ICT workforce
development projects like BTOP, I begin by outlining the relevant academic and policy
literature, exploring the transition from a digital “access” to a digital “skills” policy
focus. I here also give attention to critical research that pushes back on the strict “access”
and “skills” focus and highlights some of the structural limitations to economic
opportunity, as these limitations profoundly shape interactions between low-income
participants like Mr. Wilson and ICTs. I also touch on the implications of technology
policy embracing the undercurrents of individualism Mosco (2004) touches on, such as
policy research that has promoted privatization and ICT deregulation efforts. I argue this
embrace of neoliberalism played a key role in how the goals of digital labor were
conceptualized in both the BTOP and KEYSPOT programs.
Third, I will examine the growing digital workforce divide literature (RodinoColocino, 2006) as this research marks the disconnect between how work is defined in
technology policy and what work can in reality be attained by low-income job seekers
like Joanne who visited KEYSPOTs. This framework of a “digital workforce divide”
rather than a “digital divide” helps to highlight structural barriers to economic
opportunity and complicates the “access” and “skills” policy focus. It also better
addresses the “digital myths” that Mosco (2004) cautions policymakers about. Yet, how
do the digital workforce divide trends connect to the information economy more broadly?
Here, I will be emphasizing that although the tech economy offers unprecedented
opportunities, these benefits are reaped primarily by a “high tech minority” (Rumberger

64
& Levin, 1985). In other words, this project is aligned with scholars who suggest that
low-status and low-skilled precarious workers perform critical tasks and generate massive
wealth for the digital economy through their exploited online labor, yet, these workers
can remain functionally invisible. I will also consider research that explores how this
workforce divide specifically impacts marginalized groups (like those attending
KEYSPOTs) across class, race and gender lines.
Lastly, I will investigate the impediments to formal work for low-income urban
communities like those visiting KEYSPOTs by looking closely at scholarship that
considers the economic lives of the urban poor; the impact of workforce churn;
globalization; the retrenchment of the welfare state; and, unionization issues. The
flexible, low-risk survival strategies necessitated by these conditions will be analyzed,
and special attention will be given to research that can provide clarity on why
reproductive labor shapes informal practices (and accordingly liquid labor) for
participants like Joanne. I end my review with this area of scholarship because it links
back nicely to the exploitation of digital labor literature, providing deeper insight into the
linked relationships between the economic lives of BTOP participants and the
contemporary information economy. Having sketched out the key research areas I will
review, I will now turn to my first area – digital labor studies.
The Exploitation of Digital Labor
The emergence of online work is a significant feature in the economic lives of
KEYSPOT participants, and therefore a critical dimension of this dissertation. So, what is
the relationship between informal work or “liquid labor” and the contemporary
information economy in advanced capitalism? Are these new online work practices I

65
have touched on vis-à-vis Joanne exploitative or liberating – do they abuse vulnerable
users or instead provide tools for economic empowerment and creative expression? These
subjects are taken up and debated extensively by the scholars I will review in this chapter.
However, before I delve into this research, it is important to highlight pertinent
arguments from Chapter 2 that connect to this literature. For example, Bauman (2000)
claims that we are now entering a period of “liquid modernity” where durable institutions
and welfare state protections are being dismantled. The impact of this shift is that labor
has been decoupled from place, time and the body of the laborer. Aided by ICTs, capital
can now easily flee protected union workers in the U.S. and seek cheap labor abroad. And
as outlined by Mosco (2004), the exploitation of this labor has proliferated because the
myth of the digital sublime suggests that technology offers a route out of poverty. In
other words, the exploitative dimensions of digital technology – crystallized in Mr.
Wilson’s experience –are often overlooked and underexamined. So, building on Bauman
(2000) and Mosco (2004), to better situate liquid labor practices within the contemporary
information economy, first I will present the “immaterial labor” and “affective labor”
scholarship that categorizes these new practices. Then I will move to scholarship that can
speak to the possible motivations behind pursuing digital labor, especially in light of
some of the exploitative dimensions of this work that the immaterial and affective labor
scholars describe.
Conceptualizing Digital Labor: Immaterial Labor
So, whereas this project focuses more narrowly on the economic lives and online
work practices of poor and working-class participants through the context of KEYSPOTs
in BTOP, media studies researchers have examined how digital labor practices take shape

66
among different populations, industries, countries and cultural communities. Although
scholars have taken positions for and against the emergence of digital labor, the standard
view is that digital labor is now fundamental to the production of value in the modern
informational economy. To explain, “digital labor” practices range from creating opensource software, writing a blog, or even creating e-books like Joanne did. However,
rather than refer to these new forms as “digital labor,” Hardt and Negri (2001, 2005,
2009) and Lazzarato (1996) and describe this as “immaterial labor,” a kind of digital
labor that commodifies information. Scholars like Terranova (2000) have emphasized
that the skills needed to produce this immaterial labor are often self-taught and that the
tools utilized to produce such value may be owned by an individual rather than a
company, organization, or institution. I would note again here that one of the reasons I
am not using the term “immaterial” in my study is because I am arguing that “liquid
labor” practices significantly incorporate both immaterial and material elements. For
example, Joanne created both immaterial (e-books) and material products (political
buttons). However, it is important to add that whereas “immaterial labor” is the dominant
term in the field, scholars have sought to categorize and mark these emerging forms in
various ways. These terms include simply “digital labour” (Fuchs, 2010; Scholz, 2013)
but also “hope labor” (Kuehn and Corrigan, 2013), “aspirational labor” (Duffy, 2015),
“venture labor” (Neff, 2012), “playbor” (Bulut, 1014; Kücklich, 2005) and “passionate
labor” (Postigo, 2007).
How do scholars in these fields appraise the impact of “immaterial labor”? In the
critical digital labor camp, Marxist scholars such as Andrejevic (2008) and Fuchs (2010,
2012, 2014) complain that immaterial labor is inherently exploitative. Conversely,

67
autonomist Marxist scholars (who champion a bottom-up approach to resistance as
discussed in Chapter 2) and cultural studies scholars (who focus on how specific
communities create cultural artifacts and messages) insist that this critique is too harsh
and dismisses the participatory pleasures such digital labor can provide as well as the
potential to generate cultural or social value (Alessandrini, 2012; Arvidsson, 2009,
Jenkins, 2006; Virno, 2004). I recognize that liquid labor has cultural value –Joanne’s ebooks make an important cultural contribution– yet, this project is aligned with critical
scholars like Fuchs (2010, 2012, 2014), as the autonomist Marxist and cultural studies
accounts do not address how issues of digital access and social class can uniquely shape
digital practices. In other words, these accounts overlook the ways in which Joanne’s
practices are shaped by her social and economic position and the fact that they are part of
her complex set of urban survival strategies.
Conceptualizing Digital Labor: Affective Labor
To pivot here and provide more detailed scholarship on immaterial labor, one
subset of immaterial labor practices that has been the subject of ongoing debate among
feminist media scholars –and interacts with Marxist feminist theories on reproductive
labor –is “affective labor.” In short, these scholars insist that “affective labor” is unique,
because it is when value is extracted from our social and communal “labor” on sites like
Facebook or Twitter (Weeks, 2009). As a simple example, when we engage in a
conversation with a friend on Facebook, this is profitable for Facebook as they can in turn
sell this data to advertisers. Terranova (2000) subsequently explains that in this way, the
production of “affects” has now been subsumed into the logic of capitalism. Channeling
Bauman (2000), Fuchs (2014) argues that this sale of our affective labor has collapsed the

68
boundaries between work and play –rendering them “liquid” (Fuchs, 2014, p. 7).
Furthermore, as digital technology helps capital improve the efficiency with which it can
capture “affects” and make them profitable (recalling the Marxist feminist point) the
boundaries between productive and reproductive work similarly begin to blur. In other
words, the affective labor scholars point out that we generate economic value online even
when simply chatting with our friends on social media sites like Facebook.
I would also highlight here that in this affective labor literature, the conception of
the “housewifized labor” (Fuchs, 2014) or “digital housewife” (Jarrett, 2015) is meant to
draw a link between the affective, creative online labor of women and social
reproduction. Said another way, these scholars are echoing the types of critiques of the
invisible, exploited work of the housewife as also expressed by Marxist feminists in the
Wages of Housework campaign as I addressed in Chapter 2. In other words, this line of
argumentation suggests that the contemporary media user is exploited much in the same
manner as the traditional housewife, as the material and immaterial labor produced as a
result of the media user’s online interactions is captured by capital to sell products and
likewise gain profitable audience data (Jarrett, 2015; Turow, 2008). Andrejevic (2008),
Fuchs (2014) and Mies (1986) draw on a slightly more relaxed conception of the
“housewife” arguing that it is more generally a type of “super-exploitation” of precarious
digital workers– such as fans in the case of Andrejevic (2008) or call center workers in
the case of Fuchs (2014). In contrast, however, this project is more closely aligned with
scholars like Jarrett (2015) and Ouelette and Wilson (2011, p. 559), as they argue that
such work should be understood as shaped by factors like gender. However, I would add

69
that my assertion in this project is that the dimensions of class and race also deserve more
attention in such affective labor studies and digital labor scholarship more widely.
To emphasize my main points, although I agree on all the above points around the
gendered division of digital labor and the possible forms of super-exploitation, the
primary focus of this previous research is on middle-class users who through their
enjoyment and online interaction generate economic value. As an example, according to
Fortunati (2007), sites such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace extract economic value from
the sociability, friendship, or the “affect” of women which can result in alienation (p.
426). Yet, this research does not consider how lack of access to ICTs or mobile access
could change affective labor and correspondingly its exploitation online. Furthermore, the
immaterial labor literature overwhelmingly focuses on middle class users and/or those
with consistent ICT access. For instance, Jenkin’s (2008) framework that views
immaterial labor as “participatory media culture” obscures the time and resources (like
ICT access) needed to participate in this culture to begin with. Further, it does not
consider that those who are most likely to find economic success in immaterial creative
production are those who already have social or economic privileges. Said differently, I
am arguing that in its overwhelming focus on sites of cultural and creative production,
immaterial and affective labor scholarship is often afflicted with one of the following
blindspots: 1) assuming regular broadband access; or, 2) downplaying or ignoring the
roles of gender, race and class in structuring relationships with technology. Because
while liquid laborers like Joanne may find value and emotional reward in digital labor,
the socioeconomic context that necessitates such work is of great consequence.
Therefore, my position is aligned with critical Marxist scholars like Fuchs (2014) who

70
appropriately observes that just because work feels fun does not mean that it is not
exploitative (p. 133).
The Slippery Promises of Liquid Labor
Given the exploitative conditions already discussed in the context of the
immaterial and affective labor literature, the question remains: why do individuals choose
to engage in online work? What other factors may motivate liquid laborers like Joanne?
Whereas individual workers of course enter into digital labor for many personal and
professional reasons, scholars like Neff (2012) argue that cultural shifts towards
neoliberalism and a related celebration of risk and entrepreneurialism may keep digital
laborers devoted to such work, even as it may provide little to no pay. Others like Kuehn
& Corrigan (2013) suggest that digital laborers continue to engage in precarious work
due to a “hope” that it will eventually payoff and they will find a better opportunity, such
as a full-time job with benefits. To preface an argument that I make later in this study, I
suggest that whereas liquid laborers like Joanne may perceive themselves as
entrepreneurs, per Bauman (2000), they are in fact economically risk-averse and engage
in flexible practices due to structural limitations. Said another way, it is important to
consider the materialist dimension of risk. Through presenting the experience of liquid
laborers like Sky in Chapter 7, I will side with scholars who have argued that precarious
workers are motivated by the “hope” that their labor will eventually payoff and they will
transition into a stable job. That being said, I will now turn to consider these positions
and related scholarship in greater depth.
Risk and digital labor. In her book, Venture Labor: Work and the Burden of Risk
in Innovative Industries, Neff (2012) argues that an “ideology of risk” is deeply

71
embedded within capitalism and particularly within the information economy. To
explain, per Neff (2012) this ideology tells us that smart risk-taking, hard work, and
determination are always rewarded. This is again connected to neoliberalism –economic
inequality is viewed through this framework not a societal failure, but rather, a failure of
“personal pluck.” To make her argument, Neff (2012) draws on the embrace of
entrepreneurial values among Silicon Valley high tech workers during the dot com boom.
Among this group of workers, she suggests, precarious digital labor became highly
casualized and even celebrated – financial risk-taking and hovering on a precipice
between economic fortune and destruction was framed as “cool” (Neff, 2012). Aligned
with Bauman (2000), she suggests that in the modern era (liquid modernity) in which
individuals face declining protections and job instability, entrepreneurialism and risktaking behavior emerges, in part, due to a lack of economic options. Yet, I would point
out that the high-tech workers Neff (2012) analyzed are located in a more privileged
gender, race, and class position relative to the KEYSPOT job seekers in my study. So,
although the embrace of self-reliance strategies more broadly that I discuss later in this
project are quite similar among Neff’s (2012) participants and my own, the participants’
underlying motivations and justifications for engaging in precarious digital work are
quite different. Accordingly, I will argue that my participants worked, instead, to mitigate
financial risk through their liquid labor practices. Nonetheless, I introduce Neff’s (2012)
work for her useful attention to this dimension of risk and because that point of
divergence among my participants seems significant. Thus, Neff’s (2012) findings
gleaned from a more economic privileged set of participants reinforces how class position
can shape these motivations for precarious labor.

72
“Hopes” and “aspirations” for better work. I have already reviewed some of
the ways in which digital labor can be exploitative. I want to underscore that precarious
digital labor, however, is not promoted as exploitation – in addition to Neff (2012), other
digital labor scholars insist that it is promoted as a path to better work. For instance, it
can be framed as a path to finding more rewarding work in the formal sector– work you
“love” –or a chance to create a desirable, stable job for yourself in the informal sector
(Bulut, 2014, p. 254, Duffy, 2015; p. 2, Postigo, 2007). But what is more important here
is that the underlying motivation for pursuing informal digital opportunities may not be to
acquire an immediate or concrete reward, but rather the motivation is the “hope” (Kuehn
& Corrigan, 2013) that it will lead to formal work; or, an “aspiration” (Duffy, 2015) that
it can translate to more fulfilling work. This was a similar motivation guiding a
participant in my study who I will introduce later, Sky, who was a part-time model and
aspiring fashion designer.
To return to the extant literature and expand on the arguments from studies in this
area, in their research on the digital labor of unpaid bloggers for Sports Blog Nation
(SBN) and consumer reviewers for Yelp, Kuehn and Corrigan (2013) argued that the
participants interpreted their informal digital work as “stepping-stones” to future
opportunities, including full-time jobs (Kuehn & Corrigan, 2013, p. 14). And Duffy
(2015) found a similar motivation in her study of the digital labor of online fashion and
beauty bloggers who “aspired” for greater financial gain and recognition. Connecting to
Neff’s (2012) insights as well, Bulut (2014) suggests that video game testers are
motivated to engage in precarious digital labor because it is “cool” and –similar to
Duffy’s (2015) fashion bloggers – game testers articulate that it is work they are very

73
“passionate” about (Bulut, 2014, p. 241). Yet, as these scholars point out, herein lies an
unfortunate paradox. To gain full employment, better working conditions, or a fulfilling
job, a “hope” laborer must first readily perform work either for free or for meager pay. As
such, “hope labor” should be understood not only as a motivation for the digital worker
but also as a circular feedback loop reinforcing exploitative labor conditions. Said
differently, an individual’s willingness to participate in the circuit of exploitation only
adds to an already large pool of cheap labor, effectively decreasing the likelihood that
she/he will ever receive better compensation. In short, digital laborers may be caught in a
vicious cycle.
Nonetheless, similarly to the immaterial labor and affective labor scholarship, the
hope/aspirational labor literature captures the various practices and personal motivations
for pursuing flexible working arrangements among elite or middle-class laborers. For
instance, in her study of successful beauty bloggers, Duffy (2015) points out that her
most successful participants conform to “heteronormative standards of beauty” and
tended to have racial and class privileges (Duffy, 2015, p. 13 – 14). Therefore, while this
previous literature is useful at helping us better understand the “hope” motivations
driving participants in my dissertation like Joanne or Sky, it does not provide insight into
how the immaterial or informal economy is utilized by the poor and working class more
specifically. In sum, I am arguing that this significant literature gap in the immaterial,
affective, and “hope” labor literature reinforces the potential contribution of this study. I
suggest that my project can shed light on the intersection of digital labor with other class
related factors like poverty and digital inequality, a subject I will turn to now.

74
The Informational City and the Digital Divide
In my review of previous research examining digital labor and its relationship to
the contemporary information economy, I have emphasized that my study examines a
different group of digital laborers – poor and working-class users who visit KEYSPOTs
due to lack of broadband access and/or digital skills. Thus, building on this research, this
project is also located within a larger literature on digital inequality, or a literature which
seeks to address how the lack of broadband access can potentially shape economic, social
or cultural opportunities. It is likewise critical to include the digital inequality research in
my review as it helps better explain how the goals of digital labor evolved in broadband
policy, and correspondingly, in BTOP programs like KEYSPOTs. In this section, I will
explore the policy shift from a broadband “access” focus (first wave) to a broadband
“skills” focus (second wave). I will then highlight critical research that complicates the
“access” and “skills” model (third wave). Finally, I will investigate how the embrace of
privatization and deregulation in policy scholarship may have shaped the goals of digital
labor as articulated in U.S. broadband policy, and by extension, BTOP.
What is the Digital Divide?
To better contextualize the goals of digital labor as articulated in U.S. broadband
policy and investigate the mismatch between policymakers –and what I will term
“policytakers” in Chapter 4 –it is useful to first review the broader scholarship that
examines the intersection of broadband access and inequality, known as the digital
divide. What is the digital divide? The metaphor is meant to describe discrepancies in
information access, specifically in terms of access to Information Communication
Technologies (ICTs). To fully understand the term and its usage in policy, however, it is

75
useful to provide some background on the principle of universal service. The concept of
universal service, i.e. universal access to “wire and radio communication,” was a central
piece of legislation in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC)
Communications Act of 1934 (Federal Communications, 1934). To summarize,
policymakers of the period argued that because communication technologies such as the
telephone or radio were central to economic opportunity and political participation,
efforts should be made to ensure they are accessible to all Americans. The subsequent
digital divide research began from a similar concept of universal service, arguing that a
social contract around ICTs would be needed, as they similarly facilitate “opportunity,
participation and prosperity” (Schement, 2009, p. 3). While universal service continued
to serve as a guiding principle, these specific themes of “participation” and economic
“prosperity” were very important foundational concepts that shaped the early goals of
U.S. broadband programs as well4. I draw attention to these frames because I will discuss
both further in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, as they shaped the underlying goals of
broadband policy, and accordingly the BTOP and KEYSPOT programs (Schement &
Curtis, 1997).
The First Wave: Investigating Digital Access
Following from the concept of universal service, the first wave of scholarship
around the digital divide primarily explored issues of broadband access. Early federal
reports began to discuss government intervention and policy for “universal service” –and
particularly germane to this project –economic activity. These included the now famous

The subsequent FCC Telecommunications Act of 1996 decision began to adopt
principles guiding universal service for telecommunications (Federal
Telecommunications, 1996).
4

76
Falling Through the Net series as well as the U.S. Department of Commerce reports on
the Digital Economy in the 1990’s, both of which will be discussed in more depth in
Chapter 4. This theme of access to technology as necessary to locate economic
opportunities filtered down to the scholarly literature and influenced program
development and future policy papers on the digital divide. As Hoffman, Novak and
Schlosser (2001) argue, the U.S. government explicitly proclaimed in these early
documents that technology strengthens economic opportunity, focusing more heavily on
the “prosperity” dimension of universal service rather than political “participation.” The
BTOP project more broadly through ARRA continued to borrow this language and ideas
around digital labor, and again the impact of these discourses will likewise be examined
in more depth in Chapter 4.
To return to the extant scholarship, later first wave U.S. digital divide research
began to examine how economic disparities influenced Internet adoption. For example, a
federal survey of about 54,000 households conducted in October 2009 revealed glaring
demographic disparities in broadband access and adoption rates (National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2010). For instance, Jansen (2010)
concluded that about 95% of Americans who live in households earning $75,000 or more
annually go online “at least occasionally.” By contrast, just 70% of household members
earning less than $75,000 reported similar Internet usage (Jansen, 2010). In this sense,
impediments to prosperity – such as poverty – began to be considered by scholars in the
digital access focused research.
While income is pertinent to digital access, notably some research in this camp
concluded that “technophobia” keeps potential users from obtaining a broadband

77
connection (Digital Impact Group, 2009). However, this project is more aligned with the
view of third wave critical research, as I will argue throughout this study that
“technophobia” (for instance) is an insufficient explanation for non-adoption. To
elaborate, alongside Eubanks (2011), Wolfson et al. (2017) and Wyatt (2008), I insist that
poor and working-class individuals – such as Mr. Wilson –may resist or reject technology
if they have not benefited politically, socially, or economically from digital tools. In other
words, while I am attuned to how economic disparities shape the online habits and work
practices of KEYSPOT job seekers, this project intends to contribute an alternative social
and political framework to analyze how economic and class position may shape
interactions with, and attitudes around, technology.
Second Wave: Digital Skills for Digital Jobs
Moving beyond issues of an access “divide” or digital prosperity, second wave
researchers critiqued the scope of first wave scholarship as too limited, as it failed to
advocate for policies that would in fact help marginalized communities use digital tools
once access was established. Accordingly, this new second wave literature, attempted to
“redefine” (Gumpert & Drucker, 2002) and “go beyond” (Jung, Qiu & Kim, 2001;
Mossberger, Tolbert & Stansbury, 2003) previous frameworks. Thus, this groups of
scholars focused on skills issues like digital literacy and resource richness, and likewise
explored qualitative differences in the use of technologies (Hargittai, 2008; Mossberger et
al., 2003; Sevron, 2002; Warschaeur, 2003). In short, rather than see access as the aim of
broadband programs, the skills focused scholars asserted that the goal should be to

78
promote “meaningful use” of ICTs5 (Mossberger et al., 2003). Henceforth, scholars such
as Mossberger Tolbert, Bowen and Jimenez (2012) argued that researchers should view
the digital divide problem as “multidimensional,” as it is influenced by a divide of access
and skills as well as economic opportunity and democratic participation (Mossberger et
al., 2012, p. 1.) The conclusions derived from second wave research shaped the goals of
future broadband programs like BTOP, as this research raised the possibility that targeted
digital skills training programs could promote economic opportunity –and in doing so,
serve as a partial solution to some of the problems presented by widespread workforce
volatility and unemployment in the era of liquid modernity.
Some digital divide scholars would, of course, correctly point out that obtaining
digital skills has always been a policy priority for the U.S. government, particularly in
digital education. For instance, the e-rate program established in the 1990’s connected
eligible schools and libraries with discounted ICT access. And the National
Telecommunications Infrastructure Administration’s (NTIA) research reports in the
1990’s, including the Falling Through the Net series to be investigated in Chapter 4,
indicated that poor and working-class minority urban residents with online skills were
more likely to use the internet to engage in workforce related tasks (Compaine, 2001, p.
41). Ultimately, however, it is important to emphasize that second wave scholarship
expanded this interest by arguing that not only can broadband give poor and workingclass individuals access to job postings or online educational opportunities, but that
imparting digital skills can, in fact, help low income Americans obtain better jobs

Strover (2014) also points out that the terminology of “meaningful use” is a derivative
of language from the health field, often utilized in discussions around technology and
health search.
5

79
(Mossberger et al., 2012, p. 80). By extension, it was implied that a digital skills
education would improve the capabilities of the U.S. workforce and could thus advance
the interests of the national economy incrementally (Mossberger et al., 2012, p. 5).
While I would agree that scholarship in the areas of digital access and skills has
been fundamental in the effort to craft useful and data driven policy and that the goals of
political participation are especially important to marginalized communities (as I will
address in the next chapter), the broader issue is that whereas access was a more concrete
goal, “skills” was obviously less defined. Who decides what counts for “meaningful use,”
for example? Is it meaningful to use the internet to search for a formal sector job and less
meaningful to use it to watch YouTube music videos, for instance? In many cases, those
who defined what was “meaningful” were more aligned with the policymaker perspective
and thus had a different economic and social position relative to poor and working-class
users like Joanne or Mr. Wilson, the group I term the “policytakers” in Chapter 4. This
unfortunately reinforced a top-down approach to crafting broadband training programs
for economic development that were, in many cases, out of sync with the economic lives
of intended participants. As a result, programs were inattentive to the myriad structural
and social impediments to finding formal work in the contemporary information
economy, a subject I explore in this project. So, although the skills focused research
provided creative ideas on how to use training to improve economic conditions for lowincome communities, it has fallen short in its ability track and understand how such skills
are utilized within the contemporary information economy. Furthermore, it has often
overlooked how technology is integrated into the everyday economic lives of poor and
working people, like Joanne or Mr. Wilson.

80
As another challenge, some of the access and skills centered scholarship
addressed ICT issues primarily through the technological lens, without deeper attention to
the surrounding structural issues that impacted both ICT access and digital skills. Further,
some of this research ignored the role of deregulation and privatization in contributing to
digital inequalities. For example, second wave scholars such as Fan, Dey and Peng
(2006) were more likely to advocate business partnerships as needed to promote the
acquisition of workforce development skills. In contrast, third wave research highlighted
some of the negative impacts of deregulation and corporate partnerships to develop
broadband infrastructure and likewise shape the goals and mission of skills training
programs. I bring this up here as I will expand on this point more in the next chapter, as I
will (for example) demonstrate how a Microsoft associated consulting firm – The Arnold
Group (2011) –played a role in shaping the goals of the KEYSPOT program.
The Third Wave: Critiquing the “Access” and “Skills” Focus
Though it is true that the above first and second wave literature offers an
introduction to key themes and issues surrounding digital workforce development policy
and the goals of digital labor, much of this scholarship does not focus on the type of
structural inequalities that impact many BTOP and thus KEYSPOT participants. Thus, in
an effort to offer a more nuanced picture of the intersection between economic, social,
political, and digital exclusion, some critical digital divide scholars studying urban
community technology centers advocate for replacing the term “digital divide” with
“digital inequality” (Kvasny & Keil, 2006; Warschauer, 2003). As a related point,
Eubanks (2011) critiques the language of the “digital divide” as a starting point, as it
perpetuates a reductionist narrative that implies two separate but equal groups without

81
acknowledging the role of power, privilege, and exploitation in shaping ICT access and
interaction. As critical media studies scholar Rodino-Colocino (2012) notes, womentargeted broadband programs that insist computer skills training can improve both selfesteem and job prospects, “lets wider structural imbalances….off the hook” (p. 519). In
other words, Rodino-Colocino (2012) and others point out that the “access” and “skills”
focus risks overlooking the underlying issues of economic inequality that frame an
individual’s interaction with ICTs. Thus, building on this critical research, this study will
use the terminology of “digital inequality” where applicable. I suggest that this language
is better aligned with a critical study of the role of structural imbalances in perpetuating
inequality, and thus can position Joanne and Mr. Wilson’s experience within a larger
system of economic oppression and political marginalization.
Discourses of individualism and neoliberalism. Recognizing the shortcomings
in some of the first and second wave studies that address access and skills – and closely
aligned with Mosco’s (2004) fundamental claims regarding the myth of the digital
sublime– Clark, Demont-Heinrich and Webber (2004) observed that digital divide
debates are often shaped by a discourse of individualism. Said differently, rather than
examining the structural issues that can contribute to the lack of digital access (like lack
of education) or telling the lived experiences of those without digital resources,
conversations about broadband access and technology skills tend to focus on the
individual or on themes of self-reliance. In a similar vein, Gunkel (2003) asserts that
discussions of the digital divide also have an underlying technological determinism, or a
belief that technologies –rather than social relationships–determine the future. As Light
(2001) emphasizes, when complex social and economic problems are reduced to

82
technological issues, more investment in technology comes to be viewed as the primary
solution. As I will argue later, siding with scholars such as Stevenson (2008), this line of
thinking and the subsequent embrace of neoliberalism is reproduced in the federal Falling
Through the Net policy reports on the digital divide. Investing in more technology and
deregulating ICTs is pursued, while other state solutions – such as improving education,
raising the minimum wage, and expanding nutritional support programs –are ignored
(Stevenson, 2009). However, I would add here that I intend to expand on Stevenson’s
(2008) central claim around the discourses of neoliberalism in Falling Through the Net
through also contributing an analysis of BTOP and KEYSPOTs.
The above arguments from Clark et al. (2004), Gunkel (2003), Light (2001) and
Stevenson (2008) are aligned with Mosco’s (2004) arguments about the myth of the
digital sublime: investment in developing the “skills” capacity of an individual is
ideologically compatible with the values of neoliberalism and individualism, as it
proposes self-work as a path out of poverty. It also feeds into the narrative that skills
programs will reduce the need for social programs in the future, a claim that I will rebut
through the stories of KEYSPOT participants like Dinah in Chapter 6 and Deric in
Chapter 7. Considering how these visions shape the allocation of federal resources is
crucial, as it also foreshadows the disconnect between how policy is defined and the on
the ground realities that limit economic opportunities for poor and working class urban
Americans. In other words, it begins to expose the deeper disconnect between
policymakers and “policytakers.”
Structural impediment to finding economic opportunities. The second wave
research focus on digital skills also obscures the fundamental structural impediments to

83
finding new economic opportunities in the information economy. As a case in point, in
their study of digital access and skills training programs in the city of Austin, Staubhaar,
Tufecki, Spence and Rojas (2012) report that the modern informational city – or the
“technopolis” – does not necessarily translate into higher earnings for all city residents.
To elaborate, the Austin study found that digital access and skills were not the primary
factors preventing participants from successfully obtaining jobs in the tech field
(Staubhaar et al., 2012). Other factors were equally, if not more important, such as
educational requirements and social connections (Staubhaar et al., 2012, p. 26).
Furthermore, the authors argued that high tech cities may, paradoxically, adversely
impact poor and working urban people by raising rents and the cost of living for all
residents (Staubhaar et al., 2012, p.17). Underscoring the impediments that poor and
working-class jobseekers like those visiting KEYSPOT confront, Tufecki (2012) reminds
us that, “….it is not plausible for most of these people to obtain higher paid employment
– there simply are not enough jobs” (p.105). In making this commentary, Tufecki (2012)
urges us to consider that there is what I term in this study a broader “digital workforce
divide” (borrowing from scholars like Rodino-Colocino, 2006) that operates alongside
established patterns of digital inequality, constraining opportunities for low-income
communities. Said differently, while digital access and skills are useful in promoting
economic opportunity, skills alone cannot fundamentally alter the nature of the
information economy, nor provide the needed social connections or higher educational
degrees that many high-skilled, good paying jobs require.
Understanding this troubled terrain and the wider context is incredibly crucial to
analyzing KEYSPOTs, as ARRA utilized BTOP access and skills training programs with

84
the understanding that this would help combat joblessness in the wake of the Great
Recession (Tufecki, 2012, p. 85). These broadband programs, therefore, were predicated
on the assumption that there were better jobs awaiting workers after they acquired the
right digital skills (Tufecki, 2012). As Tufecki (2012) warns us, this premise is faulty in
that it “conflates two topics”: the digital access and skills barriers with the employment
barriers introduced by the broader restructuring of the labor market in the era of liquid
modernity (p. 85). From this perspective, policymakers overlook the role that ICTs have
played more widely in diminishing job opportunities for low-skilled workers like Mr.
Wilson and undercutting wages, a subject I will consider in greater depth in Chapter 6.
We can begin to see how the access/skills approach fails to appreciate some critical
dimensions of the digital labor problem, resulting in a set of unintended consequences
and new working arrangements which includes the emergence of the liquid labor
practices I catalog.
Access and Skills Policy: Embracing Privatization and Deregulation
Having now reviewed the first, second and third wave scholarship around digital
inequality, I will now briefly turn to policy research that has addressed how privatization
practices and deregulation can shape the goals of digital labor. When it comes to the topic
of broadband programs, as I will address in Chapter 4, another problem with maintaining
the emphasis on access and skills is that state and national broadband training efforts can
inadvertently serve marketing and deregulation ends rather than social goals. To provide
more background on this line of argumentation, Cooper and Kimmelman (2001)
complain that through allowing media deregulation, the Telecommunications Act of 1996
had a part in creating “monopolistic conditions” in which broadband became less

85
affordable, worsening digital inequality (p. 199). As a practical example of how this
relates to programs connected to KEYSPOTs, in their study of the RUS (Rural Utilities
Service) ARRA broadband deployment projects, LaRose, Strover, Gregg and Straubhaar
(2011) found that the threat of establishing public or subsidized telecommunications
services actually “stimulated” corporate investment in building infrastructure in rural
regions they had previously ignored (p. 97). In other words, the problem of digital
inequality in rural regions was only addressed by the ICT industry when the government
threatened to intervene. Therefore, in this project, I side with critical scholars like Lenert,
Christensen, Tufecki and Gustafson (2012): the free market is unconcerned with “equity
or fairness of the distribution of resources” and thus incompatible with the original
ambition of universal service or serving marginalized communities (Lenert et al., 2012,
p.117). Furthermore, partnering with industry on social programs often benefits the more
powerful players in the ICT and technology industry, to the detriment of innovation or
competition. For instance, the Gates Foundation’s 1995 project to offer free Microsoft
Word in public libraries was critiqued as expanding the influence of the Microsoft
corporation, possibly undermining growing open-source software movements (Lessig,
2002; Rodino-Colocino, 2006; Stevenson, 2008).
To reconnect to Philadelphia, as will be discussed in Chapter 4 and 5, ICT
provider solutions –such as the Comcast Internet Essentials program offering low cost
broadband to BTOP participants –reflected the private-sector’s solution to the complex
social and political issues surrounding digital access. In fact, municipal WiFi or a mesh
network would have been a much more sustainable solution for low-income
Philadelphians, and it was always unclear if Comcast’s rates would increase or hold

86
steady over time. This is sadly ironic, because as I will present in Chapter 4, Comcast
itself consistently lobbied against these moves towards community WiFi in an earlier
period. In other words, Comcast helped cause the need for such broadband programs by
their actions against the WiFi initiative, yet later offered the solution –as part of receiving
FCC approval of their NBC Universal corporate merger –which only further solidified
their future power in the media markets. I bring this up in the literature review because in
Chapter 4, I argue that industry is often a key stakeholder in broadband programs like
KEYSPOTs and therefore plays an important role in defining the goals of digital labor. In
all these ways, this critical turn – led by scholars who have contested the definition of
“digital divide,” challenged the undercurrents of individualism and technological
determinism in the dominant literature. This critical digital inequality research likewise
considered the role of private sector influence. Therefore, this critical scholarship
foregrounds my study of the economic lives of BTOP participants. Having addressed this
literature, I will now turn to consider other pertinent scholarship that can attend to the
economic lives of KEYSPOT visitors.
The Digital Workforce Divide
In my above review of the digital inequality literature that provides more insight
into how the goals of digital labor have been conceptualized and developed in U.S.
broadband policy, I have referred to a “disconnect” between this policy and the on-theground economic realities facing KEYSPOT job seekers. So, how can we better
understand their economic realities? What are the impediments to finding formal work
and, more importantly, can research shed light into how these barriers may connect to the
contemporary information economy? The widening pay gap between “high-skilled” and

87
“low-skilled” workers has led policymakers and many digital divide researchers to
conclude that access or digital skills are one of the key differentiating factors
(Mossberger, et al., 2012, p. 60; Tufecki, 2012, p. 88). Yet, as Rodino-Colocino (2006)
points out, digital divide scholarship often overestimates the impact of broadband access
and skills in locating new digital opportunities and underemphasizes the wider digital
labor force divide. In other words, as she rightly suggests, policymakers –and scholars for
that matter –have been overly attentive to the digital divide and inattentive to a growing
digital workforce divide. Building on these insights, I emphasize in this project that the
digital workforce divide is not an “access” or even “skills” divide, but has formed due to
other factors as well, including a shift to workforce outsourcing, decentralization, and
flexible specialization (Qiu, 2009). In this section, I will henceforth investigate research
that looks at divisions between high-tech and low-tech workers, how the digital
workforce divide impacts unionization efforts, and the “dangerous flexibility” of these
new working arrangements.
The High-Tech Minority
Media scholars and policymakers alike are in general agreement that the high-tech
sector offers extraordinary economic opportunities. However, as I will argue in this
project, these opportunities are for a small subset of workers with very particular training
and skills. Alvin Toffler (1980) and Robert Reich (1992) have termed this small subset of
highly skilled workers the “symbolic analysts” who are more likely to be white, male,
and in industries like tech or finance. Daniel Bell (1976) referred to this group as the
“knowledge class.” Adding to this categorization, Milton (2004) insists that high-tech
workers also include, “systems analysts, hardware and software engineers, computer

88
scientists and programmers, and webmasters” (Milton, 2004, p. 151). Russell Rumberger
and Henry Levin (1985) aptly refer to this group as the “high-tech minority,” as this small
group of well compensated and highly-skilled employees is supported by a sizeable
second group of workers –a “low-tech majority” –which includes an assortment lowwage, part-time, contracted, and informal precarious workers. This is relevant to my
thesis, as I will argue in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 that KEYSPOT jobseekers are among
this second highly exploited group of workers.
The High-Tech, Low-Tech Majority
That being said, how did a low-tech majority emerge in the context of a
seemingly booming high-tech sector? Said differently, how did the tech industry boom in
the 1990’s not benefit all U.S. workers? The answer to this question has been partly
addressed by Bauman (2000), who argues that the advancement of ICTs gave birth to the
tech boom, but also helped decouple capital from time, space, and the body of the
laborer. In other words, following the introduction of ICTs, capital could easily flee
burdensome regulations in advanced economies or protected workers to seek cheap labor
available behind computer screens scattered across the globe. Computer technology also
helps capital more easily coordinate global industrial work. As Anderson and Cavanagh
(2004) point out, deepening global debt contributed to this process – as the labor costs in
developing economies declined, global outsourcing became more profitable. So, for
example, high-tech firms began to rapidly outsource work like website development, and
these opportunities were offered for lower pay, on a contingent basis, and provided no
benefits like health insurance or a retirement plan (Castells, 1989; Rodino-Colocino,
2006). As Dyer-Witheford (1999) explains, these trends precipitated labor restructuring

89
on a global scale, because while companies continued to rely on some permanent
employees to manage projects and key assets – “the high-tech minority” per Rumberger
and Levin (1985) – this elite core was supported by a sprawling network of precarious
and contingent workers (p. 80).
The precarious, contingent workers generating profit for the high-tech minority
occupy many different positions and roles, as critical technology scholars have pointed
out. Some are in more high-skilled roles such as website development, as I addressed,
however, low-skilled workers are also central to the high-tech sector. For instance, these
low-skilled workers include those who directly interface with technology or technological
goods such as product assemblers, warehouse fulfillment staff, data entry workers,
mechanical turkers6 and call center handlers (Dyer-Witheford, 1999; Fuchs, 2014; Jarrett,
2015; Qiu, 2009; Sassen, 2003). Yet, low-skilled workers, such as janitors and
landscapers, also play a role in maintaining the spaces and offices utilized by high tech
minority staff (Dyer-Witheford, 1999; Fuchs, 2014; Sassen, 2003). Now reproductive
laborers are increasingly offered as “perks” to elite employees as well, laboring as
housekeepers, nannies, or providing meals to the busy tech professionals (Ritchel, 2012).
This rise in reproductive labor as “perks” intersects the larger argument I am developing
in this project, as it underscores how reproductive labor is increasingly degraded along
race, glass and gender lines in the contemporary information economy. To be more
specific, the high-tech minority employees are offered reproductive labor support,

Mechanical turkers perform rote tasks online for low pay, such as answering questions,
writing copy or answering surveys. For example, Amazon mechanical turk provides a
crowdsourcing marketplace allowing businesses access to individuals who are willing to
perform tasks that cannot be automated by computer.

90
whereas the kinds of positions available to KEYSPOT job seekers were in no way
conducive to parenting or reproductive labor needs. However, to return to the low-tech
majority more widely, on average, these positions are dominated by women of color and
immigrants, and the positions do not afford salaries, health benefits, paid leave,
retirement plans, or union protections (Dyer-Witheford, 1999). This class of workers is,
therefore, extremely vulnerable to exploitation, wage loss and wage-theft. And as I will
discuss in Chapter 7, I am arguing by extension that liquid laborers like Joanne are
exploited by this workforce divide, because (for example) her e-books provide surplus
value for high-tech giants like Amazon (Fuchs, 2010).
Silicon Valley and the Myth of the Digital Sublime
However, to further illustrate how this pervasive “digital workforce divide”
operates, nowhere is this divide more apparent than in the global high-tech capital of
Silicon Valley. The region is overflowing with the “high tech minority” Rumberger and
Levin (1985) refer to – the Valley is dominated by white, male, high-skilled workers and
notably has the highest concentration of PhDs and engineers in the world (Castells, 1989;
Dyer-Witheford, 1999, p. 96 – 97). These workers enjoy high wages and high-status
perks not afforded to the multitude of precarious workers who support their labor. As
another concrete example, and as I referenced briefly in the key terms section of Chapter
1, this is epitomized in the separate badges of different classes of workers at influential
information technology corporations like Google: low-wage digital book scanners are not
permitted to enjoy the same Google benefits –or even interact with – high-level staff
(Davis, 1998; Harris, 1998; Goldsmith, 2013; Wilson, 2011; Worker Center, 2001).
Dyer-Witheford (1999) makes a crucial observation that this type of social and cultural

91
isolation workforce is, in fact, a strategy utilized by tech corporations to “distance
themselves from unsightly super-exploitation” (Dyer-Witheford, 1999, p. 97). Echoing
Mosco’s (2004) arguments about digital myths, Fuchs (2014) points out that Silicon
Valley has its own associated mythology that shields it from scrutiny– Silicon Valley is a
story about “how the computer makes dreams comes true” (p. 213). Alongside Fuchs
(2014), I would argue that in addition to shaping narratives underpinning broadband
policy, the myth of the digital sublime (Mosco, 2004) also served to shield Silicon Valley
from criticisms of its role in the exploitation of U.S. and global workers.
The Digital Workforce Divide and Unionization
Can the low-tech majority unionize to resist these exploitative arrangements I
have presented? The digital workforce divide and proliferation of flexible and precarious
working arrangements has unfortunately also complicated the unionization of workers or
the ability of the low-tech majority to contest their exploitation. As will be addressed in
Chapter 5, in the late U.S. industrial period between the 1950’s – early 1970’s, unions
were more robust and could do more to support the interests of the working class7. Yet,
unfortunately, trends in technological automation have undermined unions. As DyerWitheford (1999) suggests, this was well illustrated when the acceleration of flight
pattern computerization played a major role in defeating the union of professional air
traffic controllers (PATCO) during their historic 1981 strike, resulting in the dismissal of
thousands of workers (Dyer-Witheford, 1999, p. 94). Technological developments have
also thwarted efforts to successfully organize workers like the participants in my study

It is important to add that scholars like Kabeer, Milward and Sudarshan (2013) point out
that unions did not equally serve the interests of some marginalized groups, such as
women or minorities (Edin & Lein, 1997; Kabeer, Milward & Sudarshan 2013, p. 260).
7

92
who increasingly occupy part-time or contingent roles and may be physically separated
from each other (Chaison, 2004; Pizzigati, Yentzer & Henderson, 2004). As another
complication, the sectors that are fast gaining jobs in the contemporary information
economy – such as service work and domestic work –are not traditionally protected by
unions. As a case in point, Chaison (2004) determined that between 1984 and 1997, the
childcare, finance and retail sectors gained 26 million jobs with only 5% of these workers
supported by a union. In contrast, the industries suffering the greatest job losses in the
same period, such the auto industry, were overwhelmingly afforded union protections
(Chaison, 2004, p. 90). In Chapter 6, I will argue that the sectors in which KEYSPOT job
seekers were able to locate opportunities were primarily in these non-union sectors, such
as service work, carework and domestic work. In any case, I present this research as a
counterpoint to overly celebratory accounts of technology’s ability to advance the
economic position of poor and working-class Americans and, instead, reinforce the
diminished protections for vulnerable workers like those visiting KEYSPOTs.
The Dangerous Flexibility of the Digital Workforce Divide
Although I have argued that high-tech workers hold a very privileged position in
the contemporary information economy, I want to emphasize that they are not entirely
insulated from its dangerous flexibility. To take a case in point, the forces of
globalization can and do impact highly skilled laborers. For instance, as I mentioned
earlier, high-tech work such as coding and software development can easily be
outsourced. In fact, the H1-B1 temporary visa process in the U.S. has recently come
under renewed scrutiny due to public accusations that corporations abuse the immigration
system in order to replace high skilled U.S. employees with cheaper foreign workers

93
(Preston, 2015). This was brought into national attention in a highly-publicized incident
involving Disney in which approximately 250 U.S. data analysts and engineers
responsible for monitoring park operations even participated in training their foreign
replacements who arrived via the global outsourcing firm, HCL America (Preston, 2015).
Thus, through utilizing outsourcing or contracting firms like HCL America, Infosys, and
Tata Consultancy Services, corporations like Disney are quickly connected to cheaper
foreign high-tech workers. As Dyer-Witheford (1999) points out, at the same time, by
using contracting firms they are also disassociated from foreign workers, as they often
remain employees of their original firm. That being stated, it is certainly true that the
plight of these high-skilled tech workers garnered national attention whereas low-skilled
labor outsourcing often does not.
Yet, for all these reasons, the digital workforce divide should not be understood as
a static chasm between high-tech and low-tech workers, but rather a complex system of
exploitation, in which the interaction of ICTs, immaterial labor, globalization, flexible
work and values of neoliberalism result in highly variable patterns of inequality. My
conclusion, then, is that pursuing a study of digital inequality through the lens of a
“digital workforce divide” rather than strictly a “digital skills divide” or “digital access
divide” offers a new framework for analyzing digital work and better contextualizes the
relationship between online work and the contemporary information economy (RodinoColocino, 2006). It likewise clarifies the disconnect between how work is defined in
policy and what work can actually be obtained for jobseekers like those visiting
KEYSPOTs. Such a framework also challenges some of the underlying assumptions and
tendencies surrounding digital labor in U.S. technology policy – such as an embrace of

94
the myth of digital “riches” and a shift towards private sector solutions – to be considered
further in Chapter 5. So, unfortunately, the high-tech sector is no panacea to the problems
of widening economic inequality and the urban crisis, as I will address in Chapter 4. In
sum, when we focus on the “digital workforce divide” rather than only through the
standard lens of a “digital divide,” we can begin to consider some of the exploitative
conditions facing low-skilled workers in the contemporary U.S. information economy
and the process whereby many low-income individuals are pushed towards the economic
margins, as I will now consider.
The Informal Economy, Workfare and Urban Survival Strategies
Now that I have addressed the disconnect between the goals of digital labor and
framed some of the digital workforce divide shifts that are shaping the economic lives of
many urban workers like Joanne or Mr. Wilson, the question remains: are there additional
impediments to finding formal work? Why do KEYSPOT job seekers like Joanne pursue
opportunities in the informal sector, especially given the possibilities of exploitation I
have already addressed? I will now turn to consider scholarship that traces global and
local informal economy research, or how new relations between capital and labor – and
neoliberal social policies – may push participants like Joanne into the informal sector. In
other words, this academic scholarship helps anchor this project within urban survival
strategies and more specifically the informal economy, a significant dimension in the
economic lives of participants and thus a key contribution of this project.
Informal Economy: Global to Urban Focus
Academic interest in the U.S. urban informal economy has surged since the
1970’s, however early scholarship focused on the usage of the informal economy among

95
“developing” regions rather than on the role informal economies played in advanced or
post-industrial nations. Anthropologists like Geertz (1963), Malinowski (1979) and
Mauss (2000) used ethnographic methods to document and analyze the informal trade
systems and “gift” economies of native peoples in Papua New Guinea,
Polynesia/Melanesia and Indonesia respectively. But in his study of the urban labor
market in Ghana, British anthropologist Keith Hart (1973) was the first researcher to
carry urban informal sector8 study into academic sphere. In its application, the “informal
sector” referred to developing economies that tended to incorporate both a mainstream
formal economy and an unofficial or unsanctioned economy (Doeringer & Piore, 1971).
Though my urban research is not focused on “developing economies” or global
economies, I do borrow a key term from Devey et al.’s (2006) research on the South
African informal economy. To explain, Devey et al. (2006) lament that when workers
have no opportunities for upward mobility they tend to, “circulate between the formal and
informal economies in a process of ‘churning’ driven by economic insecurity rather than
material gain” (Meagher, 2013, p. 8). As mentioned in Chapter 1, the concept of “churn”
is useful for analyzing the informal economy in Philadelphia, because as I will
demonstrate in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, low-income parents often cycle between the
formal to the informal sectors due to bleak economic prospects. So, I want to flag that I
do borrow this specific term from Devey et al.’s (2006) study of developing economies.

As discussed in the key terms section in Chapter 1, many terms have been used to refer
to these extra-market activities. The literature is thus marked by disagreement over the
conceptual definition of informal work. This dispute was fueled by academic debates on
the phenomenon; in short, the underlying interests of stakeholders shaped their research
motivations for studying informal labor practices.
8

96
To return to the informal sector, the study of the “informal economy” did not gain
widespread popularity in the United States until Ferman and Ferman’s (1973) study of
informal economic exchange as a means of survival among the urban poor in America’s
cities. Further urban ethnographic studies by Dow (1977), Lowenthal (1975) and Stack
(1974) also highlighted the informal and underground economies in the U.S. Regarding
more current research, Duneier’s (1999) ethnographic study of sidewalk book dealers in
New York City addressed the social world of informal economic actors. But although
Duneier (1999) offers a rich ethnographic portrait of the everyday lived experience of
informal workers, as I mentioned in Chapter 1 in the context of urban ethnography as a
research methodology, scholars such as Wacquant (2002) have rightly responded that this
account is overly romantic in discussing the “rehabilitative” effects of the street
economy. In other words, to apply this critique to my study, while we can celebrate the
creativity of Joanne’s informal practices, they should be contextualized as a necessary
urban survival strategy. Therefore, taking a more critical approach more in line with this
project, Robert Fairbanks (2009) suggests that the emergence of informal drug-recovery
houses in Philadelphia not only reflects survival mechanisms, but also connects to the
broader urban crisis and neoliberal labor restructuring. Notably, this is a similar argument
to the one I will advance in Chapter 5 on the urban crisis.
The Informal Economy and Advanced Capitalism
It is important to note, however, that in this same period of scholarship,
transnational economic bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saw the
informal economy as a threat to private sector development and accordingly emphasized
the detrimental impact of unregulated cash exchanges on the mainstream economy

97
(Cowell, 1990). Taking a similar position, many federal and state-based research studies
focused on the informal economy examined tax evasion (Cowell, 1990). However, in
contrast to the IMF or state perspectives, critical scholars in the “informal economy” field
began to examine how the exploitative nature of a free market global information
economy may create the conditions under which economic survival strategies become a
necessity –for example, cobbling together part-time opportunities due to a lack of
opportunities in the formal sector. In other words, there has been a more recent
recognition that the informal economy may offer marginalized and displaced workers in
the U.S. new strategies for survival in the context of global labor restructuring, and thus
may soon constitute “a major structural feature of society” (Portes, Castells, & Benton,
1989; Tickamyer & Bohon, 2000; Stack, 1974). To elaborate, as Sassen (2003) explains
in alignment with the digital workforce divide scholarship, these new exploitative
conditions primarily arise because informalization is increasingly used to increase
corporate profits, such as exploiting subcontracting or global outsourcing. Whereas
scholars like Watson (2009) saw the informal economy as disrupting neoliberalism
through alternative arrangements of power, I argue alongside Portes et al. (1989) that, in
fact, these practices are exploitative and their emergence in Rust Belt cities like
Philadelphia signals a larger transformation taking place within the contemporary
information economy. So, although the usage of the informal economy may seem trivial
as it appears limited to developing economies or appears only at the fringes of advanced
economies, I argue that the emergence of liquid labor should be understood as a
potentially significant feature of urban economies in the context of advanced capitalism.

98
Workfare, Reproductive Labor and Informal Work
Having discussed the informal economy scholarship more broadly, what
additional impediments exist to finding formal work, particularly for poor and workingclass parents in Philadelphia? While Chapter 5 will chart the history of the urban crisis in
Philadelphia as it relates to the emergence of informal work, it is important to also briefly
touch on some of the relevant contemporary research on informal survival strategies
among urban families. More specifically, this research reinforces the Marxist feminist
position that reproductive labor has been degraded along race, class and gender lines in
the era of retrenchment. In the case of low-income urban parents, urban sociologist and
anthropologist Edin and Lein (1997) explain that the retrenchment of the welfare state
throughout the 1970’s and 1980’s and the subsequent transition to “workfare” programs
in the 1990’s left many parents with less income overall with which to feed their families
and pay their bills. To explain further, “welfare” cash assistance for those living in
poverty was replaced with “workfare,” requiring parents to take jobs or participate in
workforce training to receive support. Siding with Bauman (2000), Daly (2003) reminds
us that the welfare state used to be understood as a type of “social insurance” to insulate
individual members of society from risks such as job loss or disability (Daly, 2003, p.
71). However, workfare was more compatible with the values of neoliberalism which
identified the individual alone as responsible for her/his own wellbeing. As another
example of unintended policy consequences, I would argue that the rise of workfare was
another major factor pushing low-income parents and caregivers like Joanne who visited
KEYSPOTs to pursue opportunities in the informal sector.

99
Workfare as a carousel, not a ladder. To further explain how workfare policy
changes impacted poor families following the 1990’s, according to Collins (2008), the
positions available through “workfare” were often part-time and highly casualized,
without needed benefits like health insurance, paid family leave, a retirement plan, or
disability protections (Collins, 2008, p. 141). Thus, unsurprisingly, research has indicated
that many parents leaving the welfare system for workfare continued to live near the
poverty levels as they only had access to jobs that were strict, low-status and low-paying
(Acker, Morgen, Heath, Barry, Gonzalez & Weigt, 2001; Boushey, Brocht, Gundersen,
Bernstein 2001; Cancian, Haveman, Meyeter & Wolfe; 2002; London, Scott & Hunter,
2004; Morgen, Acker, Weigt & Gonzalez, 2006). In other words, these workfare
positions were incompatible with the needs of working families and did not provide
participants a living wage. In fact, Collins (2008) suggests that workfare may have even
resulted in “downward job mobility” as it only reinforced a job history of low-status work
and carried a stigma because the work was still considered “public assistance” (Collins,
2008, p. 142). Therefore, rather than translate into steady economic support, workfare
programs may have only worsened labor “churn” as poor and working-class individuals
cycled in and out of the bottom of the labor market (Collins, 2008, p. 140; Daly, 2003;
Devey et al., 2006). For all these reasons, workfare programs contributed to labor
instability among urban Americans like those visiting KEYSPOTs, as they could not
offer low income families a “ladder leading upward to better wages” but instead workfare
acted more as a “carousel on which they went around in circles” (Edin & Lein, 1997, p.
131). This scholarship underscores how shifting policy priorities and retrenchment
limited economic opportunity for low-income urban families.

100
I want to include Weigt’s (2006) point here as well –undesirable low-wage formal
sector work is not sought out by poor and working-class individuals, it is “enforced”
through social policies like workfare (Weigt, 2006, p. 337). Thus, political scientists and
anthropologists alike have argued that welfare policies have historically played an
important role in supplying capital with a ready reserve of exploitable workers. In short,
intentionally or not, workfare maintains a kind of economic racism as it confines
marginalized populations to undesirable, low-skilled, and low-wage jobs (Piven &
Cloward, 1971; Stack, 1974; Valentine, 1971; Willhelm, 1971). In other words,
considering how social policy changes like workfare shape the economic lives of the
urban poor can also add richness to our understanding of the digital workforce divide.
The economic paradoxes of workfare. As will be examined in depth in Chapter
5, whereas post-workfare urban parents technically earned more income overall due to
taking on more jobs, Edin and Lein (1997) describe several factors that may have
ultimately pushed mothers like Joanne to pursue informal work. First, in order to obtain
jobs as was required through workfare, families necessarily incurred additional expenses,
such as the cost of transportation to and from work, and – most relevant to my arguments
–the cost of childcare (Edin & Lein, 1997). Second, as families earned additional income
from official workfare programs or other formal sector work, their federal subsidies for
housing and food stamps were reduced. Third, depending on their income levels, working
class parents could also lose their Medicaid eligibility (Edin & Lein, 1997). Said
differently, although more income was generated overall in workfare, with every dollar
earned, additional costs are incurred and other social support assistance in the form of
housing assistance, food stamps and Medicaid are reduced or withdrawn entirely.

101
Therefore, I contend that these challenges frame the economic barriers facing urban job
seekers like those visiting KEYSPOTs.
Urban survival strategies. Given the ways in which workfare could
paradoxically worsen economic circumstances, scholars insist that many urban families
devised a complex set of survival strategies to make ends meet and still retain food
stamps and housing credits (Edin & Lein, 1997, p. 19). These strategies included
pursuing informal work, but also receiving help from friends and family, soliciting
financial support from a partner, seeking aid and food from charities or other community
organizations, selling foodstamps for cash, or even buying stolen groceries or toiletries
(Edin & Lein, 1997). As Edin and Lein (1997) explain, the survival strategies pursued –
and accordingly informal work practices – are shaped not just by an individual, but by
neighborhood characteristics, the type of community resources available, and family
social networks (Edin & Lein, 1997, p. 146). Accordingly, Edin and Lein (1997) refine
our understanding of informal exchange in urban communities, arguing that informal
work practices are shaped by: 1) The strength of the local labor market; 2) The size of the
city; 3) The characteristics of the underground economy; 4) Local welfare practices; and,
5) The composition of charitable organizations (Edin & Lein, 1997, p. 180). In other
words, following from Edin and Lein (1997), the liquid labor strategies I analyze in the
context of this project should be understood as just one survival tool – albeit it a highly
valuable one –in a larger toolbox of urban survival strategies. This scholarship also
importantly reveals how retrenchment and government policy directly shape economic
practices.

102
Reproductive labor and informal work. I would also include Losby et al.
(2002) and Nelson’s (1999) points as relevant to my project, as they argue that
reproductive labor responsibilities like childcare or elder care are a major determining
factor in whether or not a person enters the informal economy (Losby et al., 2002;
Nelson, 1999). Because whereas working-class urban parents desperately need flexible
jobs as they cannot afford childcare – or have access to childcare support like the elite
high-tech workers I referenced earlier – the low-wage jobs available to them are strict,
stressful, require long hours and night shifts, and are physically demanding (Butler &
Nevin, 1997; Kurz, 2002; London, Scott, & Hunter 2002; Shulman, 2003; Weigt, 2006).
So, although scholars like Dignard and Havet (1995) take a more positive view of these
informal arrangements and argue families choose this work because it is compatible with
childcare responsibilities, my project reinforces Moser’s (1984) position: poor and
working-class families are also forced into informal work because of the policies like
workfare and the composition of jobs available to them. In other words, childcare issues
are also a major determinant of economic strategies and interactions. This is one of the
major themes of my dissertation as well.
In summary, to connect back to the Marxist feminist arguments from Chapter 2,
as Grabham and Smith (2010) argue, the retrenchment of the welfare state and a new
focus on “workfare” in public policy likewise elevated the importance of “working” and
diminished the importance of social reproduction and the work of mothering (Grabham &
Smith, 2010, p. 84 - 90). Critical feminist scholars have suggested that this is one of the
goals of neoliberal capitalism and the retrenchment of the welfare state: to diminish
carework and render social reproduction “invisible” (Abel & Nelson, 1990; England &

103
Folbre, 2002; Fisher & Tronto, 1990; Folbre, 1994, 2001). Kabeer et al. (2013) also
contribute an important observation here, and that is that parents –and mothers in
particular –may not compartmentalize their productive informal economic work and their
reproductive labor. Instead, liquid laborers like Joanne may articulate their activities “in
terms of a looser concept: that of family survival or livelihood” (Kabeer, et al., 2013, p.
252). In short, urban informal economy scholarship and research on urban survival
strategies provides deeper context for a study of working class economic lives, which is
necessary to begin to differentiate between liquid labor practices and the “immaterial” or
“affective” labor of middle and upper-class individuals. I would also add that whereas the
flexible high-tech workforce was once heralded as a path to greater equality as it would
enable individuals to better balance work and reproductive labor responsibilities, the lowtech workforce has not benefitted from these new configurations, or from the trends of
automation and computerization (Duffy, 2015; Proctor-Thomson, 2013; Toffler, 1980).
Conclusion
So, what is my contribution, specifically, to the extant literature focusing on
BTOP programs? As of now, the emerging research published on BTOP has primarily
been quantitative in nature and focused on broad outcomes rather than examining the
special characteristics of local BTOP programs. Some scholars in this group found no
conclusive evidence that BTOP resulted in higher adoption rates (Hauge & Prieger, 2015)
whereas others argue that Internet access programs like BTOP have improved the daily
lives of target populations (Jayakar & Park, 2012) and that BTOP has been successful in
moving the federal broadband vision forward (LaRose, Bauer, DeMaagd, Chew, Ma &
Jung, 2014). However more aligned with this research, Schejter and Nonnecke (2012) did

104
conduct a qualitative study of the “information use environments” of poor and workingclass urban BTOP center users in a Midwestern city to better understand broadband usage
patterns and information needs (p. 2). They both advocated for future programs that can
“enhance social capital,” a finding that resonates well with Staubhaar et al. (2012) and
my study (Schejter & Nonnecke, 2012, p. 26). Research specifically focused on
Philadelphia’s Freedom Rings Partnership found that the KEYSPOT project increased
digital literacy, helped users retain jobs, and increased broadband adoption across the city
in moderate numbers (ASR Analytics, 2012a). As my ethnographic project focuses on
how digital access and training impacts the everyday lives of urban program participants,
it can offer more detailed, granular insights into the benefits and consequences of
broadband policy.
In conclusion, as discussed, this study is positioned within a larger body of
scholarship in the fields of digital labor, digital inequality, the digital workforce divide,
and informal urban survival strategies. Therefore, first I reviewed related research in
digital labor to situate liquid labor and informal digital work within the context of the
contemporary information economy, focusing on immaterial, affective and hope labor.
Second, I presented the digital inequality scholarship to trace how the goals of digital
labor have evolved in policy, charting the transition from a digital “access” to a digital
“skills” focus. Further, I incorporated critical research perspectives. Third, I turned to the
digital workforce divide literature, as this research marks the disconnect between policy
and economic realities, exposing how the high-tech sector can exploit low-tech workers.
Finally, I considered impediments to formal work, looking at scholarship that addressed

105
informal sector labor trends, the rise of workfare, and the survival strategies utilized by
low-income urban parents.
In the next chapter, Chapter 4, I will trace the history of BTOP, including the
evolution of thinking around opportunity in the new economy. In this way, the following
chapter will connect to the digital inequality and digital workforce divide scholarship,
analyzing specifically how the goals of digital labor were being presented and developed
at the U.S. federal and local levels. This history is important to review, as it explains the
gap between policymakers and “policytakers.” In other words, Chapter 4 examines the
disconnect between digital workforce policy and the on-the-ground economic realities
facing Philadelphians like Joanne or Mr. Wilson.

106
Chapter 4
Setting the Stage: The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program
Introduction
As discussed in Chapter 3, this project is situated within a larger research area
centered around digital labor, digital inequality, the digital workforce divide, and the
informal work performed by working families in the informational city. This chapter will
take a pivot and trace the history of BTOP and the evolution of thinking around economic
opportunity in the new economy to better analyze how the goals of digital labor were
being presented and developed at the U.S. federal and local levels. This history explains
the divergence between digital workforce policy and the on-the-ground economic
realities facing Philadelphians like Joanne or Mr. Wilson– what I call the disconnect
between “policymakers” and “policytakers.” Accordingly, the impact of the Great
Recession on economic opportunity will be discussed, paying special attention to the
ways underemployment/unemployment forced many marginalized workers into new
working arrangements, including informalization. Second, the history of American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and the emergence of the Broadband
Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) will be detailed, with a focus on the
program’s goals around job creation. Third, the key federal reports Falling Through the
Net and The Digital Economy will be investigated, as these documents show how the
stakes of digital inclusion were altered in response to the changing composition of the
global information economy and the rise of neoliberalism. Lastly, how the goals of digital
labor were refined – and in some cases, resisted – by the Philadelphia Freedom Rings
Partnership and accordingly KEYSPOTs itself will be addressed.

107
In short, this chapter first presents the views and visions shaping digital workforce
solutions engineered by the “policymakers” and next focuses on some on the assumptions
and obstacles engendered through such policy, or the stance of the “policytakers.” In this
way, connecting to Mosco’s (2004) theory, I will argue that this divergence between
policy and the economic lives of BTOP participants is rooted in the myth of the digital
sublime. Said differently, this gap between policy vision and economic reality creates the
space for “unintended policy consequences,” and begins to explain how and why new
working configurations, like informal digital labor practices, emerged in the context of
the KEYSPOT program. I also emphasize the tensions between the policy goals of
economic prosperity versus the aims of political participation and community
engagement, as this underscores the tensions between public and private sector
stakeholders (Schement, 2002, 2009). Having summarized the key arguments developed
in this chapter, I will now begin with BTOP.
BTOP and the Impact of the Great Recession of 2007 - 2009
As a starting point, how and why did the Broadband Technology Opportunities
Program (BTOP) begin? Following the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse in August of
2007, global financial markets continued to cool as a result of declining confidence in
core banking institutions and tightening credit conditions. The historic 2008 default of the
U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers and the government-backed rescue of insurance
giant American International Group (AIG) signaled the depth of the crisis; industrial
production in developing and advanced economies plummeted and both profits and
wages fell (International Monetary Fund, 2009). It is in response to this crisis that the
federal government and policymakers drafted plans and approved a U.S. economic

108
stimulus plan in 2009, termed the “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act” (ARRA).
Approximately $7-billion distributed through the stimulus act was designated for
broadband Internet infrastructure development and related programs, such as the federal
Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and also the Broadband
Initiatives Program (BIP), administered by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) in rural
areas. After three first-round proposals proved unsuccessful, The Office of Information
Technology for the City of Philadelphia (OIT) and the Urban Affairs Coalition (UAC)
served as anchor institutions to submit proposals to receive BTOP Broadband
Infrastructure and Public Computer Centers (PCC) and Sustainable Broadband Adoption
(SBA) funds. These grants were successful –with PCC being awarded $6.4 million and
SBA receiving $11.8 million. Thus, in concert with institutions such as The Free Library
of Philadelphia, Drexel University, and multiple community-based organizations, the
Philadelphia Freedom Rings Partnership and the associated KEYSPOT broadband
program was formed to address the Great Recession. I will discuss the Philadelphia
project specifically in more depth in Chapter 5.
What is a “recession”? According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics,
a recession itself is defined as “a general slowdown in economic activity, a downturn in
the business cycle, a reduction in the amount of goods and services produced and sold”
(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012, p. 1). While the U.S. economy may have suffered
the most deeply during the 2007 – 2009 recession, the crisis likewise had international
repercussions as the global economy experienced its most significant downturn in 50
years (International Monetary Fund, 2009, p. 11). Economic activity contracted by 1.3%
in 2009 and the world’s advanced economies experienced an unprecedented 7% decline

109
in real GDP (International Monetary Fund, 2009, xv). In 2007, the U.S. unemployment
rate was 5%, however, by the end of the recession the unemployment rate had climbed to
10% (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012, p. 2).
Thus, while by all measures every American business and worker was impacted
by the crisis, some segments of the population (such as the KEYSPOT program
participants) experienced the effects more harshly. These impacted groups included
minority communities, men, and also those with less education. To elaborate, African
Americans and Hispanic populations experienced the highest rates of job loss; at the end
of 2009, unemployment rates were 15.5% for African Americans and 12.5% for
Hispanics (Taylor et al., p. 22, 25). Men lost jobs at a higher rate than women and
workers ages 16 to 24 were more likely to lose jobs than any other demographic (Elsby,
Hobijn & ahin, 2010, p. 3; Taylor et al., 2010, p. 1). Further, Americans with a high
school education or less were more adversely impacted than those with an undergraduate
degree or more education (Elsby, Hobijn & ahin, 2010, p. 3; Taylor et al., 2010, p. 1.)
Regarding household wealth loss, proportionally middle-aged adults suffered due to a
drop in their retirement account investments and weakened house value, all resulting
from the mortgage crisis and housing bubble (Taylor et al., 2010). Yet, it is important to
highlight that African American and Hispanic homeowners of all ages were greatly
impacted by the housing crisis, as these groups were more likely to fall victim to
subprime loans and experience property foreclosures (Taylor et al., 2010, p. 13). I present
this background because more broadly it paints a picture of the financial challenges
facing working class Americans in the period, and the landscape framing their economic
lives. Furthermore, it explains some of the wider instabilities and limitations within the

110
formal economy during this period (to be discussed in detail in Chapter 6) and helps us
understand why precarious workers like Joanne may have willingly (or unwillingly)
detached from the formal labor market and pursued opportunities in the informal sector.
The unemployment crisis during the Great Recession was also unique in that it
was accompanied by a record rise in underemployment/employment reduction and longterm unemployment, also contributing to formal economy erosion (Elsby, Hobijn & ahin,
2010, p. 4). Underemployed workers are defined as “part-time workers who say they
want to work full-time but have not been able to find a full-time job” (Taylor et al., 2010,
p. 59). According to a 2010 Pew survey, half of all part-time workers surveyed (47%)
indicated that they wanted or were seeking full time work (Taylor et al., 2010, p. 66).
Regarding reduced working opportunities, the same study found that 42% of workers had
experienced either reduced hours (28%); pay cuts (23%); forced unpaid leave (12%); or,
had full-time jobs converted to part-time (11%) (Taylor et al., 2010, p. 59). While all U.S.
workers were impacted by these employment trends, again marginalized communities
that make up the focus of this study were the most adversely impacted, as African
Americans were more like to have hours cut than white Americans; (42% vs. 22%); be
forced into unpaid leave (19% vs. 10%); or, have their full-time work converted into parttime (17% vs. 9%) (Taylor et al., 2010, p. 59). Hispanics were nearly twice as likely as
their white counterparts to report that their work hours were cut (40% vs. 22%) (Taylor et
al., 2010, p. 59). I would highlight here that long-term unemployment also became more
pervasive in this timeframe. As the Pew report explains, “an unfortunate consequence of
long-term unemployment is that it feeds upon itself,” meaning that the unemployed
become less likely to find work with every passing month and thus more likely to become

111
detached from the formal economy altogether (Taylor et al., 2010, p. 19). In other words,
I argue that these trends of underemployment/employment reduction and long-term
unemployment contributed to new working arrangements, including the shift to the
informal digital economy witnessed in the Philadelphia KEYSPOT project.
As a related point, I would add that the Great Recession arrived following a
thirty-year trend of deepening wage inequality. These widening inequalities resulted from
a web of interconnected factors reviewed in Chapter 2 and 3, such as globalization, a shift
to technological computing, offshoring and a decline in U.S. manufacturing (Goldin &
Katz, 2008; Goode & Maskvosky, 2001; Massey & Denton, 1990; Massey & Eggers,
1990; Sugrue, 2005; Wilson, 1996). As already considered in the context of a broader
“digital-workforce divide” in Chapter 3, whereas the shift to digital technology has been
celebrated as an economic boon for U.S. workers, in reality it has had a polarizing effect.
For instance, there have been gains in “high-end, high-skill jobs” and in low-wage
service sector work, while opportunities in manufacturing and middle management have
dwindled9 (Autor, Katz, & Kearney, 2006; Castells, 1989; Cohen, 1981; Harvey, 2006;
Hodos, 2002; Katz, 2010; Rodino-Colocino, 2006; Sassen, 1991). Katz (2010) makes a
critical point that will be elaborated on in Chapter 5 as well, that while historically the
U.S. economy has benefitted from its highly mobile workforce, in the last two decades
many low-skilled or deskilled workers have become trapped in communities that offer
limited access to jobs (Sassen, 2009). So, whereas workforce churn has increased, worker
mobility has declined in the wake of the Great Recession, resulting from factors like the

Katz (2010) argues that an influx of construction work opportunities for poor and
working-class men during the housing market boom of 2002–2006 may have somewhat
obscured these trends.

112
housing market crisis, the subprime mortgage crisis, and enduring credit market issues
(Frey, 2009; Katz, 2010). This is yet another facet of the complicated economic
circumstances shaping the economic lives of low-income Philadelphians, an environment
that is pushing many into the informal economy.
While negative in human terms, the impact of the Great Recession was not
uniformly negative in economic terms. Though output fell during this period, the amount
of real GDP produced by one hour of labor –or labor productivity –increased. (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012, p. 16). Additionally, whereas consumer spending
declined in every other category, consumer spending in healthcare increased (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012, p. 15). These two points underscore that these two
“silver linings” did not necessarily bode well for the typical American worker: increased
productivity means that workers were expected to work harder for the same or lower
wages. I would add that healthcare is by no means a luxury item and yet costs grew in an
already difficult economic period. This is pertinent to the arguments I am developing in
this dissertation, because as I will detail in Chapter 7, informal digital laborers like Sky
struggled due to lack of access to affordable healthcare. Again, this highlights the
precarious, difficult economic conditions in which many low-income urban Americans
found themselves during the timeframe of the BTOP grant project, and how retrenchment
and lack of social services can interact together to influence a family’s financial
decisions.
The History of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)
Now that I have provided more context around the Great Recession and how it
impacted the economic lives of working-class Americans, I will now provide more

113
background on BTOP. To reverse these recession trends I have outlined above, economic
bodies such as the IMF recommended policy reforms (in addition to temporary
government stimulus packages like the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program)
that could develop infrastructure and deliver the most economic “bang for the buck”
(International Monetary Fund, 2009, xix). Therefore, it is in response to the 2007 – 2009
economic crisis that the federal government as well policymakers drafted and approved a
U.S. economic stimulus plan in 2009 termed the “American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act” (ARRA). However, it is important to note that the ARRA “stimulus” plan of 2009 in
the Obama administration came after the 2008 Emergency Economy Stabilization Act
under the Bush administration– also referred to as the “bailout” – which authorized the
U.S. Treasury to respond to the housing market collapse by spending up to $700 billion
to purchase mortgage backed securities and infuse cash to the flagging banks. Though the
financial markets responded well to this economic stabilization measure, public interest
groups and organized labor perceived that this action was simply rewarding the very
institutions responsible for predatory lending practices. This is useful to flag because, as I
discussed earlier in this chapter, poor families were the most likely to be impacted by the
subprime mortgage crisis. In other words, it is important to contrast the two measures, as
the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act focused on the markets whereas the
2009 ARRA targeted economic investment and infrastructure.
To return to the ARRA, the act most broadly represented the federal
government’s policy response to the Great Recession and its objectives in the short-term
were to preserve and create jobs and likewise to provide assistance to the unemployed
while also investing in long-term development of U.S. infrastructure. Other forms of

114
assistance included expanding social support programs during the crisis, such as the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps.
Though, in my view, this social support and infrastructure expansion was too limited, a
subject I will address later in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7. Other ARRA goals included
increasing U.S. energy efficiency and stabilizing state and city budgets (ARRA, 2009,
HR 1). More specifically, the act’s goals were outlined as follows:
1) To preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery;
2) To assist those most impacted by the recession;
3) To provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring
technological advances in science and health;
4) To invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other infrastructure
that will provide long-term economic benefits; and,
5) To stabilize state and local government budgets, in order to minimize and avoid
reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax
increases (ARRA, 2009, p. 123).
Notably, recovery here is defined by “preserving, creating, and assisting” and balanced
with themes such as “efficiency, minimize.” These connections and tensions are
important, as they represent themes that filter down to the BTOP program itself.
Moreover, echoing scholars like Mosco (2009) as well as Golding (2000), Feenberg
(2009), and Winner (1986), these themes represent technology as a vehicle for progress,
development, and social support.
To expand on my last point, whereas policymakers saw developing technology
access and skills as a means to jumpstart the formal economy, it is less discussed that

115
policymakers saw as an added benefit that wired communities increase institutional
efficiencies. As it relates to public policy, Stone (1988) explains that “efficiency” is
defined as the “ratio between input and output, effort and results, expenditure and
income, or cost and resulting benefit” (p. 61). Said differently, “efficient” policy (in
theory) allocates new resources or restructures existing resources to extract the maximum
possible value (Stone, 1988). Repeatedly, BTOP documents suggested that broadband
allows for greater efficiencies. As a practical example, a 2012 NTIA funded BTOP
progress study championed Internet access as a direct means to reduce healthcare costs
for the U.S. (ASR Analytics, 2012b, p. 35). Whereas ICT policy is closely associated
with institutional efficiency, to reconnect to an earlier point aligned with Mosco (2004), it
is also associated with increased individual efficiency. As this line of reasoning goes,
providing computer access and digital skills can give an individual the tools necessary to
become self-sufficient and self-sustaining. In this way, as I will expand on later in this
chapter, we can see the language around broadband and institutional efficiencies as
dovetailing with – and structured by – the discourses of neoliberalism.
However, to return to BTOP, approximately $7 billion of the funds distributed
through the ARRA were designated for broadband Internet infrastructure development
and related programs, including the federal Broadband Technology Opportunities
Program (BTOP) supporting the Philadelphia project, but also the Broadband Initiatives
Program (BIP) administered by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) in rural areas. In total,
NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects, approximately $6 billion for grant
funding and $1 billion in loan funding (Kruger, 2013, p. 2). Only state or political
agencies, nonprofits, or “other entities” in the public interest were eligible to apply for a

116
Broadband Technology Opportunities Program grant (ARRA, 2009, HR 399). Given the
scale of this federal investment, I would argue that research about the role of the
programs in the everyday economic lives of low-income Americans is useful in its ability
to help us better understand any potential benefits or limitations to guide future policy.
So, how were BTOP funding decisions made? The grant applications for BTOP
were subsequently evaluated in a few ways. For instance, grants were judged by their
ability to acquire equipment or instruments; construct and deploy broadband
infrastructure; ensure access by community “anchor institutions”; deploy Internet projects
that increased public safety; and, support education and economic development by
supplying access to low-income, unemployed, elderly, and other “vulnerable
populations” (ARRA, 2009, HR 400). Other secondary BTOP goals included increasing
digital education, broadband awareness, training, access, and providing equipment to
schools, libraries, and healthcare providers (ARRA, 2009, HR 398 – 399). Finally, “jobcreating strategic facilities” in targeted communities were prioritized (ARRA, 2009, HR
398 – 399). In their study evaluating the economic impact of BTOP, Hauge and Prieger
(2015) analyzed BTOP grant applications for the frequency of “target” statements linking
to all of the aforementioned goals10. Hauge and Prieger (2015) found that “workforce
development” was the most cited target statement and was referenced 963 times
comprising 20% of all citations, with “mapping” and “digital literacy” ranked as second
and third with 916 (18% of total) and 887 (17% of total) citations respectively (Hauge &
Prieger, p. 6559). Other economic target statements in grant applications included “small

The authors identified target statements such as “workforce development”, “public
housing”, “senior citizens”, and “homeless” (Hauge & Prieger, p. 6559).
10

117
business” with 119 citations, or around 3% of the total citations (Hauge & Prieger, p.
6559). So, this underscores that “access” and “skills” were intimately tied to economic
opportunity; a grantees ability to convincingly argue for “workforce development” was a
major determining factor influencing funding deliberations. Additionally, BTOP grantees
were required to publish quarterly reports on their success in meeting all the ARRA
defined benchmarks.
In brief, the goals of the BTOP program were both to provide broadband access to
Americans in underserved communities and to improve broadband infrastructure. While
home broadband access was discussed, acquiring access through community sites was
emphasized. The position that broadband access at home should be balanced with other
community access options like KEYSPOTs connects to the U.S. government’s policy
position –developed over time in their well-known 1990’s white paper series Falling
Through the Net – that achieving total home broadband penetration was not a feasible
policy strategy (ARRA, 2009, HR 398 – 399). I will turn to these reports in the next
section, as the goals of digital labor were in many ways formed and solidified in this
three-part set of reports as well as in a series of “companion” papers on the digital
economy. Tracing this history offers a window into the thinking of leaders and
policymakers in a key transitional period in which the U.S. government began to respond
to significant shifts in the growth of online computing, work practices, as well as the
changing composition of the U.S. economy. In sum, these neoliberal discourses reveal the
embrace of the “myth of the digital sublime” Mosco (2009) references, the myth that
technologies can overcome power structures and material conditions. In other words,
these reports lay the foundation for my larger point that the dominant discourse suggested

118
that with the appropriate access and skills, individuals can forge new economic
opportunities, even in the most difficult circumstances, to lift themselves out of poverty.
However, following from Schement and Curtis (1997), there is an “essential
tension” underlying the goals of broadband policy more broadly that I would like to
address (p. 132). To explain, this tension is due to policy’s inability to discern whether
information should be viewed as a commodity, and thus governed by free market
principles or if, conversely, it is a public resource and thus must be supported by
governmental programs (Schement & Curtis, 1997). Whereas this can be a tension
between political interests or governing factions (Republican or Democrat), I would
underscore that imposing this as the dominant frame is overly simplistic, as it does not
account for the ways in which neoliberal ideology and the embrace of market-driven
solutions has influenced technology policy positions on both the American right and left
(Schement & Curtis, 1997). Indeed, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that
deregulated the media and loosened ownership restrictions was passed under the
Democrat-aligned Clinton administration. Therefore, we can instead view these policy
tensions as shifting between the twin goals of “prosperity” and political “participation,”
as I referenced in the digital inequality literature review section of Chapter 3 (Schement,
2009). These goals of prosperity and participation can be complementary, but also
contradictory. In this way, I assert that the myth of the digital sublime (Mosco, 2004) –
that technology offers a cheap and efficient solution to complex urban problems like
poverty –operates as an internal discourse within policy whereas the tensions surrounding
political prosperity/participation act as external forces steering the decision making and
the allocation of resources. What is at stake as these “tensions” exert influence over the

119
policymaking process is whether programs benefit only economic interests “prosperity,”
or, instead, provide communities with tools for political “participation” and engagement
(Schement, 2009; Wolfson, Crowell, Reyes & Bach, 2017). This larger question of the
tensions between these aims is one in that I will consider in the conclusion chapter of this
dissertation as well.
Falling Through the Net and The Digital Economy
To begin to trace the evolution of these internal policy discourses around
“prosperity” or workforce issues, I would argue that the federal government’s response
and relationship to Internet technology and the information economy was first sketched
out and developed in a three-part set of reports produced in 1995, 1998, and 1999
respectively entitled Falling Through the Net. The documents after 1995 were also
bolstered by a set of companion reports on the Digital Economy in 1998 and 1999, and
thus the later installments in the Falling Through the Net series should be understood in
relationship to those priorities and positions as well. A deep dive into these reports is
useful, as these early Internet and digital economy policy reports are, in many ways, a
sort of origin story for BTOP and the goals of digital labor, capturing shifts in language
and priorities still underpinning the federal programs almost 20 years later. These reports
track the evolution of the concepts used to locate and describe digital inequalities,
delineate shifting policy goals and programs, and as Stevenson (2009) notes, they also
mark a swing towards neoliberalism and the embrace of private sector solutions to the
problems of digital access. That being said, I will now turn to an analysis of the first
Falling Through the Net policy report.

120
Falling Through the Net: The Promise of “Riches” in the Information Age
To begin, the July 1995 Falling Through the Net report was the earliest
installment and was entitled, “A Survey of the Have Nots’ in Rural and Urban America.”
This initial report began to develop the policy argument that because digital access – just
like telephone access – was a vital telecommunications tool necessary for economic,
social, and political engagement, it should necessarily fall under the existing categorical
principle of “universal service” that I discussed in Chapter 3. To restate, the principle of
universal service, or the rights of citizens to access communication technology, was a
central piece of legislation in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC)
Communications Act of 1934 around “wire and radio communication” (Federal
Communications, 1934). The 1995 Falling Through the Net report underscored the
importance of information seeking and information practices in the evolving
“Information Age” and made the link between digital technology and economic
prosperity insisting that, “While a standard telephone line can be an individual's pathway
to the riches of the Information Age, a personal computer and modem are rapidly
becoming the keys to the vault” (McConnaughey, Nila, Sloan, Baxter, Alverez &
Francesconi, 1995, para 3). Therefore, the idea that a personal computer might serve as
the “keys to the vault” of economic prosperity became the standard view in federal
broadband policy. This repeats the “prosperity” goal of early universal service policies,
yet the political “participation” function of broadband also received some attention in this
first report (Schement, 2009).
In this early document, I would underline that those without Internet access were
characterized as “have-nots” or the “information disadvantaged.” The report also

121
presented economic data to demonstrate that the urban and rural poor were lagging in
computer penetration rates (McConnaughey et al., 1995, para 5). Aligned with the
perspectives of digital divide scholars regarding access issues discussed in Chapter 3
(Hoffman et al, 2001; Jansen, 2010), the report noted that such groups – including lowincome Americans, minorities, young and less educated users –were the most
“enthusiastic” users of digital technology services that “facilitate economic uplift and
empowerment.” These economic uplift activities were defined as: 1) Searching for
employment opportunities; 2) Engaging in educational activities; and, 3) Accessing
government reports (McConnaughey et al., 1995, para 10). Aligned with studies like
Compaine (2001) already discussed in the literature review, the connection was made
between education and online use; the report highlighted that low-income ($10,000$14,999) Internet users in urban, rural, and central cities were among the groups most
likely to enroll in online classes (McConnaughey et al., 1995, para 11). More generally, I
would highlight that the first report advocated policies that could provide “public ‘safety
nets’” to “complement the long-term strategy” of home Internet access for all Americans
(McConnaughey et al., 1995, para 17). Notably, future reports would back away from the
home broadband goals and shift towards advocacy for “safety nets,” such as making
broadband access available in community access centers (‘CACs’) like libraries.
To move on from the first report, the second 1998 installment of the series
subtitled “New Data on the Digital Divide,” expanded on the argument that digital policy
should adhere to the principles of universal service. However, the language used was
slightly different, as it focused more on the U.S. as an “information society,” internet
access as the “information superhighway,” and discussed how the country could develop

122
its own “information infrastructure” (McConnaughey, Lader, Chin & Everette, 1998, para
2). This report used both “digital divide” and “have nots” to discuss unconnected
Americans; the repeated use of the term “digital divide” underscores the growing fear
that the gap was widening, rather than closing, even as digital technology became more
affordable. However, I would point out here that this language also downplays the
economic and power disparities captured in the language of “have-nots” or the
“information disadvantaged” from the earlier report. This change also signaled the future
diminished focus on community power and political participation in broadband policy. In
sum, the language of “have-nots” implies there are also “have-mores” and perhaps even
“information advantaged,” terms that would better speak to the power and structural
imbalances at the heart of digital inequality (Eubanks, 2011).
And now, lastly, the final 1999 report, “Defining the Digital Divide” was the most
extensive of the three reports, totaling 127 pages and firmly positioned digital access11 in
the realm of an emerging global digital economy. This report argues that in this new
paradigm, U.S. workers would need not only access, but digital skills to stay competitive.
More specifically, the report argues that digital access is critical as the country must
ensure workers are “highly-skilled, well-educated” and “technology-literate” if we are to
remain a leader in the world economy (McConnaughey et al., 1999, para 5). Further,
embracing the view that information is a commodity, the private sector12 is seen as the

11

The report also highlights that the U.S. “internet churn” rate is 15%, referring to the
percentage of individuals that were once digitally connected to the internet, but became
unconnected due to fact that they could either no longer afford access and/or could not
replace a faulty computer (McConnaughey et al., 1999, p. 39). In this way, the report did
complicate and further understanding of “access” as a multidimensional issue.
12
Again, pursuing private industry solutions to public telecommunications infrastructure
was very much aligned with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed under President

123
appropriate partner for the federal government to work with in order to achieve the policy
goals of digital inclusion with such statements as, “we look forward to working with the
private sector to bring the riches of the Information Age to everyone” (McConnaughey et
al., 1999, para 7). Thus, while the initial Falling Through the Net report sketched out the
U.S. policy role in broadband development, the last report takes a notable pivot, asserting
that the private sector should take the lead – a position that would be reinforced through
the Digital Economy companion reports as well. In sum, this last installment of Falling
Through the Net embraces private sector solutions and goes the furthest for drawing a
link between economic “riches” and digital access, also charting a policy shift from
“access” towards “skills.” However, as I alluded to earlier, I assert that the Falling
Through the Net series should be understood alongside the influential Digital Economy
policy series as well.
The Digital Economy: Digital Skills for a Global Stage
The first Digital Economy report in 1998 –produced by a special project group in
the U.S. Department of Commerce –reiterated some of the themes of the Falling Through
the Net series, including overlooking the digital workforce divide, stressing “skills”
training, and promoting globalization and private sector involvement. These influential
reports also bolstered the position that information is a commodity and contributed to the
decline in focus on issues of broadband and political participation. The report began on
an optimistic note regarding the state of the economy, citing a shrinking budget deficit,
lower interest rates, and lower barriers to international trade as the first proof of the new

Bill Clinton which included Internet in spectrum allotment but also deregulated
broadcasting and telecommunications markets and loosened media ownership
requirements.

124
economic promise of the digital era (Margherio, Henry, Cooke, Montes & Hughes, 1998,
p. 1). The report suggested that the expansion of information technology had allowed for
job growth by increasing the demand for programmers, systems analysts, computer
scientists and engineers. As the report argues, these high-paying private sector jobs earn
workers an average of $46,000 per year compared to the national average of that time of
$28,000 (Margherio et al., 1998, p. 6, 46). While this appears positive on the surface, as
addressed in the previous chapter, this focus on the “high-tech minority” (in the words of
Rumberger & Levin, 1985) overlooked a growing digital workforce divide (RodinoColocino, 2006) intersecting with the digital divide. While the report anticipates that the
new economy will create jobs, it cautions that if American workers are not sufficiently
“skilled” for these new opportunities, they will migrate abroad – marking the move from
an “access” to a “skills” policy focus (Margherio et al., 1998, p. 51). For instance, the
report, again, emphasized that the private sector will take a lead role in the digital
economy and policies of deregulation are championed. Channeling liquid modernity
(Bauman, 2000), the report also heralds a shift to “less rigid organizational structure” and
promotes the shift towards globalization, advocating for a “seamless global marketplace”
(Margherio et al., 1998, p. 48 - 50).
Moving on, the second “Emerging Digital Economy” report in 1999 repeats some
of these same themes from the first report, focusing on globalization, flexibilization,
digital skills and the private sector. However, while acknowledging that the technology
sector offers high paying jobs, however, this report voices concern that the U.S. lead in
the utilization of digital technology is “diminishing” and includes a discussion on the
intersection between the digital economy and emerging digital workforce divides (Henry,

125
Cooke, Buckley, Dumagan, Gill, Pastore & LaPorte, 1999, p. 1). Reiterating the
assertions of Devey et al. (2006) who understand the informal economy as emerging from
wider labor instability or “churn,” the report also flags that digital technology has caused
a “churn” effect (Henry et al., 1999, p. 37). To put it another way, whereas jobs are
quickly gained in the tech field, they are just as quickly lost in other industries, resulting
in grave instability for U.S. workers who must constantly be retrained and develop new
skills to keep pace with workforce demands (Henry et al., 1999). I would argue that this
further highlights the emerging digital workforce divide: there is great demand for highpaid “core IT workers” but wage gaps between technology industry workers and other
workers had begun to widen (Henry et al., 1999, Introduction, Para 11 – 12). Yet, this
report strangely still advocates for continued deregulation and positions information as a
commodity, rather than public resource, even as it admits the digital gap is not closing
and that the current solutions are insufficient (Henry et al., 1999, p. 7). This reinforces
Lenert et al.’s (2012) position that the free market is unconcerned with “equity” and is
thus a poor partner for achieving the goals of universal service (Lenert et al., 2012, p.117;
Schement, 2002).
To sum up my key points, through a close read of the Falling Through the Net
and companion Digital Economy series, we see how the goals of digital labor begin to
take shape. To be more specific, first the reports all chart a broadening of overall policy
goals, as the goal of ICT access and “universal service” is expanded to also incorporate
digital skills. Second, aligned with Mosco’s concept of the myth of the digital sublime
(2004), the reports associates ICTs with economic prosperity – literally “riches.” Third,
the language of “have-nots” is abandoned for the term “digital divide,” which I contend is

126
less attentive to political participation and the role of power and structural imbalances in
generating broadband access disparities to begin with. Fourth, the papers each promote
globalization, flexibilization, and deregulation. While the last Digital Economy white
paper does recognize the possible problems of a “digital workforce divide” and labor
“churn,” like all the other reports, it ultimately promotes information as a commodity,
championing private sector solutions to the enduring problems of digital inequality. As I
will address later in this chapter, these tensions between the public (information-as
resource) and private (information-as-commodity) solutions influenced the Freedom
Rings Partnership as well, specifically in the program’s relationship to Comcast and their
“Internet Essentials” low-cost home Internet program (Schement, 2009; Schement &
Curtis, 1997). I would add that Chapter 5 will address the role the private sector played in
crippling Philadelphia’s municipal WiFi project – Wireless Philadelphia – in 2005.
In other words, I am arguing in this chapter that broader national policy
prescriptions iterated and refined in the 1990’s that pulled programs towards the
“prosperity” pole later constrained local government’s ability to address digital access
problems and the dimension of political participation. In short, these reports track the
evolution of the concepts used to locate and describe digital inequalities, delineate
shifting policy goals and programs, and mark a swing towards neoliberalism seen in the
embrace of private sector solutions to the problems of digital access. Although these
themes filtered down to the Freedom Rings Partnership programs as well, it is important
to underscore that the discourses were differentiated through multiple stakeholders and
“layers” of the partnership, the policymakers and the policytakers, as I will now consider.

127
The Freedom Rings Partnership: Defining and Differentiating Digital Labor
While federal policy played a central role in determining how “work” was
discussed and setting the parameters of the related ICT discussions around prosperity and
political participation, the goals of digital labor were refined – and in some cases, resisted
– within the Philadelphia Freedom Rings Partnership (FRP) itself. Said another way,
whereas we can understand both the Falling Through the Net and Digital Economy series
as engineered by the “policymakers” we will now examine how those stances bear out on
the ground for broadband access and training programs –the stance of the “policytakers.”
So, although it is true that the goals of digital labor were molded by federal BTOP policy
visions, they were in many ways refined and differentiated through multiple layers of the
Philadelphia partnership including through lead partners, marketing staff, community
organizations, specific KEYSPOTs, and digital trainers/computer assistants. While the
lead FRP partners enjoyed the most control over the policy visions, individual partners
also shaped the mission and discussions around economic opportunity, workforce
development and political participation. These planning goals were often complementary,
but could be contradictory. To be more specific, visions were negotiated by various FRP
stakeholders through internal discussions, formal planning and working groups, private
reports, and public marketing materials and strategies. Notably, as I will demonstrate,
stakeholders also differed in their conceptualization of information as a commodity or,
alternatively, as a resource necessary for political engagement (Schement & Curtis,
1997).
Therefore, to explore this and build on how digital labor was conceptualized, this
section will first examine the Philadelphia partnership’s collective priority on community

128
engagement. Second, I will provide the technology industry perspective that focused on
“efficiencies,” embraced neoliberalism, and reinforced prevailing digital myths (Mosco,
2004). Third, I will analyze the public marketing approach that balanced ARRA visions
with the needs of prospective KEYSPOT visitors. And finally, I will present the on-theground community organization visions that pushed back and resisted the federal, local,
and technology industry positions around workforce development. In short, I argue that
as you move through different layers of the partnership, a gap between federal priorities
and local needs begins to come into view. In this way, those closest to the on-the-ground
economic realities, such as community organizations, digital trainers or participants– the
“policytakers” – were more likely to refine or reinterpret policy to address the social,
political and economic needs of their communities. In sum, while the goals of economic
development were built through federal visions, outlined by BTOP, refined by the FRP
partners, and guided by the private sector, they were somewhat complicated by marketing
efforts, and often revised by on-the-ground organizations.
Freedom Rings Partnership: Overall Goals and Program Evaluation
In this way, as a starting point to begin to analyze the Freedom Rings
Partnership’s conception of workforce development – as well as touch on the tensions
between “prosperity” and “participation”— what were the goals of the Freedom Rings
Partnership, relative to the ARRA? Through a series of meetings in the Fall of 2011, the
Freedom Rings Partnership collectively decided that the KEYSPOT programs should be
evaluated on the basis of three shared outcomes. These outcomes included: 1) Improving
community engagement of participants; 2) Increasing adoption and broadband
subscription rates; and, 3) Providing job and educational training. So, while the

129
partnership’s primary goals were unsurprisingly much aligned with the federal ARRA
vision, internally Philadelphia made a point to elevate community engagement –
“participation” –and prioritize it before job and economic “prosperity” functions. This
was also due to the unique origin of the partnership itself that was rooted in principles of
“digital justice” and community needs, a subject I will turn to in Chapter 5. However, I
highlight these tensions as it is in slight contrast with the federal visions put forward in
Falling Through the Net, The Digital Economy, as well as in ARRA reports. Yet, while
job training was collectively agreed upon internally by all partners as the third goal of the
program, during weekly meetings lead partners asked for – and shared – “success stories”
which primarily centered on job training. For example, in early 2012, some stories that
were shared included that of a single mother who secured employment after earning her
Microsoft Office specialist certification as well as another mother who felt she “can be
more effective” at her job after receiving training through KEYSPOTs. I would argue that
this reveals that the lead partners internally recognized that “community engagement,” or
participation more broadly, was the more unifying message for all stakeholders.
Nonetheless, lead partners also believed that foregrounding workforce development gains
was crucial for federal support and broader public buy-in. Yet, as I will explain, other
private interests shaped the orientation of the messages as well, which I will now
consider.
Private Sector Interests: Embracing “Efficiencies” and Neoliberalism
Private industry also played a role in shaping the goals of digital labor. For
example, internal and consulting-firm produced reports further influenced how workforce
goals were presented and developed. These reports often reflected the interests and

130
conclusions of the private sector – aligned with the stance that information is a
commodity –and consulting documents were typically generated at the request of lead
partners (Schement & Curtis, 1997). In concert with Microsoft Corporation, a technology
consulting firm based in Seattle –The Arnold Group – produced a deck and “output
document” that was shared internally at meetings and circulated to the partners. Their
report entitled, “Shape the Future: The Benefits of Digital Inclusion in Philadelphia,”
provided an economic modeling tool aggregating publicly available data on digital
inclusion, income, government program costs, and graduation rates to predict the
potential economic and social benefits of KEYSPOTs. Referencing the urban crisis to be
discussed further in the next chapter, the report noted that a “cycle of poverty” had
historically impacted the economic life of the city and argued that investment in digital
infrastructure would result in earnings improvement for workers who would be
“benefiting from the lifetime creation of 879 jobs.” (The Arnold Group, 2011, p. 3 - 9). I
draw attention to this statement as this claim mirrors Mosco’s (2004) critique of the myth
of the digital sublime, as it implies that with the right access and skills, individuals will
forge new economic opportunities and lift themselves out of poverty.
Echoing the ARRA’s own language–The Arnold Group (2011) report also argued
that digital access would allow for “efficiencies,” reducing costs to city taxpayers through
offering some government services online, potentially saving as much as “$4.50 per
transaction” (The Arnold Group, 2011, p. 5 - 18). In turn, investing in digital
infrastructure in Philadelphia would result in “reduced dependency” of the poor on social
programs. The report therefore reasoned that the welfare state could be further retrenched
due to this technological investment and I would emphasize that the language of

131
neoliberalism and the narrative of self-responsibility is repeated throughout. For example,
the researchers claim that broadband access and skills can reduce government healthcare
spending as poor and working class populations would acquire the tools to better
“manage” their personal health, particularly health issues resulting from obesity (p. 18).
Here I would underscore that the lens of neoliberalism obscures structural realities that
may limit access to healthy food for those living in poverty, including high food cost and
urban food deserts. The Arnold Group (2011) report even goes so far as to argue that the
wage increases resulting from technological access could potentially lower incarceration
rates, again ignoring structural factors.
Said differently, in The Arnold Group consulting report, investment in technology
is discussed as an efficient “return on investment,” offering poor and working-class
communities access to a wider range of material resources for a reduced government cost
(Stone, 1988). In line with the government stance laid out in Falling Through the Net and
The Digital Economy, the report also advocated for public-private partnerships as a future
strategy to help improve Philadelphia’s economic “global competitiveness.” (The Arnold
Group, 2011, p. 11). This position firmly advocates for the information-as-a-commodity
perspective (Schement & Curtis, 1997). Thus, in an embrace of the values of liquid
modernity and the digital sublime– associating access with economic mobility,
neoliberalism, privatization, and globalization –the tech perspective is closely aligned
with a “policymaker” vantage point and elevates the goals of “prosperity” whereas
political “participation” goals are ignored (Schement, 2009). Still, most broadly the report
likewise denotes a failure to deeply understand or attend to the complex web of structural
and social factors limiting opportunity for poor and working class urban Philadelphians

132
like Joanne or Mr. Wilson. However, the partnership’s marketing arm played an
interesting role in defining the goals of digital labor as well.
Marketing Visions: Reflecting Policymakers, Attracting Policytakers
In contrast to the technological sector aligned output document, the marketing and
advertising documents produced for the partnership played the role of framing and
communicating the economic goals of the program to the general public as well as
potential program participants. More specifically, the advertising firm “The Mighty
Engine” was responsible for creating: 1) The “KEYSPOT” branding; 2) The promotional
strategy to generate awareness of KEYSPOTs, and 3) The partnership’s host website,
www.PhillyKeyspots.com. The marketing element was an interesting dimension of the
project, as the advertising was responsible for reflecting both the vision of the
“policymakers” publicly and yet, at the same time, was tasked to promote the program to
the “policytakers,” i.e. potential program participants. In sum, this meant that the
marketing strategy had two faces, one that it presented to the policymakers and one that it
presented to the policytakers.
To further explain my point, when working directly with the partnership to craft
general campaigns that would reach all segments of the population, the Mighty Engine
attempted to emphasize the “prosperity” economic and workforce elements in their
messaging. For instance, during weekly meetings, the firm regularly solicited assistance
from partners to identify KEYSPOT program participants for possible inclusion in future
marketing “radio spotlights.” In one such meeting, a marketing strategist outlined the
“qualifications” for desirable participants in these future campaigns: 1)
Under/unemployed (found a job, or found a better job); 2) Youth education, seniors; and,

133
3) “Reentering society (found a place to live, found a job). As we can see, the most
desired participants for communication campaigns were those who found a job through
participation in KEYSPOT programs, rather than those who engaged more deeply with
their community, diverging slightly from the general partnership priorities. So, this is
more closely aligned with promoting the federal and private sector visions, but
nevertheless was also viewed as necessary to secure public buy-in of the program. Thus,
this recalls Mosco’s (2004) observation that technology programs are more palatable to
the public when they adhere to the goals of creating a neoliberal self-sufficient worker.
Nonetheless, the firm diverged from these visions in its efforts to target potential
program participants residing in Philadelphia’s poor and working-class communities,
including direct marketing campaigns like flyers or out-of-home (OOH) advertisements,
such as wrapping bus shelters. For instance, at a weekly meeting in June of 2012, the
Mighty Engine unveiled a promotional flyer that emphasized the connection between
KEYSPOTs and workforce development (speaking to policymakers and policytakers) but
also promoted social support programs (speaking to policytakers). In other words, federal
visions and private industry visions tended to highlight reduced costs and demands for
social service as a benefit of digital inclusion, whereas participant marketing touted social
support program participation as a benefit of digital participation.
To say this differently, in contrast to The Arnold Group’s report, The Mighty
Engine advertising campaign for KEYSPOTs highlighted enrollment in social programs
as a potential benefit of obtaining digital access, a detail that demonstrates the differences
in the internal visions of the program versus the external framing of the program to the

134
public. Here is a concrete example of this messaging, taken from a marketing flyer
created for the partnership:
Quite simply, we’re trying to improve the quality of life, earning potential, and
network of those currently living on the wrong side of the digital divide in
Philadelphia. Our research shows that offering access to computers and the
Internet to those currently without it can make for dramatic changes, from
unprecedented access to job opportunities and enhanced job skills to fuller
participation with public benefits for which they already qualify.
Here KEYSPOTs and the technological access and training they provide is promoted as a
program that can “make for dramatic changes” in the lives of poor and working-class
Philadelphians, aligned with the “riches” and prosperity theme repeated in Falling
Through the Net and the Digital Economy reports. Yet additionally, it underscores a
reality tacitly acknowledged: the poor and working-class Philadelphians targeted through
KEYSPOTs need access to social support programs, i.e. “fuller participation with public
benefits.” This dimension was addressed in marketing precisely because partners knew
that, ultimately, it would be vital for achieving success. In this way, we begin to see the
gap between policymaker and policytaker goals and needs come into view.
Policytakers: Resisting Workforce Policy Visions
To summarize my previous arguments, the goals of economic development were
built through federal visions, outlined by BTOP, refined by the FRP partners, guided by
the private sector, and somewhat complicated by marketing efforts. Yet, I want to point
out that additionally, individual community groups, digital trainers or lab assistants,
participants, and other local stakeholders often pushed back on or resisted the dominant

135
narrative around economic development for prosperity and the ARRA policy priorities.
These groups often focused more heavily the on political participation dimensions. As
will be discussed in Chapter 5 in more depth, some of these differences also stem from
the history of the partnership itself, which had its origins in both the failed Philadelphia
municipal WiFi project in 2005 and a Digital Justice summit that convened long before
the grant writing process for BTOP even began. However, to return to my point, I am
arguing that we can understand these policy tensions as the result of an interaction
between a set of top-down and bottom-up forces. Said differently, the national visions
were arranged at the “top” and their messages filtered down the Freedom Rings
Partnership’s organizational levels, such as to the city and lead partner visions, but were
influenced by powerful stakeholders like the technology sector. Marketing efforts acted
as an intermediary layer, communicating visions from the top but also considering how to
attract program participants. The local, on-the-ground organizations at the base of the
project were closer to specific challenges limiting community opportunity for KEYSPOT
visitors like Joanne or Mr. Wilson and were accordingly more likely to promote political
participation as the goal of broadband access programs. As such, the local framing of the
issues of economic opportunity and digital labor were much more attuned to the kind of
structural barriers discussed in Chapter 3, including the rise of precarious working
arrangements, the retrenchment of the welfare state, the expanding digital workforce
divide and the growing forces of neoliberalism. Further, these local on-the-ground visions
were more clear-eyed in their assessment of the potential of digital access and skills
programs, modulating the myth of the “digital sublime” (Mosco, 2004) and thus

136
exploring the potential of technology to mobilize communities for social justice (Wolfson
et al., 2017).
As a concrete example of how these visions were filtered through the various
layers of the partnership, while it is true that many non-lead partner organizations in FRP
drew on messages of economic opportunity, they shaped this messaging to more closely
adhere to their own unique programmatic mission. As a case in point, in contrast to the
federal or private sector policy perspectives, in one advocacy organization’s digital skills
training courses, workforce issues were presented in the context of Philadelphia’s wider
urban crisis. In fact, in order to underscore the social and economic barriers facing lowincome KEYSPOT job seekers and the growing digital workforce divide, in one course a
KEYSPOT digital trainer, Maria, shared the following statistics around poverty and
inequality with her class:
The SPM [Supplemental Poverty Measure] figures released by the Census Bureau
on Thursday show that households may have income above the poverty line,
factors such as medical expenses are pushing increasing numbers into poverty.
The new figures also indicate that the tepid job growth in the more than four
years since the financial crisis come mostly in the form of low-wage jobs that
in many cases are not able to lift families out of poverty.
In sharing this with her digital skills class, here Maria draws connections between the
broader political and economic conditions precipitated by the Great Recession itself – as
well as the urban crisis in Philadelphia to be addressed further in Chapter 5 –and the
proliferation of low-wage, precarious work. Said another way, Maria acknowledges the
trouble economic landscape in Philadelphia and connects the lack of good jobs to the

137
Great Recession. Incidentally, Maria – whose positionality is much closer to the
participants and therefore on-the-ground realities in Philadelphia –recognizes that the
“goals” of digital labor presented in federal policy (BTOP) and partnership visions (FRP)
of economic prosperity may not connect to the lived economic realities of urban
Philadelphians.
Thus, to return to the training course, recognizing this disconnect between
technology policies and economic realities, Maria focuses instead on how digital skills
can be used for political mobilization and participation (Wolfson et al., 2017). In sum, the
exploitative working conditions facing poor and working-class Philadelphians are, in
Maria’s view, related to a broader restructuring of the relations between capital and labor
in the contemporary information economy. Thus, it is necessary to for poor and workingclass communities to mobilize and organize for labor rights to improve worker
protections. In this way, Maria explains, there will be better opportunities in the future.
What is important here is that Maria advocates for the KEYSPOT programs to promote
deeper political participation rather than centering on economic prosperity. To provide a
historical reference and help her students more deeply reflect on the dire economic
conditions facing Philadelphia in the wake of the Great Recession, Maria shares a quote
from Martin Luther King, Jr. with her class:
The emergency we now face is economic, and it is a desperate and worsening
situation…there is a kind of strangulation in the air, in our society it is murder,
psychologically, to deprive a man of a job or an income.
In other words, Maria includes the MLK quote in her class to underscore the ways in
which the 2007 – 2009 crisis magnified and reproduced longstanding racial and class

138
disparities. Again, it is important to highlight that poor and working-class communities
like those visiting KEYSPOTs were impacted the most harshly by the Great Recession,
as for instance, these groups were even more likely to fall victim to predatory housing
loans. So, rather than strictly focus on the digital access or digital skills training needed to
connect individuals to economic opportunity, Maria and the community based
organization in which she worked shifted the focus back onto the longstanding structural
conditions – including the urban crisis in Philadelphia –that contributed to the digital
divide in the first place. It is also worth mentioning that digital trainers and KEYSPOT
open lab assistants were in many cases members of the communities in which they
worked, and thus had lived experiences – such as health issues or experiences with
homelessness –that made them better able to meet participants’ social support needs and
made them more aware of the myriad challenges to finding good paying jobs (Wolfson &
Crowell, 2013). Therefore, this gap between policy goals and economic realities was well
understood by those working on-the-ground in Philadelphia’s KEYSPOTs. And it is also
the space in which new working arrangements began to emerge.
Conflicting Visions: Policymakers and Policytakers
Having just argued that on-the-ground stakeholders may push back on or resist
federal policy visions and promote the dimension of political participation, for a final
glimpse into how greatly economic visions can diverge, I will turn to a series of
partnership-wide “sustainability” workshops held in the summer of 2012. The objective
of the sustainability workshop was to begin to sketch out and solidify the partnership’s
commitment to continue to support broadband infrastructure in the city after the
conclusion of BTOP. Therefore, partnership members at all levels – from lead partners to

139
computer trainers –met to discuss creating a “Digital Inclusion Compact and Vision
Development.” In one of the session activities called the “History of the Future” exercise,
attendees gathered at tables at random to brainstorm on how the project would ideally be
remembered. In short, the goal of the exercise was to envision the city after the
conclusion of the Freedom Rings Partnership.
Table discussions among attendees revealed that after two years of intense
collaboration, partner organizations still shared vastly different visions of a digital future
for Philadelphia. For instance, a high-level partner representative, Jay –more closely
aligned with the technology industry position–expressed a hope that technological access
would connect participants with jobs, but also reduce the city’s need for social support
programs in the future. Imagining how BTOP would be ideally be remembered five years
hence, Jay thus role-played:
Now it’s 2017 and the city economy has flourished, in no small part due to the
success of BTOP and creating a digitally connected city! Most formerly
unemployed have digital skills to get better jobs. For those that do need to
search, they can access all that information online, and there is less need for
welfare programs and in-person unemployment centers.
In other words, as his statement reveals, Jay literally saw “digital skills” as the key for
connecting participants to jobs, also repeating the economic prosperity theme. Yet, Jay
likewise expressed a goal – aligned with the ARRA language around “efficiency” and the
technology industry position of reducing “dependency” – that technological access would
reduce the need for social support programs in the future (Stone, 1998). Said differently,
Jay reiterated the digital myth as Mosco (2004) conceptualizes it, or the myth that

140
technology can offer cost-effective solutions for pervasive and very complex urban
problems, and even possibly allow for further retrenchment. His position, therefore, was
closer to the policymaker vision.
In contrast, at the same table, a digital trainer from an advocacy organization
(Audrey) expressed her hope that broadband adoption and digital skills would promote
deeper political participation and community engagement. Her vision more closely
reflected the priorities of the larger partnership and community organizations. Next,
Audrey talked about a “digital future” that would see BTOP as an important leader in the
movement to use technology to fight for social justice and turn back patterns of economic
inequality that persisted throughout the city. In short, Audrey referred to the urban crisis,
or the broader social and structural problems and the political issues framing the Great
Recession that I will turn to address in Chapter 5. Nevertheless, it is important to note
that Audrey –like the digital trainer, Maria – was more involved than Jay in the on-theground work of engaging with participants, and I would thus emphasize that her
positionality within the partnership impacted her view of the digital divide problem.
Therefore, Audrey more closely represented the policytaker vision, arguing that political
change would be necessary to close the digital workforce divide and dramatically
improve the economic lives of low-income Philadelphians like Joanne and Mr. Wilson.
The conflicting vision communicated by Jay and Audrey –even at the end of the Freedom
Rings Partnership – captures the enduring tensions surrounding urban policy frameworks
for addressing economic opportunities for poor and working-class Americans, the
requisite goals of digital labor, and the tensions between the goals of economic prosperity
or political participation. Furthermore, the conflicting visions Jay and Audrey expressed

141
revealed the disconnects and ruptures between two populations, those that make policy
and those to whom policy is targeted – policymakers and policytakers. This gap was a
space for unintended consequences, in which new working arrangements and informal
digital practices indeed emerged in KEYSPOTs.
Conclusion
This chapter traced the history of BTOP and the evolution of thinking around
opportunity in the new economy to study how the goals of digital labor were being
presented and developed at the U.S. federal, city, and community levels. This history
revealed a widening disconnect between digital workforce policy and the on-the-ground
economic realities facing Philadelphians like Joanne and Mr. Wilson. It also highlights
the deeper tensions between the goals of promoting economic prosperity and political
participation through broadband programs (Schement, 2009).
First, the impact of the Great Recession on jobs and economic opportunity was
explored. Special attention was given to the impact of the Great Recession on the
demographics that most overlapped with KEYSPOT visitors, i.e. poor and working-class
communities of color. The relationship between the Great Recession and
unemployment/underemployment was examined, and these trends were explained in
relation to the emergence of informal work in urban communities. In order to set the
stage for Chapter 5, the Great Recession was situated in the context of the larger urban
crisis that has impacted many post-industrial Rust Belt cities like Philadelphia for over
thirty years.
Second, this chapter traced the history of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) – detailing its goals to stimulate the economy in the wake of

142
the Great Recession – and described how BTOP emerged from these goals. The language
of ARRA itself was also discussed, including the inherent discord between themes of
program creation and increasing social support (e.g., SNAP) and themes promoting
institutional “efficiencies” and using technology to minimize some social support
interventions. The structure of BTOP was also investigated through outlining the goals of
economic and digital labor as targeted by the program, such as the goals of job creation
and worker training.
Third, as they were the key documents through which the U.S. government began
to outline and refine its thinking around the role of the Internet in stimulating economic
opportunity, the Falling Through the Net and Digital Economy reports were studied. The
early Falling Through the Net report promoted the concept of “universal service” arguing
that Internet technology could offer “riches” echoing the prosperity theme, yet cautioned
that some segments of the U.S. population –“have-nots” – could be left behind. The
second report described the growing online world as an “information society” and the
“have-nots” now inhabited a “digital divide,” language that diminished issues of power.
In the last report, signaling the neoliberal shift, the discussion of the digital economy
moved to the forefront and the report stated that private industry, rather than the federal
government, should take the lead in developing the U.S. broadband infrastructure and in
tackling the complex issues surrounding the digital divide.
A close reading of the Digital Economy reports explained how (and why) the U.S.
federal government’s thinking on the role of digital technology was evolving, i.e. shifting
away from earlier reports that assigned equal weight to the role of the Internet in both
social and economic ventures. The federal goals of digital labor were repositioned by a

143
new economic imperative to train American workers for global opportunities, provide
them with the “skills” necessary to work in technology jobs and industries, and to give
them the ability to search for jobs online. However, the final Digital Economy installment
did take notice of a possible digital workforce divide. In these reports, the private sector
was also designated to lead such efforts – providing the infrastructure and training
necessary to achieve federal policy goals – with the U.S. government cast in a supporting
role. Therefore, we see a shift towards the view of information as a commodity, rather
than a public resource (Schement & Curtis, 1997).
Finally, how “work” was defined and differentiated through the Freedom Rings
Partnership was discussed through four different dimensions. Partner planning meetings
and discussions prioritized community engagement and political participation as the most
important outcome of the program, yet “success stories” largely centered on job training
and work opportunities. Internal consulting reports –like that produced by the Microsoft
associated, The Arnold Group—took the private sector perspective on the prospect of
digital inclusion, emphasizing how workforce development and technological access
could increase institutional efficiencies and maximize global competitiveness (Stone,
1988). Third, the use of KEYSPOTs marketing materials to define digital labor and work
was also explored. In contrast to the technology industry position and to some extent the
ARRA itself, participant targeted materials presented FRP as way to access social support
programs. Finally, on-the-ground organizations more in touch with the everyday lived
realities of urban Philadelphians –a group I am terming the “policytakers” –framed digital
inequality as an issue of social justice requiring deeper political participation and likewise
positioned the lack of jobs within the context of the Great Recession and the urban crisis.

144
Partner representatives not engaged in direct work with participants were more likely to
side with the industry view and federal position, envisioning that KEYSPOTs would
stimulate the formal economy and reduce the need for social support programs; in other
words, allow for further retrenchment of the welfare state (Mosco, 2004).
In this way, I am asserting in this chapter that we can understand the formulation
of policy and approaches to digital labor as an evolutionary process whereby ideas are
defined and redefined as we move through time and between institutions and
stakeholders. We can also understand it as a top-down and bottom-up process where
policymakers –and also policytakers –influence programs goals. On-the-ground
communities targeted for BTOP funds – those communities on the wrong side of the
digital divide – may push back on federal or technology industry visions that
misunderstand or misinterpret their needs. These discussions are also driven by an
underlying policy question – is information a commodity to be circulated through the free
market, or is it a public resource necessary for political engagement (Schement & Curtis,
1997)? The disconnect between vision, goals and reality was, indeed, a space of
unintended consequences. However, to analyze KEYSPOTs, it is likewise important to
situate the program within the context of Philadelphia itself and its particular social,
economic, and political landscape (Wolfson & Crowell, 2013). Therefore, the following
chapter will first trace the history of Internet programs in Philadelphia, provide more
background on the structure of the Freedom Rings Partnership, and concretize the role of
the urban crisis in restricting economic opportunities for poor and working-class
Philadelphians visiting KEYSPOTs like Joanne or Mr. Wilson.

145
Chapter 5
Philadelphia- The Urban Crisis and the Freedom Rings Partnership
Introduction
While federal policy visions saw technology as a means to stimulate growth postrecession and promote prosperity through the ARRA as discussed in the previous chapter,
I am arguing that alongside digital inequalities, complex structural issues such as lack of
opportunities in the formal sector coupled with the breakdown of durable social support
institutions yielded unintended consequences. So, whereas policymakers touted ICT
access as a cheap and efficient solution for tackling complex problems like urban
poverty, policytakers resisted or rejected this vision, instead focusing on participation as
needed to force political change in low-income communities. This space of interaction
and tension between the broader federal technology policy visions and on-the-ground
urban needs and realities forms the terrain of this study. Thus, as I will present in this
chapter, Philadelphia’s digital divide, the digital workforce divide, and the emergence of
informal digital work should also be understood as a consequence of a larger urban crisis
(Wolfson & Crowell, 2013).
Therefore, in order to analyze the work of the KEYSPOT program specifically—
and urban broadband adoption more generally—it is important to situate broadband
adoption initiatives within a precise social, economic, and political landscape (Wolfson &
Crowell, 2013). Therefore, this chapter will first detail the history of Internet programs in
Philadelphia, as some of the relevant themes and threads– such as the economic, political
and social goals of broadband access and the tensions between public and private
interests– continued to exert influence over the Freedom Rings Partnership. Second, as

146
referenced in the last chapter in the context of policymakers and policytakers, more
background on the formulation of the Freedom Rings Partnership itself will be provided,
with attention to the embedded program design and the evolution of visions around job
training and workforce development on the local level. Lastly, in order to properly assess
how the economic lives of the urban poor have been shaped by the contemporary
information economy, the history of the urban crisis as it has unfolded in Philadelphia
will be discussed. Special attention will be given to the ways in which postindustrialization, discriminatory social policies and the retrenchment of the welfare state
reduced economic prospects for urban Philadelphians and pushed many like Joanne to
pursue informal sector opportunities or caused participants like Mr. Wilson to lose their
jobs. Having sketched out the key points of this chapter, I will now first turn to the
history of internet programs in Philadelphia
Blueprints for BTOP: Lessons of Wireless Philadelphia
As argued in the previous chapter, tensions between public and private solutions
shaped federal policy, and the embrace of privatization and deregulation constrained local
government’s ability to appropriately respond to pervasive digital access problems. While
Chapter 4 charted the shift towards private solutions on a federal scale, the longer history
of the private sector’s involvement in broadband development in Philadelphia is unique
and that history provides added context into some of the different stakeholder visions
already described in Chapter 4. For example, as referenced briefly before, the private
sector played a major role in crippling Philadelphia’s municipal WiFi project – Wireless
Philadelphia – in 2005. The failure of this project rallied community stakeholders to
convene and discuss digital inclusion issues, and then later this coalition served as base of

147
the BTOP grant writers for the Philadelphia Freedom Rings Partnership. The municipal
WiFi episode also underscores again the tensions between visions of information as a
commodity and information as a public resource that I discussed in the last chapter
(Schement & Curtis, 1997).
Wireless Philadelphia: A Vision of Digital Inclusion
So, to first provide background on the municipal WiFi project, on August 25,
2004 then Philadelphia mayor John Street announced via press release that he had
appointed an executive committee to explore the viability of establishing a municipal
wireless Internet project in the city (Cardenas, 2004). If successful, the 2005 project
would have made Philadelphia the largest U.S. city to undertake such a venture and
project a vision of the city as a forward-thinking, tech-savvy destination. A public
infrastructure, it was reasoned, would also help address the city’s sizable digital divide by
offering poor and working-class residents more affordable internet access and also
supporting businesses to spur economic growth. The mayor’s executive committee tasked
Chief Information Officer Dianah Neff with creating the business plan and also selected a
non-profit partner, Wireless Philadelphia, to help create the digital infrastructure and
evaluate bids from ISPs. This first city press statement revealed that the goals of the
municipal network were to help citizens, businesses, schools, community organizations,
and city visitors. However –perhaps sensing some of the challenges ahead to realize such
an ambitious project –the initial press statement indicated that the committee would also,
“identify possible legal and regulatory barriers and help develop strategies to overcome
them” (Cardenas, 2004). In preemptively accounting for “possible legal and regulatory
barriers,” this press statement was the opening salvo in what would become a fierce

148
public debate on the role of broadband in economic life and the private sector’s role in
shaping public information access programs.
Stakeholder Tensions: Private Sector Strategies, Political Promises
While the public’s response to Mayor Street’s plans for municipal WiFi was
overwhelmingly positive, telecommunications corporations such as Comcast (notably
headquartered in Philadelphia) and Verizon Wireless grew concerned that such a project
could decrease sales to current customers as well as block expansion to a new pool of
potential customers residing in the city (Abraham, 2015). Therefore, knowing that
Philadelphia would not agree to put the brakes on a popular project, citing “unfair
competition,” Verizon began to lobby Pennsylvania state legislators to attempt to block
the city’s proposal (Associated Press, 2004). Yet, rather than openly voice their
opposition to the WiFi plan, industry lobbyists included the deal-kill as a smaller
stipulation in a larger state senate bill addressing telephone company incentives for
expanding broadband infrastructure throughout the state (Associated Press, 2004).
Regarding Verizon’s back-door approach to reshape wider state policy to their advantage
in response to Philadelphia’s municipal WiFi project, New America Foundation research
fellow Joshua Breitbart complained, “They’d never hold a press conference to announce
that they’re panicked, but they’ll roll out their full range of power to block Philadelphia’s
entrance into the market” (Abraham, 2015). Comcast subsequently refused to submit a
bid for the WiFi project, citing subsidies as problematic to competition – although the
corporation itself had received $30 million in subsidies in exchange for establishing its
own headquarters within the city (Siklos, 2005). I want to highlight that this interaction
captures the paradox of urban broadband programs: though broadband is widely

149
recognized as central to the functioning of the economy and yet unaffordable for many
low-income urban Americans, to ensure survival, initiatives must be “market friendly” or
better still market-approved by the telecommunications industry itself. This is one
concrete consequence of the impact of the federal policy position established through the
Falling Through the Net and Digital Economy series– and the embrace of information-ascommodity –examined in the previous chapter (Schement & Curtis, 1997). It also lends
weight to Lenert et al.’s (2012) claim that the free market is unconcerned with the greater
social good and is, therefore, an inappropriate partner for government efforts to achieve
the ultimate goal of universal service.
That all being stated, it is important to note here that political pressure also played
a role in determining the fate of Wireless Philadelphia. Though the telecommunications
industry was ultimately unsuccessful in stopping the WiFi initiative in Philadelphia at
that particular time, mounting local political pressure in the city also undermined the
program’s stability. Two city Council members –including Michael Nutter who would
later serve as Philadelphia’s mayor during the Freedom Rings Partnership–also cited
concerns about the cost of the project and questioned whether or not it was an appropriate
investment, given the city’s other financial challenges (Twyman, 2005). It is worth
pointing out that this adds another dimension to the stakeholder groups discussed in the
previous chapter. In short, “policymakers” is a wide group, including researchers and
government workers more generally, but also politicians at the city, state and federal
levels. In this way, financial, industry, state, and local political pressure constrained the
program’s ability to obtain a highly prominent, well-established ISP partner. Thus,
Wireless Philadelphia partnered with the newer and less-tested internet service provider,

150
EarthLink. As I will turn to now, unfortunately, Earthlink was less prepared to
accomplish the formidable tasks ahead.
Lessons Learned: Earthlink’s Threads and Failures
To expand on Earthlink’s involvement, in its initial press statement after the
partnership was announced, EarthLink indicated that digital inclusion was to be the
“cornerstone” of the municipal WiFi project (Earthlink, 2007). To this end, Wireless
Philadelphia CEO Greg Goldman remarked that the partnership was critical because
“low-income families can begin using the powers of the Internet to improve their
educational, employment, and life opportunities” (Earthlink, 2007). Notably, this first
mission statement focusing on education and employment mirrors almost exactly the
themes of “economic riches” from Falling Through the Net, the Digital Economy, BTOP
–and of course the Freedom Rings Partnership itself. To be eligible for the Earthlink
program, low-income customers were required to have income 150% or below the federal
poverty level, or enrolled in programs like Transitional Assistance to Needy Families
(TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The following summer, a small-scale
test of the network was conducted and the Wireless Philadelphia program announced that
it would be offering eligible low-income residents access for $9.95/month, subsidizing
EarthLink’s $20/month rate. This plan is similar to the one that Comcast would adopt
later for its “Internet Essentials” program during the Philadelphia BTOP grant, as I will
address later in this chapter.
While Earthlink’s initial network tests for the city were successful, WiFi was still
a fledgling technology and a less established service like Earthlink was not well equipped
to meet the myriad challenges ahead. For instance, the infrastructure was plagued with a

151
number of small issues –access points in street lights were improperly installed and in
some areas data speeds crawled below what was advertised (Abraham, 2015). The larger
rollout date was postponed twice and following the election of Mayor Michael Nutter in
late 2007, many expressed concerns that Earthlink was not committed to fulfilling the
terms of its contract with the city (Abraham, 2015). By May 2008, EarthLink reported
that it had enrolled only 6,000 customers. The contract was negotiated in the court
systems and a month later, Earthlink formally withdrew (Technical.ly Philly, 2009).
Shortly thereafter, a coalition led by local IT consultants and a company, Network
Acquisition, bought EarthLink’s equipment for $16.8 million.
The threads and failures of the municipal broadband project – including the
ultimate victory of the private sector over the city’s program to address affordable WiFi
and digital access for Philadelphia’s low-income populations – shaped the strategies and
missions of the coalition that later applied for BTOP funding in 2009 (Breitbart, 2005).
This interaction also brings into focus how the federal policy debate over information as a
commodity or information as a resource can play out and influence technology programs
on the local level (Schement & Curtis, 1997). Moreover, the future stakeholders that
would create the Freedom Rings Partnership coalition were forged in the context of the
collapse of a very popular municipal WiFi initiative to address digital inequality in the
city. In other words, this new coalition formed as a direct response to the failures of
Wireless Philadelphia and held a different vision for the city, a vision which saw political
participation as a key aim of digital inclusion. The discourse around the digital divide and
the role of internet technology in economic life and workforce development in
Philadelphia also more specifically began to take form.

152
Digital Justice and the Freedom Rings Partnership
Ultimately, the hard lessons of the failed municipal WiFi project were instructive
and emboldened a new group of stakeholders to coalesce around a shared vision of a
digital city. Therefore, following the failure of Wireless Philadelphia to realize the
promise of digital inclusion throughout the city, in 2008 around 30 organizations united
to form the Digital Justice Coalition in order to, “ensure that there is a plan in place to
provide the public of Philadelphia with affordable and reliable Internet access” (Wolfson
& Crowell, 2013). Notably, even the language of “digital justice” takes on added
significance, as it is indicative of the more diverse movement driven by a goal of social
and political equity, forming a counterweight to the powerful corporate interests that had
previously hampered the municipal WiFi project. However, in 2008, the city and its
residents began to consider new possibilities to revive the goals of the defunct WiFi
program through the then newly announced ARRA stimulus package, i.e. BTOP.
Although the Digital Justice Coalition might seem trivial in the context of a
contemporary study, it is in fact crucial in terms of helping to further contextualize the
varied stakeholder visions as discussed in Chapter 4 – the policymakers and policytakers.
It likewise reinforces my broader point about the troubled relationship that exists between
community groups seeking the expansion of broadband to address problems of inequality,
social justice, and political participation and the goals of the private sector that view
information, instead, as a commodity to be bought and sold (Schement & Curtis, 1997).
To add more background on the Digital Justice Coalition and its goals, the
conversations and evolving plans around applying for BTOP funding through the
stimulus package started to take shape at a 2008 summer summit where the city’s

153
technology office and 50 community groups convened to design the goals and sketch
ideas that would serve as the basis of the future grant proposal. Additionally, the
collective: 1) created a BTOP planning group, 2) approached a national foundation to
conduct a study about current broadband adoption rates and patterns in the city that could
act as a baseline, and, 3) developed a questionnaire around community and organization
broadband needs (Wolfson & Crowell, 2013). After three first-round BTOP grant
proposals proved unsuccessful, The Office of Information Technology for the City of
Philadelphia (OIT) and the Urban Affairs Coalition (UAC) served as anchor institutions
to submit proposals for the BTOP Broadband Infrastructure and Public Computer Centers
(PCC) and Sustainable Broadband Adoption (SBA) funds respectively. As mentioned
earlier, these were successful –with PCC being awarded $6.4 million and SBA receiving
$11.8 million – and the anchor entities in concert with institutions such as The Free
Library of Philadelphia, Drexel University, and multiple community-based organizations
formed the Freedom Rings Partnership and the associated KEYSPOT broadband
program.
To expand on and review some of the details of the partnership provided in
Chapter 1, the foundational goals of the KEYSPOT program were to: 1) Create or
refurbish 77 public computer centers throughout Philadelphia; 2) Develop an awareness
campaign around the digital divide and broadband adoption across the city; and, 3) Train
15,000 Philadelphians in educational programs to build digital literacy and increase
broadband adoption. The project would more than triple the workstations available to
low-income residents by updating 26 already-existing public computer centers and
creating 51 new centers, in total upgrading 65 workstations and installing 764 new

154
workstations. Over 5,000 laptops were distributed to Philadelphia Housing Authority
(PHA) residents. Digital education courses were outlined to train participants in basic
computer use, multimedia content development, in order to “improve job search and
resume” and “improve access to government and community services” (The National
Telecommunications & Information Administration, 2011).
While the Digital Justice Coalition and its members sketched their own vision for
digital inclusion in the initial summer summit, I would highlight here that through the
process of applying for funding, new stakeholders entered into the mix with their own
aims and internal objectives. Further, when BTOP funding was finally retained, the
objectives and aims of the ARRA more broadly also contoured the resulting program and
its mission. For instance, as discussed in Chapter 4, the federal goals included lowering
U.S. governmental costs to provide services – “efficiencies” –and in some cases shifting
services online so that participants could “self-serve” (Stone, 1988). As argued
previously, this promoted efficiencies, but it was also palatable –because as Mosco
(2004) asserts –it adhered to the values of neoliberalism that champion self-responsibility
as the path to greater economic prosperity. As a more concrete example of my point, in a
2012 National Telecommunications Infrastructure Administration (NTIA) BTOP
progress study, Internet access was presented as a potential vehicle to reduce healthcare
costs for the U.S. and ways to urge potential patients to seek online help were considered
(National Telecommunication Infrastructure Administration, 2011 a, p. 35). Again, I
would underline here that this goal is more in line with a neoliberal project that intends to
shift away from a traditional social services model to a new paradigm where participants
are responsible for locating services. This also echoes the position taken by my

155
participant, Jay, in the “History of the Future” exercise that I presented in the last chapter.
To review, Jay was more aligned with the policymaker interests and imagined that, in the
future, KEYSPOTs would reduce the need for social programs in the city. Regarding the
BTOP grant proposal, the goals of digital labor were developed by a number of interests
–which is why as I discussed in Chapter 4 –the objectives in partner materials and on-theground organizations were often complementary, yet occasionally contradictory.
To return to the KEYSPOT program design, in order to access the low-income
populations that would most benefit from BTOP, the program design embedded the
public computer centers (PCC) and broadband training programs (SBA) into the city’s
existing social-service infrastructure (Wolfson & Crowell, 2013). For instance, the sites
were located in 19 recreation centers, 10 homeless shelters, 15 affordable housing sites,
libraries, and community-based organizations working with poor or marginalized
communities. Most of the centers were located in neighborhoods with the least access to
broadband, i.e. North, West, and South Philadelphia. According to BTOP and FRP
materials these communities were in “the greatest need of economic development” (The
National Telecommunications & Information Administration, 2011b). Yet, here the
NTIA vision emphasized economic “development” and overlooked the issue of the urban
crisis, a dimension that this chapter explores later.
Flaws in the Public-Private Partnership Model: Comcast Internet Essentials
Having just reviewed the formation of the Freedom Rings Partnership, I will now
turn again to addressing some of the tensions between public and private interests
occurring at the local project level. As part of the goal to increase broadband adoption in
the home, the Freedom Rings Partnership also worked with two programs, Comcast

156
Internet Essentials and Wilco/Mobile Citizen, to enroll eligible Philadelphians into
affordable internet access plans. As key background (because it connects to my argument
about the limits of the private sector in promoting the goals of universal service, Lenert et
al., 2012), in exchange for FCC approval of its acquisition of a majority stake in NBC
Universal (General Electric), in 2011 Comcast agreed to establish the Internet Essentials
program offering a three-year low-cost broadband access ($9.95/month) to poor and
working families with children13 (Federal Communications Commission, 2012). This
arrangement was similar in some ways to the Earthlink rate program discussed earlier in
the context of Wireless Philadelphia. However, as the Internet Essentials program was
limited to families with children –and Philadelphia Housing Authority residents were
constrained due to home wiring limitations – FRP also utilized a partnership with
Wilco/Mobile Citizen14 offering an installation fee of $14.95 and $14.95 per month15.
This represented a more nuanced response to the problems of cost than the 2005 solutions
presented by Earthlink in the municipal WiFi initiative.
Yet, to return to my critique of private sector stakeholder interests, at the end of
the first year of the Freedom Rings Partnership initiative in 2011, site partners had
reported multiple issues with Comcast Internet Essentials. First, in weekly meetings I
attended, partners related that many needy participants were ineligible due to the fact that
the program was limited to families with school-aged children. Second, some reported

Notably, in the wake of new talks of a potential Comcast merger with TimeWarner,
Comcast agreed to extend Internet Essentials “indefinitely.”
14 Wilco is the cable provider for Philadelphia Housing Authority and Mobile Citizen is
the non-profit arm of CLEAR.
15 Also, I would add that participants were eligible only after completing 8 hours of FRP
digital training and if not previously enrolled with high-speed access within previous 90
days.
13

157
that sign-up requirements made it difficult for eligible participants without a permanent
residence (e.g., such as homeless shelter families) to enroll. Third, partners complained
that they had to assume enrollment management responsibilities, though Comcast was
supposed to be more accountable for such tasks. This is simply another example of how
on-the-ground organizations must react and respond to private sector involvement. Yet,
most alarming, at the end of 2011, Internet Essentials had only enrolled 463
Philadelphians in its program (Federal Communications Commission, 2012). To illustrate
the inadequacy of Comcast’s participation in the mission of increasing broadband
adoption, an internal Freedom Rings Partnership mail survey of broadband adoption in
the home conducted by Drexel University at the conclusion of the Freedom Rings
Partnership polling 322 Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) residents found that 36%
utilized Wilco/Mobile Citizen, 23% utilized Verizon, 23% utilized other options, and
only 17% utilized Comcast. In other words, over 80% of those surveyed selected other
internet service providers over Comcast Internet Essentials. This finding should be
shocking, yet Freedom Rings Partnership stakeholders more closely aligned with the
technology sector interests largely dismissed it. Instead, these stakeholders highlighted
later Internet Essential subscription rate “improvements,” as if improvement alone was
adequate.
Therefore, in light of Comcast’s criticisms five years earlier that Mayor Street’s
municipal WiFi program in Philadelphia would promote unfair competition, I would
point out that when collaboration with Comcast was pursued to address pervasive digital
inequalities in the city, notably low-income Philadelphians did not benefit as much as
was promised. Moreover, Internet Essentials was established in exchange for government

158
approval of its acquisition of a majority stake in NBC Universal. Nonetheless, the
program’s limitations rendered many needy Philadelphians ineligible. This episode
highlights some of the enduring “essential tensions” and complexities which color the
history of broadband access programs in Philadelphia and conflicting visions of
information as a commodity or as a public resource (Schement & Curtis, p. 123). Further,
it illustrates the ways in which neoliberalism demarcates the lines between public and
private in the context of the urban crisis and in the contemporary information economy.
In Chapter 6, I will explore this idea further through the perspective a KEYSPOT digital
trainer, Sammy, who in an interview insisted that the private sector interests – like
Comcast –benefit far more from these partnerships than poor and working-class
communities. However, now I will turn to a broader factor shaping not only digital
access, but also framing the economic lives of KEYSPOT participants like Joanne and
Mr. Wilson.
BTOP: An Organic Response to the Urban Crisis
In order to better establish the relationship between digital and economic
inequality in Philadelphia, I will now pivot to the issue of broadband access and the urban
crisis in Philadelphia. At the time of the Freedom Rings Partnership, roughly 41% of
Philadelphians lived without consistent or quality access to broadband Internet (Pew,
2012). In their FCC-sponsored study of broadband adoption issues, scholars Powell,
Byrne and Dailey (2010) rightly frame the issue of digital exclusion as one of inequality
– low broadband penetration rates intersect with high rates of poverty and
under/unemployment. I argue alongside Wolfson (2013) that Philadelphia’s KEYSPOT
program is, in fact, an attempt to respond to the urban crisis –the informal digital

159
economy occupied by participants such as Joanne simply filled the economic “gaps” left
by urban policies of retrenchment (Wolfson & Crowell, 2013). This retrenchment or the
breakdown of durable support institutions per Bauman (2000), is linked to the values of
neoliberalism already discussed in previous chapters. To restate, neoliberalism is a theory
of politics and economics that argues human wellbeing can be achieved through
individualism and free market principles (Harvey 2005; 2006). This philosophy
accordingly holds individuals accountable for their welfare, rather than the society or the
state (Harvey, 2005). In this way, the values of individualism and neoliberalism also
underpin the “urban crisis” which has been marked by burgeoning rates of poverty and
deep poverty; disappearance of waged and full-time work; food insecurity and food
deserts; cuts to educational programs and assistance; and rising incarceration rates–
among other troubling trends.
I am asserting in this dissertation that to understand the disjuncture that exists
between technology policy visions (policymakers) and the realities of contemporary
urban life (policytakers), it is likewise necessary to frame this research within the history
of urban crisis as it has specifically evolved in Philadelphia, touching on the ways in
which racial discrimination, local and federal development and housing policy,
retrenchment, and the ideology of the primacy of market in the information economy has
limited economic prospects for participants like Joanne and Mr. Wilson (Wolfson &
Crowell, 2013). It is also necessary to understand not only the informal digital practices
that participants like Joanne are utilizing, but also the factors motivating their movement
into the informal sector. In his historical analysis of the urban crisis as it unfolded in
Detroit, American historian Thomas Sugrue (2005) argues that although U.S. urban

160
unemployment and poverty is not a new feature of American life, “the forms and
distribution of postindustrial urban poverty are novel” (p. 4). Said differently, something
new, in fact, is occurring in Rust Belt cities like Philadelphia in the era of liquid
modernity and warrants closer study. The new forms of urban poverty, he contends, result
from the fact that the urban poor are increasingly confined to isolation in segregated
neighborhoods and are often detached from the formal economy or entirely removed
from it (Sugrue, 2005, p. 4). Sugrue (2005) as well as Goode and Maskovsky (2001)
maintain that the interaction of racial discrimination, economic trends, pro-market
ideologies, and political forces in the 1940’s – 1960’s have culminated in a “fiscal, social,
and economic crisis” seen today in Rust Belt cities like Detroit and Philadelphia as well
as Baltimore, Chicago, Newark, and Pittsburgh (Goode & Maskovsky, 2001, p. 4;
Sugrue, 2005, p. 5).
I would argue, however, that in Philadelphia these trends began to take shape far
earlier, in part due to the fact that the city’s dominant industries (like garment-making
and metalworking) were impacted by deindustrialization before Detroit’s automotive
industry. Additionally, migration patterns – highly striated by race and class –developed
in the 1930’s and the city’s programmatic response to depopulation and housing was, in
fact, uniquely draconian. Examining the ways in which post-industrialization,
discriminatory social policies and the retrenchment of the welfare state contributed to
reducing the economic prospects for poor and working-class Philadelphians like Joanne
and Mr. Wilson in the formal sector is useful as it provides more explanation into why
and how these liquid labor practices developed. This also pushes back on the standard
neoliberal view that somehow the urban working-class are poor due to personal failures

161
and a lack of self-responsibility. Thus, having discussed the broader stakes of the urban
crisis, I will now turn to a historical analysis of how these economic issues unfolded in
Philadelphia to better frame the economic lives of working class Philadelphians today.
The Economy of Early Philadelphia
In this chapter, I suggest that tracing how the entrenched patterns of inequality in
Philadelphia hardened over time challenges the frame of neoliberalism, as it reveals that
critical policy and political decisions played a major role in limiting the social and
economic mobility of low-income Philadelphians. So, how can we better understand the
current economic crisis in the context of this longer history? The economic fortunes of
the city have changed quite considerably over time. In the 1770’s, Philadelphia was the
U.S.’s richest coastal city (boasting the first bank and the first stock exchange), the
second largest city in the British Empire after London, and the national capital (Hodos,
2002, p. 358). Though New York gained advantages in finance –and Philadelphia
ultimately lost its position as capital to Washington, D.C. –early Philadelphia became a
manufacturing stronghold in industries like metalworking, machining, garment-making,
chemicals, and drugs (Hodos, 2002, p. 358). In the period of 1880-1930, Philadelphia
experienced substantial growth in its economic base, population, as well as increased
housing construction (Greenberg, 1981, p. 306). Thus, the city’s position as a
manufacturing stronghold and its place in the industrial economy was shaped very early
in the city’s history. Interestingly, Nash (1986) argues that the economic industries and
social tensions in the early coastal cities like Philadelphia in many ways shaped the
country’s future, as the “conception of an indivisible public good or commonwealth” was
weakened in favor of championing strong free market principles (p. 97).

162
I want to also highlight that the widespread patterns of racial segregation seen in
contemporary Philadelphia have resulted, in part, from decades and decades of
discriminatory politics and policies. As an example, whereas in the early 1900’s jobs
were largely located in the same areas in the heart of Philadelphia, beginning in the
1930’s transportation infrastructure changes allowed for greater movement and thus for
the city’s population to be distributed over a wider area (Greenberg, 1981, p. 307).
Regions of the city that were highly industrialized in 1880 and failed to attract new jobs
in the 1930’s deteriorated more rapidly than those areas that promised new manufacturing
jobs. Black Americans of the time were more likely to become trapped in these areas
because as the composition of available jobs changed, they were far less likely to have
access to the transportation needed to enter new residential housing outside of the city in
suburban areas (DuBois, 1899; Greenberg, 1981). Thus, communities of color began to
become enclosed in Philadelphia’s fastest deteriorating neighborhoods (Greenberg,
1981). This situation only worsened over time, and can still be seen in present day
residential patterns and high poverty tracts in the city (Yapa, 1998).
It is also worth noting that the composition of jobs available in the early 1900’s to
communities of color were different than those available to poor and working class white
residents. For instance, in this early period, black Philadelphians were more likely to
work in domestic or personal services – around 60% of men and 90% of women – and
did not benefit from manufacturing work as much as their white counterparts (DuBois,
1899). Furthermore, though immigrant groups like the Irish or Italians were subject to
discrimination, they were still more likely to work in jobs that offered them some
protections in the form of unions or other collectives (DuBois, 1899). For example,

163
during the Depression era, craft guilds for tanners and carpenters expanded to provide
opportunities – and political organizing power – to many disenfranchised Philadelphians
(Nash, 1986). Yet, people of color were largely excluded from admission to these guilds
(Nash, 1986).
To return to the history of discriminatory urban housing policies, as depopulation
trends continued throughout the 1940’s, in 1949 the Philadelphia Redevelopment
Authority attempted to respond by authorizing the City Planning Commission to survey
the older and deteriorating sections of the city, most of which were populated by poor and
working-class immigrants and minorities. On the basis of that survey, the demolition of
158,000 housing units in distressed areas (or 26% of all available city housing) and the
“rehabilitation” of another 72,000 units was recommended (Klenieweski, 1986, p. 567).
To address the displacement of the poor and working-class populations from the areas
marked for demolition, the commission established new residential housing in Eastwick,
a large vacant area on the periphery of the city, adjacent to the Philadelphia airport
(Klenieweski, 1986). To many of the urban poor, this forced relocation to the isolated
Eastwick area was akin to isolating them on a “reservation” (Klenieweski, 1986, p. 571).
Further, while this plan may have benefitted city development interests, it increased racial
segregation and removed poor and working-class residents from access to jobs,
transportation, and vital employment social networks. These are factors that would
contribute greatly to the current economic situation, as this caused many urban
Philadelphians to become more and more detached from the formal economy and formal
sector job opportunities (Taylor et al., 2010, p. 19).

164
During the 1950’s period, some efforts were made to stave off urban decline and
deindustrialization. However, again, I would argue that the private sector was one of the
primary beneficiaries of these endeavors. For instance, in 1958 Philadelphia mayor
Richardson H. Dilworth worked with the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce to form a
nonprofit known as the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) to
attempt to support the manufacturing industry and stave off trends of deindustrialization
beginning to impact other Rust Belt manufacturing strongholds throughout the U.S.
(McKee, 2004). By utilizing its tax-free status, the program was designed to shift the cost
of urban redevelopment to the federal government, thus avoiding local costs and
unpopular relocation programs. While the program was successful in creating jobs,
reshaping public policies to stimulate manufacturing growth, and increasing tax revenues
for the city, this approach primarily benefited private companies. For example,
multinational corporations such as Scott Paper, Crown Cork and Seal, and Campbell
Soup (across the Delaware River in Camden, New Jersey) came to call Philadelphia
home. However, PIDC did not attempt to address trends of racial segregation and
working-class Philadelphians were still largely confined to poor-paying or unskilled jobs
in the in the primary manufacturing sector (e.g., janitorial, assembly work) as well as in
the secondary manufacturing sector (e.g., service work) (Sugrue, 2005). While labor
unions offered more protection to poor workers of color than it did in the previous period,
Sugrue (2005)–aligned with Kabeer, Milward and Sudarshan (2013) who address limited
protections for women workers –notes that some unions “quietly acquiesced” to
discriminatory hiring or promotion practices (Sugrue, 2005, p. 11). Thus, even as the
government was making efforts to shore up the struggling formal economy, at this point,

165
we also begin to see worker protections breaking down. These trends have only continued
to worsen and likewise run parallel to the wider breakdown of durable institutions
Bauman describes (2000).
Philadelphia’s Urban Crisis
Whereas policy interventions like PIDC led to some gains in manufacturing in the
1950’s and 1960’s, during the 1970s Rust Belt cities experienced a steep economic
downturn as automated production enabled corporations to move to less costly (and
nonunionized) rural areas, suburban areas, or overseas (Goode & Maskvosky, 2001;
Massey & Denton, 1990; Massey & Eggers, 1990; Sugrue, 2005; Wilson, 1996). Scholars
such as Inman (1995) and Sugrue (2005) are right to point out that governmental policies
contributed to the predicament: federal cuts to urban programs decreased support for the
poor, and government housing plans often reinforced racial inequalities. Additionally,
mortgage-tax exemptions for would-be home buyers, expansion of transportation
highway projects, and military investment in suburban areas only further accelerated
patterns of urban flight as more and more middle class (largely white) residents and
businesses acquired the means (and mode) to leave the cities (Sugrue, 2005; Wilson,
1996). As the landscape architecture of the city changed to accommodate increased
commuter traffic to the outlying areas, roadways and bridges cut through low-income
areas of Philadelphia in such a way as to prevent pedestrian traffic or bicycling (Yapa,
1998). In other words, a constellation of policy decisions hastened deindustrialization and
the contemporary urban crisis. Although some minority populations did increase their
numbers in suburban Philadelphia, on the other hand, urban communities of color lost
their white residents to suburban areas much more quickly (Massey & Eggers, 1990;

166
Quillian, 1999). As Jargowsky (1996) argues, the fact that trends of depopulation,
poverty, and class and racial segregation became more and more widespread in Rust Belt
cities throughout the U.S. –despite differences in local economies and housing
availability –indicated an impending urban crisis, but also that an unfortunate
“fundamental and important process [was] underway” (p. 997). Said differently, as I also
argue in this project, new relationships were forming between work and capital in urban
America.
To connect this history back to my project, how did these trends impact the
economic lives of the urban poor and their access to formal and informal work? I should
explain here that class and racial segregation dramatically reshapes economic prospects
for the urban poor by disrupting both the: 1) Development of formal employment
networks, such as close accessibility to areas where jobs are; and by, 2) Weakening
informal employment networks, such as the ability to get a job through recommendation
from a friend or hearing about a job in the community (Sugrue, 2005; Wilson, 1996). In
other words, to reconnect to Straubhaar et al.’s (2002) claim presented in Chapter 3,
social connections and cultural capital are often required to obtain such jobs, especially in
the burgeoning technology field (p. 26). In this way, joblessness became a defining
feature of the “new urban poverty” – Philadelphia residents who could not afford a car to
travel to new opportunities in the suburbs often became unemployed or dropped out of
the labor force altogether (Wilson, 1996, p. 19). Through this process, the emergence of
temporary and low-wage “casual labor” (e.g., part-time, temporary construction work)
proliferated and urban underemployment and unemployment rates increased as well
(Sugrue, 2005, p.121; Taylor et al., 2010, p. 19). As I will demonstrate in Chapter 6,

167
these were the types of formal sector opportunities available to KEYSPOT job seekers
like Joanne or Mr. Wilson.
The high poverty rates that resulted from pervasive urban unemployment and
underemployment triggered a more complete economic withdrawal and retrenchment
from already struggling poor neighborhoods in Philadelphia. While withdrawal and
collapse is a complex process, it is caused by a number of discrete factors I will outline
here. First, demand for goods and services changes when residents in a given area have
less income. For example, purchase of groceries may plummet and stores may close.
Demand for services like utilities also declines – notably, this can also preclude future
private investment in the community’s infrastructure, like laying higher speed fiber optic
cable for Internet access, which again, compounds digital inequality (Massey & Denton,
1990). Second, public community infrastructure is weakened. As residents have less or
no income to tax, public funded education or other institutions like libraries providing
information access to the community may deteriorate, limiting future opportunities for
community members, especially children (Massey & Denton, 1990). Third, collapse can
spread: a reduction in revenues can undermine not only the infrastructure of poor
neighborhoods, but over time begin to undermine the city’s budget and wider
infrastructure. In sum, each change touches another, transforming the overall ecology of
urban neighborhoods. The end result is that the formal economy begins to breakdown and
complex survival strategies – including liquid labor –can spring up in the cracks and
fissures. It is important emphasize that while I am focusing on economic issues to
contextualize the economic lives of BTOP participant and “liquid labor” practices,

168
poverty has “multiplicity of causes” and non-economic factors can also shape the ecology
of low-income communities (Yapa, 1996).
So, how did the city government respond to this growing crisis? In an attempt to
respond to the effects of the urban crisis in Philadelphia, in the mid-1970’s
redevelopment programs –recalling the forced relocation to Eastwick discussed earlier –
were revived as City Planning Commission chair Bernard Meltzer advocated the use of
eminent domain and new relocation programs to move the poor and working-class
population to the suburbs and other areas of the city. Programs and projects like
Meltzer’s reflected one of the predominant urban planning strategies Rust Belt cities
utilized to respond to the urban crisis: Klenieweski (1986) aptly terms it “triage” (p. 563).
Taking the name from the medical practice of separating patients who would live with
care and those that would not, Klenieweski (1986) demonstrates that “triage” came to
define many urban planning programs in post-industrial cities like Philadelphia
throughout the 1970’s that selected some neighborhoods for renewal and others for
“recycle.” In this way, the city of Philadelphia failed to develop more comprehensive
structural solutions to the urban crisis, leaving the poor neighborhoods vulnerable to
further collapse, and imperiling future investment in poor communities. In all these ways,
a critical history of the politics and policies of urban space help frame a study of the
economic lives of KEYSPOT participants as well as the modern formal and informal
urban digital economy in Philadelphia.
Globalization and the Shift to the Information Economy
To turn to the information economy, during the period between the 1980’s and
1990’s, industrial cities like Philadelphia – already struggling in the wake of the urban

169
crisis –were also among the hardest hit by globalization and the shift to a technology,
information and service-based economy (Bell, 1976; Castells, 1989; Cohen, 1981;
Harvey, 2006; Hodos, 2002; Sassen, 1991). As Philadelphia-based companies attempted
to expand their global influence and keep pace with technological changes, the
manufacturing industry that had long served as the economic bedrock for cities like
Philadelphia moved overseas and the economic prospects of low-skilled workers were
therefore further diminished (Wilson, 1996). The digital workforce divide hit
Philadelphia hard: manufacturing in Philadelphia dropped from 45% in 1970 to 24% in
1990; in the same period, manufacturing employment plummeted from 51% to 31%
(Hodos, 2002; Wilson, 1996). Between 1950 and 1980, Philadelphia also lost half of its
Fortune 500 headquarters, reduced from 13 to 6 (Cohen, 1981). Arguing that the city
must “promote local interaction with global economic forces and factors” and reinforcing
the politics of neoliberalism and the primacy of the market, the Greater Philadelphia
Chamber of Commerce responded by forming a committee of 27 CEOs of local
companies to promote economic development (Hodos, 2002, p. 369). Note that the
language of “promoting” global interaction mimics the technology industry perspective
reflected in The Arnold Group (2011) report I reviewed in Chapter 4. In other words, the
city embraced the private sector and its role in contributing to the digital workforce
divide and the impact of deregulation or privatization on the poor was not challenged.
As I addressed in Chapter 3 in my discussion of the digital workforce divide,
while technological changes may have opened up new high-skilled employment
opportunities in the service and financial sector, in contrast, many low-skilled jobs were
rendered obsolete or shifted overseas (Goode & Maskovsky, 2001; Wilson, 1996).

170
Further, echoing Bauman’s (2000) breakdown of durable institutions, temporary, parttime, and contract work became more common (Goode & Maskvosky, 2001). To better
illustrate this digital workforce divide, in the period between 1987 – 1989, low skilled
male workers were unemployed an average of two months longer than they were twenty
years before –and twice as likely to drop out of the workforce altogether (Wilson, 1996).
Census data from 1990 reporting on the nation’s 100 largest cities revealed that the ratio
of jobless residents to employed residents was over three times higher in poverty
neighborhoods, magnifying the patterns of inequality established during the urban crisis
of the 1970’s (Wilson, 1996). In short, the combination of manufacturing decline,
continued racial discrimination in hiring, and technological changes pushed the urban
poor to “the economic margins” as many moved to informal work or left the labor market
altogether (Sugrue, 2005, p. 262). With lack of opportunities in the formal sector, the
poor entered “survival circuits” – the city’s drug trade endured and incarceration rates in
poor urban communities soared to unprecedented rates (Alexander, 2012; Sassen,
2009slack; Wacquant, 2009). This also marks the passage into the informal digital labor
market, as struggling residents like Joanne began to explore new avenues for economic
opportunity.
Retrenchment and the Information Economy
As touched on in Chapter 3, policies of welfare state retrenchment and the
breakdown of durable institutions only compounded the economic issues facing urban
Americans. To restate, although post-industrial urban areas had not recovered from the
crisis of the 1970’s, federal support and programs benefitting cities and their residents
were drastically cut or reduced in the 1990’s. My project supports the position adopted by

171
New Poverty Studies scholars like Goode & Maskovksy (2001) who contend that this
shift was due in part to neoliberalism and the political imperative to end “state
dependency” and embrace the logic of the market and privatization practices (Goode &
Maskovsky, 2001, p. 8). To give a more precise picture of how this has impacted cities,
in 1980, federal contribution to city budgets was 18%, yet by 1990 it had dropped to
6.4% (Wilson, 2011, p. 49). As discussed in Chapter 3 in the context of the informal
economy literature, programs that had benefited many poor working urban people,
especially mothers (like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC) were cut
(Wilson, 1996) and welfare programs were transitioned to “workfare” programs (Goode
& Maskovksy, 2001, p. 5). These policy changes dramatically reshaped the economic
fortunes – and working arrangements – for poor families in urban communities.
To expand on the above point, as already stated in Chapter 3, Grabham and Smith
(2010) argue –drawing on Marxist feminist thought – that the focus on “workfare” in
policy elevated the importance of “working” and diminished the importance of social
reproduction and the work of mothering (Grabham & Smith, 2010, p. 84 - 90). Following
from this and further straining urban families, the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 also put a lifetime limit on the
length of time a household could receive welfare (Collins, 2008; Edin & Lein, 1997;
Mink, 1998; Weigt, 2006). The federal minimum wage was likewise allowed to fall, also
further constraining the economic lives of the urban poor. It is also meaningful to add that
new welfare reporting rules also meant every dollar received from a child’s father for
child support resulted in a decrease in the overall entitlement contribution, thus many
mothers began to simply bypass the formal systems and receive support from fathers

172
directly (Edin & Lein, 1997, p. 144; Stack, 1974). This also presaged new economic
arrangements for urban families who needed to find ways to retain their social benefits.
While the discourses of individualism and neoliberalism played a major role in
ushering in a large-scale rollback of the social safety net, a harmful dominant frame of
the black urban mother emerging in this period also dampened public support for welfare
(Piven, 2001). To elaborate on this, in his 1976 Republican presidential primary contest,
then governor Ronald Reagan spoke of a black woman in Chicago bilking the welfare
system out of hundreds of thousands of dollars - the “welfare queen” stereotype was thus
borne. This reductionist frame captured none of the complexities of urban life and yet
was used as a cudgel against political support for welfare policy, painting all black
mothers as promiscuous and lazy (Bobo & Smith 1994; Page & Shapiro 1992). Weeks
(2009) argues that this frame represented a larger “attack on poor women,” a punishment
levied against low-income mothers due to the perception that single motherhood, and in
many cases poverty itself, is a result of personal and moral failings rather than structural
conditions (Edin & Lein, 1997; Weeks, 2009, p. 102). A distinction began to be made in
public discourse between the deserving or undeserving poor as political rhetoric of
neoliberalism painted urban mothers as “welfare queens” and black men as dangerous
(Goode & Maskovsky, 2001; Gil, 2007). As Goode and Maskovsky (2001) state in line
with the neoliberal project, “The deserving poor are now those who embrace the spirit of
entrepreneurship, voluntarism, consumerism, and self-help, while the undeserving poor
are those who remain ‘dependent’ on the state” (p. 8). I use this quote to highlight that
“entrepreneurship” was championed as a positive frame, but as I addressed in the key
terms section of Chapter 1, poor and working-class individuals are unable to take certain

173
risks due to their precarious financial positions. And as I will address in Chapter 7,
participants like Joanne were also less likely to have access to the resources needed to
establish a formal business venture. So, whereas the welfare state restructuring changes
were articulated under the neoliberal language of “responsibility,” this language papers
over the underlying policy frame that painted low income black parents as both immoral
and overly reliant on the largesse of the state (Duggan 2003; Grabham & Smith, 2010).
I would be remiss if I did not note here that in the 1990’s there were some slight
gains for low-income workers in Philadelphia in areas such as healthcare (resulting from
expansion of the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Thomas Jefferson
University) and education (as universities like Drexel and Temple moved to set-up global
campuses) (Hodos, 2002). As I will discuss in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, a KEYSPOT
participant (Ron) directly benefitted from this expansion and obtained a job in the
healthcare sector during this period. Yet, while there were some improvements for the
city’s economy in the 1990’s, the job losses from the previous decades, continued
depopulation, and rising levels of poverty translated to deep revenue losses for the city.
Ultimately, in September of 1990, the city of Philadelphia went to the municipal-bond
market to borrow $375 million dollars, almost twice the previous yearly request for $188
million, to cover deficits from the previous 6 city budgets (Inman, 1995). The request
was rejected by borrowers and the city fell into a 3-year fiscal crisis. In other words, the
city funds were inadequate to meet its required expenses. This was also the end result of
the urban crisis neighborhood ecology effect I referenced earlier.
Tracing the history of the city’s low-income neighborhoods highlights the role
that both politics and policies have played in constraining opportunities for many poor

174
and working-class communities of color. I present this history to push back on a standard
view – peddled by the discourses of neoliberalism and individualism –that urban poverty
is an individual problem, related to personal deficiencies like a lack of work ethic. Thus,
instead I have emphasized the ways in which post-industrialization, discriminatory
policies, and the breakdown of durable institutions like the welfare state have worked
together to reduce economic opportunities for urban Philadelphians. In the face of grim
economic prospects, many have turned to new strategies for survival – including the
liquid labor practices I am analyzing in this project.
Contemporary Philadelphia: Surviving the Digital Workforce Divide
In sum, I argue that a digital workforce divide paradigm provides a useful frame
to understand the present situation in Philadelphia (Rodino-Colocino, 2006). The ongoing
urban crisis significantly contributed to that divide, heightened by trends of
deindustrialization, depopulation, reduction in federal support programs, globalization,
and retrenchment. While my focus hitherto has been historical, I want to point out that
economic struggles continued in Philadelphia, which during the timeframe of the
KEYSPOT project had the highest rate of poverty of any of the top ten U.S. cities as
28.4% of its population lived below the poverty line (Pew, 2013). At the time of the
KEYSPOT project, Philadelphia also had the highest rate of “deep poverty”—people
living below half of the poverty line—of any of the country’s most populous cities. To
elaborate, the average annual income for someone living in deep poverty is $5,700 or
$11,700 for a family of four and Philadelphia’s deep-poverty rate was 12.9%, which
practically means around 200,000 residents lived in deep poverty during the data
collection period (Pew, 2013).

175
How do the poverty measures fit more precisely within employment patterns in
the formal sector? Following the 2009 economic crisis that precipitated the ARRA,
unemployment in Philadelphia began rising steadily. In 2012 during the BTOP grant
project, approximately 11.5% of Philadelphians were unemployed and a much larger
number of Philadelphians were underemployed (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). The
median annual income in Philadelphia was then approximately $34,000, or $16,000
below the national average (Pew, 2012). While there were some gains in the health and
education sector in the city as I discussed earlier, for low-income Philadelphia many
opportunities remained in the service sector or in unskilled labor (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2013). As addressed in Chapter 3 –and as will be discussed in more depth in
the following chapter –service sector jobs and unskilled jobs are increasingly by-contract,
part-time, or temporary without a salary or health benefits. In other words, formal sector
opportunities were extremely limited, and those that were available to low-income
Philadelphians did not provide a living wage nor necessary benefits like healthcare.
Looking more closely at the statistics around poverty in Philadelphia, it is clear
that the problem adversely impacted families in the region: 31% of families with children
under the age of 18 live in poverty and 47% of families with children are headed by
women living in poverty (Pew, 2012). Philadelphia’s public education system is also
underfunded. The Philadelphia School District has been in a fiscal crisis since 2001 and
in an effort to close a budget gap of more than $200 million, the city’s School Reform
Commission voted to close 23 schools in 2013 and planned to close 64 more by 2017
(Herold, 2012). In this way, we can see that the urban crisis and the digital workforce
divide has a devastating effect on poor families, constraining their ability to meet basic

176
reproductive needs, such as feeding and educating their children. To refer to the Marxist
feminist arguments presented in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, again scholars have suggested
that this is one of the goals of neoliberal capitalism: to elevate work values and similarly
demote the role social reproduction plays in society (Abel & Nelson, 1990; England &
Folbre, 2002; Fisher & Tronto, 1990; Folbre, 1994, 2001). In other words, these burdens
on poor families have generated a new set of working arrangements, as individuals must
learn to balance economic and childcare needs.
So, where do high rates of poverty, the rollback of social programs, racial
discrimination, inequitable local and federal development policies, and the digital
workforce divide leave KEYSPOT parents like Joanne? Practically, the difficult
economic climate has meant that many poor and working-class residents like Joanne must
work more than one job to survive and it has accordingly pushed many urban
Philadelphians into the informal economy. So, while the standard view taken in the
immaterial labor literature (Alessandrini, 2012; Arvidsson, 2009, Jenkins, 2008; Virno,
2004) and in federal broadband policy would celebrate such practices as
“entrepreneurial,” again, I suggest that this view does not recognize the structural barriers
and discriminatory policies that have made such arrangements necessary for poor and
working-class Philadelphians. Further, this over-celebratory view does not address the
fact that such “entrepreneurship” does not provide the type of stability and support
families may need, such as a predictable salary, health benefits, retirement benefits, or
sick leave. Therefore, it is important to situate this project within a particular social,
economic and political landscape to properly evaluate the economic lives of BTOP
participants and the relationship between informal work and the contemporary

177
information economy. In the following chapter, I will explore this further through
chronicling the specific experiences KEYSPOT visitors pursuing jobs in the formal
sector.
Conclusion
As discussed in Chapter 4, the ARRA and the resultant BTOP programs were
engineered with the objective of stimulating the economy and creating jobs in the wake
of the Great Recession. Tracing the longer history of digital programs and the urban crisis
in Philadelphia is pertinent, as it highlights the ways in which social, economic, and
political forces shaped city visions and plans for broadband access and further
constrained the economic opportunities available for poor families of color in
Philadelphia. I include this history because it reveals that the current shift to the informal
economy witnessed in in the context of BTOP is not simply the result of inevitable
economic forces and it has not occurred in a vacuum. Rather, it is the result of federal and
local policies that prioritize the market, “development” or private interests – be it through
the failures of Wireless Philadelphia or the relocation policies pursued through Eastwick
–often at the expense of the urban poor, exacerbating trends of digital exclusion,
economic isolation, and racial segregation. Further, this history combats the political
ideology of neoliberalism that would seek to make a distinction between the “deserving”
and “undeserving” poor or pathologize poverty as a condition related to morality or a lack
of personal responsibility.
In short, while tangled, a historical examination of structural problems
surrounding digital inequality and economic opportunity in Philadelphia contextualizes
the emergence of liquid labor practices today. It likewise highlights the role that the

178
urban crisis has played in constraining opportunities for Americans and the economic
lives of urban families more particularly. In the next chapter, I will extend my exploration
of these issues to KEYSPOTs, considering the barriers to formal opportunities in
Philadelphia and detailing what types of formal sector job opportunities were sought by
participants and what opportunities were indeed available. I will demonstrate that the
opportunities available were largely low-skilled, low-paid, and part-time. I suggest that
these barriers to the formal economy are the result of social, political and economic
factors – including the urban crisis –and reflect a broader restructuring of the
relationships between capital and labor. That being said, I will now turn to introduce my
participant, Ron, on the first day I met him at a KEYSPOT Digital Jobs fair in 2012.

Chapter 6
Working Class Jobs in the Formal [Digital] Economy
Introduction
On a cold Saturday morning in January of 2012, hundreds of unemployed and
underemployed Philadelphians flocked to historic Girard College16 in West North
Philadelphia to attend job events which included a Freedom Rings Partnership “Digital
Jobs Fair,” an in-person jobs fair, and various free development and digital skills
workshops. On the day of the Girard College event – also associated with the citywide
Martin Luther King Day of Service –some of the several hundred job seekers first
trickled into a medium-sized classroom where attendees without home internet access
were offered the opportunity to use laptops to draft emails to prospective employers or
create and print their resumes. Such job-related events were particularly well attended –
because as discussed in the preceding chapter on the urban crisis– Philadelphia
unemployment rates climbed steadily following the 2009 economic crisis that
precipitated the ARRA. In 2012, approximately 11.5% of Philadelphians were
unemployed and a much larger number of Philadelphians were underemployed (Bureau
of Labor Statistics, 2012).
At the fair, representatives from KEYSPOTs around the city spoke with job
seekers about how to search for opportunities and the benefits of home internet access. A
few attendees lingered to use the computers; quizzically one woman holding a black

Girard College is notably a Philadelphia historic site; Civil Rights protests erupted on
the campus during the 1960’s after local NAACP chapter president Cecil B. Moore
demanded that the school desegregate and allow African Americans to apply for school
admission (Temple University Libraries, 2011).

folder asked, “Wait, are there companies here to talk to?” Job-seekers then wandered
down an interior corridor into classrooms where Target Corporation volunteers in
branded red t-shirts led workforce development workshops on topics like “Resume
Writing” and “Building Your Personal Brand.”
After stopping at the Digital Jobs Fair and the Target event, job-seekers entered a
larger crowded open area where representatives from companies including Comcast,
AT&T, Vanguard and Piedmont Airlines were seated in rows at folded tables. A young
African American man approached the Piedmont Airlines table with his printed resume in
hand, yet was instructed only to, “follow the company on Facebook and Twitter.” A
young woman moved toward the Comcast table and explained to the representative, “I
work at a daycare center right now.” Another man in a tweed baseball cap pushed
through the crowd and questioned a recruiter, “You need a driver’s license? Mine is
suspended for a ticket.”
Leaning against a back wall with a folder of freshly printed resumes, Ron, 45,
who recently lost his job in the healthcare sector in the wake of the Great Recession,
explained that that while the companies gathered at the in-person event were “topnotch”
many of the representatives he spoke with, “were just like ‘hey, let’s keep going, look at
the website’.” With a sigh, he admitted that the jobs such companies would provide could
be superior to “factory work” but many of the positions were only part-time. When
questioned about his access to a computer and technological skill, Ron replied that he had
two laptops at home, fluency in social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn, and
digital skills including expertise in Photoshop and Illustrator. Regarding his perception of
the current employment landscape in urban Philadelphia Ron observed: “I think the best

181
area to go into is some type of form of customer service, where it is high demand, low
reward.”
Overview
Ron’s challenges in finding well-paid opportunities in the formal sector and my
interaction with other attendees at the KEYSPOT Digital Jobs Fair paints a portrait of
some of the myriad challenges facing low-income job seekers in Philadelphia. So, what
impediments exist to finding formal work in the modern informational city? In what
fields and sectors were KEYSPOT participants gaining jobs? As my opening vignette
reveals and as I have addressed in previous chapters as well, some of the challenges
facing this population of job-seekers included: 1) The rise of part-time work in sectors
that are “high demand, low reward,”; 2) Structural barriers that can limit access to
opportunities, like lack of a driver’s license or access to transportation; 3) A job history
that does not prepare you for high-skilled work, such as, “I work at a daycare center right
now,”; 4) The reality that even with digital access and skills, work opportunities may still
be limited for low-income urban Philadelphians; and, 5) Intrusive social media job
application tactics that may exploit desperate job seekers. Yet, how can these challenges
be better explained and how did they impact the search for work in the formal sector?
And if Ron had already acquired access and advanced digital skills –why was his jobsearch still unsuccessful? In order to present the complex economic terrain that I have
just described, in this chapter I will examine what type of digital work skills participants
obtained in FRP programs and then address some of the barriers such job-seekers faced in
the formal economy.

182
Following from this, what are the key insights I am developing in this chapter? To
first explain the work skills obtained and address these barriers –building on the insights
in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 –I will provide more detail on what type of “digital workforce
skills” are sought and obtained in the context of the KEYSPOT programs. This includes
hard skills (such as typing) and soft skills (such as resume writing). Second, I will
address the barriers to formal sector opportunities and concretize the digital workforce
divide, including detailing what types of job opportunities were sought by participants
and what opportunities were indeed available in Philadelphia. Third, I will argue that
although technological skills were necessary to obtain work due to online applications,
the opportunities available were largely low-skilled, low-paid, part-time and may have
required only minimal computer skills. The positions were also overwhelmingly located
in the reproductive labor sectors I discussed briefly in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, in other
words sectors such as carework, domestic labor and some service work. Notably, these
sectors did not provide work that was flexible for parents like Ron. Fourth, I will address
how the lack of well-paid jobs may have contributed to the continued need for social
support programs. Last, I will present some of the unique challenges digital technology
may present for working class job seekers, such as the ways in which digital applications
may result in “social sorting” and explain how desperate work seekers feel increased
pressure to submit to invasive applicant screening practices. Finally, to connect to my
larger point, in this chapter I assert that these barriers to the formal economy reflect a
broader restructuring of the relationships between capital and labor in urban U.S.
economies. The formal sector limitations I will begin to outline in this chapter lays the
groundwork for Chapter 7, where I suggest that struggling KEYSPOT participants may

183
seek opportunities in the informal economy, or in other words, pursue liquid labor. In
short, this chapter provides a more nuanced insight into the economic lives of BTOP
participants.
Before I move into my data analysis regarding the barriers to formal sector work,
however, I would like to revisit a few earlier arguments that are crucial to this chapter. In
Chapter 4, I addressed the development of broadband policy and, more specifically, the
evolution of the goals of digital labor. I subsequently charted the shift from a broadband
access focus to a digital skills focus. I argued that the policymaker vision of economic
development was at odds with some of the on-the-ground economic and social realities
impacting low-income job seekers –or the “policytakers” in the wake of the urban crisis
as I addressed in Chapter 5. Though I highlighted these contradictory stakeholder
interests and assessed their relationship to the pervasive digital myths Mosco (2004)
described – which peddle technology as a cheap solution to complex urban problems –I
did not offer a detailed account of how KEYSPOT programs developed and organized
their courses to teach workforce skills to participants in the first place. Thus, I want to
underscore, before I move on, that these KEYSPOT skills courses were not ineffective at
their objective of training and connecting some participants to jobs. For example, in this
chapter I will highlight the stories of participants like Dinah, who obtained a position
through KEYSPOTs. Said another way, I want to emphasize: participants found jobs. So,
the argument that I am developing in this chapter instead is that despite the administration
of successful training programs, many KEYSPOT visitors were unable to obtain the type
of full-time, good-paying jobs with benefits they needed to make ends meet. Most
notably, the positions were inflexible to the reproductive labor needs of families. What is

184
important here is that as a result of the retrenchment of the welfare state, the breakdown
of durable social support institutions, and the degradation of reproductive labor in the era
of liquid modernity, participants who found jobs continued to need social support
program assistance to survive. In other words, the digital myth that imparting digital
access and skills can reduce the need for social programs among low-income
Philadelphians rings hollow.
As a related point on digital access and skills, I am also asserting that a strict
“access” and “skills” policy focus overlooks the ways that class and social position can
shape interactions and attitudes toward ICTs. As revealed through the experience of Mr.
Wilson in Chapter 1 and in Chapter 3 in the context of the Digital Impact Group report
(2009) on “technophobia,” by assuming low-income populations do not adopt new
technologies because of fear or because they cannot grasp its usefulness, the ways in
which technological tools can oppress or exploit this most vulnerable class of job-seekers
is overlooked. This includes Mr. Wilson but also a participant, Tiara, who I will introduce
in this chapter. This fits with Mosco’s (2004) argument as well – the myth of technology
as synonymous with constant social progress can cloud our ability to properly critique
digital tools. So, emphasizing all these dimensions is important background not only to
better contextualize the lack of access to good jobs KEYSPOT visitors endured, but also
to understand how the process of informalization I will explore in Chapter 7 – or liquid
labor – relates to the contemporary information economy. However, in order to
understand the economic lives of KEYSPOT job-seekers more specifically, it is first
necessary to provide more background on how the goals of digital labor I reviewed in

185
Chapter 4 were actually implemented and executed in the KEYSPOTs workforce training
courses.
The Freedom Rings Partnership: Developing Digital Workforce Skills
Having sketched out the broader stakes and goals of this chapter, to begin, what
“digital workforce skills” were taught in KEYSPOT courses? As discussed in Chapter 4,
the ARRA represented the federal government’s policy response to the Great Recession.
Its objectives were to preserve and create jobs, provide some relief to the unemployed,
and promote the development of U.S. infrastructure. More specifically, as I outlined in
my discussion of the Falling Through the Net and Digital Economy series, policymakers
saw developing technology “access” and “skills” as a means to jumpstart the formal
economy and increase institutional efficiencies. Accordingly, BTOP grant applications
also reflected and reinforced this policy focus. As presented in Chapter 3 and 4, Hauge
and Prieger (2015) concluded that “workforce development” was the most cited target
statement in BTOP grant applications. In fact, the statement was referenced 963 times,
and other economically focused target statements included “small business” with 119
references (Hauge & Prieger, p. 6559). In this way, grantees reinforced the prevailing
goals of digital labor and this was further reflected in program development.
In this way, “workforce development” and stimulating the economy was outlined
as one of the primary objectives of the Freedom Rings Partnership. However, as
discussed in Chapter 4, this vision was differentiated somewhat between lead partners,
community organizations, and individual trainers— or, between the policymakers and the
policytakers. Some stakeholders emphasized the economic prosperity dimension whereas
others focused on political participation (Schement, 2009). Said differently, the various

186
groups had unique visions on how training should occur and how to position their
instruction within the context of community needs. However, I want to highlight that
nonetheless a substantial percentage of overall training hours were dedicated to
workforce development skills across all sites. Approximately 13% percent of the total
training hours for the public computing centers (PCC grant) were devoted to Microsoft
Office alone whereas 10% of digital training sessions (SBA grant) were focused strictly
on digital workforce skills courses, including certified job training programs like the
“International Computer Driver’s License” (Gangadharan, Carolan & Chan, 2013, p. 43).
To give a more detailed picture of how heavily community organizations invested in
workforce skills training, as of May, 2013, Philadelphia FIGHT – an HIV/AIDS health
advocacy organization – had alone provided 1,864 hours of the “job readiness” training
courses to 280 participants and 1,753 hours of Microsoft Office skills training to 222
participants (ASR Analytics, 2012a, p. 12). In other words, while stakeholder visions
diverged, workforce training and job search support was a significant dimension across
the partnership. I would also point out that the Freedom Rings Partnership itself was a
significant source of employment for the city. The PCC grant created or maintained 77
part-time lab assistant positions and 11 full-time managing positions. Additionally, the
SBA program created or maintained 45 full-time positions, including management and
training positions (Gangadharan et al., 2012, p. 44).
Job search a was a strong motivation for visiting KEYSPOTs. As mentioned in
Chapter 1, some additional research was conducted by other FRP partners as well,
including a mixed methods study (surveys and focus groups) sponsored by the Open
Technology Institute (OTI) of the New America Foundation. Their findings support many

187
of the conclusions of this project, including my assertion that KEYSPOT visitors
accessed sites and enrolled in programs seeking economic opportunity. To be more
specific, one of the measures utilized was a workstation user survey17 administered at
public computing centers (PCC) and computer training (SBA) sites across the
partnership. According to the OTI survey findings, the second most cited motivation for
visiting a KEYSPOT was, “to look (or apply) for a job” and about 30% credited the
KEYSPOT with helping connect them with work opportunities (Gangadharan et al.,
2013, p. 43). Additionally, 52% of the 550 Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA)
residents that responded to a Drexel University mail survey reported using program
resources to search for a job whereas an additional 17% reported finding work as a result
of access or digital training (Dandekar & Kim, 2013). In short, though FRP stakeholders
– policymakers and policytakers – diverged somewhat in how programs were
implemented and presented, job seeking and job skills training was nonetheless a
significant component of the entire partnership.
Technological Skills for Workforce Development
Given that job training and job search formed a significant dimension of the
partnership, how was workforce training conceptualized through programs and
implemented across KEYSPOTs? To restate the partnership’s main focus as discussed in
Chapter 5, KEYSPOTs offered points of access to broadband Internet through the PCC
side of the grant as well as digital skills programs through the SBA grant. As discussed in

Two survey versions were used and both yielded a response rate of approximately
50%: the short form survey was available in 54 sites and produced 3148 responses
whereas the long form survey was available in 43 sites and generated 538 responses.
Both included detailed demographic information however the long form survey presented
additional questions such as participant motivation for use and home subscription status.
17

188
Chapter 1 and in the previous chapter, the program consisted of 764 computer
workstations across the city and 5,000 netbook computers were distributed to qualified
Philadelphia public housing residents. Coupled with the technological assets, the
KEYSPOT program was marketed and mediated by a large online network,
www.PhillyKEYSPOTs.org. The online portal was a place for participants to locate a
public computer center, enroll in skills courses, or obtain more information about the
KEYSPOT program.
As job search was a key motivation for visiting KEYSPOTs, participants engaged
in many activities related to their job search, including browsing jobs, writing resumes,
and acquiring information on how to obtain unemployment benefits. Training courses
were perceived as a means to acquire fundamental skills, such as creating an email
address or mastering software like Microsoft Word. Although the digital training
resources available through KEYSPOT were integral to the job search process, making
social connections and networks were an equally important resource for participants as
they sought employment opportunities. Further, KEYSPOT participants were often
members of marginalized groups—such as homeless persons or ex-offenders—and
required extra sensitivity from trainers or, in some cases, help locating additional social
support services to complete their job search. In all these ways, the participants who took
part in KEYSPOT programs exemplified Philadelphia’s diverse economy.
Teaching Hard and Soft Technology Skills
At this point, readers may have rightly noted that while the term “access” is more
defined, “skills” is more variable and open to interpretation – and as discussed in Chapter
3 – a subject of considerable academic debate (Hargittai, 2008; Mossberger et al., 2003;

189
Sevron, 2002; Warschaeur, 2003). In the context of KEYSPOTs, I would suggest that
Philadelphians seeking work enrolled in training programs to improve both their hard
technology skills (such as typing and software proficiency) as well as soft technology
skills (such as communicating via email to prospective employers). Related to soft
technology skills, as presented in the opening, FRP partners worked to establish job fairs
where participants could interact with potential employers and develop their job-pitch
skills. Although many KEYSPOT training programs taught core skills through formal
computer courses, lab assistants also worked one on one with participants at the open
access centers to enhance hard and soft skills. As discussed earlier in the chapter’s
opening vignette in the context of Ron, participants entering KEYSPOT programs
exhibited a range of competencies in these skill areas. Some participants possessed
advanced digital skills whereas others had limited (or no) prior experience with
computers or computer software.
Hard technology skills. So, what hard technology skills were being taught in
KEYSPOT programs? The hard technology skills taught at FRP sites varied widely.
Skills taught included, but were not limited to: 1) “mousing” (using a computer mouse);
2) typing skills; 3) building software proficiency in programs such as Microsoft Word,
Excel or PowerPoint; 4) establishing and using email accounts; 5) navigating websites;
and, 6) using browsers and online search tools. I would underscore that many hard
technology skills ladder up: without adequate mousing and typing skills it is impossible
to obtain software proficiency or effectively utilize websites. The format of many
KEYSPOT training programs attempted to address this issue by offering courses for

190
novice, intermediate and advanced technology users. Targeted classes like these also
gave trainers the ability to better focus their instruction on the needs of the class.
Having briefly defined hard and soft digital skills in the context of KEYSPOTs, I
will now pivot to how skills were related to the job search process. Searching and
applying for jobs online requires a number of discrete hard technology skills. For
example, to search for a job on a website, you would first need to be able to use a mouse,
type, and then understand how to operate a web browser. Unfortunately, websites for jobpostings could be complex and overwhelming for hard-skills learners. Banner ads or
“mousetrap” sites were seen to be particularly troublesome for new users in KEYSPOT
training programs who could easily get lost during class. Thus, the instructors in these
hard-skills courses usually relied on assistants –or me in some cases – to provide
personalized support. This fieldnote captures the interaction between a KEYSPOT
computer assistant (Camille) who is supporting a lab visitor (Joe) who struggles to locate
job opportunities online. As you can see, because he lacked fundamental hard technology
skills, Joe was unable to effectively search for jobs online:
Joe tells Camille that he is working on a resume and job related research. He
seems to be fairly adept at using the mouse but is rather slow with typing, using
only his index fingers. Joe is surfing a website on jobs; on the top of the site it
reads, “3 ways to apply for jobs online.” As he is searching through the content on
the site, he seems to also struggle with the website’s organization.
Thus, the above interaction between Camille and Joe illustrates a reality for many digital
learners that I want to emphasize: job application resources online are not always
designed for their needs. Additionally, email services, software programs, websites and

191
online job postings can be similarly unaccommodating. In short, I want to emphasize that
teaching hard skills was undoubtedly an important and significant dimension of
KEYSPOT workforce development courses.
Soft technology skills. I would also stress here that hard skills alone, however,
were not sufficient to fully prepare job seekers to apply for potential positions. Learning
soft technology skills was also necessary. Again, I highlight this point as it fits into my
larger argument that a strict digital skills policy focus may overlook the many soft skills
that are needed to find work (Straubhaar et al., 2012). Although most participants had
already developed some hard skills, some new students in KEYSPOT programs struggled
with acquiring the necessary soft skills, such as effective business writing or job
interview techniques. The soft technological skills taught through KEYSPOTs to jobseekers can be more widely defined, but included: 1) effective business writing
(including resume strategies); 2) communicating to prospective employers through email; 3) online job search and application strategies; 4) interviewing techniques; and 5)
online security practices, such as setting social media privacy settings to limit prospective
employers’ access to personal information. In many cases, these soft skills could not be
taught through a single lesson, as they required a mixture of local, social, and cultural
understandings. In other words, knowledge about how to obtain a particular job
opportunity successfully requires general communication skills such as fluency, literacy
and digital skills, but also localized social and cultural knowledge, such as employer
expectations or an educational degree. These expectations or requirements were not
always made transparent through the job application itself, which meant that poor and

192
working-class applicants lacking the appropriate social and cultural networks began the
job search process at a distinct disadvantage.
Thus, echoing Straubhaar et al.’s (2012) findings from the Austin, Texas
broadband project, I suggest that cultural capital and social capital were also extremely
useful –if not vital –in the quest to secure better work opportunities, particularly highskilled work in the tech sector. Therefore, a framework that is more attuned to the “digital
workforce divide” rather than a broader “digital divide” helps us to closely consider
impediments to formal work opportunities that go beyond the simple acquisition of online
access and technological skills (Rodino-Colocino, 2006). So, to reiterate my point from
earlier in the chapter, I am outlining the hard and soft skills training because my
argument in this dissertation is not that KEYSPOT courses were ineffective at their
objective of teaching skills. On the contrary, I intend to illustrate that hard and soft skills
alone were not enough to connect many of my participants to the types of jobs they
needed to exit poverty.
Low-Skilled, Low-Wage and Part-Time Work in the Formal Economy
So, having detailed the range of hard and soft skills taught in KEYSPOT job
training courses, let us now turn to the jobs themselves. The opening vignette from the
KEYSPOT Digital Jobs Fair already began to sketch out some of the impediments poor
and working-class job-seekers faced in their efforts to find formal sector opportunities.
For instance, some participants confronted structural barriers such as lack of
transportation; others may have had a job history of low-skilled work. Yet, even job
seekers like Ron with advanced digital skills (in Photoshop and Illustrator) seemingly
found it difficult to locate full-time jobs that offered a good salary and benefits. Drawing

193
on the digital workforce divide paradigm, I aligned with Straubhaar et al. (2012) in
suggesting that one possible explanation for Ron’s experience is a soft skills issues –
social and cultural networks may be necessary for job mobility and to attain better, highskilled positions. Yet, as detailed in previous chapters, changes in Philadelphia’s
economy in the era of liquid modernity–including the urban crisis characterized by the
breakdown of durable social support institutions and decreased labor protections– also
played a role in precipitating the rise of part-time and flexible work. To reiterate my
stance, I have termed this problem, more broadly, an emergent digital workforce divide
(Rodino-Colocino, 2006). This is a divide impacted by digital access and skills, but that
is also a function of a broader restructuring of the information economy. Said a different
way, jobs were available to participants like Ron, just not the right jobs.
To expand on this point, throughout the duration of the BTOP grant, KEYSPOT
visitors remarked that they were unable to find consistent, well-paying, reliable
opportunities; thus, many participants reported turning to one, two, or even three parttime jobs to financially survive. In fact, many of those visiting KEYSPOTs to find work
disclosed that even though they were searching for opportunities, they were already
earning income from at least one job. Part-time workers like Ms. Ramirez, who I will
introduce later in this chapter, were also less likely to earn benefits like healthcare which
contributed to higher living costs. And, while it was true that some participants lacked
broadband access and digital skills, this was not universally the case. In fact, participants
like Ron and Joanne had acquired advanced digital skills, yet the opportunities available
to them in the formal economy would not provide a living wage and otherwise lacked
status. Likewise, other personal limitations –including a job history defined by low-

194
skilled work and lack of affordable childcare access –pushed participants like Ron and
Joanne to pursue opportunities in the informal economy. To build on these arguments, I
will now turn to the composition of jobs available, explain the impact of precarious work,
and last discuss how the lack of full-time jobs has pushed some participants into chronic
part-time working arrangements.
Composition of Jobs in the Formal Sector: Analyzing Job-Postings
If I am arguing participants were not locating the “right” jobs, how do we get a
clearer picture of the types of opportunities that were available to poor and working-class
job-seekers visiting KEYSPOTs? As I discussed in Chapter 1, in addition to creating
ethnographic fieldnotes and conducting in-person interviews, I also collected hundreds of
documents throughout the duration of the project. These documents included handouts or
reports available in weekly staff meetings, flyers available in fieldsites, informational
packets, advertisements, participants materials (resumes, poems, or writing samples) and
community notices. Another type of document I collected in my fieldwork were jobpostings and job advertisements. To explain how these were collected, KEYSPOT staff
and community organizations regularly circulated job postings and lab bulletin boards
were likewise a resource for job seekers. Though participants were often using
KEYSPOTs to search for jobs online, analyzing the composition of job flyers available in
sites was a good starting place to begin to map the types of formal sector opportunities
available. Approximately 30 of these job postings were collected and subsequently
analyzed; I will now turn to those findings.
The types of formal work opportunities circulated at KEYSPOTs were largely in
the reproductive labor sectors that I identified in Chapter 2, with carework (such as

195
nursing and elder care) and domestic work (like cleaning and food preparation) most
heavily represented. Some of the outlier job positions included a casino security guard, a
school crossing-guard, and a truck-driver. The sample postings, notably, corroborate my
claim that many of the formal sector opportunities available were precarious, meaning
part-time or contract positions that would not provide a living wage or any benefits, such
as health insurance and family leave. While at first glance the employers appeared to be
of high-status, on closer inspection, the jobs were primarily for low-status and low-skilled
work. The jobs did not require advanced educational degrees or certifications; however,
most surprising, an analysis of the documents suggested that advanced digital skills may
not even be relevant or required for the positions available. Simply put, the positions did
not require applicants to have digital skills. This would appear to turn the access and
skills policy focus on its head: while access and skills were necessary to apply to the
positions online, they may not have been necessary for an applicant to be considered for –
or ultimately obtain –the available positions.
Documents collected. To pivot to analysis of the job postings, the two documents
collected below—for a position as hotel housekeeper and a cook at a major hospital –
reflect a representative sample of the types of announcements circulated through
KEYSPOTs. They are similar in that they are for positions that would be associated with
reproductive labor functions, i.e. cleaning (hotel housekeeper) and cooking (hospital
cook). A close read of the positions reinforces my larger assertion in this dissertation that
the formal sector opportunities available to KEYSPOT visitors were not high skilled and
did not offer a living wage. The first position –obtained from a KEYSPOT in a faith

196
based community center in West Philadelphia – is for a luxury hotel seeking
housekeeping and maid services:
Figure 1: Palomar Hotel Seeking Part-Time Housekeepers

First, I would underscore that this job position is not for work in the home yet is
nevertheless closely associated with the reproductive labor functions identified by the
Marxist feminist Wages for Housework movement in Chapter 2, as it required the worker
to “maintain cleanliness and appearance.” In addition to cleaning hotel spaces, a job
applicant would need to be able to provide these services in a “friendly manner” –in other
words, a worker would be expected to perform more affective labor functions, such as
smiling and being friendly to guests. In contrast to the high-skilled work that is
performed in an office, there is also an expectation the employee will engage in physical
activities by “regularly” and “frequently” lifting heavy objects. Most notably, however,
advanced digital skills do not appear to be required. In fact, the hotel housekeeping

197
position only asked that a candidate possess the ability to “read and interpret documents”
as well as “write routine reports”; regarding educational expectations, only a GED is
needed for the position. In other words, this refers to more basic literacy skills than hard
or soft technology skills. The housekeeping position is also “part-time,” and therefore
most likely would not provide a job-seeker a living wage or benefits like health
insurance. Potential applicants for the housekeeping job were invited to visit the hotel’s
website for more information. Thus, to sum up the key takeaways from the
announcement, the position was for a part-time, low-skilled, low-status reproductive
labor job, offering no benefits and requiring limited (if any) digital skills.
Having closely examined one position posted at KEYSPOTs, I will now turn to
consider a second job advertisement for a local children’s hospital. It is remarkably
similar to the previous posting in both the type of position as well as the job
requirements:
Figure 2: Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Seeking Part-Time Cook

As you can see, this second posting was also seeking a worker to perform traditional
reproductive labor functions in a wider sense, in this case acting as a hospital cook.
Accordingly, the requirements for the job are related to previous food preparation
experience, more specifically a job-seeker must understand “cooking

198
methods/procedures” and have familiarity with “kitchen equipment.” Correspondingly,
this second position does not appear to require digital skills, as it seeks a worker with
“good communication skills” who will “be able to read English with understanding.” As
with the first job posting for a hotel housekeeper, this opening was part-time and thus
would alone likely not provide a job applicant with a living wage or benefits. To apply to
this position, a job-seeker only needed a high-school degree. And similar to the first
website, online applications were encouraged. In short, both positions I have herein
analyzed are for reproductive labor-type roles, precarious, and did not require the
applicant to possess significant digital skills or an advanced educational degree.
Whereas one could argue that both jobs may have required some digital
knowledge, could these skills not be learned quickly on the job? It seems unlikely, for
instance, that a cook would require extensive knowledge of Microsoft Word or that a
hotel maid would need to understand Microsoft Excel. Said differently, I am arguing that
an analysis of these job postings from KEYSPOTs revealed that although digital access
and skills may be a barrier to the job application process, it is unclear that such skills
presented a significant barrier to obtaining the job. My conclusion, then, is twofold. First,
KEYSPOTs played a significant role in training participants in the hard and soft digital
skills needed to apply to jobs online. However, at the same time, these same digital skills
may not have been required for the types of positions available to job seekers. And
second, along these lines, although KEYSPOTs connected participants to jobs, these
positions were overwhelmingly for part-time, low-skilled and low-status precarious work.
Further support: Drexel University KEYSPOT jobs survey. As further
support for my above claims about the composition of formal opportunities available to

199
KEYSPOT job-seekers, I would also refer to a related Drexel University study of
KEYSPOTs (Dandekar & Kim, 2013). To provide more background, the mail survey of
550 Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) residents conducted in 2013 by Drexel
University provides more granular data on the type of formal opportunities sought and
obtained by job seekers. It is important to explain here that public housing residents made
up the largest target group of the Philadelphia Freedom Rings Partnership, as over 5,000
residents participated in an 8-hour digital training required as part of the Drexel
sponsored free Netbook program. To return to the Drexel survey findings, 17% of the
Philadelphia Housing Authority program respondents indicated that they found
employment as a result of KEYSPOTs (Dandekar & Kim, 2013). While the respondents’
new employers varied widely – ranging from Temple University Hospital to Walmart –
the “positions obtained” measure tells the real story of what type of opportunities were
available. Closely aligned with my findings, most of the positions obtained by
participants were in reproductive labor sectors. For example, approximately 30% of the
jobs obtained were in the carework field, including positions like home health care aide,
daycare assistant, nurse and medical assistant (Dandekar & Kim, 2013). An additional
15% of the reported jobs were in domestic/cleaning work, such as janitorial staff and
housekeeping (Dandekar & Kim, 2013). Next, service industry work comprised roughly
another 15%, with job titles ranging from call center representative, receiving associate
(stocking), sales cashier and store clerk (Dandekar & Kim, 2013). Other positions
obtained by participating PHA residents included security officer, school crossing guard
and survey taker. Remarkably, less than 10% of the jobs obtained by KEYSPOT program
participants were for higher-skilled work, such as research assistant and phlebotomist

200
(Dandekar & Kim, 2013). Said another way, the findings from my analysis of job posting
collected between 2011 – 2013 bears out in other partner research as well. To sum up the
main conclusions from my own analysis as well as the Drexel study, the formal sector
jobs available to KEYSPOT job-seekers were part-time, low-skilled, low-wage, and lowstatus, with opportunities in carework, domestic work and service sectors most heavily
represented. Having now discussed the composition of jobs available to KEYSPOT
visitors, I will turn directly to KEYPOT participant experiences to better explain how
these workforce realties shaped the economic lives of Philadelphians like Ron.
Low-Skilled and Low-Status: Precarious Work and Welfare
As I have asserted above in my analysis of job-postings and Drexel’s Philadelphia
Housing Authority mail survey, the work obtained by participants was low-skilled or
low-status in nature, and notably afforded unpredictable or undesirable working hours not
conducive to parenting. But, how exactly did these jobs impact the individual economic
lives program participants? In a semi-structured interview, one KEYSPOT digital trainer
in a health advocacy organization, Sammy, captured some of the limitations of the formal
sector opportunities obtained by job-seekers. As discussed in Chapter 1, trainers like
Sammy were my key access point to participants, as trainers had already earned the trust
of a wide range of community members visiting KEYSPOTs. To return to my interview
with Sammy, he explained that he had recently assisted a job seeker, Dinah, gain a
position as a security guard. Yet, although Dinah obtained a position, Sammy admitted to
me that it was not the type of job she needed to make ends meet. In our discussion,
Sammy touched on some of the challenges facing poor and working-class job seekers like
Dinah and the nature of precarious work that I want to explore in more depth:

201
…so, she got this job. Success story. Great. And she was working as –and
presumably still is working –as a security guard for some kind of hospital or clinic
or something that was open all night, and she needed to get a pay stub. And
actually I should say she was working through a contracting company….all the
universities for example, probably several thousands of jobs, and they are all
subcontracted and undoubtedly [they are] paid less and have no unions and no
benefits and no retirement. So [Dinah needed the paystub] to apply for food
stamps because despite all that, she is still not making enough money.
As Sammy highlights for us here, although Dinah obtained work in the formal economy
as a security guard –and thus on the surface hers was a KEYSPOT “success story” –in
fact, her new opportunity was not ideal. For instance, as a subcontractor, Dinah worked
alone in a clinic at night. She had little to no contact with her company, and thus had no
support in how to navigate practical matters related to her employment, including how to
access her paystub. Furthermore, as her position was contracted, Dinah was poorly
compensated, had no union protections, and received no benefits. While Dinah needed
hard and soft technological skills to initially obtain the position (and access her pay stub
online), Sammy complained that she did not need advanced digital skills as a condition of
her employment. Yet, most remarkably, shortly after Dinah obtained the position, she
returned to the lab to ask Sammy for assistance in gathering the documents necessary to
apply for food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
I should add here that while KEYSPOT participants came from a range of
backgrounds with differing work histories, almost all engaged in varied and complex
survival strategies to meet their daily needs. Therefore, just as Edin and Lein (1997)

202
described in their urban ethnographic study I reviewed in Chapter 3, program participants
often relied on varied income streams and social support programs – both governmental
and non-governmental –to survive. And further, participants invested a significant
amount of time managing these sources and scanning for new economic opportunities.
For example, enrollment in job-training programs like those offered through KEYSPOTs
not only aided participants during a job search, but such programs were in some cases a
precondition for recently laid-off workers seeking to continue receiving government
unemployment benefits. Thus, it is critical to underline participants utilized digital
training for multiple purposes beyond simply obtaining workfare skills.
To return to Dinah, as Sammy acknowledged, though hers would on the surface
be considered a “success story” because she obtained a job through KEYSPOT programs,
it was not a position that offered her a living wage and therefore she continued to need
food stamps to make ends meet. Dinah’s experience runs contrary to the position of the
technology sector interests presented in Chapter 4: digital training programs do not
necessarily improve economic conditions to the point that the welfare state is no longer
needed (Mosco, 2004; The Arnold Group, 2011). In fact, poor and working-class
participants like Dinah found formal sector jobs and still required social support
programs. Her experience reinforces the relevance of a digital workforce divide
framework, as an access and skills policy focus may overlook the special challenges
faced by working people searching for and applying for jobs. For instance, Sammy
specifically highlighted how contracting and the lack of union protections impacted
Dinah’s working conditions. In short, I argue that forces like shift to ICTs, fewer unions

203
protections, and globalization in the era of liquid modernity has dramatically diminished
the job prospects for working people in the modern informational city (Tufecki, 2012).
Interestingly, Sammy also remarked to me that his experiences connecting patrons
with jobs made him refine his own personal attitudes towards ICTs. According to
Sammy, in some cases technology is, “being used as a tool to help layoff more people
and push more work on to people down on the pay scale.” When I asked what exactly he
meant by this comment, Sammy grumbled that not only was Dinah unable to find a goodpaying job, she was also given no human resources support whatsoever and needed his
help to simply access her pay stub. In other words, Sammy suggested that ICTs have
diminished the job prospects for working people, acting as a “tool to help layoff” and
suppress wages. Yet, adding insult to injury, ICTs can also shift responsibilities – that
would have previously been held by the human resources staff of a company, like
assisting workers with accessing a pay stub –to already overburdened and vulnerable
low-wage workers. Sammy’s statement here captures some of the enduring tensions
surrounding the role of technology in the everyday economic lives of poor and workingclass Philadelphians and likewise illustrates the complex experiences, attitudes and
beliefs which shaped their interactions with information technology. Sammy’s
observation also underscores the utility of a digital workforce divide frame that can better
draw attention to how issues of power and class structure an individual’s relationship to
technology (Eubanks, 2011).
The Urban Crisis and Chronic Part-Timers
Having drawn attention to some of the unique challenges facing KEYSPOT job
seekers, to fully comprehend the tensions resulting from this digital workforce divide I

204
have highlighted, it important to understand how low wage-work and retrenchment can
together push individuals into multiple part-time jobs. In other words, because
participants like Dinah could not locate a single full-time job that provided a living wage
and benefits, they may turn to several part-time formal or informal jobs to survive. This
can, in some cases, incorporate informal strategies like Joanne’s as I will address in
Chapter 7, but in many cases, translates to holding two or three jobs in the formal sector.
This has resulted in a situation where there are “chronic part-timers,” or workers who
never find a full-time position and thus must permanently juggle several opportunities to
keep afloat financially. Often lack of access to benefits like health insurance was a major
contributing factor in labor churn (Devey et al., 2006). One such visitor working multiple
part-time jobs in the formal sector was Ms. Ramirez, who lived in public housing and
regularly walked to a nearby KEYSPOT in a faith based community center in North
Philadelphia. She visited the KEYSPOT a couple of times per month to work on her
resume and apply to jobs online. Ms. Ramirez’s experience illustrates the various
challenges facing chronic part-time workers. It also demonstrates how individuals must
survive and adapt when they are unable to find one good-paying job or whey they lose
access to needed social support programs like Medicaid in the era of retrenchment.
Ms. Ramirez was in her early sixties and moved to West Philadelphia from
Venezuela in the mid 1960’s. She began teaching in the city’s public-school system in
1976 and worked at three different schools in her community, serving as a Spanish
language teacher, an Algebra instructor (“for a few years in the 1980’s”), and as a
teacher’s aide. Ms. Ramirez walked with the use of a cane as she is disabled due to an
injury she sustained while teaching in the classroom in the late 1990’s. Although she was

205
on short-term disability for a period, Ms. Ramirez ultimately lost her health coverage and
could not continue to obtain treatments like physical therapy. Due to her injury and lack
of access to treatment, Ms. Ramirez was unable to be on her feet all day in a classroom.
Thus, she was forced to leave her full-time teaching position and then entered into parttime work. Another factor in her decision to leave her full-time job, as she explained, was
her need to care for an elderly parent, which I will turn to later.
When I met her at the KEYSPOT, Ms. Ramirez held three part-time jobs: one as a
teacher’s assistant, a second as an administrator with the Philadelphia court system and a
third as a substitute teacher. She regularly attended KEYSPOTs in the hopes of finding a
full-time job and frequently used the lab’s computers to edit her resume and scanned for
job opportunities online. She confessed to me that juggling three jobs was physically and
emotionally exhausting, especially given that she was also the primary caregiver for an
aging parent. This excerpt from my fieldnotes describes how balancing part-time work
and caring for her mother caused Ms. Ramirez considerable hardship:
[Ms. Ramirez] says now she is working part-time and has 3 jobs [in addition to
working as a substitute teacher]– one is working with the Philadelphia court
systems and her second is working part-time as a teacher’s aide. She says many
days she has to wake up at 4:00 or 5:00 am in order to go check on her mother
who is in ill health before going to work. Ms. Ramirez explains that her mother
cannot afford home healthcare.
In other words, as this fieldnote excerpt reveals, ironically Ms. Ramirez was initially
forced into part-time working arrangements because she could not obtain quality
healthcare for herself, and then she remained in part-time work because she could not

206
afford home healthcare for her mother. This underscores how the lack of access to social
support programs like Medicaid or affordable healthcare directly shaped the economic
lives and, correspondingly, the work practices of poor and working-class Philadelphians.
And although Ms. Ramirez was not engaging in the reproductive labor of childcare, she
was directly responsible for providing care for an immediate family member. In
conclusion, the culmination of chronic part-time work and a lack of affordable health
benefits pushed Ms. Ramirez –and by extension her family – into precarious economic
arrangements. Ms. Ramirez’s story also helps explain how the retrenchment of social
support programs like Medicaid can have direct consequences for the job prospects of
many low-income Philadelphians, as these types of constraints can push individuals to
pursue a set of survival strategies that lead to greater personal hardship rather than a path
out of poverty. Ms. Ramirez’s experience also pushes back on the technology sector
position articulated in The Arnold Group (2011) report and through the partnership
representative Jay’s statement in the “History of the Future” exercise presented in
Chapter 4: access and skills training does not enable further retrenchment of the welfare
state. I will now consider other ways in which the access and skills focus can overlook
key dimensions of the job search problem.
Marginalized Through Access, Algorithms and Social Media
Finally, having reviewed the hard and soft workforce skills KEYSPOT visitors
obtained through training programs and some of the limitations surrounding formal sector
opportunities, including precarious and chronic part-time work, I will now turn to discuss
the ways online tools have reshaped the job search and job application process itself. This
is a critical dimension because, as I will demonstrate, although ICTs have changed the

207
way we all search for and apply to jobs, these tools have uniquely altered the job
application process for poor and working-class Americans. As discussed through Mr.
Wilson’s perspective and in Chapter 2, Mosco (2004) argues that the “myth of the digital
sublime” can interfere with our ability to properly critique technology and consider how
an individual’s economic and social position can shape their attitudes and beliefs
regarding ICTs. For example, as I will turn to consider later in this chapter, a participant
(Tiara) expressed great concern to me that social media access could promote
discriminatory hiring practices. For me, this was an unexpected response and reinforced
how my own racial and class position shapes my personal interaction with online tools.
More specifically, as an able-bodied white woman, I do not have these same social media
concerns and instead, frequently include my photograph in job related materials. In this
way, I assert that a digital workforce divide frame can better draw attention to how issues
of power and economic privilege impact a person’s relationship with ICTs, as was also
the case with Mr. Wilson. Therefore, in the following section, I will analyze how the rise
of online job applications, challenges with mobile access, and social media concerns can
limit and shape economic outcomes for poor and working people. This is also important
context for my next chapter on the emergence liquid labor practices as well, as it begins
to explain some of the additional factors that may encourage participants to pursue
opportunities in the informal sector.
Problematic Algorithms: Applying to Jobs Online
Although the shift to online applications has proven advantageous for employers
as it greatly expedites the applicant review process, I would briefly point out that it has
also eliminated or significantly reduced opportunities for job candidates to provide

208
personal context. I draw attention to this issue because it is yet another example of how
ICTS can create special challenges for poor and working-class job applicants, as they
may have had limited opportunities for higher education, gaps in work history, or nontraditional backgrounds in low-skilled work. Additionally, an online applicant may also
be immediately excluded by simply checking a box: poor credit reports, arrest records or
a conviction status are easily linked to potential job applicants (Martin, 2010). For
example, KEYSPOT trainers assisting ex-offenders in locating work boasted that they
offered those in reentry a “cheat sheet” or specific instructions on how to get their records
expunged to prevent immediate digital exclusion. One ex-offender visiting KEYSPOTs
complained to me that he could, “barely even get a job at McDonald’s” with a felony
conviction on his record. While I acknowledge that this type of applicant information was
previously available to prospective employers prior to the internet, I would underscore
that digital applications have greatly streamlined this sorting process, offering limited
space for explanation or contextualization. This further illustrates how ICTs can be
mobilized in a way that submits poor and working-class participants seeking jobs to
further social sorting and marginalization, and likewise elevates the importance of
considering how economic and class position can shape interactions with technological
tools.
Access Inconsistencies: Applying to Jobs on Mobile Phones
Here some readers would rightly raise the question of how poor and workingclass job applicants beyond KEYSPOTs are accessing applications as, increasingly, job
opportunities in the formal economy require online applications. Though some online
applications are compatible with smartphone technology, typically access to broadband

209
and a computer is useful, if not required, for job-seekers. For example, a participant I will
introduced in Chapter 7, Deric, reported that before KEYSPOTs, he was primarily
utilizing smartphone technology to search for and apply for jobs. Deric’s experience was
not unique: a 2015 Pew Research study indicates that around 28% of job seekers are
using mobile devices to connect to work opportunities (Smith, 2015). Individuals with
less education – holding a high school diploma or less –are also more likely to rely on a
smartphone for advanced job-related tasks, yet mobile devices are unlikely to properly
display job applications, websites can be hard to read, and attaching supporting
documents such as resumes is made more difficult (Smith, 2015). So, although the trend
of increased mobile broadband adoption has led to optimism among many digital divide
researchers, I would side with those scholars who have rightly pointed to the
inconsistencies in terms of the quality of use and argued that mobile access may have an
uneven impact on economic growth or even civic engagement (Chew, Levy & Ilavarasan,
2011; Napoli & Obar, 2014). Nonetheless, while mobile access can present a challenge to
formal sector job applicants, this is one area where KEYSPOTs could directly respond.
However, another way that ICTs are impacting the job search process for poor applicants
is that they may be more likely than middle or upper-class workers to be asked to submit
personal information to employers. For instance, some of my participant were asked (or
felt pressure to) allow potential employers access to their social media accounts, a subject
I will now turn to.
“Friend and follow us!”: Social Media and Employer Screening Practices
So, to pivot away from online application and mobile access issues, I would
underline that social media plays a prominent role in the job search process today.

210
Modern job-seekers may use social media to search for a job, network, or conduct
background research on a prospective employer (Smith, 2015). Poor and working-class
Philadelphians visiting KEYSPOTs expressed concern to me regarding the emerging role
social media may play in evaluating their job applications. More specifically, participants
in precarious economic situations stated that they often felt increased pressure to submit
to social media “screening.” For instance, as participants explained, potential employers
may encourage job applicants to friend the company on Facebook or follow the company
on Twitter. Yet, given the precarious financial situation many job-seekers were in, some
felt they simply had no choice but to willingly submit to these practices. This recalls the
insights of Dyer-Witheford (1999) and Stack (1974) presented in Chapter 3 –many lowstatus workers may be more reluctant to speak out against exploitative working
conditions because they are already in such dire economic circumstances.
As a practical example of how this “screening” evolved from my fieldwork, I
regularly witnessed social media applicant “screening practices” during my participant
observation at job fair events. As presented in this chapter’s opening vignette, the
Freedom Rings Partnership was a co-sponsor of the MLK Day of Service job fairs at
Girard College in both 2012 and 2013. At the events, prospective applicants printed their
resumes at the Digital Jobs Fair and practiced their soft skills (like interview techniques)
with KEYSPOT staff, then exited into a larger open area where employers were gathered.
As job seekers approached the prospective employers who were seated behind folding
tables or in freestanding booths, applicants were often only asked to Facebook “friend” or
Twitter “follow” the companies. For example, this fieldnote entry captured during the
2013 job fair event depicts one of these interactions:

211
A man representing “Piedmont Airlines” says to a potential [female] applicant,
“The easiest way to stay in touch with us is to friend us on our Facebook page
or to follow us on Twitter.” Another male about 18 – 24 years old approaches
the table in gray slacks, a blue and white striped oxford shirt and a black tie about
5 inches too short. He has a very small frame. He tells the man at the information
desk that he has a resume, and is instructed only to, “follow the company on
Facebook and Twitter.”
In other words, as this fieldnote reveals, whereas job fair attendees were instructed to
print their resumes at the Digital Jobs Fair and practice soft skills like interview
techniques, when they approached prospective employers, their resumes were not always
solicited and their interactions with the recruiters could be brief. Although I grant that for
some job-seekers establishing social media connections could be beneficial in other ways,
like in learning more about the company, I would point out that in this instance it was not
made clear to applicants why or how this was useful (or used) for gaining employment. It
was also unclear if the voluntary social media participation would even substantially
improve a candidate’s opportunities for employment. In this way, this incident captures
some of the exploitative practices that poor and working-class job seekers may submit to
in their quest for formal sector job opportunities.
I would add here that the common practice of asking potential applicants to
Facebook “friend” or Twitter “follow” companies has, of course, a dual purpose. First, it
gives employers the ability to further screen potential applicants but, second, it boosts
internal marketing efforts through increasing an organization’s social media presence and
number of followers online. Most disturbingly, this practice not only exposed the job

212
applicants to additional scrutiny and surveillance, but also potentially rendered the
applicants’ social networks visible to employers as well. Nonetheless, in a state of
economic precariousness, job-seekers like Ron indicated that they often felt powerless to
refuse any potential employer requests. In short, these social network surveillance
strategies served as another impediment – albeit a more indirect one –to formal sector
work opportunities. Participants additionally voiced fears that these invasive practices
could expose them to hiring discrimination, a subject I will turn to now.
Social Media Concerns: Discrimination and Digital Photos
As another complicating factor shaping their interactions with technology in the
formal job sector, participants likewise expressed concern that the wide availability of
digital photographs – accessible through sites like Facebook – could expose them to
potential discrimination based on race, gender or appearance. Job seekers communicated
in interviews and during participant observation that in addition to the prospective
employer friending and following practices already discussed, applicants may be asked to
submit a photograph with their application and/or on resumes. In some cases, participants
reported that they were encouraged to provide photographs on other job networking sites
like LinkedIn. In this portion of fieldnotes taken from site observation, one participant,
Tiara, expressed her apprehensions regarding digital images and online job applications:
Tiara points to a sample resume from the book that depicts a personal picture on
the resume and continues to say that she feels there is pressure to add a picture,
and that some [job] websites require it. She expresses concern that this could be
discriminatory, and that you will be judged on how you look and not on your
credentials. She says to me, “Like, if you were applying to a security job, would

213
you put your face [there] and show you are a 90-pound woman? Or, you know if
you did, they won’t hire you, right? What if they just look at your picture and
decide you don’t look like they think you should, so you can’t do the job?” She
later explains that she took down her Facebook page when she went on the job
market due to concern that she would be searched.
In this fieldnote excerpt, Tiara reiterated some of the special challenges facing poor and
working-class job seekers when it comes to social media. In referencing my gender and
perceived physical attributes – “you are a 90-pound woman” – Tiara intended to point out
the ways in which photographs can potentially exposed job applicants to discrimination.
To put it another way, Tiara worried that a woman could be removed from consideration
from a security sector job simply because she does not fit the image (male, physically
strong) most associated with the position. Additionally, she raised the prospect of racial
discrimination as well given that digital photos are readily available on social media.
Finally, whereas my participant, Ron, felt obligated to submit to social media screening,
Tiara cited surveillance concerns as her motivation for deactivating her social media
profile while searching for a job.
In sum, Tiara’s insights around social media surveillance connect to a larger
argument that I am making in this project, and that is that marginalized communities have
complex relationships with ICTs that are shaped by their economic, social and political
position. To refer to my earlier point, as an able bodied white woman, I would not have
considered the availability of my photograph online to be a possible disadvantage if I was
seeking a new job. In fact, for me, it could even be an advantage. In this way, Tiara’s
concerns about social media and potential job discrimination recalls the “digital myth”

214
that Mosco (2004) theorizes – technology is not a simple, inexpensive solution to a
complex social and economic problems and furthermore technologies are not “unbiased”
or neutral (Feenberg, 1991). Thus, as Eubanks (2011) suggests, when evaluating
broadband programs centered around workforce development, we must consider issues of
power and privilege: Tiara’s interactions with technology – just like Mr. Wilson’s –are
uniquely shaped by her gender, racial and class location. I draw attention to Tiara’s story
because it suggests that the impediments to formal sector opportunities go far beyond
access and skills: the technologies themselves can constrain economic opportunities or
shape online practices. So, drawing on Wyatt (2008) and recalling Mr. Wilson’s
experience as well, I would underscore that it is necessary to develop a more nuanced
view of broadband adoption, considering alternative reasons why marginalized may resist
or reject ICTs. This more nuanced understanding could also potentially help better bridge
the gap between the policymakers and policytakers.
Conclusion
To touch on some of the main findings presented in this chapter, KEYSPOTs
have focused on the role of technology in facilitating the job search process and
accordingly programs implemented hard and soft digital skills training courses for
workforce development. The KEYSPOT programs were successful at connecting
participants to formal sector work, however the opportunities available to job seekers
were more likely to be in the reproductive labor fields, such as carework or domestic
work. However, there were significant impediments here: the available job opportunities
were often precarious, meaning part-time or contract. Additionally, the jobs available
typically provided no benefits and offered undesirable working hours. In other words,

215
poor and working class urban Philadelphians like Dinah or Ms. Ramirez were not
necessarily obtaining or accessing the type of high-skill or high-status jobs that could
support a family and provide a living wage. Participants have obtained jobs through
KEYSPOTs, nonetheless some continued to require social support programs like food
stamps (SNAP) to make ends meet. Whereas hard and soft digital skills may be necessary
to apply to the jobs online, notably it appeared that advanced digital skills may not be
requirements for the positions available to low-income job-seekers, as the postings I
shared for jobs as a hotel housekeeper or hospital cook demonstrates. In the absence of
good paying full-time work, participants with significant family responsibilities like Ms.
Ramirez had to permanently juggle several part-time formal jobs in the formal sector.
Lastly, technology also posed unique challenges to KEYSPOT job seekers, as my
participants encountered difficulty applying to jobs online due to social sorting and felt
pressured to submit to invasive applicant screening practices through social media.
It is important to restate that I am not arguing in this dissertation that the Freedom
Rings Partnership was wholly unsuccessful. Participants found jobs. And, as I will
discuss in Chapter 8, in my view the partnership provided valuable tools and resources
for poor and working-class communities struggling in the wake of the Great Recession. I
am arguing, instead, that the “access” and “skills” policy focus overlooks important
dimensions of the issue, such as how structural barriers can limit economic opportunities
and the ways in which social and class location can shape interactions and experiences
with ICTs. In other words, I argue that while participants did gain digital skills, these
skills did not necessarily translate to better, well-paying jobs in the formal sector.
Dispelling the digital myth as Mosco (2004) conceptualizes it, I also assert broadband

216
training programs do not necessarily result in “reduced dependency” as private sector
policymakers have predicted (The Arnold Group, 2011). In sum, there is a disconnect
between the goals of digital labor as conceived by policymakers and the on-the-ground
complex economic realities shaping the economic lives of policytakers.
Therefore, as discussed in this chapter, many poor and working-class
Philadelphians faced enormous barriers to finding good paying jobs in the formal sector.
Given that low income participants are constrained in their ability to apply to formal
sector jobs, cannot locate good-paying formal sector jobs, and felt concerned that digital
tools like social media facilitated workforce discrimination, is it a surprise that some
might resist or reject ICTs like Mr. Wilson, or exit the formal economy like Joanne? As I
will discuss in the following chapter, I argue that those with advanced digital skills like
Joanne who could not find high skilled jobs utilized their skills to create opportunities
outside the formal economy, thus embracing “liquid labor” practices. In this way,
participants attempted to achieve greater economic flexibility to better support their
families and mitigate financial risk in the turbulent, precarious urban economy.

217
Chapter 7
Families and Liquid Labor in the Modern Informational City
Introduction
On a typical Tuesday afternoon at the KEYSPOT during the Fall 2012
presidential election season, you could find Joanne seated at the corner computer next to
her son, browsing online for images of American flags, red elephants or the Obamas. She
brought her own inexpensive button-making machine to the lab, located interesting
images online, and took advantage of free online software to size them for printing. She
often paired digital images with local sayings, such as “bad boy” or “bad girl,” a trendy
quip used among teenagers. Once her button design was finalized, Joanne utilized the
KEYSPOT’s printing resources and asked lab staff if she needed color prints. With a
laugh, Joanne admitted to me that her most popular button depicted a young President
Obama smoking a cigarette.
While Joanne had a contract with local schools to create buttons for special
events, she explained that most of her sales were made with strangers on the street, highly
unpredictable and variable. Though she did not earn significant income from these sales,
she liked that it required few financial risks and that she did not have heavy upfront costs.
The brief cash transactions were in Joanne’s own words, “smaller, more flexible.” Most
broadly, Joanne’s experience in the informal economy of Philadelphia offers a window
onto the ways in which policy, poverty, and technology intersect on the ground. More
specifically, her experience reveals how the digital workforce divide (Rodino-Colocino,
2006), structural impediments to formal work, and declining social support in the wake of

218
the urban crisis in Philadelphia may, together, generate a new set of precarious digital
work practices among poor and working-class families.
As I introduced in the opening of this dissertation, Joanne is a single mother and
visited the KEYSPOT to manage three informal endeavors that earned her a small
income. Joanne created political buttons that she sold on the street, but she also wrote
children’s e-books which she sold primarily on Amazon.com. The subject matter of her
books was significant to Joanne, as she wrote from the perspective of an urban mother
who has a child with a developmental disability. Joanne contended that her viewpoint
was underrepresented in the predominantly “white-authored” children’s literature.
However, Amazon would not compensate Joanne until her sales met a certain threshold,
typically a few hundred dollars. While one of her e-books earned Joanne revenue, she
admitted that her other digital books had not yet met the limit. To attempt to gain higher
sales, she frequently publicized her books on Facebook, Twitter, and targeted online
messaging boards. Joanne also used digital media sites like Etsy to promote and sell
handmade goods, like jewelry and artwork. While Joanne occasionally used the lab’s
computers to search for necessary materials, most of her jewelry supplies –like thread and
brightly colored wooden or clay beads –were either made at home or purchased from
stores in the community. Unlike her buttons, Joanne assembled these items primarily at
home rather than at the local KEYSPOT. Although she sometimes wore her jewelry or
carried her goods in small plastic bags folded in her backpack, she preferred to sell them
through digital exchange or “community fairs” rather than on the street corners. But,
despite her best efforts, Joanne did not make enough income from any of these three

219
informal endeavors to survive comfortably, and thus frequently searched for other
opportunities in both the formal and informal sectors.
According to Joanne, the primary benefit to the informal economy was that it
permitted her greater flexibility while reducing economic risk. To elaborate, first,
flexibility was important to Joanne because she is a single mother and wanted to spend as
much time as possible with her son, Jaleel. Before entering the informal economy, Joanne
explained that she worked at a local bar and restaurant, waiting tables during the day and
working behind the bar at night. As she pointed out, jobs in the service sector are
typically strenuous and require afternoon and night hours, which can prevent mothers
from picking up their children from school. The work was dull; Joanne was unable to use
her creative skills. And although she did not earn a significant or steady income from her
informal endeavors, they did not require a substantial financial investment. For instance,
she explained that her button-making machine was relatively inexpensive and she could
create Amazon e-books online for free. Therefore, building on my arguments regarding
the impediments to formal work developed in Chapter 6, poor and working-class parents
entered the precarious online economy for many reasons, including: 1) reproductive labor
and childcare responsibilities; 2) the need to lower economic risks and a lack of access to
startup capital; 3) the inability to earn a living wage in the formal sector; and finally,
because, 4) the formal sector jobs available were low-status, low-skilled and dull. Her
story also complicates the standard policy focus on digital access and skills training:
Joanne had obtained both hard and soft digital skills prior to visiting KEYSPOTs. Yet,
paradoxically, she could not use those skills in the former sector but could, however,

220
utilize them in informal online work practices. In this way, this chapter focuses on the
emergence of precarious online labor –or liquid labor –in the modern informational city.
Overview
Joanne’s experience is important to document, because as Chapter 4 and Chapter
5 discussed, federal U.S. technology programs like BTOP have focused on the role of
broadband access and digital skills training in stimulating economic growth. Said
differently, the overarching goal of the BTOP program through ARRA was to connect
low-income underemployed and unemployed Americans to jobs. Some policymaker
interests – embracing the myth of the digital sublime –even suggested that imparting
digital access and skills would provide participants a path out of poverty and, therefore,
the welfare state could be further retrenched (Mosco, 2004; The Arnold Group, 2011).
Nevertheless, as I argued in Chapter 6, many poor and working-class participants faced
significant barriers in finding formal sector opportunities that would provide a living
wage and benefits. In fact, participants like Dinah continued to rely on food stamps even
after obtaining a new job through KEYSPOT programs. Conversely, participants like Ms.
Ramirez were stuck in chronic part-time work and visited KEYSPOTs in the hopes of
finding a single full-time job that could provide benefits like healthcare.
In the face of these dire economic conditions –and confronting diminished formal
sector job prospects –participants utilized KEYSPOT digital resources in an attempt to
create opportunities outside the formal economy. These activities ranged from promoting
services such as modeling or caricature drawing, to selling handmade goods and digital
goods online. In some cases, street economies merged with digital economies in unique
and unanticipated ways. Whereas these flexible labor options and online activities could

221
be viewed as expanding economic possibilities for low income Philadelphians, as I
argued in Chapter 3 – in alignment with scholars like Andrejevic (2008), Duffy (2015),
Dyer-Witheford (1999), Fuchs (2014), Kuehn and Horrigan (2013), Mies (1988), Jarrett
(2015), Ouelette and Wilson (2011) –digital labor is uniquely exploited by capital in the
non-wage digital economy. These liquid labor practices are undoubtedly dynamic,
creative, and make a cultural contribution; Joanne herself noted that her e-books provide
a valuable perspective on parenting a child with disabilities (Arvidsson, 2009; Jenkins,
2006). Yet, it is important to situate these practices within the larger digital workforce
divide (Rodino-Colocino, 2006) and consider the relationship between these new
precarious online work practices and the larger information economy. Though informal
work may have provided extra income, these practices did not provide participants with
long-term financial stability and could not deliver route out of poverty (Mosco, 2004).
So, whereas scholars like Edin and Lein (1997), Collins (2008), Daly (2003), Grabham
and Smith (2010) and Sassen (2003) have theorized and detailed urban street economy
“survival strategies,” in this chapter I contribute a perspective on how these street
strategies intersect with the digital economy, a facet underexamined and undertheorized.
To develop my arguments on the emergence of this precarious work, in this
chapter first I advocate for framework of “liquid labor” that can position the informal
digital labor practices of working class individuals within the context of the digital
workforce divide. The motivations and factors shaping this work intersect with some
dimensions I have already explored in this dissertation, such as how the urban crisis and
retrenchment impact the economic lives of poor and working-class Americans. Next, to
bring my theory of liquid labor to life, I will present the stories of four of my research

222
participants – Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron. Third, I will synthesize some of the key
themes gleaned from my examination of their liquid labor practices, arguing that my
participants engaged in these strategies because provide they provided flexibility and
minimized financial risk. These online practices were also more conducive to
reproductive labor roles. I will also consider how working-class participants are utilizing
the informal economy; I will detail some of the emergent “hybridized” forms, such as
creating digital goods to be sold online, creating material goods to be sold online, and
marketing digital goods and services. Finally, I will summarize my key thoughts to lead
into the conclusion chapter, as I consider areas of resistance, possible interventions, and
future research goals.
Offering a New Framework: Liquid Labor
To restate the framework presented in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, drawing on
Bauman’s (2000) concept of “liquid modernity,’ I propose the rise of informal online
labor – or liquid labor –as a framework for understanding the complex issues surrounding
precarious work and the information economy in advanced capitalism. More specifically,
I am applying Bauman’s (2000) ideas to a study of the economic lives of the urban poor,
with a focus on informal digital labor practices. Said differently, the framework of liquid
modernity helps explain, more broadly, that the emergence of these precarious informal
digital practices results from larger patterns of labor restructuring in the U.S. and the
accompanying breakdown of durable social support institutions like the welfare state
(Bauman, 2000). I would extend Bauman’s conceptualization here and add that the
interaction of these dynamics has also had a significant impact on families and childcare
access, which was likewise a factor driving liquid laborers to seek more flexible work.

223
With limited access to capital, low-income participants gravitated towards these low
financial risk strategies; nevertheless, participants assumed other risks, in the form of a
significant investment of their own personal time (Beck, 2000).
In this chapter, therefore, I assert that these flexible, low-financial risk work
practices should be understood as a kind of super precarious, highly exploited online
labor. While I agree with scholars like Beck (2000) and Deuze (2006) that “risk” is a
defining feature of liquid life, I suggest in this project that “liquid laborers” are those
workers who assume the most risk, strive for maximum flexibility, and circulate in the
most precarious survival circuits (Sassen, 2003). However, what is also important here is
that I advocate for a materialist consideration of risk in the context of digital work. To
explain, workers like Joanne occupy a very different position in the economy and are thus
bound by a different decision matrix when it comes to risk. Said differently, the ability to
take risks in the new economy –the ability to be “entrepreneurial” – should be understood
as dependent on economic or social resources. Simply put, whereas I would agree with
Neff’s (2012) assertion that “risk” is a celebrated value in the new economy and can lead
to exploitative working arrangements, I would emphasize that an oversimplified
understanding of risk overlooks how the new economy can uniquely exploit different
groups along race, class or gender lines. For instance, middle class beauty bloggers (like
those in Duffy’s 2015 study) may be more likely to have resources to fall back on if their
risky online venture fails; for instance, such online workers may find greater security in
knowing a family member or friend can provide them housing or help with emergency
healthcare costs in a tight situation. This is not a luxury that participants like Joanne have
and therefore they must evaluate risk differently. As a related point, because ICTs have

224
increasingly played a role in reshaping the economic fortunes of the working poor – as
seen through Mr. Wilson’s story – I would likewise extend Bauman’s (2000) theory to
consider that an individual’s relationship with liquid modernity (and technology) is
uniquely shaped by their social and class position. Therefore, I have selected “liquid
labor” as a more appropriate classification than “immaterial labor” or “affective labor” to
draw attention to the ways in which class location and digital access interact to generate
precarity and limit economic opportunities and consider the material and immaterial
aspects of this work.
However, moving beyond Bauman’s (2000) conceptualization, as discussed in
Chapter 1, I find “liquid” to be a useful term for a few other key reasons. First, in
economics, liquid assets are those that can be easily converted to cash – participants like
Joanne relied heavily on small cash transactions to maintain flexibility and limit financial
risk. Second, in contrast to “immaterial” labor, participants like Joanne produced both
material and immaterial goods, dissolving the boundaries between what is “immaterial”
and “material.” Third, as both Bauman (2000) and Castells (1989) argue, the expansion
of ICTs has allowed capital to easily flow across borders and boundaries, fleeing
protected workers to seek cheaper global labor. Lastly, liquid labor resonates with Devey
et al.’s (2006) concept of churn, or the process whereby precarious workers enter and exit
the formal and informal markets, but never gain stable economic footing. Having outlined
my goals and theoretical underpinnings, I will now turn to my participants to better
ground and expand on my theory of liquid labor as a type of hyper precarious and hyper
exploitable labor.

225
Liquid Laborers: Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron
Before I introduce each participant, I will provide some more background to
better contextualize their digital labor practices. Why have my participants chosen to
enter the informal economy? What factors have shaped their decision to pursue liquid
labor practices? This answer has been posed and answered, partially, in previous
chapters. For instance, I have already presented how the breakdown of durable
institutions, such as the welfare state, impacted the economic fortunes of many poor and
working-class Americans (Bauman, 2000). For example, in Chapter 3, I reviewed
research from scholars like Collins (2008), Daly (2003), Edin and Lein (1997), Grabham
and Smith (2010), and Sassen (2003) who have rightly argued that urban “survival
strategies” (including informal work) have been necessitated by declining social support,
reduced union protections, and the rapid embrace of neoliberal policies like workfare.
Marxist feminist scholars have likewise suggested that shifts in reproductive labor have
put an additional strain on the working class; said differently, issues of childcare can push
low-income Americans into new working arrangements (Abel & Nelson, 1990; England
& Folbre, 2002; Fisher & Tronto, 1990; Folbre, 1994, 2001). Furthermore, following
from Rodino-Colocino (2006), there is a growing digital workforce divide where a “high
tech minority” benefits from changes in the information economy, whereas the lowskilled American workforce faces declining wages and increased precariousness
(Bauman, 2000; Beck, 2000; Deuze, 2006; Rumberger & Levin, 1985). Given the limited
formal sector opportunities and the rise of chronic part-time work I presented in Chapter
6, some marginalized workers may seek alternative sources of income in the informal
sector.

226
But what about the impact of these wider economic changes on Philadelphians
more specifically? In Chapter 5, I traced the history of Philadelphia’s housing and urban
policies to show how they contributed to patterns of racial and economic segregation in
the city, trapping the urban poor in the declining high-poverty neighborhoods. This racial
and economic segregation limited their geographic proximity to formal jobs and reduced
vital social networks. I likewise explored how these policies –coupled with high rates of
incarceration and an underfunded public educational system –put additional economic
pressure on low-income families, causing many to become loosened or detached from the
formal economy altogether (Wilson, 2011). In Chapter 6, I addressed some of the
challenges to finding work in the formal sector in Philadelphia, noting that the jobs
available to workers were low-wage, low-skill, and of low-status. Notably, the sectors in
which KEYSPOT participants attained jobs were in reproductive labor fields like
carework/domestic work or the service industries. The positions were also typically parttime and thus did not typically provide needed benefits like healthcare or family leave.
While these previous insights help frame the issues surrounding liquid labor, they
do not represent the full range of factors and motivations that played a part in a
participant’s decision to seek informal work. Some of these other considerations and
motivations included increasing flexibility, minimizing financial risk, and managing
reproductive labor responsibilities. Therefore, to bring my theory of liquid labor to life, I
will now turn to introduce four participants –Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron. I have focused
on these four participants as they represent a diverse set of liquid laborers, two females
and two males, ranging in age from 21 to 45. Each engaged in very different activities.
For instance, as presented in the opening, Joanne is a 34-year-old African American

227
woman and her informal economic activities included selling pins, digital books and
jewelry. Sky is a 21-year-old African American woman and a part-time model who
promoted her modeling services online. Deric is a 31-year old African American man
who sold digital music and marketed his music on the web. Ron is 45-year-old African
American man who worked as a caricature artist and a for-contract graphic designer. In
presenting these participant accounts, I will give special attention to the individual factors
and personal motivations that caused them to each seek opportunities in the informal
sector. Following the detailed portraits, I will then synthesize and elaborate on key
themes.
Before I move on to discuss the ethnographic data in detail, I would reference my
earlier key finding that the informal “street” or “material” economies are now merging
with digital or “immaterial” economies in unique and unanticipated ways. Thus, I offer a
broad typology here to better orient the reader to my subsequent analysis. The informal
digital strategies I examine can be grouped into three categories: 1) Utilizing media tools
available at KEYSPOTs to create digital goods to be sold online, like Joanne’s Amazon
e-books, 2) Utilizing media tools available at KEYSPOTs to create material goods to be
sold online or in the streets, like Joanne’s political buttons; and, 3) Utilizing media tools
available at KEYSPOTs to promote informal services, like modeling. Another significant
trend I observed in the field was that social media and other online resources were used to
promote and market goods and services. In some cases, participants like Joanne were
using digital content – like the online images of the Obamas – as the raw material for
street goods. Again, this is a point of differentiation from the “immaterial labor”
literature, in that I am tracing the connection points between street and digital economies.

228
That being stated, I would also emphasize a broader point that I am making in this
chapter, and that is that these multiple, dynamic survival strategies resulted from
childcare issues and a need to maintain flexibility and minimize financial risk. Having
contextualized these liquid labor practices, I will now turn back to Joanne, offering a
more detailed description of her online work practices and motivations.
Meet Joanne
Introduced in the opening of the dissertation as well as this chapter, Joanne is a
34-year-old African American woman who was a “regular” at the KEYSPOT located in
the faith-based community center in North Philadelphia. She self-described as an “artist”
and engaged in various liquid labor practices as I have discussed, including selling
buttons/pins on the street, creating digital books, and selling handmade jewelry. As
Joanne did not earn consistent or significant income from any of her informal endeavors,
she frequently scanned for other temporary work opportunities in both the formal and
informal sectors. Each liquid labor strategy she pursued required little start-up capital and
thus presented few substantial financial risks; Joanne’s financial transactions were
usually small cash exchanges, around $20 or less. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight
that she assumed different kinds of risk, in the form of heavily investing her personal
time into her ventures, without knowing if they would become profitable. As discussed in
the opening, while she owned a laptop, she did not have internet access at home. Joanne
had both hard and soft digital skills.
Mothers and the service sector: the necessity of reproductive labor. Relating
to what will be first thematic argument about the relationship between informal labor and
reproductive labor, for Joanne, the primary benefit to the informal economy was that it

229
permitted her greater flexibility in working hours. This was especially important to
Joanne as she is a single mother and wanted to spend as much time as possible with her
son. Further, Jaleel has a developmental disorder and thus it was not easy for Joanne to
obtain childcare for him; she explained that other family members were not as well
equipped or trained to meet his needs. Joanne was thus concerned with providing
enrichment for Jaleel, activities that after school care programs were not able to provide.
Notably, retrenchment may have influenced this reality – as discussed in Chapter 5 on the
urban crisis, some educational programs and services were reduced due to budget cuts in
Philadelphia in the previous period, precipitated by the city’s fiscal crisis in the 1990’s.
To return to Joanne, before entering the informal economy, she worked in the service
sector at a local bar and restaurant. As she pointed out, jobs like this in the service sector
require afternoon or night hours which are difficult for parents. In other words, aligned
with my arguments in Chapter 6, the formal sector work available to Joanne was
somewhat akin to Dinah’s opportunity –low-status, low-skilled, low-paid and requiring
night hours. In short, as durable institutions breakdown in the era of liquid modernity and
reproductive labor is degraded along class, racial and gender lines, parents like Joanne
turned to flexible work to navigate increasingly precarious economic conditions.
Amazon e-books: the unique exploitation of digital labor. Having detailed the
reproductive labor considerations that drew her to online work, I will now turn to a
deeper examination and analysis of these flexible liquid labor practices. As discussed,
Joanne participated in multiple informal activities. Regarding the first type – digital
goods to be sold online – the e-books that Joanne wrote and sold on Amazon would fall
into this category. Joanne used free online software to create her books and then

230
subsequently sold them online. However, the surplus generated from this labor largely
benefitted Amazon.com, as Joanne was not compensated until her total sales reached a
certain benchmark of several hundred dollars. As previously discussed in Chapter 3,
“immaterial labor” was in this way exploited by capital in the non-wage digital economy
(Andrejevic, 2008; Fuchs, 2010, 2014; Jarrett, 2015). In other words, though Joanne
controlled the means of creative production in her handmade jewelry business, for her ebooks she very clearly produced, “surplus value for others who control capital and use
the appropriated labor for achieving profit” (Fuchs, 2010, p. 143). In sum, while Joanne
received some compensation for her digital books, she received nothing unless her book
was successful. Thus, although she limited financial risks, she invested a significant
amount of personal time into these activities, without any guarantee that it would ever
earn income.
Here a reader might point out that Amazon did shoulder some upfront costs in
providing the online e-book creation software and in hosting the book online. But, I
would respond that Joanne took over the promotional functions. For example, to ensure
she met the Amazon.com required benchmark and received some payment from her ebooks, Joanne utilized her personal network of friends and family through social media,
posting messages about how to buy her book online. As discussed in the introduction to
this chapter, one of her books centered on how urban mothers parent children with
developmental disabilities. Thus, as a complement to her social media promotional tactics
targeting friends and family, Joanne additionally utilized online messaging boards geared
towards disability communities. Yet, as she assumed these various promotional functions,
she invested a significant amount of time publicizing her book on behalf of Amazon. So,

231
though Amazon shouldered some costs, they were marginal and earned back quickly if
Joanne made any sales. In this way, I argue that Joanne’s experience highlights the nature
of the digital workforce divide, as the non-wage and low-wage low-tech majority plays a
significant role in making the digital economy profitable for the high-tech minority
(Jarrett, 2015; Rumberger & Levin, 1985).
To return to the issue of risk and a materialist consideration of risk-taking, though
Joanne did not take on financial risks to create her Amazon e-books, nonetheless, she
assumed great risks in the form of investment of her own time. This speaks to the ways in
which class position can uniquely shape how risk is navigated and defined – Joanne was
unable to risk any money, so she had to risk her time instead. Yet, although Joanne is a
poor and working class digital laborer, I would point out that her overall self-marketing
strategies were similar to those executed by the middle-class “aspirational laborers”
detailed in Duffy’s (2015) study of beauty bloggers reviewed in Chapter 3. This is a
subject I will explore in the next section when I introduce another participant, Sky.
Nevertheless, I want to highlight that though I analyze a different type of classed digital
labor, there are potential intersections with current scholarship that centers on middle and
upper class digital laborers. Nonetheless, as I stated in the opening, I am arguing that a
materialist consideration of risk and possible forms of exploitation is critical.
Political buttons: traveling light and street corner sales. To now shift to
analyzing her second liquid labor strategy, as mentioned, Joanne also created political
buttons. This would be the second typology I introduced earlier – using digital goods to
sell material products on the street. To generate her designs, in addition to using lab
computers she also leveraged KEYSPOT resources like free paper and printing. While

232
she had a simple website for her products, she observed that street marketing was one of
her most effective strategies. To sell her buttons on the street, she affixed about 50 – 100
of them to a small, lightweight painting canvas fitted with a shoulder strap. At the top of
the board, the price – “$1.00!” –was hand-painted in bright yellow puff paint. Joanne
carried them with her during the day as she traveled throughout the city, on the bus or by
foot. She typically earned about $30 - $50 in cash per hour in this way, however she had
to return home when her supply ran low. Here Joanne’s strategy to “travel light” recalls
Bauman’s (2000) characterization of the contemporary information economy as an era in
which, “Travelling light, rather than holding tightly to things deemed attractive for their
reliability and solidity….is now the asset of power” (p. 13). To expand on Bauman’s
(2000) observation, although her income was unpredictable, she was not weighed down
by upfront costs and produced (and carried, literally) was a small number of goods at one
time, thus maximizing flexibility and minimizing financial risk in that part of her work.
Therefore, “liquid labor” here recalls the ways in which workers like Joanne traveled
light, avoiding heavy commitments or investments.
Risky, solid street economies; low-risk liquid economies. Yet, it also useful to
change directions here and explain the tensions informal workers faced when selling
goods on the street. This highlights that while material economies can be somewhat
regulated, the digital economy remains more fluid and is, therefore, not as tightly policed.
This in part explains why so many informal digital laborers are fast embracing it as an
option to earn additional income: it is a largely unregulated sector of the economy. To
expand on how material economies are regulated, during street selling for her buttons and
jewelry, Joanne was careful to not delay in one place and constantly kept moving on

233
public transportation. This is because to legally peddle her goods on the street, Joanne
was required to obtain an official license from the city of Philadelphia. The license cost
was about $200 - $300 and required an application and paperwork, and for liquid laborers
like Joanne who wanted to maximize flexibility and minimize economic risk, this upfront
financial investment was considered prohibitive. Nevertheless, Joanne explained to me
that there were potential risks in selling her goods without a city license:
And so, they kind of just keep moving. You know, you can't stay in one place.
You have to keep your eyes looking for that because I was actually sitting at City
Hall once. I thought I hit the jackpot. I was sitting down at City Hall because the
weather was inclement. I was inside and I was also in the way of a lot of traffic.
You know, between the Broad Street line and the arrow people coming by and I
think I made like $60 in two hours. I was just like, “Whoo! Whoo!” You know?
And a police officer objected for me to move along and I did, but I came back the
following day and she came over with her partner and said, "If I see you down
here again I'm going to arrest you." I was just like, "Wow, I'm not selling
drugs. I am selling pins!" I didn't say all of that….but, yeah, that was
disappointing because I hadn't found a place with that much traffic yet.
As this interview excerpt indicates, the informal street economy was policed in shared
city spaces like the street or subway, constraining the ability of the liquid laborer to
access “traffic” or the greatest density of potential customers. So, if she wanted to sell
without a license, Joanne cannot be fixed in one spot, but must be perpetually on-the-go.
Thus, my position here is that another reason why she must “travel light” is a practical
one: Joanne was on the move constantly to evade arrest. Yet, as I have already described,

234
Joanne adapted her strategies to fit these limitations – fastened with a shoulder strap, her
canvas board proved a cheap, lightweight solution that allowed her goods to be mobile.
However, again, this episode highlights one of the benefits to selling immaterial goods
like Amazon e-books instead of material goods like buttons on the street: you are not
physically limited by the inventory you can transport and additionally you take no
financial (or legal) risks peddling goods without a license.
Building on this point, I would underline that in the above quote, Joanne
distinguished her liquid labor activities from other more nefarious informal economic
activities, i.e. the traffic and sale of drugs on the street. Although Joanne is not “selling
drugs,” informal economic activity of all types was policed – the penalty for selling her
pins on the street was arrest and possible prosecution. This frames the complex tensions
that exist between the informal and formal economy and the structural role of
government and policing in defining economic exchange in urban spaces. And, it also
emphasizes the potential motivation for embracing the informal digital economy more
widely– it mitigated some risks, and although exploitative, did not require up-front
payments in the form of a license. Thus, Joanne’s calculation and evaluation of risk was
very much materialist and tied to her class position: she had to constantly reevaluate her
risks, with a focus on limiting upfront costs. Nonetheless, as Joanne later explained in an
interview, flexibility and mitigating risk was not necessarily a choice, as poor and
working-class liquid laborers have structural barriers to accessing capital.
Structural barriers to a formal business: lack of access to startup capital. As
a pushback on the entrepreneurial frames embedded in broadband policy that celebrate
technology as a path to business opportunity, I would point out that Joanne was interested

235
in establishing a formal business to sell her products, yet faced structural barriers.
Joanne’s liquid labor model – relying on low financial risk ventures and small cash
transactions – was her only viable option. For as Joanne pointed out, the quality of a
business plan or a would-be entrepreneur’s business concept does not fundamentally alter
the nature of capital. Said another way, those without resources living at the economic
margins cannot secure the financing necessary to establish a formal sector venture. In an
interview, Joanne championed her low-risk model and explained how difficult it is for
poor and working-class business owners in her community to obtain loans or startup
capital:
Well, there's a lot of misinformation from eons where people are still working on
it. For instance, the notion that you need to have a lot of money to start your
own business, the notion that if you write a business plan you can get a
business loan, that is completely bogus. It doesn't matter how your business plan
is. If you don't have collateral and money that is already coming into your
business to show that you'll be able to pay it back.
In other words, Joanne indicated here that poor and working-class participants without
significant economic resources – such as homes or cars – may not have the “collateral”
needed to obtain a small business loan for start-up capital. Additionally, the absence of
credit history or poor credit may hinder poor and working-class entrepreneurs in their
loan application process. Said differently, Joanne suggested that anyone who thinks
she/he can easily obtain a loan armed only with a strong business plan has been confused
by “misinformation.” Nonetheless, the “smaller, more flexible” informal economy
allowed Joanne an opportunity to earn money. Joanne created her e-books online; her

236
political pin business only required the purchase of an inexpensive button-making
machine, and she used KEYSPOT resources like paper and online software for free.
These structural impediments that Joanne referenced reveal that a limited and
vague policy definition of “entrepreneurial activity” is not only over-celebratory, but
overlooks a significant dimension of the problem of economic mobility. As Joanne
cannot engage in economic risk-taking – whether through personal capital or invested
capital – she must instead take on other risks, such as risks of personal time or even the
risks of peddling on the streets of Philadelphia without a license. This also underscores
the ways in which the “access” and “skills” policy focus can obscure the complex
relationship between poverty, inequality and ICT access. Joanne wanted to start a
business, but due to her class position, she did not have access to the resources that were
necessary. It likewise highlights how “risk” is uniquely conceptualized among different
classes of digital laborers and underscores the utility of a materialist understanding of
risk.
However, to shift to another liquid labor strategy, I would add that when I met
Joanne, she was beginning to build a small handmade jewelry business, primarily selling
the goods directly through Facebook to friends or at local community street fairs. This
would fall under the second typology I mentioned earlier, utilizing KEYSPOT media
tools to create material goods to be sold in the streets. But, whereas Joanne occasionally
used the lab resources to search for the materials needed to create jewelry, most of her
supplies –such as thread and brightly colored wooden and clay beads –were purchased
from stores in the community or made at home. Though she was beginning to experiment
with selling her goods on Etsy, at the time of my research, she had not yet fully

237
developed that avenue to promote her goods. Nonetheless, I wanted to briefly include
these other liquid labor strategies, though it was under development.
So, to sum up and frame all of her liquid labor practices, Joanne was initially
motivated to pursue liquid labor due to her reproductive responsibilities, as her previous
job working at a bar and restaurant was not conducive to parenting. She appreciated the
flexibility liquid labor could provide her, even though she admitted that the income
earned from her ventures amounted to small infusions of cash rather than a steady,
predictable income. As she did not have access to the capital she would have needed to
establish a formal business, Joanne embraced a low financial risk model. Nevertheless,
she risked her own time and faced exploitation of her labor, as evidenced by her
relationship with her e-book host, Amazon. She used both street and digital economies to
make ends meet, shifting between creating material goods and immaterial goods. And
though her online work demonstrated incredible creativity and ingenuity, her practices
were a means of family survival facing dire economic circumstances. In short, Joanne
was the most precarious of precarious laborers, highly exploited and vulnerable (Beck,
2000; Bauman, 2000; Deuze, 2006). Having now detailed the liquid labor of one single
mother, I will now turn to the online work practices of another, Sky.
Meet Sky
While Joanne’s usage of the informal digital economy has now been discussed at
length, it is valuable to contrast her informal strategies with those of another participant.
Sky is a 21-year-old African American woman with curly hair and boxy dark glasses,
who was a “regular” at a KEYSPOT located in a health advocacy organization in Central
Philadelphia. During her free time at the lab, Sky often watched music videos on

238
YouTube or fashion clips featuring models walking the catwalk. She was a college
student, but also worked as a part-time model: therefore, her liquid labor practices would
fall under the third typology I described – using digital media to promote informal goods
and services. While Sky is not a mother, she did have custody of her three-year old
brother, Darius, and was primarily responsible for his care. So, like Joanne, Sky was
shouldering the burdens of caregiving alone without a partner, a circumstance which
impacted her economic life and labor strategies. Thus, I want to briefly highlight that
liquid labor can not only shaped by class, but can be influenced by gender or race. Sky
did not have a computer or broadband access at home, but she had hard and soft
technological skills.
Part-time work, poverty and reproductive labor. In addition to working in the
informal economy as a model and studying as a part-time college student, Sky held
another part-time job working at large fast-food restaurant chain. Unfortunately, Sky did
not earn enough income from this formal sector job to survive and it did not provide her
family with needed benefits like healthcare. Thus, to make ends meet, Sky picked up
modeling jobs when she could and occasionally babysat for a co-worker’s children. Like
Joanne, the informal economy offered Sky flexibility in her schedule to allow her to both
care for Darius and attend college classes. However, much like Ms. Ramirez, her parttime work did not provide her with healthcare which put an additional financial strain on
her family. This presented special challenges for Sky, as she was the primary caregiver
for Darius. In fact, I would add here that Sky visited the health advocacy organization in
which the KEYSPOT was located for free medical services because she was living in
poverty. This underscores that liquid labor practices result from an interaction of

239
economic and social forces, including poverty, the rise of precarious work, and the
degradation of reproductive labor across race, gender and class lines. More broadly,
Sky’s story highlights how the urban crisis practically shaped the economic lives of
KEYSPOT visitors.
The risk of wage-loss and wage-theft: lack of protection for liquid laborers.
How did Sky connect to informal modeling opportunities? Like Joanne, Sky employed
multiple strategies to find opportunities. First, she marketed her modeling services to her
personal social network through Facebook. Second, she advertised her services and
responded to posts online; some of the resources she used to find “gigs” included local
messaging boards, an online website geared towards the modeling industry, and Craig’s
List. Like Ron, a participant who I will turn to later, Sky also relied heavily on word-ofmouth recommendations: she primarily found work through local Philadelphia based
designers and boutique clothing store photo-shoots.
While I have touched on issues surrounding the online exploitation of digital
labor, my interviews with Sky exposed another harsh reality for liquid laborers that
Joanne had not experienced. As she was not protected by a contract, when the terms of
her labor changed, Sky did not feel she was in a strong position to make challenges.
Thus, her experience suggests that both formal laborers (such as Dinah) and informal
laborers seeking work through KEYSPOTs could be subject to multiple forms of
exploitation. To provide an example to this point, regarding a recent modeling event she
worked, Sky complained:
We wore scarves printed like bright colors, geometric. It was cool but I was
perturbed because they said it was going to be $50 and then they paid me $45

240
and didn’t even pay me back for my [bus] fare and it was ass-far. But it will be
good for my portfolio and one day I’ll hopefully get something permanent.
So, whereas Sky had agreed to perform a service for $50, when she arrived, she was paid
$45 and not reimbursed for travel expenses as agreed upon. This reaffirms the multiple
forms of exploitation poor and working-class job-seekers face: in the formal economy,
they may be subjected to invasive social media screening practices (as discussed in
Chapter 6), whereas informal workers can encounter digital economy exploitation (as in
the case of Joanne’s Amazon e-books) or wage theft or wage loss (as was the experience
for Sky). In other words, when liquid laborers face exploitation, because they are in such
a precarious economic position, they are less likely to complain or bargain for higher
wages (Dyer-Witheford, 1999; Harvey, 2005; Stack, 1974). It also reveals that whereas
upfront financial risks are limited for poor and working-class liquid laborers like Joanne
and Sky, backend risks are not. Therefore, although Sky was not obligated to invest cash
into her modeling business, she was at constant risk of wage loss or wage theft, among
other forms of possible exploitation.
Class position and portfolios: the slippery promise of hope labor. Having
addressed the issue of wage loss presented in Sky’s interview, I would emphasize that
there is another key reason here that Sky did not contest her exploitative working
conditions, and it connects to the insights of digital labor scholars previously reviewed in
Chapter 3. Though Sky was not properly compensated for her modeling services, she
tempers her response remarking that, “it will be good for my portfolio and one day I’ll
hopefully get something permanent.” In other words, though she was not properly
compensated in this situation, she still had “hope” (Kuehn & Corrigan, 2013) that she

241
was one step closer to her ultimate goal: attaining a full-time position. This would, in
turn, allow her to give up the multiple jobs she must now work to survive. In other words,
she downplayed her own exploitation. Sky’s sentiments here support the claims of digital
labor scholars I reviewed in Chapter 3 (Bulut, 2014; Duffy, 2015; Kuehn & Horrigan,
2013; Neff, 2012; Postigo, 2007) who have argued that digital laborers may see their
work as a long-term investment. Said differently, even though they are often aware of the
exploitative dimensions, precarious digital laborers may continue to engage in their work
in the hopes that it will eventually lead to a more stable, profitable, or permanent
opportunity. Nonetheless, I would point out that these precarious exploitative “hopeful”
arrangements can translate to work as well that spans social classes, such as unpaid
college internships as a form of hope labor (Rodino-Colocino & Beber, 2015).
However, given her economic, social and class position – not to mention her
significant reproductive labor responsibilities as a young single caregiver to her brother–
Sky’s ability to convert her part-time modeling work into a paid formal position seemed
limited. Therefore, although I agree with scholars who have conceptualized these
practices as “hope labor” (Kuehn & Horrigan, 2013) or “venture labor” (Neff, 2012), I
would insist that we must also consider a digital laborer’s social and class position as
well as their access to ICTs. For example, Neff (2012) is right to chronicle the
exploitative dimensions of high-tech work in the dotcom era, yet these workers
undoubtedly still had racial and class privileges that at least made it more likely that they
would eventually obtain full-time or well-paid work. In contrast, Joanne and Sky faced
significant structural barriers (like lack of access to startup capital or transportation) but
also technological barriers, as they were relying heavily on KEYSPOT resources to

242
continue their digital work practices. This group of laborers also considered flexibility
and how to lower risks in a way that was materialist and uniquely classed.
In sum, Sky’s liquid labor practices had many intersections with Joanne’s online
work. She was similarly motivated to pursue liquid labor, because as a single primary
caregiver to her brother, she needed a schedule that would allow her more flexibility but
would not require an upfront financial investment. In addition to her caregiving
responsibilities, Sky was also juggling a part-time job at a large fast food restaurant chain
and college coursework. Though liquid labor opportunities in modeling provided some
extra cash to supplement her income, it was not enough to survive. In fact, Sky visited the
organization in which the lab was located for free health services. But although Sky
acknowledged she had encountered wage loss and wage theft, she had hope her modeling
work was a stepping stone to new opportunities and stability. Nonetheless, Sky faced
significant structural challenges (like lack of access to a home computer) that constrained
her opportunities for economic mobility. In referencing her “portfolio” and future
modeling career, Sky’s outlook was far more optimistic than my third liquid laborer,
Deric, who was pursuing a career in the music industry.
Meet Deric
Having just discussed the digital labor practices of both Joanne and Sky, I will
now turn to introduce another liquid laborer who, like Joanne, visited the KEYSPOT in a
faith based center in North Philadelphia. Deric is a 31-year old African American male
who moved to Philadelphia from the Midwest in 2009 to, “chase [a] dream as an R and B
artist.” Like Joanne, he also created digital media that he sold online –in his case, online
music and digital beats. As he did not have a home computer and primarily accessed the

243
internet via a mobile device, Deric regularly visited his local KEYSPOT to create music
and send digital music files. Deric had both hard and soft technological skills. In addition
to providing new avenues to make money from music, Deric argued that his access to a
local KEYSPOT expanded the artistic possibilities of what he could do musically. In
short, I want to highlight that Deric valued both the economic and cultural benefits of
KEYSPOTs, as this is a subject I will consider further in Chapter 8.
New parents seeking new opportunities. To return to Deric’s liquid labor
practices, at the time of the project, Deric and his fiancé, Tamara, recently had a baby.
Thus, like Joanne and Sky, Deric had significant reproductive labor responsibilities and
liked the flexibility the informal economy could provide his family (Bauman, 2000). As
Deric explained, with a newborn, either he or Tamara needed to be home to feed his son,
“every four hours,” so some work opportunities in the formal sector were entirely out of
the question for both parents. Though Deric and his family benefitted from the flexibility
the informal digital economy could offer –and the work did not require an upfront
investment of cash –his music work required a substantial time investment and the
payouts he received were small and incredibly unpredictable. Like both Joanne and Sky,
although Deric earned some income from these informal ventures, it was not enough to
survive. So, though Deric visited the KEYSPOT each week to work on his music, he also
spent a significant amount of time searching for formal sector jobs online, often using the
lab’s resources to print resumes and cover letters. Therefore, like Joanne and Sky, Deric’s
financial situation was incredibly precarious; while he was engaged in liquid labor, he
also sought opportunities in both the formal and informal sectors.

244
Music and money: the exploitation of digital [music] labor. To describe his
liquid labor practices in greater depth, like Joanne, Deric earned revenue through a
dynamic and constantly evolving set of informal strategies. He gained income primarily
by: 1) participating in internet and blog radio stations; 2) generating views on his multiple
YouTube channels; and, 3) remixing music and selling digital beats online. To provide
more background on each strategy, first Deric earned a small amount of income – a few
hundred dollars per month –from his participation in blog talk radio stations. He
explained that the blog talk radio stations were accessed primarily via mobile phone
applications, “all over the world,” and were also a way to gain business contacts. Second,
Deric maintained several music channels through YouTube which were listed separately
under various “stage names.” In this way, he earned a small amount of money from
YouTube when users viewed his content. Nonetheless, I want to focus on his third
informal labor strategy – remixing and selling digital beats.
To elaborate on this third strategy, one resource Deric utilized to remix and sell
digital beats was “ClubCreate,” a now defunct application accessible through Facebook
which allowed artists to earn money from creating digital beats or submitting remixes of
available songs. For example, Deric was compensated when a beat he generated from a
popular music hit was featured on another forum and further when his remixed version of
a hit was “shared” through the application. Yet, like Joanne’s e-books, Deric did not earn
a significant amount of income from a single share or feature. Only when his song was
frequently shared did it generate anything measurable, meaning above a few dollars. I
would point out here that music producers were in many ways using a crowdsourcing
model to generate low-cost and low-risk creative content. In other words, while Deric

245
invested considerable time creating music on the site, he earned income only if his beat or
remix was successful. Therefore, in many ways, Deric’s story mimics Joanne’s
experience with her Amazon digital books and reinforces the nature of the digital
workforce divide. To expand on this, the low-tech majority assumes risk in their online
labor – such as investments of personal time – and plays a significant role in making the
digital economy profitable for sites like Amazon or YouTube of apps like ClubCreate
(Jarrett, 2015; Rumberger & Levin, 1985). And though Deric invested a substantial
amount of time into his online work, like Joanne, he struggled to keep his family
financially afloat.
Liquid labor and social support resources. Repeatedly in our discussions, Deric
underscored that the KEYSPOT digital skills courses were extremely beneficial to him;
for instance, a trainer helped him improve hard digital skills related to his music, such as
how to upload MP3s to his personal website. Yet, to return to my above point, he
disclosed that one of the KEYSPOT’s most useful functions was to connect him to social
support resources his family needed as they were living in poverty (Wolfson & Crowell,
2013). For example, in our interview, he praised the computer assistant, Camille, who
went out of her way to connect him with material resources for his infant son. Deric
articulated his appreciation for Camille, saying:
She didn't just help me with my music. She helped me find a job, clothing, and
stuff for my son. She helped me a lot.
In short, Deric explained that Camille was not only providing digital assistance, but that
she helped him find needed items such as, “clothing, and stuff for my son.” This
underscores the ways in which reproductive labor influenced digital work practices but

246
likewise demonstrates that while liquid labor offered some cash, it was not enough to
survive. Additionally, Deric told me that the lab staff had occasionally connected him to
local formal sector job opportunities where he could make some extra cash to better
support his family. In sum, for Deric, these liquid labor practices acted more as “survival
circuits” and did not appear to translate to substantive economic mobility (Sassen, 2003).
Said differently, in the context of the wider urban crisis, participants like Deric acquired
digital skills and yet, like Dinah, continued to need social support services to make ends
meet. This reinforces my position aligned with Mosco’s (2004) concept of the “digital
myth”– and contra the policymaker stance –that access and skills programs do not
necessarily offer a route out of poverty. His comment also underscores that for him,
KEYSPOTs played a vital social support role, a role that went far beyond simply
providing digital access and training.
Self-marketing, connections and neoliberal identities. As a final point on how
Deric executed his liquid labor strategies, to earn income and attract industry attention,
Deric invested a significant amount of time marketing his music on social media. For
example, Deric tweeted 15 – 20 targeted messages daily to drive his thousand-plus fans
to blog radio appearances and YouTube channels. He frequently posted information on
important upcoming events on his Facebook page and maintained high visibility on music
sharing sites like Sound Cloud, Sound Click and YouTube. Deric was also a registered
artist on the networking and promotion site, ReverbNation. And each week he dutifully
uploaded new selfies on the streets of Philadelphia for his social media pages, layered
through gritty filters or edgy graphics. This constant self-marketing was vital because
Deric feared that without improved social connections, it would be difficult for him to

247
generate enough revenue from his liquid labor practices to support his growing family.
He shared with me that to make it in the music industry:
[It’s about the] connections that you've got. So, I mean you can make the beats
and have the music and not go nowhere with it because you don't have the right
connection, and then now it is getting to the point now it is not even just about
who you know. It's about how much money you've got.
Here in stressing the “right connection,” Deric referred to the same barriers Straubhaar et
al. (2012) addressed in their study that I have referenced throughout – a digital access and
skills policy focus can obscure the role of social and cultural connections in connecting
poor and working-class job-seekers to opportunities, particularly in high-skilled and highstatus work. Moreover, Deric expressed here that “the money you’ve got” is equally
important to break into the music industry. In contrast to Sky, in this statement Deric also
revealed that he was slightly less hopeful that his digital labor would ultimately translate
to a better (or more permanent) employment opportunity.
Yet, the point I would emphasize is that because he could not rely on support
structures or a steady income, Deric attempted to generate income with all the tools
available to him, including constant self-marketing (Banet-Weiser, 2012; Gill, 2007). In
all these ways, Deric embodied the modern precarious “neoliberal” laborer because– to
paraphrase Bauman (2000)– he understood that the responsibility for caring for his family
rested entirely on his shoulders (p 19). However, while Deric emphasized his family’s
financial struggles and articulated the structural challenges facing his community (like an
underfunded educational system), Deric expressed pride that he took on so many roles to

248
support his family or “hustle.” Following from this, he clarified his evolving liquid labor
strategies to me:
Because now, not only am I an artist, but I am a promoter now. I'm a writer,
producer, and, also, I am a webmaster now. So, moving to Philadelphia has
opened up the horizons for me –not just to do one thing in music –but to do a
whole bunch of different things in music.
In this statement, Deric celebrated the multiple roles that he assumed in his liquid labor
practices, explaining that he is an artist, promoter, writer, producer and webmaster. Said
differently, he esteemed his own flexibility and liquidity, or his ability to move into
multiple roles and wear many hats to support his family. His comments here –and his
constant commitment to self-marketing on social media –suggests that Deric was
engaging in a type of neoliberal self-work, constantly regulating and branding both his
conduct and appearance online (Banet-Weiser, 2012; McRobbie, 2004; Gil, 2007; Gil &
Scharff, 2011). So, although Deric utilized a dynamic and evolving set of strategies to
make ends meet and faced exploitation of his digital content, his own appraisal of this
online music work was multifaceted. On one hand, he realized that his endeavors might
never lead to a stable job and confessed that he did not have the right “connection.”
Regardless, on the other hand, he celebrated his “hustle” and felt pride in his ability to
navigate an uncertain economic environment and engage in precarious liquid labor.
Deric embodies the complexities and contradictions of liquid labor. As a new
parent with an infant son, flexible online work practices gave him more freedom in his
schedule and he enjoyed the “hustle” of navigating his many roles. He invested
significant time into his music work –and though it was not translating to economic

249
stability – he felt pride in his ability to self-market and manage his image on social
media. One of the most useful functions of KEYSPOTs to Deric was not related to
technology at all, but that the digital assistant, Camille, could help him access social
support resources his family needed to survive poverty. While Deric made an important
cultural contribution just like Joanne, in contrast to the celebratory accounts of creative
culture presented by scholars such as Jenkins (2006), I want to reiterate that the
“immaterial labor” of poor and working-class workers is uniquely exploited by capital in
the non-wage digital economy (Andrejevic, 2008; Fuchs, 2010; Jarrett, 2015). In sum,
Deric struggled in liquid labor, yet espoused the benefits of the digital economy and
promoted neoliberal self-work. I also want to briefly flag that unlike Joanne and Sky,
Deric did have the support of a partner to share the caregiving responsibilities. In other
words, the men in my study were more likely to share caregiving responsibilities,
whereas the women assumed these roles alone. That being said, I will now turn to Ron,
another father who engaged in liquid labor to support his family.
Meet Ron
After Ron (45) lost his job in the healthcare industry in the wake of the Great
Recession, he attended the Freedom Rings Partnership “Digital Jobs Fair” in an attempt
find work in the formal sector. However, while I introduced Ron in Chapter 6, I did not
discuss how he was making ends meet given his impediments to finding well paid formal
work. With formal job opportunities limited to him, like Joanne, Sky and Deric, Ron
entered liquid labor as a caricature artist, using digital tools to market his services and to
help him gain customers on the street. Like the other participants already introduced, Ron
employed multiple tactics, earning revenue through a constantly evolving set of flexible

250
survival strategies. First, he utilized digital tools to create material goods – caricature
drawings – to be sold on the streets. And second, he promoted his art as a type of
informal service, performing at birthday parties and other events. Ron had two laptops at
home, but they were, in his words, a little “outdated”: one had a touchscreen that he could
draw on and the other was primarily used for software programs and storage. He reported
to me that he was looking for “funding” to upgrade them both. Ron had advanced hard
and soft digital skills, with fluency in software programs like Photoshop and Illustrator.
He also supported a large family including a wife, two children (ages 25 and 20), and a
niece (19) who lived with him.
Growing up quickly: balancing work and reproductive responsibilities. How
did Ron get started in his craft? Ron told me that he grew up in a small rural community
in Pennsylvania and started out as a “low-key artist” doing portraits for friends and
family in his hometown. At the age of 20, he realized he wanted to establish a career in
the arts and so headed for the “hustle and bustle” of Philadelphia. Ron enrolled in an arts
college to develop his creative skills – and to expand on my above point –during his
training attained hard digital skills including mastery of Photoshop, Illustrator and
computer animation. It took Ron a few extra years to complete his program because he,
“found out he was going to be a daddy” in his first year of school, and likewise held a
full-time job. During this time period, Ron also frequently returned to his hometown to
check on an aging parent. On the challenges of this family balancing act, Ron remarked
that, “It taught me just the resilience of growing up quickly.” In other words, like Sky,
Ron juggled reproductive labor responsibilities, a job, as well as college coursework.

251
However, like Deric (and unlike Joanne and Sky), he did have the support of a partner to
help with caregiving.
Lack of contacts and service sector limitations. Though he was well-trained
and deeply inspired by the art and culture of the city, Ron confided in me that he
struggled to find his way into the high-tech art world and pursued other options to
continue to support his family. Like Joanne, Ron entered the service sector, first working
as a restaurant busboy and later as a waiter. His experience in the workforce reinforces
my arguments from Chapter 6: many of the opportunities available to KEYSPOT
participants in the formal sector were in fields like carework, domestic and service work.
I would also reiterate that the jobs available in these industries were not conducive to
parenting and did not offer benefits like health insurance. For instance, although he
enjoyed advancing in the service industry, Ron admitted that the working hours were not
ideal for him as a parent, thus he eventually transitioned into the healthcare sector where
his schedule and pay were more consistent. I would remind the reader here that as I noted
in Chapter 5, the healthcare industry in Philadelphia experienced healthy growth in the
1990’s and into the 2000’s, and thus was a significant source of employment for the city.
In this way, Ron benefitted from this expansion I discussed earlier.
Art and design for-sale: low financial risk liquid labor. However, as I have
mentioned elsewhere, Ron ultimately lost his job in the healthcare sector due to
downsizing in the wake of the Great Recession. With limited options in the formal sector
on the horizon and the need to support a large family, Ron decided to enter the informal
economy. According to Ron, that period of his life felt like a “rebuilding process.” He
stated:

252
So, now after being laid off I had more mental time that I could see the big
picture. So, I am kind of creating it out, starting from scratch. So, I'm in that
rebuilding process. So, I am trying to think what is more efficient? What will I
work with? Purge things, keep things, things like that.
As Ron divulged here, one of the challenges for liquid laborers is that they do, in fact,
need access to technological tools, hence his question, “What will I work with?” Thus, it
is important to point out that these were resources that KEYSPOTs could help provide. In
any case, Ron also described this as a time where he considered “efficiency,” or how to
make the most out of what limited resources he had.
After evaluating his options, Ron ultimately decided to use his creative digital
skills to generate extra cash, promoting and offering caricature drawing services on the
street. Later, he gained some small jobs working birthday parties for friends, entertaining
children with his drawings and other skills such as face-painting. When his caricature
drawing business slowed, Ron expanded to offer graphic design services, creating
personalized business cards and other materials for clients. Like my other liquid laborers,
Ron did not have a significant amount of disposable income to “work with” and thus,
following from Bauman (2000), pursued several low financial risk approaches to gain
customers and clients. To obtain work, first Ron utilized social media. He maintained a
separate Facebook “business page” and used both LinkedIn and Google Plus to develop
business contacts. Thus, I would note here that leveraging personal social media networks
and self-marketing was a central strategy for Joanne, Sky and Deric. Second, Ron relied
on an online event platform, Gigmasters. For a low monthly membership fee, the
platform offered Ron access to potential bookings, provided quotes to interested clients,

253
and helped him host an official business website. In other words, like Joanne, he needed
to limit his financial risks and up-front costs. Lastly, Ron leveraged word-of-mouth
recommendations, which he made clear were vital to obtain gigs. Yet, Ron did not make
enough from any single opportunity to survive and, like Deric, was actively seeking work
in the formal economy.
High demand, low reward: the information economy and the digital
workforce divide. As I presented in the previous chapter in the context of the Digital
Jobs Fair where I first met him, Ron shared a bleak – and relevant –assessment of the
current state of the formal economy in Philadelphia. To summarize that assessment, Ron
complained that the formal sector positions available to him were primarily, “highdemand, low-reward.” In other words, the jobs available were in sectors like service work
and carework that would offer few benefits and perks. Further, the positions required
undesirable hours, delivered low pay and were particularly inflexible to parents. So,
although Ron was searching for formal work, he was not overly optimistic about his
prospects in the formal labor market.
I am returning to this point, however, to identify and underline that here another
participant account exposes the disconnect between digital policy and economic reality.
Ron had advanced creative and digital skills, yet throughout his career he struggled to
gain the high-tech, creative work he was qualified for due to a lack of social connections
and his reproductive labor needs. Thus, he leveraged his skills, instead, into work in the
informal digital economy. This supports my larger assertion that the digital workforce
divide (Rodino-Colocino, 2006) should be understood as shaped by social and economic
position, but also as related to a larger restructuring of the urban labor market in

254
advanced economies. It likewise substantiates Straubhaar et al.’s (2012) argument that
workers seeking high-tech work could face significant social and cultural barriers. In
short, an access and skills policy focus can overlook the other impediments faced by
KEYSPOT program participants more widely in their quest to find high-skilled, highstatus opportunities in the formal sector. And as I have now demonstrated, Joanne, Sky,
Deric and Ron were each highly skilled and yet unable to find consistent, well-paid
formal work.
A path to financial success: self-help and self-care. But beyond this, what were
Ron’s other motivations for engaging in liquid labor? Interestingly, in our interviews,
Ron repeatedly referred to or quoted motivational speakers or self-help books that he
found inspirational. He explained that these books and speakers had shaped his personal
philosophy on how to best approach his business. Notably, these books drew heavily on
neoliberal themes. One of the motivational speakers he listened to encouraged all aspiring
entrepreneurs to, “under promise and over deliver,” to their customers. Ron remarked
that he decided to take that on as a mantra for his own business, offering discounts for
referrals and focusing more on customer “quality” than on his price point. In other words,
Ron intuited from his study of these self-help books that to be successful, he should
concentrate more on the quality of the product and building customer relationships rather
than strictly focusing on his bottom line. Though Ron was enthusiastic on this point, it
struck me as fraught – would this focus ultimately earn Ron more revenue in the future?
It was clear from our discussions that his family desperately needed income. Was this
philosophy focused on developing the business or, instead, centered on developing the
attitudes, capacities and outlook of the individual laborer?

255
To this point, another motivational book that Ron referenced in our interviews
was about the importance of “self-marketing” in the digital age. In this way, Ron’s
outlook echoes Deric’s, as he emphasized neoliberal self-work and self-branding (BanetWeiser, 2012; McRobbie, 2004; Gil, 2007; Gil & Scharff, 2011). In our interview, Ron
then urged all aspiring liquid laborers to prioritize their own self-care above the care of
the community. Said differently, Ron himself embraced the dominant values of
neoliberalism and encouraged other aspiring liquid laborers to adopt these same core
beliefs. He proposed that to give to others in an uncertain world, you must first take care
of yourself. Ron thus described the self-help book’s main themes to me:
So, if you're not doing for others, you're only doing for yourself. So, the basic
part of that is saying take care of yourself first [and] then you are able to give
to others. And those who are all givers in this world –if they continue to give to
others, they're constantly taking care of themselves –which is enabling them to
give to others. So, in that same sense, this book is teaching you how to take
care of yourself first in order to be the best that you can be for yourself as
marketing.
In making this comment to me, Ron advised all aspiring liquid laborers to, “take care of
yourself first.” According to Ron, looking after yourself allows you to, “be the best that
you can be,” in business but also in life. Yet, what is most interesting is that Ron made a
concrete connection between these attitudes and “self-marketing” to improve your
business prospects. In this way, Ron appeared to suggest that liquid laborers like Joanne,
Sky and Deric were not simply marketing their products online, but that they are also
marketing themselves, ideally as neoliberal, self-reliant laborers. Consequently, his

256
statements revealed that in this state of perpetual economic uncertainty and instability –
when workers cannot rely on durable social support institutions –many may turn inward
for answers and solutions. So, while “liquid labor” encapsulates the precarious, fluid
online working practices that emerged in my fieldsites, it does not fully capture the
deeper discourses and attitudes that structured how participants understood their own
work. Additionally, it does not speak to how the discourses of the digital sublime appear
to cut across class boundaries, and may even become internalized (Mosco, 2004).
Ron’s outlook therefore frames the challenges and tensions facing critical
researchers as they examine broadband programs and precarious digital work.
Participants could simultaneously inhabit dual perspectives on their practices, positions
that seemed at times in conflict with one another. For example, all participants openly
acknowledged and critiqued the structural factors that had inhibited their opportunities
for advancement and mobility. Yet, at the same time, participants embraced and
championed neoliberal attitudes and blamed themselves when their liquid labor practices
were not profitable enough to support their families. Subsequently, many liquid laborers
shared Mr. Wilson’s frustration that the rise of ICTs has not benefitted all communities
equally and that technology – through automation or computerization –has played a role
in dramatically reshaping the economic prospects for the urban poor. Even so, many
participants regarded digital skills as a possible route out of poverty, even though none
had achieved stability and most continued to rely on social programs. These issues draw
attention to the ways in which the myth of the digital sublime (and neoliberalism) are
deeply embedded not only within broadband programs like KEYSPOTs, but also within
our culture –and in some cases – within the workers themselves.

257
Conclusion
One of the chief goals of the BTOP programs was to develop broadband
infrastructure for job growth. This goal implied that technological development
stimulates job opportunities and can mitigate unemployment. Yet, as I have presented in
this chapter, many poor and working-class participants used digital resources to generate
opportunities outside the formal economy. These activities ranged from promoting
services such as modeling or caricature drawing, to selling handmade goods or digital
goods online. In some cases, digital and street economies collided in unique and
unanticipated ways. The surprising emergence of these dynamic survival strategies in the
context of the Freedom Rings Partnership programs raised questions that I have pursued
in this project: how can we better understand these informal online work practices? Why
are they happening and how are they connected to the contemporary information
economy?
To summarize my key arguments from this chapter, liquid laborers like Joanne,
Deric, Sky and Ron all arrived at the informal economy primarily due to their
reproductive labor responsibilities and their need for supplemental income in the absence
of high-skill, high-status job opportunities in the formal sector. In short, though they each
had obtained advanced hard and soft technological skills, they were unable to find good
jobs and thus applied those digital skills towards precarious online ventures. The income
they obtained from their ventures was often a small infusion of cash, rather than a
predictable living wage or living income. While some, like Joanne, would have wanted to
establish a formal business, structural factors like a lack of credit history and economic
collateral were prohibitive. Thus, given that they did not have access to capital, liquid

258
laborers could only make small investments into their enterprises and had to consider
minimizing financial risk. Nevertheless, participants did risk their own time in dedicating
themselves to their online work without knowing if it would eventually translate to
income, all the while generating wealth for corporations like Amazon or YouTube.
Liquid laborers faced various forms of exploitation online and offline. Digital economies
appeared to offer some advantages over street economies for participants like Joanne, as
they were not highly policed. While my participant Sky was hopeful that her modeling
work would convert to a full-time opportunity, Deric was more pessimistic, citing a lack
of social contacts and money as a barrier to finding formal work in the music industry.
Following from this, despite their best efforts in the informal (and formal) sectors,
participants like Sky and Deric continued to need the aid of social support programs to
survive, services their KEYSPOT could help them locate. And although participants
openly critiqued the structural factors that had limited economic opportunity for their
families, they also celebrated their online self-marketing and self-work, championing the
values of neoliberalism.
To summarize my overarching thesis developed in this chapter, in the wake of
retrenchment and the urban crisis in Philadelphia, the informal economy offered poor and
working-class parents and caregivers a source of supplemental income many once
received through welfare and social programs. Thus, the informal online economy in
urban Philadelphia should be viewed critically and seen as connected to –and a
consequence of – broader patterns of governmental restructuring that are happening
alongside labor shifts within the information economy. And I want to flag that while the
work practices I have described in this chapter reflected creativity and contributed

259
cultural value, liquid laborers were highly vulnerable to exploitation and wage loss or
wage theft (Andrejevic, 2008; Fuchs, 2010; Jarrett, 2015; Jenkins, 2006). However,
beyond that, I am arguing in this project that while middle and upper-class digital
laborers generating economic value online through blogs or engagement on Facebook
may be exploited (Duffy, 2015; Fortunati, 2011; Jarrett, 2015), the stakes are clearly
higher for liquid laborers like Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron who are struggling to survive
and feed and clothe their families. Therefore, it is important to consider how issues of
class and digital access interact with –and influence –digital labor practices and the
materialist dimensions of risk-taking.
It is also important to highlight that some liquid laborers like Deric accessed
KEYSPOTs for social support services as well as computer access. So, though broadband
access and skills programs like KEYSPOTs have provided communities impacted by the
urban crisis with badly needed resources, the “access” and “skills” policy focus has also
overlooked the useful social support dimension of KEYSPOTs. This focal point has also
obscured other barriers to economic opportunity, like lack of access to startup capital or
even access to affordable childcare or healthcare. Along these lines, as Tufecki (2012)
points out, broadband programs cannot generate good jobs where they are none and as
Straubhaar et al. (2012) notes, such programs also cannot substitute for social or cultural
capital. Said differently, while technological development – including developing digital
access and skills –is a key component of a thriving urban economy, it cannot replace
durable support institutions or a robust welfare state infrastructure.
In closing, I submit that the revival of survivalist informal economies in large
U.S. cities like Philadelphia over the last 40 years suggests that informal work has been

260
tied to the changing relationship between capital and labor in liquid modernity (Sassen Koob, 1989; Sugrue, 2005; Wilson, 1996). However, the merging of the digital and street
survivalist economies is a relatively new phenomenon, one that can perhaps help critical
media scholars consider new areas of possible labor exploitation, as the low-tech majority
generates massive wealth for the high-tech minority (Rumberger & Levin, 1985). In
addition to the shift to ICTs and the growing digital workforce divide (Rodino-Colocino,
2006), I have investigated the broader trends that have contributed to this informalization
process, including globalization, neoliberalism, decreased union protections and the
rollback of social programs. And as I am arguing here, simultaneously, the degradation of
reproductive labor along class, racial and economic lines has likewise reshaped working
arrangements and the work practices of poor and working class urban Americans. Thus, I
am proposing the rise of liquid labor – a type of highly precarious, flexible, classed
digital labor –as a framework to better understand the complex issues surrounding the
restructuring of the relations between capital and labor in America’s modern
informational cities. In the following chapter, I will offer some concluding thoughts on
this project, but also consider areas of possible resistance, interventions, and future
research directions.

261
Chapter 8
Conclusion: Liquid Labor, Precarious Lives
Introduction
When I asked Ron if he had any advice on how to become a successful liquid
laborer and survive in the uncertain urban information economy, Ron responded that to
be effective, the “number one skill is you have to be coachable.” He elaborated on his
point to suggest that in the contemporary information economy, you must be constantly
learning new skills – technological and otherwise –and expanding your opportunities.
Nothing is guaranteed anymore and nothing is solid. As steady opportunities in the
formal sector dwindle, the precarious flexible economy expands. To survive in these
difficult conditions, as Ron proposes, one must be in a state of perpetual evolution, easily
taught and trained to do something better. In other words, like Joanne, Sky, Deric or Ron,
in the era of liquid modernity you cannot rely on durable institutions, so you alone must
make economic opportunities with whatever tools are available.
Given the complicated portrait I have painted in this dissertation of precarious life
in the formal and informal urban economies, where do we go from here? What are the
possible interventions and solutions to the problems I have carefully outlined in this
study? In this closing chapter, first, I will sum up my key arguments from this
dissertation and briefly review my framework of liquid labor. Second, I will outline my
intended contribution to academic scholarship in the research areas of digital labor and
the digital divide. Third, I will explore possible extensions of this dissertation to pursue in
the future. Fourth, I will consider possible interventions and areas of resistance. Finally, I
will offer a personal reflection and deliver some concluding thoughts on the project.

262
Overview of Project
To summarize they key arguments I have advanced in this dissertation, as stated
in Chapter 1, the primary purpose of this study was to better understand the economic
lives of poor and working class BTOP participants. More particularly, I sought to also
investigate why and how “liquid labor” strategies were utilized by participants like
Joanne, particularly in the context of a federal broadband project like BTOP that was
focused on recovery and economic enhancement in the wake of the Great Recession of
2008 in Philadelphia. I proposed “liquid labor” as a framework for understanding the
transitioning relationships between work, class, technology and inequality. I argued that
in a global information economy marked by the breakdown of durable institutions – and
facing poor prospects in the formal sector – participants like Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron
navigated informal sources to make ends meet. Further, I specified that these issues are
also framed by social support needs – for instance, Dinah gained a job through
KEYSPOTs but still required food stamps (SNAP). I asserted that whereas many digital
divide scholars and federal policymakers have centered on technological “access” or
“skills” as a path to economic opportunity for low-income Americans, this overlooks how
technology practically fits into the everyday lives of KEYSPOT visitors like Joanne and
Mr. Wilson. In short, a failure to appreciate the on-the-ground economic realities facing
urban Americans has resulted in a problematic disconnect between policy visions and
program practices, or gap between the policymakers and the “policytakers.”
Along these lines, this study had four chief objectives. First, I analyzed how
“work” – as it related to poor and working-class Americans –was discussed in BTOP
materials and how the “goals” of digital labor were being presented and developed.

263
Second, I investigated the impediments to finding formal work and tried to understand in
what fields and sectors KEYSPOT participants were gaining jobs. Third, I explored the
disconnects between how “work” was defined and what work was obtained through
KEYSPOTs, focusing on the more “invisible” dimensions of urban labor. Following from
this, I sought to contextualize the changing relationship between informal labor and the
contemporary information economy among the urban working class. Thus, having briefly
outlined the project’s key objectives, I will now turn to review the data collection
processes, methodology and theoretical framework I employed to investigate these
research questions.
Data Collection, Methodology and Theoretical Framework
Having reviewed my research focus, I will turn now to my data collection
procedures and practices. As I presented in Chapter 1, this ethnographic study was based
on 400 hours of participant observation in BTOP funded “KEYSPOTs,” i.e. public
computer centers (PCC) and broadband adoption training programs (SBA). I also
conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with participants and staff and collected 150
documents pertaining to the KEYSPOTs. As also explained in Chapter 1, Philadelphia
and the KEYSPOTs program in the post Great Recession period provided a rich research
site for the study of “liquid labor” practices, as the city had an unusually high rate of
poverty coupled with a low broadband penetration rate. The KEYSPOT program’s
embedded design granted me access to a diverse subset of working class families.
Positioning my study of “liquid labor” within a larger technology policy framework
revealed a more complex picture of the relationship between poverty, digital inequality
and economic opportunity.

264
As I addressed in Chapter 1, uncovering informal digital labor practices required
time, but more importantly, necessitated gaining the trust of participants. As a
methodology, ethnography allowed me time and space to attempt to capture this
complexity. As ethnographic research seeks to study people within their environments,
gaining rapport and trust was vital to the data collection process (Emerson, Fretz & Shaw,
2011). Notably, these social interactions directly shaped the type of data I obtained. For
instance, I took on very gendered roles in the fieldsites to gain that participant trust,
cleaning computers, making coffee and caring for children. In this way, I want to
underline again that my stance as a researcher and my own subjectivity was intimately
tied to this project and granted me a unique access point to learn more about reproductive
labor in the lives of my participants. Regarding my theoretical framework, the analysis of
my ethnographic data was structured by critical theory, drawing on Marxist feminism’s
conception of “reproductive labor,” Bauman’s (2000) sociological arguments on “liquid
modernity,” and Mosco’s (2004) cultural arguments regarding “digital myths.” These
three theoretical planks provided direction and structure to my primary findings.
Primary Findings
In brief, there were four key interconnected findings in this project that I will
herein summarize. First, I argued in this dissertation that there is a disconnect between
the policymakers designing broadband programs and the “policytakers” to whom the
programs are targeted. Thus, misled by the “myth of the digital sublime,” (Mosco, 2004),
policymakers embraced the neoliberal view that ICTs were a cheap and efficient solution
to complex urban problems. On this point, I also emphasized the ways in which ICTs are
uniquely classed. For instance, Mr. Wilson rejected broadband not due to

265
“technophobia,” but because he viewed computerization and automation as directly
responsible for his job loss at the bowling alley, whereas Tiara communicated a concern
that social media exposed her to hiring discrimination (Digital Impact, 2009). To my
second finding, I determined that although programs like KEYSPOTs have endeavored to
connect low-income Philadelphians to jobs through digital access and skills, the types of
formal sector jobs available to participants were low-skilled, low-wage and low-status
and particularly inflexible to parents. Regarding the formal sector challenges facing my
participants, some participants like Ms. Ramirez were forced into a dead-end cycle of
chronic part-time work due to a lack of access to social support programs such as
Medicaid. Thus, to my third point, given these formidable impediments in the formal
sector, some participants instead pursued flexible, low financial risk opportunities in the
informal sector. Finally, I suggested that the rise and frequency of these informal
arrangements may signal a changing relationship between capital and urban labor. To
elaborate, my research indicated that existing street economics are being reshaped by the
introductions of ICTs. Yet, more broadly, I contended that the breakdown of durable
support institutions, degradation of reproductive labor and introduction of ICTs are some
of the forces interacting to generate these new working arrangements along class lines
(Bauman, 2000). In brief, this space of “liquid labor” marks a new terrain of struggle that
moves beyond issues of technological development but, more importantly, economic
equality and community infrastructure. Having briefly sketched out these main
contributions, I will now turn to a more detailed final discussion and review of each
major finding.

266
Broadband Policy and the Goals of Digital Labor
As discussed in Chapter 4, the ARRA and the resultant BTOP programs were
engineered with the objective of stimulating the economy and creating jobs in the wake
of the Great Recession. Yet, as I have argued elsewhere, there was a disconnect between
the federal economic policy visions and implementation in local KEYSPOTs. More
specifically, in the Philadelphia program, the goals of economic development were built
through federal visions, outlined by BTOP, refined by the Philadelphia FRP partners,
guided by the private sector and somewhat complicated by marketing efforts. Most
interestingly, the communities targeted for BTOP funds – those communities on the
wrong side of the digital divide – pushed back on the federal and/or technology industry
visions that prioritized workforce development over political engagement. This
disconnect between vision, goals and reality can also be understood as the space of
“unintended consequences” where informal digital labor practices emerged.
Yet, in tracing the longer history of digital programs and the urban crisis in
Philadelphia in Chapter 5, I also highlighted the ways in which social, economic, and
political forces shaped city visions and plans for broadband access prior to KEYSPOTs –
and how federal, state and city policy further constrained economic opportunities for poor
families of color in Philadelphia. These forces were aided by the discourses of
neoliberalism, which focused on poverty as an individual problem; in effect, this focus
obscured the role of structural issues (like lack of educational access) in limiting
opportunity. In short, here I demonstrated that “liquid labor” or informalized work has
not occurred in a vacuum, but was the result of federal and local policies that prioritized
the market or “development” at the expense of the urban poor, exacerbating trends of

267
digital exclusion, economic isolation and racial segregation. In all these ways – contrary
to the “myth of the digital sublime” articulated by The Arnold Group Report (2011) or
KEYSPOT partner Jay–I emphasized that technology is not an easy or inexpensive
solution to the problems facing urban America. In a related vein, programs like
KEYSPOTs do not allow for further welfare state retrenchment. For instance, Dinah
obtained a job through KEYSPOTs, yet still needed foodstamps (SNAP). Additionally,
my participant Deric visited the KEYSPOT to find clothing and other necessary items for
his infant son. So, while broadband programs and digital infrastructures are an important
dimension of the urban economy, they cannot (and should not) substitute for or replace
durable social support institutions (Bauman, 2000; Mosco, 2004).
Impediments to the Formal Workforce
Having touched on the labor policy discourses surrounding BTOP, what
workforce training was offered and what jobs were obtained by participants? As I
presented in Chapter 6, KEYSPOTs primarily focused on the role of technology in
facilitating the job search process and incorporated both hard and soft digital skills into
the training courses for workforce development. Overall, the KEYSPOT program was
successful at connecting some job-seekers to formal sector work. Yet, the opportunities
available to KEYSPOT visitors were more likely to be in reproductive labor fields, such
as carework or domestic work. These formal sector opportunities – as the job-postings
seeking a maid and hospital cook demonstrated – were often precarious, part-time or
contracted. Additionally, the jobs did not provide a living wage, offered no benefits, and
required undesirable working hours that were inflexible for parents. Said differently,
although participants obtained jobs through KEYSPOTs, many continued to rely on

268
social support programs. In the absence of full-time work, participants like Ms. Ramirez
and Sky with significant family responsibilities lacking access to programs like Medicaid
permanently juggled part-time formal and informal sector opportunities. Their
experiences underscore how the breakdown of durable social support institutions and the
shift to precarious, part-time work has dramatically reshaped the economic lives of urban
families in America (Bauman, 2000).
To return to the KEYSPOT programs, whereas hard and soft digital skills were
necessary to apply online to these available jobs, advanced digital skills were not always
requirements for the positions available to participants. For instance, the job postings
seeking a hotel housekeeper and hospital cook did not reference digital skills, asking only
for applicants with basic literacy skills. This raises additional questions on how the
“policymaker” vision of digital training may collide with workforce realities. I noted that
technology itself also posed unique “classed” challenges to KEYSPOT job seekers. To
elaborate, KEYSPOT participants were more likely to encounter difficulty applying to
jobs online simply because credit checks can now easily sort out low-income jobs
seekers. Additionally, participants like Ron and Tiara remarked that they felt pressured to
submit to invasive social media applicant screening practices; Tiara even underscored
that new technologies could increase racial or gender hiring discrimination. In all these
ways, the myriad impediments to locating well-paying formal sector work begin to bring
into focus the complex challenges facing BTOP job-seekers. These impediments likewise
frame the conditions under which informal work became, for some, a necessity.

269
The Rise of Informal, Precarious Online Labor
Building on these insights regarding formal work and technological relationships,
in Chapter 7 I argued that liquid laborers like Joanne, Deric, Sky and Ron all arrived at
the informal economy due to their need for supplemental income in the absence of highskill, high-status job opportunities in the formal sector and their reproductive labor
responsibilities. I noted that each participant had obtained advanced hard and soft
technological skills, yet was unable to find good work. Thus, each applied those digital
skills toward ventures in the informal sector. The income Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron
obtained from their ventures was often a small infusion of cash rather than a predictable,
steady income. Yet, the digital economy was desirable because it was flexible for parents,
requiring little financial risk and up-front investment; it was also unpoliced, in contrast to
street economies. While some, like Joanne, would have wanted to establish a formal
business, structural factors like a lack of credit history or economic collateral were
prohibitive. Because participants needed to control economic risks as they did not have
access to capital, they assumed other risks: liquid laborers invested substantial time into
their enterprises without knowing if it would ever translate to income and faced multiple
forms of exploitation. Liquid laborer, Sky, was hopeful that her modeling work would
convert to a full-time opportunity whereas Deric was more pessimistic, citing lack of
social contacts and money as a barrier to formal work in the music industry. However,
most importantly, I would point out that these liquid labor practices did not translate to
increased financial security or economic mobility.
In short, rather than see these liquid labor opportunities as enhancing economic
opportunities for participants, I have underscored that these digital practices were one

270
tool in a larger set of urban economic survival strategies. For instance, despite their best
efforts in the informal (and formal) sectors, participants like Dinah, Sky and Deric still
required the aid of social support programs to survive, services each KEYSPOT could
help them locate. And consequently, participants were likely to be subjected to
exploitative arrangements in which established companies or more powerful interests
reaped revenue from their creative endeavors. For instance, Amazon.com only
compensated Joanne when her e-book sales met a certain threshold of several hundred
dollars. In the same way, ClubCreate only compensated Deric when his beats were
widely shared online. Liquid laborers were offered no benefits or contracts to protect
their work, their time, or their creative products. In fact, Sky was underpaid for her
modeling gig, but was without recourse. And it was unclear what intellectual property
rights Deric retained over the digital beats generated on the ClubCreate site. So, although
“liquid labor” incorporated creative components and the materials produced have cultural
value, it is important to situate the practices within a critique of advanced informational
capitalism.
Changing Relationships Between Capital, Class, Urban Labor and Technology
In the wake of retrenchment and the urban crisis in Philadelphia, I have asserted
that the informal economy offered poor and working-class parents and caregivers a
source of supplemental income many once received through welfare and social programs.
Thus, the informal economy in urban Philadelphia should be viewed critically and seen as
connected to –and a consequence of – broader patterns of governmental restructuring
happening alongside the shift to the information economy. So, although broadband access
and skills programs have provided urban communities impacted by Great Recession with

271
badly needed resources, the “access” and “skills” policy focus has overlooked the vital
social function of KEYSPOTs in addition to the other barriers to economic opportunity.
In the same way, this focus has too often incorporated the myth of the “digital sublime”
which suggests that digital tools can deliver a route out of poverty, even though – as I
have demonstrated in this project –the jobs available to KEYSPOT participants were lowskilled, low-wage and low-status (Mosco, 2004). It is also notable that lack of childcare
access was a significant impediment for the participants visiting labs, yet this is a very
practical dimension invisible in BTOP policy. So, to highlight my wider point, while
technological development is a key component of a thriving urban economy, it cannot
substitute for social support structures like state supported childcare, enable further
retrenchment of the welfare state, or provide an easy path out of poverty.
Finally, I have suggested that the revival of the survivalist informal economies in
large U.S. cities like Philadelphia over the last 40 years strongly suggests that informal
work is tied to the changing relationship between capital and labor in the wake of urban
deindustrialization (Sassen-Koob, 1989; Sugrue, 2005; Wilson, 1996). As access to good
paying jobs in the formal sector evaporate, the informal economy has expanded to absorb
some of these displaced workers. Although I am not arguing that survivalist economies
are a new feature of urban life, I do assert that the merging of the digital and street
survivalist economies is a relatively new phenomenon. Examining the fusion of street and
digital economies helps us consider new areas of possible exploitation, as liquid laborers
like Joanne and Deric collectively generate massive wealth for the high-tech minority
(Rumberger & Levin, 1985). In addition to a growing digital workforce divide (RodinoColocino, 2006), I have discussed other trends that have contributed to the process of

272
informalization, such as patterns of globalization, decreased union protections and the
degradation of reproductive labor along class, racial and gender lines. Following from
this, I have proposed the rise of “liquid labor” as a framework for understanding the
complex issues surrounding the restructuring of the relations between capital, class and
labor in America’s modern informational cities.
My Framework: Liquid Labor, Precarious Lives
To synthesize these key findings and hone in on my intended contribution to the
field, I have proposed “liquid labor” as a framework for understanding the transitioning
relationships between work, technology and inequality. To elaborate, when one considers
the shift between how work was defined in the previous industrial economic period
(formal, waged, unionized) and the work in the modern information economy (flexible,
unwaged, self-directed), I suggest that the emergence of informal digital strategies –
especially among the working urban poor in advanced economies who face financial
pressure due to policies of retrenchment –becomes more predictable. Beyond Bauman’s
(2000) conception discussed in Chapter 2, I find “liquid” to be a useful term because in
economics, liquid assets are those that can be easily converted to cash – participants like
Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron relied heavily on small cash transactions to maintain
flexibility and limit financial risk. Second, in contrast to “immaterial” labor, participants
like Joanne produced both material and immaterial goods, so this dissolves the
boundaries between what is “immaterial” and “material.” Third, as both Bauman (2000)
and Castells (1989) argue, the expansion of digital information technologies have allowed
capital to easily flow across borders, fleeing protected workers to seek cheaper global
labor. Lastly, liquid labor resonates with Devey et al.’s (2006) concept of churn, or the

273
process whereby precarious workers rapidly enter and exit the formal and informal labor
markets, but never gain stable economic footing. However, most broadly, “liquid”
captures the characteristics of the new flexible, precarious urban worker, who must take
on new shapes and new skills to survive and support their families in the digital era. This
term also intends to draw attention to the materialist dimensions of risk-taking in the new
economy, more specifically the way in which flexible labor can cause special pressures or
limitations across class, race or gender lines.
My Contribution
I contend that this study can make a contribution to the literature on digital labor
and digital inequality within the field of media studies. Bringing the extant digital
inequality and digital workforce divide literature into conversation with the literature on
immaterial and affective labor can offer a new vantage point to conceptualize digital
work practices. For example, first I suggested that for poor and working-class parents like
Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron, reliance on the digital economy as a survival strategy in a
turbulent economy is a different type of interaction than, for example, middle and upperclass users generating “immaterial labor” for online games or social media. Said
differently, studies investigating how middle or upper-class users create economic value
(for companies) or are exploited through games, Facebook, or Twitter analyze different
kinds of immaterial labor. I therefore locate a different type of interaction that is shaped
by access to ICTs, but also social and class position.
Second, this project is in conversation with the critical digital divide literature, as
it complicates the “access” and “skills” policy focus. Said another way, applying Mosco’s
(2004) “digital myths,” I have underscored that programs like BTOP can unintentionally

274
frame broadband as a means to further retrench the welfare state. The “access” and
“skills” concentration can also overlook the practical structural issues (like lack of
childcare access) that constrain an individual’s ability to participate in ICTs courses as
well as economic opportunity more broadly. This emphasis likewise fails to consider the
role ICTs have played in diminishing opportunities for poor and working-class laborers
like Mr. Wilson. Building on this, I insist that it is important to appreciate the ways in
which class position shapes attitudes and interactions with technology. Finally, I have
charted the tensions between policymakers and “policytakers” – a tension between
“prosperity” and “participation” –through my analysis of KEYSPOTs (Schement, 2009).
As a final intended contribution, I have proposed that the framework of “liquid
labor” charts the rise of precarious, hyper-exploited work in the contemporary
information economy. Said differently, it captures the changing contours of the urban
economy and the characteristics of the new urban digital working class. The framework
likewise considers how the breakdown of social support institutions has destabilized the
working class who, without jobs or security, must become “flexible” (Bauman, 2000;
Sennett, 1998) and float in and out of the formal and informal economies. Having
discussed these areas of contribution, I will now turn to future areas of research and ways
to extend and enrich this line of inquiry.
Future Research
Given that I have reviewed my key findings and areas of intended contribution,
what are the next steps for this research? How can I continue to develop this project and
my scholarship more broadly? There are multiple areas of research that can extend and
compliment this project, however, I will briefly touch on three potential lines of inquiry.

275
To begin, first, I could extend this project by refocusing more concretely on the class
dimensions of these findings, delving more deeply into this “liquid labor” as a form of
exploited and alienated labor. I could also compliment this project by examining how the
intersections of informalization, the digital workforce divide (Rodino-Colocino, 2006)
and the degradation of reproductive labor impact a different group of precarious digital
laborers. Finally, I could reexamine these liquid labor practices through a political and
cultural lens, assessing the role of digital programs in developing new cultural forms and
deeper community engagement to push back on the economic changes (such as the
decline of unions) that have reshaped economic opportunities. Having sketched out these
three future research extensions, I will now describe and consider these three possible
areas of future research in more detail.
Digital Inequality and the Working Class
When I began this study, my intention was to investigate the informal – “liquid
labor” practices. Why were they occurring, especially in a program like KEYSPOTs? In
the process of analyzing the data and building and revising a framework to attempt to
capture these broader changes in the urban economy – in part, resulting from the
introduction of ICTs – I discovered how significantly the rollback of social support
programs and lack of access to childcare was shaping the economic lives of urban
families. I then began to understand how the rise of part-time jobs, declining union
support, and lack of job benefits was making it nearly impossible for families to make
ends meet through the formal sector alone. Though I have attempted to capture the
layered factors shaping the economic lives of my participants – with “liquid labor”
strategies serving as one tool in a larger set of survival strategies – it seems clear that this

276
is just the tip of the iceberg. How can I dig in and build on these practices as “survival
strategies”? Furthermore, while this research was conducted during the Obama
administration, given the current Trump administration’s priorities to further retrench the
welfare state and slash programs like Medicaid, I predict that the reliance of “liquid
labor” in urban communities will, sadly, only intensify. Thus, developing this framework
may only be more relevant given the country’s new policy direction.
That being stated, moving forward, I could more closely examine these “layers”
to expand this framework. As one “layer” I might extend, this research has raised a
broader question about the connections between these programs and the formal labor
market. In other words, as this study focused more on participants who engaged in
informal labor practices, at the beginning it did not as closely address the types of jobs
that participants obtain through these programs. My initial research suggested that these
jobs are in fields like carework, domestic work and service work. Yet, for those that do
obtain jobs, what are their experiences in those roles, specifically in relation to
technology? If they continue to require social support, how long is that support needed?
A multi-methodological study that utilized ethnography as well as survey data could
possibly yield more insight into the long-term impact of digital training programs and the
experiences of these workers in the formal sector as well as the informal sector. More
importantly, further development could yield more insights into role of social class
specifically in structuring these opportunities and interactions. I might also consider this
labor as a form of highly exploited, alienated labor and situate this project within a
broader Marxist analysis of the trends of precariousness and informalization. In short, this
first future direction would serve to deepen and update my research.

277
Reproductive Labor and the High-Tech Industry
However, to change directions, I could also shift to an approach that could shed
light on a different set of precarious laborers. As I briefly discussed in the context of the
literature review in Chapter 3, reproductive laborers are also increasingly offered as
“perks” to elite technology sector employees, laboring as housekeepers, nannies, or
providing meals (Ritchel, 2012). This rise in reproductive labor as a “perk” for
professionals in the technology sector intersects with the broader argument I developed in
this project, as it underscores the growing digital workforce divide (Rodino-Colocino,
2006) but also how reproductive labor is degraded along race, glass and gender lines. For
example, on average, these carework positions are dominated by women of color and
immigrants (Dyer-Witheford, 1999). These types of reproductive labor positions are also
increasingly informalized and do not afford salaries, health benefits, paid leave,
retirement plans, or union protections (Dyer-Witheford, 1999). A future ethnographic or
qualitative study could explore the economic lives of these precarious workers supporting
the technology industry, not only describing their experiences, but investigating the
arrangements between these reproductive laborers and the tech firms they serve. A
project of this type could not only contribute another view of the digital workforce
divide, but it could also provide more insight into the evolving relationship between
precarious tech-sector work, reproductive labor and social class. In this way, a study of
this type of study would not be so much a direct extension of this project, but an
important compliment investigating similar research questions, among a different class of
precarious informalized laborers.

278
Neoliberal Work and the Creative Dimension of Informal Labor
As a third area for future inquiry, liquid laborers like Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron
repeatedly expressed to me their interest in creative endeavors. Joanne considered herself
a writer and artist. Sky was an aspiring model and had hopes to become a fashion
designer. Deric loved music. Ron was a trained artist with graphic design experience. In
short, all four participants communicated their desire to engage in more flexible – but
also more fulfilling and creative –work. This harkens back to the conclusions reached by
digital labor scholars such as Bulut (2014) and Duffy (2015) in their study of video game
testers and fashion bloggers respectively. They argued that their participants engaged in
digital work because they wanted a job they “loved” or felt “passionate” about. I would
suggest that this desire may only be heightened for poor and working-class individuals
who often occupy the most undesirable and unfulfilling formal sector jobs in the
contemporary information economy. In other words, how do the creative, hopeful or
aspirational dimensions of this labor play a role in motivating poor and working-class
participants to exit the formal economy? A greater investigation and attention to this
dimension could add a critical –and more nuanced –dimension to my argument on the
unique online work performed by the poor and working class.
Yet, as I revealed through the experience of Ron, discussion of the creative
dimension of labor was also yoked to participant consideration of the values of
neoliberalism. In other words, participants could simultaneously critique the structural
factors (like a poor educational system) that constrained their economic opportunity, yet
celebrate the neoliberal values of self-reliance. Ron expressed frustration that the
composition of formal sector opportunities available to him were “high demand, low

279
reward,” but found great comfort and inspiration in motivational speakers and self-help
books. These messages reassured Ron that with hard work and self-care, he could exit
poverty through “entrepreneurship.” Thus, rather than examining liquid labor practices
through a strictly economic lens, it could be fruitful to delve more deeply into the
relationship between liquid labor, “hope labor,” but more broadly the internalization of
neoliberal values and self-branding (Banet-Weiser, 2012; Kuehn & Horrigan, 2013). Said
differently, although I have included a discussion of the centrality of risk evaluation to
liquid practices through an economic focus, what are the deeper personal values that may
also shape a participant’s decision to engage informal work? Do the policymaker
neoliberal values influence –or intersect with— policytaker values? Or said another way,
how deep does the digital myth penetrate? So, while considering reproductive labor,
liquid modernity and digital myths contextualized participant economic motivations and
captured the changing shape of urban labor, it does account for or fully explain the
appearance of this “neoliberal” laborer. So, delving into these deeper motivations could
be either an extension or a compliment, depending on the findings and conclusions. In
short, these three areas offer some exciting possibilities and areas of inquiry that, while
outside the scope of the research questions in this dissertation, could potentially extend or
compliment this project.
Policy Priorities and Possibilities for Resistance
Also in the spirit of extending my research, although this critical dissertation has
focused heavily on the exploitative aspects of the formal and informal economy in the
context of a wider urban crisis, I think it is important to also attempt to translate these
lessons learned into possibilities for intervention or resistance. Said another way, while I

280
have painted a bleak portrait of the economic lives of many BTOP program participants, I
do believe there are great potentials for change. As some possible starting points, I argue
that these circumstances I have chronicled and critique could be improved, if: 1)
Precarious workers could become more organized through unionization or related efforts;
2) Urban social support programs were better funded; 3) Childcare needs become a
greater political priority; and, 4) Technology programs could again place equal emphasis
on the aspects of “prosperity” and “participation.” Having summarized the possible areas
of intervention and resistance, I will now move through these proposals in more detail.
Organizing Precarious Workers
To begin, I have highlighted in this study how labor market changes –including
globalization, an emerging digital workforce divide (Rodino-Colocino, 2006) and the
breakdown of unions –have increasingly left the poor and working class vulnerable to
exploitative working conditions. However, more recently some domestic grassroots labor
movements have gained traction and suggest a brighter potential future in organizing
precarious, isolated, or contract workers. For example, the “Justice for Janitors” coalition
in the 1990’s applied a variety of creative protest strategies aimed at exposing the
exploitative work practices of high-tech companies like Apple (Dyer-Witheford, 1999).
The tactics the “Justice for Janitors” coalition utilized included advertising campaigns but
also hunger strikes (Dyer-Witheford, 1999, p. 97). Yet, most notably, these campaigns
were successful because they forged cross-community alliances (Dyer-Witheford, 1999).
For instance, the “Justice for Janitors” campaign reached out to immigrant advocacy
groups and even environmental activists who were concerned about Apple’s waste
disposal practices (Dyer-Witheford, 1999). Thus, drawing interest groups to their cause,

281
the janitors’ movement gained more visibility and support and eventually won
renegotiations of their working conditions. This could be one potential model for
precarious workers to adopt.
Though these new configurations are promising, I would however point out that
globally dispersed and immigrant workers (particularly women) may face special
challenges in their future ability to organize (Kabeer, Milward & Sudarshan, 2013, p.
251). In their study of the organizing strategies of women and immigrants such as waste
pickers in Pune, India, Kabeer, Milward and Sudarshan (2013) argue that global
organizations can and should become more proactive in providing support resources to
informal, precarious global workers. To elaborate, they first point out that low-income
women engaging in informal work are often widely dispersed and that likewise their local
work conditions can vary greatly (Kabeer, Milward & Sudarshan, 2013, p. 258 – 259).
However, if transnational organizations can more deeply understand and appreciate the
changing landscape and characteristics of global work – and respond accordingly by
creating new configurations and approaches that can better connect the local with the
global– Kabeer, Milward and Sudarshan (2013) contend that it is possible that these
workers can more easily forge international cooperative unions. In other words, domestic
and global precarious U.S. workers may need to forge stronger connections across
struggles, apply a range of protest strategies, and utilize established non-governmental
organizations or other transnational bodies whenever possible. I would add here that this
cross-struggle movement building was also an approach utilized by Maria’s organization
as presented in Chapter 4 in my discussion of “policytakers.” Thus, I would emphasize
this approach as a potentially successful model for precarious local and global workers.

282
Strengthening Social Support Systems
As a second possible area for intervention, to aid precarious urban workers still
struggling after the Great Recession, federal and local governments must continue to
support – and expand – social support programs. More broadly, this study has repeatedly
demonstrated the vital role that the welfare state played in the economic lives of BTOP
participants. I have underscored through the lives of Ms. Ramirez and Sky how the lack
of access to needed resources or healthcare programs can dramatically alter a family’s
economic life, pushing some into chronic part-time work or even out of the formal sector
entirely. Whereas the political discourses of neoliberalism may suggest that those relying
on social programs are lazy “welfare queens,” this study has revealed that even when
low-income urban individuals obtain jobs, they may still require social programs (Bobo
& Smith 1994; Page & Shapiro 1992). Not to belabor the point, but because the jobs
available to these urban workers are increasingly part-time, they do not provide a living
wage and offer no benefits. These positions are also incredibly inflexible for parents, and
thus harm working families.
I reiterate these issues because they are of great concern at the present political
moment, as the Trump administration’s recently proposed 2017 budget would enact
draconian welfare state cuts. The current budget seeks to cut foodstamps (SNAP) by
29%, children’s health insurance by 19%, Medicaid by 17% and Temporary Assistance
for Needy Families (TANF) by 13% (Lu & Soffen, 2017). As I discussed in Chapter 3,
Edin and Lein (1997) argue that the economic survival strategies pursued by urban
families (including liquid labor) are influenced by neighborhood characteristics, family
social networks but, above all – social support resources (Edin & Lein, 1997, p. 146).

283
Said differently, a family’s survival strategies must be altered anytime support services
are cut or reduced, therefore even small policy changes can generate an incredible
amount of family instability. Without welfare state protections, struggling families who
cannot draw on other resources (like family networks) may not be able to meet their most
basic needs. In short, I have underscored in this dissertation how the retrenchment of the
welfare state can have a ripple effect throughout the entire urban economy, hastening
community economic collapse but also impacting the overall financial health of U.S.
cities.
In addition to the proposed welfare state cuts discussed above, the Trump
administration’s 2017 budget would also seek to introduce stringent work requirements to
receive benefits like foodstamps (SNAP) and even possibly Medicaid (Alcindor, 2017).
As discussed earlier, previous research has demonstrated that parents leaving the welfare
system for workfare often continue to live near poverty levels, as they only have access to
jobs that are strict, low-status and low-paying (Acker, Morgen, Heath, Barry, Gonzalez &
Weigt, 2001; Boushey, Brocht, Gundersen, Bernstein 2001; Cancian, Haveman, Meyeter
& Wolfe; 2002; London, Scott & Hunter, 2004; Morgen, Acker, Weigt & Gonzalez,
2006). Therefore, rather than translate into higher workforce participation or spurring
economic growth, programs like workfare can worsen labor “churn” as poor and
working-class individuals cycle in and out of the bottom of the labor market (Collins,
2008, p. 140; Daly, 2003; Devey et al., 2006). Bernstein and Spielberg (2017) rightly
point out that Medicaid in fact enables work, as it can provide the treatment necessary for
sick or injured patients to return to their jobs. To cite an example from my study, Ms.
Ramirez directly explained that she became unable to work certain jobs due to lack of

284
access to healthcare to treat her disability. Said another way, healthcare was a major
determining factor in her entrance chronic part-time work, pushing her and her mother
into deeper financial hardship and struggle.
Given that the trends such as automation, computerization and globalization will
only continue to change the economic landscape in America’s cities, the government can
and should find ways to respond to current workforce realities. Because, at the present
time, many urban workers simply do not have access to stable, full-time jobs with
benefits. If the welfare state continues to be retrenched and workfare is embraced– as
seems very possible given the goals of the Trump administration – we can expect more
labor instability and hardship for America’s poorest families and patterns of wealth
inequality to only intensify (Lu & Soffen, 2017). For as this project has begun to
demonstrate, lack of access to social support is one of the major determining factors of
“liquid labor” and can cause individuals to become loosened or detached from the formal
economy altogether (Wilson, 2011). In this way, social support programs should be
understood by policymakers as integral to a healthy economy: when families are unable
to access these resources, they are more likely to be pushed into “survival circuits” that
never lead to financial stability and exacerbate labor churn (Devey et al., 2006; Sassen,
2003). This has a long-term effect on the health and productivity of urban economies
overall.
Affordable Childcare and State-Supported Reproductive Labor
Building on this, as an extension to the need for social programs, another major
factor that determines the economic lives of urban Philadelphians is access to childcare.
So, whereas trends in globalization, computerization and automation have had a

285
significant financial impact on urban families, at the same time, profound shifts in
reproductive labor and childcare support have generated and motivated a new set of
working arrangements. Each of the liquid laborers I have introduced in this dissertation –
Joanne, Sky, Deric and Ron – entered the informal sector due to the flexibility it could
provide them as parents. In contrast, the formal sector jobs available to poor and
working-class job seekers through KEYSPOTs were the least flexible to parents, and the
opportunities did not offer benefits parents desperately needed like healthcare, maternity
leave or personal days. In some cases, parents in these types of low-skilled formal sector
positions could even risk being fired for taking a day off to care for a sick child (Edin &
Lein, 1997). Therefore, childcare access (or lack thereof) can directly contribute to
working arrangements but also the process of churn, as parents may be hired and fired
frequently from low-wage jobs due to reproductive labor needs (Devey et al., 2006).
Thus, lack of welfare and childcare support, when combined together, can have a
devastating financial impact on urban families.
These childcare challenges facing the working class will only be compounded if
the Trump administration follows through on its objective to implement additional
workfare requirements to access social programs (Alcindor, 2017). As family members
take on more work, they will necessarily incur additional expenses, including the cost of
childcare (Edin & Lein, 1997). For some families, the cost of childcare could even meet
or exceed wages earned from low-skilled jobs. It is important to note that workfare
requirements and lack of access to childcare support tend to cause special hardships for
single female-headed households (Gingrich, 2010). Indeed, in my study, Deric and Ron
both had the help of a partner whereas Joanne and Sky were single caregivers in their

286
family. In other words, new workfare requirements would target the most vulnerable lowincome families, particularly poor single mothers, pushing many into deeper into
financial hardship.
Whereas workfare shifts and the discourses of neoliberalism have framed
childcare as a “personal” problem, as Khimm (2015) points out, it is also an economic
and policy problem. Since the 1980’s, although the costs of childcare have doubled,
careworker pay has remained flat (Roberts, 2013). Families in deep poverty are now
spending approximately 30% of their overall income on childcare (Roberts, 2013). At the
same time, the instabilities generated by lack of affordable care cost the economy up to
$3 billion annually and the rising costs also dampen consumer discretionary spending
(Knowledge@Wharton, 2014). In this way, reproductive labor is the “invisible driver” of
the economy, not only in that it reproduces the next generation of workers, but also as a
major potential drag on overall U.S. long-term economic health (Knowledge@Wharton,
2014, para 8). So, whereas state supported childcare programs would likely have a
positive net effect on the total U.S. economy, I suggest that such programs would have
the most potential to impact and lift up low-income families. I would also point out that
KEYSPOT visitors throughout my two years in the field also communicated that lack of
access to childcare was a significant barrier to taking classes or visiting the lab. And one
of my key “jobs” in the sites was, in fact, to help parents look after their children. Thus,
even more practically, broadband programs that do not consider these types of limitations
can neglect key target populations.

287
Technological Investment: Participation
So, having discussed organizing, social support programs and state supported
childcare as places for intervention in the lives of low-income urban workers, I will now
pivot to the role that I think technology can play in this process. In this dissertation, I
have critiqued the policymaker stance and the “access” and “skills” focus in broadband
programs. Yet, I want to emphasize that KEYSPOTs were valuable community resources
far beyond the dimensions of “prosperity” and economic uplift. The KEYSPOTs were
sites where participants could email friends and family around the globe, read the news,
search for an apartment, play video games, find new recipes or complete an online
college course. More broadly, KEYSPOTS were central community sites where
participants gathered to meet neighbors, attend lectures and meetings, or simply escape
the cold. In some cases, they doubled as arts and cultural centers, as KEYSPOT training
programs taught a range of creative skills as well including video production, music
production, and digital photography. Because the KEYSPOTs were embedded in the
city’s existing social service infrastructure, these were also vital material resource centers
for participants like Deric who needed clothing for his infant son and Sky who needed
access to healthcare services (Wolfson & Crowell, 2013). In the afternoons when the labs
were closed at the North Philadelphia faith-based KEYSPOT, preschoolers enrolled in
the daycare program pulled their mats and blankets into the dark places beneath the
computers to sleep. Technology was not assigned its own separate space; in fact, the
funding BTOP provided allowed the Freedom Ring Partnership host organizations to
offer more to their communities, building new programs or strengthening established
ones.

288
Given these multifaceted aspects of KEYSPOTs, I therefore suggest that a policy
focus on the dimension of “prosperity” can overlook these key functions of KEYSPOTs
in connecting and enriching communities. So, although the KEYSPOT infrastructure had
a clear technological basis, it was also a social infrastructure (Wolfson & Crowell, 2013).
Quite significantly, KEYSPOTs played a role in promoting political engagement, or the
“participation” dimension to recall my arguments in Chapter 4 (Schement, 2009). To
elaborate on this point, the Pennsylvania voter ID regulations were under judicial review
during the 2012 U.S. presidential election cycle and KEYSPOTs served as a place to
distribute and discuss information regarding electoral participation for many poor and
working-class Philadelphians (Bronner, 2012). In fact, KEYSPOTs throughout
Philadelphia distributed yellow leaflets entitled, “Do you want to vote on election day?”
and posted official announcements on walls, doors, or tacked them up on computer lab
bulletin boards. Printed and posted materials offered details on the new state voting
requirements, such as proof of citizenship, residency in PA, and not presently
incarcerated. Participants conferred with digital trainers and computer lab assistants on
the Voter ID policies throughout city’s KEYSPOTs. Additionally, visitors graded the
presidential debates, argued over policy platforms and discussed the economic issues they
personally faced and issues in their communities. What is important here is that beyond
the formal politically focused training courses I discussed in Chapter 4, KEYSPOTs were
also informal spaces that promoted deeper political participation and information sharing.
Why are these community engagement spaces necessary – or relevant – to the
question of improving economic conditions? Alongside the digital trainer, Maria, I
introduced in Chapter 4, I argue that the proliferation of low-wage, precarious work is not

289
simply an economic issue, but rather a political and social one. The exploitative working
conditions facing poor and working-class Philadelphians in the aftermath of the Great
Recession of 2008 are related to a broader restructuring of the relations between capital
and labor in the contemporary information economy. While this is a problem formed, in
part, by technological tools, it is also intimately connected to the breakdown of unions,
the retrenchment of the welfare state and reproductive labor needs. Thus, it will be
necessary to for poor and working-class communities to continue to have access to spaces
like KEYSPOTs to seek information, but also to mobilize voters, organize for labor rights
and to improve worker protections. In other words, technology does have a vital role yet
to play in the uplift and economic empowerment in low-income communities, yet it can
and should go beyond digital “access” and “skills.” I suggest that returning a balance
between the twin goals of economic “prosperity” and political “participation” is needed,
as the economic challenges facing those on the other side of the digital divide are deeply
enmeshed in neoliberal capitalism (Schement, 2009). Said differently, economic change
will be catalyzed by political change.
Final Personal Reflection
In closing, although these two KEYSPOT staff members – Maria and Evelyn –
were not significantly featured in this dissertation, two statements they made during
personal interviews encapsulate the tensions and challenges facing federal broadband
programs like BTOP, particularly between the priorities of “prosperity” versus
“participation” I have highlighted above (Schement, 2009). Though the interviews were
initially focused on questions around skills training and workforce development, both
participants repeatedly veered away from these topics in our discussions, and they each

290
insisted that political participation and community building should be the chief focus of
technology training. When I asked Maria if she ever discussed the “digital divide” with
the students in her classes, Maria pushed back on the entire conception of a “digital
divide” altogether, pointing out that “policytakers” on the ground often do not
differentiate between divides of internet access and economic divides. Subsequently,
Maria explained that in her course, she talked with the students about the role of training,
more generally, in facilitating political engagement. Maria clarified:
We looked at the digital divide a little bit. But, it was not like….there is this
way where it is made into this big thing in [and] of itself. It is also like, if you just
step back a little bit – it is okay, yeah. People who are poor do not have heat
and they also do not have internet! It did not really seem like there was that
much to kind of study about it, in that sort of way. But, I mean –I remember
reading, like we read stuff around the citizenship schools and the civil rights
movement and how, like, it was something that started out around training.
Like, teaching people how to read so they could pass the citizenship test to
vote and how that kind of education was linked to building the movement
together.
In this way, Maria suggested that though she “looked at the digital divide a little bit” with
the students in her digital courses, she did not see that “there was that much to kind of
study about it.” How are divides in access to technology more or less separate from
divides in access to basic resources, such the need for a heated home? And it is no
coincidence, of course, that after she framed the “digital divide” as a divide of economic
inequality, Maria immediately touched on how training, historically, has been used to

291
educate individuals in how to exercise their democratic right to vote. Said differently,
because she framed the digital divide as an issue of social justice, the solution needed to
overcome digital and economic inequality was political rather than strictly technological.
Similarly, when I questioned Evelyn, a program coordinator, about the most
important aspects of BTOP and KEYSPOTs in my final interview, she did not emphasize
job training or workforce development at all – even though as discussed in Chapter 4 and
Chapter 5, this was one of the most significant and stressed dimensions of the
partnership. More specifically, Evelyn likewise accentuated the potential social, cultural
and political impact of ICTs in her community. Further, she stressed that it is important to
make technology “relevant” to all participants. Evelyn explained this accordingly:
You know, making technology relevant to people with actual needs. You
know, using technology for things like community building, learning, you
know, and sort of –I guess making things possible that wouldn't be otherwise?
Like being able to communicate with someone thousands of miles away.
It is interesting to note that in her above statement, Evelyn implied that “actual needs” are
not simply material or economic, but also included engaging communities or helping a
participant talk to a faraway family member or friend. Therefore, according to Evelyn,
the role of programs like KEYSPOTs should be to nourish communities –not simply in
economic ways – but to make technology more socially, culturally and political relevant.
So, building on these critical insights from Maria and Evelyn, while the focus of
this dissertation has been largely economic and technological, the solution to the
problems of liquid labor are firmly grounded in the political. In fact, it feels somewhat
strange to complete this project in the current political moment, where the issues of

292
“working class” instabilities and precarious global networked labor are more salient than
ever, highlighted daily in newspaper op-eds and debated in town halls or on social media.
Yet, at the same time, while the working class has become a source of renewed interest in
the U.S. political consciousness, indeed the current proposed government solutions to the
problems of widening class inequality unfortunately continue to be predicated on the
same neoliberal values of self-work and self-reliance. For instance, this is made plain in
the priorities of the 2017 Trump administration proposed budget I have hitherto
discussed, which seeks to further slash the already threadbare social safety net.
Given these challenges, the goal for digital divide researchers will be to navigate
with great dexterity between these poles of “prosperity” versus “participation,” to ensure
that the same tools we champion are not used as a cudgel against the working class we
purport to serve in our research (Schement, 2009). Said differently, we need to be more
aware of the “digital myth,” especially when funders or other policymaker interests hope
to use ICTs as a means whereby to further retrench the fragile welfare state. We should
advocate for broadband programs that are more holistic, recognizing that technological
tools alone cannot solve the complex problems of urban poverty or counterbalance the
ways in which ICTs have reshaped the economic lives of urban families. In this way, I
mean for “liquid labor” to be less a strict definition or explanation of online work
practices, and more a mirror onto a precarious, shifting economic world. For I contend
that Joanne and Mr. Wilson’s stories – though seemingly divergent and contradictory –
reflect a deeper dislocation and disturbance stirring within the foundations of the
informational economy.
