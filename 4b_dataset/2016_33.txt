ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
There are so many people to thank, but I’ll start with my deep thanks to my major
professor, Dr. Marcia A. Mardis, who is not only an outstanding mentor but also an incredible
human being. Whenever I panicked or began to doubt myself, she always knew exactly what to
say to encourage and motivate me. I could not have made it through this dissertation process
without her strong guidance and support. I wish I could express my thanks to her more
eloquently, but all I can really say is that she is truly amazing.
Along with Dr. Mardis, I must thank the other members of my committee: Dr. Melissa
Gross, Dr. Don Latham, and Dr. Vanessa Dennen. Dr. Gross has been with me since the
beginning, serving as instructor for my first doctoral seminar, Research Methods. Her strength in
research and dedication to her students has been an inspiration. I am grateful for Dr. Latham’s
strong and masterful understanding of the English language, which has been a huge help for me
while polishing up this dissertation. My work would not be the same without his tremendous
assistance. I am grateful to Dr. Dennen for her excitement about my work and general
cheerleading of my doctoral efforts. Also, she’s a fellow runner. Runners are good people.
Finally, I must also thank Dr. Kathy Burnett for her support and guidance throughout my
doctoral career.
Is it weird to thank places? Thank you Catalina Café (especially my favorite barista
Micah!), Fermentation Lounge, and Grasslands Brewing Company. I spent quite a bit of time in
your establishments, drinking your beverages, and writing. Thank you for allowing me to do that.
There is not enough room on this single page to express all of my thanks to my family
and friends. I would never have gotten this far without their love and constant support. Thank
you to Claire Leary for encouraging me to get my MLIS, become a librarian, and then continue
my education. Claire, I aspire to be the librarian you are. I am also thankful for my wonderful
writing group, Laura-Edythe Coleman, Mikki Smith, and Julia Skinner. It has been so very
rewarding to be surrounded and supported by people slogging through the same writing process.
Having friends with whom I could complain, cheer along, and write has helped me through many
tough and frustrating writing periods. Thank you for being my writing companions. Thank you
also to my fellow doctoral students who provided me with inspiration, motivation, and
encouragement since I first entered the doctoral program. Thank you so very much for being my
friends.

ABSTRACT
Cyberbullying is a problem many young adults ages 12 to 18 have experienced on a daily
basis. Adult support is critical in both the prevention and intervention of cyberbullying. Although
parents, teachers, and school administrators have been highlighted as sources of support for
cyberbullied young adults, librarians have not been studied as a source of support although
school and public librarians engage with teens on a daily basis. Through empathetic services, i.e.,
activities carried out in everyday in which librarians provide social, emotional, and psychological
support, librarians can help young adults who are experiencing and/or witnessing cyberbullying.
Empathy in the library has been infrequently researched within LIS. When empathy has been
studied, it is often under different labels, such as pastoral care or customer service.
The purpose of this research was to investigate how rural school and public librarians can
be a source of support for rural cyberbullied young adults. The study was guided by four
research questions in which I explored the types of support rural young adults desired and
received from rural librarians as well as the types of support rural librarians perceived they
offered and would like to offer.
In this project, I used two qualitative methods: semi-structured interviews and structured
video autoethnography. The fourteen participants in this project included three school librarians,
four public librarians, and seven young adults. The participants were all residents of rural
Southwest Georgia. In this project, I focused on rural young adults and rural librarians within
this region. In an attempt to be a more reflexive researcher, I also maintained a personal written
autoethnography to reflect on my research process.
In my analysis, I found that while rural young adults often saw rural librarians as sources
for information, mentorship, and everyday help, they also saw potential for librarians to engage

viii

in advocacy and empathy while in the library. In many interviews and video entries, the rural
librarian participants frequently highlighted their significant role in information provision and
instruction for rural young adults. While a few librarians acknowledged that they provided
social, emotional, and psychological support for their young patrons, librarian participants
typically downplayed the importance of this role in their work. However, librarians revealed a
desire to not only improve their role as providers of information and instruction but also to
increase the social, emotional, and psychological support they provided in their libraries.
Since this is an exploratory project, I suggested that empathy in the library is a little
researched area in LIS and often overlooked by librarians in the field. Additional research is
needed in the important role of empathetic services in librarianship. This research fills a gap in
the literature about rural librarians as a source of support for rural cyberbullied young adults and
introduces the term “empathetic services”. I also proposed that future research is needed into
relational communication theory as a framework for empathetic services

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
1.1 Overview
As the popularity of social media has grown since its introduction in 2002, instances of
cyberbullying among young adults have also increased (boyd, 2007). Cyberbullying is “any
behavior performed through electronic or digital media by individuals or groups that repeatedly
communicates hostile or aggressive messages intended to inflict harm or discomfort on others”
(Tokunaga, 2010, p. 278). While sharing many of the same characteristics as traditional, face-toface bullying, cyberbullying is distinguished by its online location, perceived anonymity, and
flexibility of roles (Bauman, 2010; Bowler, Mattern, & Knobel, 2014).
Along with these differences, the relative newness of cyberbullying, adults’ lack of
awareness of its severity, and adolescents’ reluctance to inform adults about victimization,
present challenges when determining how to best support cyberbullied young adults (Li, 2007;
Mark & Ratliffe, 2011). Adults, including parents, teachers, clergy, and coaches, have many
important roles in the daily lives of adolescents. However, while these adults often perform a
supervisory role, librarians do not (Braun, Hartman, Hughes-Hassell, Kumasi, & Yoke, 2014).
As stated by one teen during the Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Summit,
“Teens need more adults who are not ‘in charge’ of them” (Braun et al., 2014, p. 10). Librarians
have unique relationships with youth that can be described as informal and relaxed. Unlike the
parent-child or teacher-child dynamic, librarians have a more-balanced power relationship with
teens. Through this relaxed relationship, librarians are able to help cyberbullied or otherwise
distressed youth in ways other adults may not. These opportunities have not been thoroughly

1

examined or discussed within library and information studies (LIS) scholarly and practitioner
literature.
1.1.1 Librarians as a Source of Support
The support of adults is critical in both prevention and intervention related to
cyberbullying among young adults (Mason, 2008). In the literature, parents, grandparents,
educators, school officials, and legislators have been highlighted as potential sources of support
and advocates for victims of cyberbullying (boyd & Hargittai, 2013; Mason, 2008; Meredith,
2010). Because of the influence of family on “the development and prevention of antisocial and
violent behavior”, the focus of research on the parental role in cyberbullying prevention and
intervention is understandable (National Science Foundation, 2013, p. 5). Teachers are also a
logical focus as sources of support and guidance. Because adolescents spend a considerable
amount of time in school, teachers often take a lead role in educating youth about Internet safety,
appropriate technology use, and personal online responsibility (eSchool Media, Inc., 2012).
However, other adults within a young adult’s community, like librarians, also perform supportive
roles on a daily basis (Braun et al., 2014). Examples of librarians performing this supportive role
include maintaining the library as a safe and welcoming environment for youth development
(Brautigam, 2008), serving “as the connection between young adults and other community
agencies” (Braun et. al, 2014, p.13), and using bibliotherapy to help patrons “cope with mental,
physical, developmental or social problems” (Cesari, 2014, p. 2).
The role of librarians in cyberbullying support has yet to be thoroughly investigated. A
community-wide approach, including school and public librarians, is necessary to educate adults
and youth about cyberbullying, combat this pervasive problem, and support its victims (U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). Public and school librarians provide planned

2

programming, informal instruction, readers’ advisory, mentoring, outreach, and other services
that are have a secondary function, often without the awareness of the librarians themselves, in
preventing cyberbullying and assisting cyberbullied young adults (Brautigam, 2008; Cesari,
2014; Cronin, 2001). One of these “other” services currently offered by librarians possessing the
potential to help is empathetic services.
In this study, the term “empathetic services” refers to structured activities carried out oneon-one or in groups and everyday, unstructured interactions in which the role of the librarian is
to provide social, emotional, and psychological support. Empathy within the context of the
library has been sporadically investigated under labels such as pastoral care, library as a safe
space, socio-emotional support, and invisible services (Cesari, 2014; Jones & Delahanty, 2011;
Morris, 2013; Shaper & Streatfield, 2012). The role of empathy in librarianship has been
examined in the research of several LIS scholars in the United Kingdom but rarely in North
America (Birdi, Wilson, & Cocker, 2008; Birdi, Wilson, & Tso, 2009; Wilson & Birdi, 2008).
Interpersonal communication is integral to providing empathy in a library setting. Interpersonal
communication refers to “the verbal and nonverbal interaction between two interdependent
people” (DeVito, 2013, p. 4). Librarians engage in interpersonal communication during everyday
exchanges with patrons, such as answering reference questions, conducting programming, and
offering technical support.
1.1.2 Young Adults’ Perceptions of Cyberbullying and Victim Support
Although there has been a recent push for the inclusion of young adult perspectives of
cyberbullying, the majority of research has focused on cyberbullying from an adult
understanding (Allen, 2013). Engagement of young adults in cyberbullying research is critical
for the development of effective prevention and intervention programs that reflect the actual

3

needs of adolescents (Bowler, Mattern, & Knobel, 2014). Additionally, the lack of research into
young adult perspectives regarding victim support is particularly noticeable (Jacobs, Goossens,
Dehue, Völlink, & Lechner, 2015). Recent innovative studies by Bowler et al. (2014), Corby,
Campbell, Spears, Slee, and Butler (2014), and Giménez Gualdo, Hunter, Durkin, Arnaiz, and
Maquilón (2014) have given voice to adolescents’ understanding of cyberbullying and
victimization. Yet, there still exists a gap in the literature concerning the types of support young
adults themselves perceive as helpful and needed. While this dissertation did not extensively
examine the perspectives of young adults regarding cyberbullying as part of the findings, these
perspectives naturally arose during interviews with and video responses from teens and provided
support for the discussion of empathetic support in Chapter 5.
1.1.3 Rural Communities and Libraries
The U.S. Census Bureau defines rural as “places with fewer than 2,500 people” (U.S.
Census, 2014, ¶ 5). For the Bureau, this includes “all population, housing, and territory not
included within an urban area” along with rural subcategories such as rural adjacent, rural
distant, and frontier (U.S. Census, 2014, ¶ 5). Another definition comes from the Center for the
Study of Rural Libraries, which defines rural “as a place with less than 25,000 people and is
outside a metropolitan area.” (Standerfer, 2006, p. 138). The U.S. Department of Veteran
Affairs’ Office of Rural Health provides one more definition – rural areas are “any non-urban or
non-highly rural area” (U.S. Census, 2014, ¶ 16). Each of these definitions are rather vague,
essentially describing what rural communities are not rather than what they are. These definitions
do not convey the shared sense of community experienced by rural citizens or how “tightly knit”
these communities are (Moeller & Becnel, 2015, p. 5). Additionally, these definitions are not

4

reflective of the harsh realities rural areas experience, including poverty, “mobility
disadvantages”, isolation, and limited access to human services (Stegner, 2007, p. 8).
Rural Southwest Georgia served as the setting for this dissertation. The selection of this
region is both personal and pragmatic. I grew up in Southwest Georgia and served as a librarian
for a number of years in one of the region’s public library systems. Because of this, I feel a close
connection with the rural communities and libraries of this particular area. All of the participants
in this research are residents of rural Southwest Georgia. The seven librarians in this dissertation
are employed in either a public or school library in Southwest Georgia--three are school
librarians, and four are public librarians. The seven young adult participants are either current
students or, in two cases, recent high school graduates in Southwest Georgia and served by both
rural public and school libraries.
1.2 Problem
Young adults’ use of social media has risen quickly (boyd, 2007). In 2012, 81% of young
adults used social media, much higher than 55% in 2006 (Madden et al., 2013). As adolescents’
engagement with social networking sites has grown, they are also providing more information
about themselves online. Through profiles, posts, and uploads, young adults are sharing photos,
addresses, phone numbers, and school locations (Marwick et al., 2013). As a result of this
openness, young adults leave themselves vulnerable to online harassment including
cyberbullying. In a 2011 survey, Lenhart, Madden, Smith, Purcell, Zickuhr, and Rainie found
that 88% of online young adults had observed mean or cruel behavior on social media. Fifteen
percent of those surveyed reported being the focus of such behaviors (Lenhart et al., 2011).
Although not every unkind post or message on social media qualifies as cyberbullying, these

5

behaviors can quickly escalate and have serious repercussions. To cope with these experiences,
young adults need the support of adults, families, friends, and communities.
1.3 Importance/Significance of the Research
Typically in cyberbullying cases, young victims are reluctant to seek help from adults.
Believing that adults are unable to intervene or that adult intervention may cause the harassment
to increase, victims attempt to solve the problem alone or under the guidance of peers (Mason,
2008). While parents, grandparents, and teachers have been examined as sources of support for
victims, little research has focused on the supportive role of librarians (D’Auria, 2014; Kwan &
Skoric, 2013). Young adults are frequent users of both public and school libraries (Braun et al.,
2014). Libraries offer neutral spaces for “adolescents to grow intellectually, emotionally, and
socially” (Braun et al., 2014, p. 1). Because librarians lack the control a teacher or principal
possesses over a teen’s daily life, they serve an important “non-supervisory” role (Braun et al.,
2014, p. 10). This relaxed dynamic encourages adolescents to share feelings, concerns, and
experiences they may feel reluctant to admit to a parent or teacher. As a result, librarians have
the potential to support cyberbullied young adults in conjunction with parents, teachers, and
other adults in the community. Through day-to-day interactions with young patrons, librarians
offer guidance through programming, reader’s advisory, and empathetic services (Jones, 2008;
Tukhareli, 2011).
While the concept of empathy within the setting of libraries is nothing novel, the explicit
labeling of this service is new (Miller & Wallis, 2011; Wilson & Birdi, 2008). This dissertation
introduces empathetic services as a critical service that librarians provide young adults during
everyday interactions. Empathetic services structured activities carried out one-on-one or in
groups and everyday unstructured interactions in which the role of the librarian is to provide

6

social, emotional, and psychological support. Empathy in the library is not limited to young
patrons. Librarians provide empathetic services to patrons of all ages. However, with young and
vulnerable patrons like cyberbullied young adults, an empathetic librarian plays an important
role in serving as a source of encouragement, support, and positivity.
Secondly, this study draws attention to the perspectives of rural young adults regarding
cyberbullying and victim support. Much of the literature in this area presents the views of
researchers and neglects the experiences, voices, and thoughts of those being victimized. These
aggressive online behaviors are often invisible to those outside of the insular world of
adolescents. In many cases, victims do not report these behaviors, instead believing “they need to
learn to deal with it (cyberbullying)” on their own (Juvonen & Gross, 2008, p. 502). Young
victims keep cyberbullying experiences concealed from adults, relying on friends and technology
to manage these attacks (Corby et. al, 2014). As a result, parents, teachers, and other adults may
be unaware a young adult is participating in or is the victim of cyberbullying, or if aware, feel
helpless to intervene (Kiriakidis & Kavoura, 2010).
However, research focusing on the perspectives, experiences, and reflections of young
adults can help remove the invisibility of cyberbullying and reveal possibilities for supporting
victims. For adults to help, they must have a better understanding of cyberbullying from the view
of young victims (Bowler et. al, 2014). Using interviews and video autoethnographies of rural
young adults and rural librarians, this dissertation will highlight the types of support cyberbullied
young adults see themselves needing, the ways in which rural school and public librarians can
provide this support, and the key role of empathy in this support by librarians.

1.4 Definition of Terms
The following terms are used frequently in this proposed project. The operational
definitions have been drawn from a comprehensive study of the literature.
Cyberbullying – any behavior performed through electronic or digital media by
individuals or groups that repeatedly communicates hostile or aggressive messages
intended to inflict harm or discomfort on others (Tokunaga, 2010, p. 278).
Social Networking Sites – web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a
public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of users with
whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and
those made by others in the system (boyd & Ellison, 2007, p. 211).
Empathy – the ability to identify and understand another person’s situation and feelings
(Miller & Wallis, 2011, p. 122). Empathy is one competent of the overall support an
individual receives including, but not limited to, financial, physical, informational,
instructional, and emotional support.
Empathetic Services – structured activities carried out one-on-one or in groups and
everyday unstructured interactions in which the role of the librarian is to provide social,
emotional, and psychological support.
Social support – Resources, including material aid, socio-emotional support, and
informational aid, provided by others to help a person cope with stress. (American
Psychological Association, 2016, ¶55)
Interpersonal Communication – the verbal and nonverbal interaction between two
interdependent people (DeVito, 2013, p. 4)

8

Rural - a place with fewer than 25,000 people and outside of a metropolitan area
(Standerfer, 2006, p. 138).
Young Adult – a youth between the ages of twelve and eighteen (YALSA, 2008)
Librarian – an individual with an MLIS/MLS degree working in a library in a
professional capacity (ALA, 1991)
1.5 Purpose
The purpose of this study is to highlight the important, but often unacknowledged, role
empathy plays in the everyday work of rural public and school librarians. Through semistructured interviews and structured video autoethnographies with adolescents and librarians, the
honest and expressive voices of young adults, public librarians, and school librarians can be
heard. Without the input and reflections of each population, it is challenging to develop staff
training, programming, and services that successfully support and help young patrons,
specifically those who are victims of online violence (Bowler et al., 2014).
Librarians are a potential source of support for cyberbullied young adults. Parents,
teachers, and school administrators have been promoted as resources for young adults to seek out
when experiencing and/or witnessing cyberbullying (boyd & Hargittai, 2013; D’Auria, 2014;
Messias, Kindrick, & Castro, 2014). Librarians are often overlooked or relegated to an “other
adults” classification. However, librarians provide mental, emotional, and psychological support
to patrons during day-to-day duties (Shaper & Streatfield, 2012). Empathetic services are an
avenue through which librarians can support cyberbullied young adults.

1.6 Research Questions
This study integrated three perspectives: rural young adults, rural school librarians, and
rural public librarians, especially as they pertained to empathetic services provided to
cyberbullied young adults. This dissertation addressed the following questions:
RQ1: What types of empathy and support have rural young adults received from rural
librarians?
RQ2: What empathy and support do rural young adults want to receive from rural
librarians?
RQ3: What types of empathy and support do rural librarians provide rural young adults?
RQ4: What empathy and support do rural librarians want to provide rural young adults?
1.7 Overview of Research Method
This study focused on three populations, young adults, school librarians, and public
librarians, in rural Southwest Georgia. Both rural public and school libraries have been
particularly hard hit by the recent recession and funding reform (Molnar, 2014; Stegner, 2007).
Even before the recession, rural libraries lacked the equivalent funding and human resources of
urban and suburban libraries (Barron, 1995). Inexpensive and quality training and professional
development is greatly needed in rural libraries (Mehra, Black, & Lee, 2010). In a minor way,
this research supplements the insufficient amount of research on rural libraries and rural patrons
as well as provides suggestions for improving youth services in rural areas.
I used semi-structured interviews and video autoethnographies to collect the data for this
study. First, I interviewed seven librarians in individual semi-structured interviews lasting
approximately 60 minutes. Subsequently, I interviewed seven young adults in individual semistructured interviews lasting approximately 30 minutes. After the interview phase was

10

completed, I asked both the librarian and young adult participants to record one video
autoethnography lasting approximately 5 to 10 minutes during their own time. School and public
librarians were contacted through the researcher’s existing personal and community social
networks; young adult participants were recruited through recommendations from these
librarians, regional youth organization leaders, and church youth pastors.
I used Charmaz’s (2006) approach to grounded theory as a guide for data collection and
analysis. Because of its exploratory nature, this study emphasized Charmaz’s elements of code
development, theme discovery, and preliminary theory application (Heath & Cowley, 2004). The
categories and codes revealed during this study’s data analysis have the potential to support the
future use of relational communication theory in LIS and cyberbullying research.
Throughout data collection, I maintained a written autoethnography. This journal allowed
me to reflect on each interview; the design of the interview questions and video prompts; and
captured personal reflections during the process. Notes, comments, and questions were recorded
in this journal before, after, and as needed during data collection. The journal supplied me with
ideas for possible codes and categories used during subsequent analysis.
At the completion of data collection, I began memoing. As Saldaña (2010) noted, “the
purpose of analytic memo writing is to document and reflect on: your coding process and code
choices; how the process of inquiry is taking shape; and the emergent patterns, categories and
subcategories, themes, and concepts in your data” (p. 33). Memoing is an established practice in
qualitative research (Saldaña, 2010). Through the act of memoing, a researcher can stay
connected with his/her data and “engage in critical reflexivity” (Charmaz, 2006, p. 163).

11

1.8 Limitations of the Research
This study was exploratory and used two qualitative methods for data collection and
analysis. Quantitative methods were not used in this project. As a result, the findings were not
generalizable to the entire young adult or librarian populations. Data collection occurred in four
rural counties of Southwest Georgia and involved rural young adults and rural librarians.
Because this study focused on rural youth and rural librarians, the experiences, thoughts, and
beliefs of urban and suburban teens and librarians are not reflected in the findings. Instead, this
dissertation offers directions for further research and recommendations for practitioner
application.
This study focused on the complex and controversial topic of cyberbullying, as well as
the sensitive subject of emotional and psychological support of cyberbullied victims. At times,
some young adult and librarian participants appeared reluctant to share personal stories and
reflections with the researcher (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). Participating young adults
may have been concerned that the researcher would share these narratives with parents, teachers,
or friends, while librarians may have been concerned about the impact of sharing personal views
and/or opinions may have had on their job. Researching sensitive topics can be an emotional
experience for both participants and researchers (Dickson-Swift, James, Kippen, & Liamputtong,
2007). Developing and maintaining rapport with the participants is essential to avoid negatively
impacting the quality of the data collected and undesirably affecting the mental and emotional
health of participants (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006; Dickson-Swift et al., 2008). Through
intensive reading regarding appropriately and ethically interviewing minors about sensitive
topics and the challenges of sensitive research, I developed a plan for potential emergency
situations encountered while interviewing (i.e. dealing with distressed teen participants).

1.9 Overview of Subsequent Chapters

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
Beginning with a discussion of the information-saturated world of young adults and the
role of social media in the every day lives of young adults, this literature review will introduce
cyberbullying, the evolution of cyberbullying research, empathy, and the empathetic role of
librarians. The review closes with an examination of related research into cyberbullying
intervention and the supportive role of librarians.
2.1 The Everyday Lives of Young Adults
Much like adults, young adults live in an information-rich world fueled largely by the
Internet (Itō & Antin, 2010). Itō, Horst, Bittanti, boyd, Herr-Stephenson, Lange, Pascoe, and
Robinson (2008) first introduced three distinct genres of young adult online participation called
“hanging out”, “geeking out”, and “messing around”. In this dissertation, the definition for
young adult is the definition specified by ALA’s Young Adult Library Services Association: a
youth between the ages of twelve and eighteen (YALSA, 2008). Today’s young adults are going
online to seek information beyond that required for school assignments (Dresang, 1999). They
are engaging online “along a continuum of practice that ranges from ‘hanging out’ and ‘messing
around’ to the more invested ‘geeking out,’ depending on individual interest in a given media
activity” (Harris, 2011, viii). Adolescents spend a significant amount of time connecting with
their peers on social media with over 81% of young adults using these sites to communicate with
friends (Braun et al., 2014; Itō et al., 2008). Social networking sites have been defined as:
Web-based services that allow individuals to construct a public or semi-public profile
within a bounded system, articulate a list of other users with whom they share a

14

connection, and view and traverse their list of connection and those made by others
within the system. (boyd & Ellison, 2007, p. 211)
Although the popularity of various social networking sites such as Friendster, MySpace,
and Facebook has risen and fallen, young adults continue to embrace online communities (boyd,
2007).
Not only are young adults consuming information, they are also communicating and
creating information. A Pew Research Center survey (Madden, 2012) found that young adults
are sharing more information about themselves than ever before. Through social media, young
adults are providing real names, photos, addresses, school names, relationship statuses, and
personal videos (Madden et al., 2013). Through social media and similar online communities,
young adults are creating digital content, or “geeking out” (Itō et al., 2008). Young adults are
developing video games, blogs, videos, music, and podcasts with the help of digital tools and
online collaborations, and then distributing these creations to an online audience (Ahn et al.,
2012). While participating in digital activities, young adults are building digital literacy skills,
engaging in social literacy practices, and “using these new cultural places for both play and
learning” (Davies, 2012, p. 554). For digital youth, the Internet, and social media in particular,
combines school, home, work, and social worlds (Koltay, 2011).
2.1.1 The Developmental Role of Social Media
Social media has many roles in the daily lives of young adults, but three roles have
received a considerable amount of research. These roles, identity performance, connection, and
literacy as performance, will be highlighted in the following few paragraphs (Leu, Kinzer, Coiro,
& Cammack, 2004).

15

Young adults use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other sites as locations where they
can work out, perform, and negotiate online identities (Davies, 2012). Through shared profiles,
photos, status updates, comments, conversations, and videos, social media provides a new
avenue to engage in “impression management” (boyd, 2009, p. 128). Through this public sharing
of personal information, young adults are able to both define themselves and control how others
see them. Sharing is a type of performance, both for themselves and online audiences; young
adults are participating in what Goffman (1956) referred to as a “presentation of self in everyday
life” (p. 1). The fluidity of social media permits young adults to constantly construct and
reconstruct this online presentation of self. However, the self that is displayed through social
media does not exist in isolation from the offline self. Instead, the online self is a reflection of the
offline self (McMillan & Morrison, 2006).
For young adults, offline friendships and relationships are key motivators for joining a
social networking site (boyd, 2007). The profiles of friends act a guide for “what types of
presentations are socially appropriate” (boyd, 2007, p. 127). The imagined audience shapes how
a young adult decides to present himself or herself online (boyd, 2008). Adolescents use social
cues drawn from the profiles, posts, and comments of friends to “fit in” both online and offline
(Davies, 2007). Related to fitting in, these displayed connections or friendships offer young
adults another way to share information (Donath & boyd, 2004). The connections a young adult
forms on social media, called “friending” on Facebook or “following” on Instagram, informs
viewers about his or her popularity, social status, group identities, and interests (boyd, 2007).
2.1.2 The Literacy Role of Social Media
Although “hanging out” with friends is the main draw of social media, young adults are
using these sites to hone digital literacy skills (Braun et al., 2014). For the purposes of social

16

media, digital literacy can be defined as “the myriad social practices and conceptions of
engaging in meaning making mediated by text that are produced, received, distributed,
exchanged, etc., via digital codification” (Lankshear & Knobel, 2011, p. 5). Young adults are not
only accessing information while in online communities, they are also interpreting, evaluating,
publishing, and communicating information (Koltay, 2011). Lankshear and Knobel (2011) argue
that social media is “a member of a family of literacy practices” (p. 256) and outside of the
classroom, young adults engage in “self-selected literacy practices”, or literacy performances,
with social networking sites forming “communities of practices” (Yi, 2008, p. 871). Literacy is a
social practice, which takes places through the public environment of social media (Gee, 2000).
With the help of social media, young adults are creating meaningful content, engaging in
discussions, and forming informal spaces for learning (Lankshear & Knobel, 2011).
2.1.3 The Everyday Lives of Rural Young Adults
Although rural areas can pose challenges for accessing reliable and affordable Internet
service, rural young adults have become increasingly heavy Internet consumers (Foundation for
Rural Service, 2013). In a survey by the Foundation for Rural Service (FRS)(2013), 66% of rural
young adult respondents believed that broadband Internet was an “essential” telecommunication
service. Like urban and suburban young adults, rural young adults are going online for a variety
of purposes. These purposes include homework/research, social media, shopping, streaming
television, gaming, online classes, and browsing (FRS, 2013). For rural young adults,
participation in social media ranks second only to school homework/research in popular online
activities (FRS, 2013).
Much of the literature on young adults’ use of social media focuses on the overall
population of young adults including urban, suburban, and rural. Little is known about how rural

17

young adults engage with social media or what differences exist in the social media use of urban,
suburban, and rural young adults. Research into rural libraries and Internet connectivity has
revealed the important role libraries have in providing rural citizens with high speed and
consistent Internet (Alemanne, Mandel, & McClure, 2011). For many rural areas, the public
library is the only available access to Internet services, which may be too expensive or nonexistent elsewhere (Heuertz, Gordon, Gordon, & Moore, 2003). Unfortunately, rural libraries and
rural youth services are both under-researched in LIS literature.
2.1.4 Rural Public Libraries and Rural Young Adults
The U.S. Census Bureau defines rural as “places with fewer than 2,500 people” (U.S.
Census, 2014, ¶ 5). For the Bureau, this includes “all population, housing, and territory not
included within an urban area” along with rural subcategories such as rural adjacent, rural
distant, and frontier (U.S. Census, 2014, ¶ 5). Another definition for rural comes from the Center
for the Study of Rural Libraries which defines rural “as a place with less than 25,000 people and
is outside a metropolitan area.” (Standerfer, 2006, p. 138). The U.S. Department of Veteran
Affairs’ Office of Rural Health provides one more definition -- rural areas are “any non-urban or
non-highly rural area” (U.S. Census, 2014, ¶ 16). Each of these definitions is rather vague,
essentially describing what rural communities are not – urban – but not what they are.
Like urban and suburban libraries, rural libraries are supportive, nurturing, and
welcoming environments for young adults (Jurkowski, 2006). In small rural communities, the
public library is one of the only safe places for young adults to hang out after school, on
weekends, and during school breaks (Smith, 2003). Rural libraries function as a safe space for
young adults, a place where programming, materials, and services are available that encourage
healthy online and offline behaviors (Smith, 2003). Although rural communities may appear

18

safer than urban and suburban communities, rural young adults are not immune to problems like
crime, drug use, and violence (Smith, 2003). With the increase in popularity of social media,
these destructive activities have moved online.
2.1.5 Rural School Libraries and Rural Young Adults
School libraries in rural communities suffer from many of the same constraints as rural
public libraries (Molnar, 2014). Inadequate funding, undereducated staffing, and state and local
politics place a limit on what services and materials school libraries can offer young patrons
(Molnar, 2014; Rajput & Medley, 2003). This limited access to libraries and library materials has
an impact on an adolescent’s “academic achievements and development of literacy skills”
(Smith, 2014, p. 164).
However, in rural communities where poverty, lack of education, and poor infrastructure
are common, school libraries are a critical information and technology resource for young adults
(Digital Literacy Task Force, 2013). Along with public libraries, school libraries offer students
access to technology and training on digital literacy alongside the classroom (American
Association of School Librarians (AASL), 2007). Digital literacy and digital citizenship
education in K-12 schools and communities is necessary to prevent and intervene in
cyberbullying and other types of online violence (Mason, 2008). In a teacher-librarian role,
school librarians possess the necessary training to develop lesson plans targeting digital literacy
as well as informal information literacy instruction (AASL, 2007).
The limited amount of existing LIS literature on youth services in rural school and public
libraries mainly has a practitioner focus and provides guidance on programming, collection
development, advocacy, and marketing (Mellon, 1987; Smith, 2003). While how-to and best
practice articles are essential points of reference for librarians, additional research into the ways

19

rural librarians engage with rural youth and the roles and responsibilities of rural libraries in the
lives of rural youth would benefit rural libraries and the youth they serve.
2.2 A Brief Overview of Cyberbullying
The social media rich everyday life of a youth is not without its downsides. Online life
leaves many adolescents vulnerable to attacks on their privacy and personal safety.
Cyberbullying has been “portrayed as a pervasive intimidation method” that emerged with the
arrival of social networking sites in the early 2000s (Juvonen & Gross, 2008, p. 497). Although
cyberbullying can occur through a range of formats including video, e-mail, texting, and instant
messaging, it is typically associated with social networking sites (Marwick & boyd, 2011).
Extreme cases of cyberbullying in popular media, often involving suicide and/or legal
action, have drawn the attention of parents, politicians, school officials, and researchers
(Alfonso, 2012; Stanglin & Welch, 2013). However, cyberbullying rarely results in observable
tragedies. Instead, the effects of cyberbullying, like those of traditional bullying, are often felt
more subtly throughout the life of a victim. Feelings of depression, low self-esteem, anxiety,
stress, loneliness, hopelessness, and fear have been associated with involvement and experience
with cyberbullying (Giménez Gualdo et al., 2014; Kiriakidis & Kavoura, 2010). Both
cyberbullies and victims of cyberbullying are emotionally impacted by aggressive online actions
(Kiriakidis & Kavoura, 2010). Cyberbullying is a detrimental experience for all those involved.
2.2.1 Traditional Bullying vs. Cyberbullying
While traditional bullying and cyberbullying share several similarities, there are
important distinctions. Traditional bullying involves the following features: “(1) power
imbalance between bully and victim, (2) bullying behavior is repeated over time, (3) intention to
cause harm, (4) perpetrated by an individual or a group, (5) face-to-face interaction, and (6)

20

largely confined to the school and school day” (Phillips, 2014, p. 3). Cyberbullying shares the
repetition, intention, and perpetration features displayed in traditional bullying, but social media
has changed the nature of power imbalance and interaction style of bullying (Ybarra, boyd,
Korchmaros, & Oppenheim, 2012). There is no longer a physical power imbalance between the
bully and victim; the physical strength of a bully has little significance in a digital environment
(Langos, 2012). Instead, a social and/or technological power differential is common (Slonje,
Smith, & Frisén, 2013).
Through the anonymous power of social media, anyone can be a cyberbully, victim, or
bystander, and these roles are often interchangeable. A young adult can simultaneously be a
bully and victim, a role referred to as “bully/target” (Smith, Dempsey, Jackson, Olenchak, &
Gaa, 2012). The anonymity of social media encourages a disinhibition effect in cyberbullies
(Bowler, Mattern, & Knobel, 2014). This effect refers to the loosing of social inhibitions or
restrictions during online interactions (Suler, 2005). Cyberbullies are “physically and
emotionally removed from their victims” (Varjas, Talley, Meyers, Parris, & Cutts, 2010, p. 269).
Without face-to-face interaction, bullies do not see the impact of their online actions. As a result,
young adults may participate in actions online they would never have offline (Varjas et al.,
2010).
Because social networking sites can be accessed anywhere, at anytime, and by anyone,
victims are unable to escape cyberbullying (Juvonen & Gross, 2008). While a traditional face-toface bully could be avoided when away from school, the ubiquity of the Internet leaves
cyberbullying victims feeling powerless to prevent further cyberbullying (Langos, 2012). Often,
victims are reluctant to seek the help of parents or teachers. Young adult participants in a study
by Slonje and Smith (2008) reported adults as less aware of cyberbullying than traditional

21

bullying and unable to help. Adult awareness is critical for combatting cyberbullying, especially
awareness by parents (Slonje & Smith, 2008). To support and advocate for cyberbullied young
adults, parents, teachers, school officials, and others must be aware cyberbullying is occurring in
their communities, recognize the various types of cyberbullying, be knowledgeable about
national, regional, and locally available support resources, and actions that should be taken
(Slonje & Smith, 2008).
2.2.2 Defining Cyberbullying
Despite the media attention, the term “cyberbullying” is difficult to define (Langos, 2012;
Ševčíková, Šmahel, & Otavová, 2012; Tokunaga, 2010). In the literature, cyberbullying has been
interchangeably labeled as online harassment, online bullying, cyberspace violence, online
aggression, Internet bullying, and electronic bullying (Chisholm, 2006; Moore, Huebner, &
Hills, 2011; Vaillancourt et al., 2008; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004). This mix of labels suggests that
cyberbullying is an ambiguous word that researchers have struggled to plainly and neatly
articulate despite significant discussion among researchers (Bowler et al., 2014; Langos, 2012;
Marwick & boyd, 2011; Tokunaga, 2010; Vaillancourt et al., 2008).
Tokunaga (2010) provided one comprehensive definition for cyberbullying:
“Cyberbullying is any behavior performed through electronic or digital media by individuals or
groups that repeatedly communicates hostile or aggressive messages intended to inflict harm or
discomfort on others.” (p. 278). This definition clearly identifies cyberbullying as a distinctive
form of aggression occurring in an online environment, similar in some ways but different in
others to traditional face-to-face bullying. In his article, Tokunaga urged other researchers to
develop a shared conceptual and operational definition to improve the quality of cyberbullying
research. In this dissertation, Tokunaga’s definition is used when understanding cyberbullying.

22

2.2.3 Young Adults’ and “Drama”
While researchers cannot agree upon a label or definition for cyberbullying, researchers
and youth also do not share the same conceptualization of “cyberbullying” (Marwick & boyd,
2011). Marwick and boyd (2011) discussed the divide between the adult label of “cyberbullying”
and the young adult label of “drama”. Much like cyberbullying, drama is challenging to define.
Many of the behaviors labeled as drama by young adults, such as trash talking, arguing, gossip,
and pranks, may be seen as bullying by adults. Drama is simply a part of daily life for young
adults and not viewed as bullying behavior (Marwick & boyd, 2011).
The label of drama allows youth to “distance themselves” from those practices adults
would identify as bullying (Marwick & boyd, 2011, p. 1). As a result, young adults may not
respond to researchers’ use of terms like “bullying” or “cyberbullying” in surveys, interviews, or
focus groups. Marwick and boyd (2011) encouraged researchers to use the terminology of young
adults when engaging with youth and investigating the experiences of this age group. By doing
so, cyberbullying research will become more reflective of the actual experiences and perceptions
of young adults.
In a similar vein, Mishna, Wiener, and Pepler (2008) investigated conflict and bullying
within adolescent friendships. Although the researchers focused on face-to-face bullying, they
revealed the dynamic, co-constructed, and, at times, combative nature of friendship.
“Disagreement and conflict in friendships are inevitable” (Mishna et al., 2008, p. 551). However,
while some friends are able to resolve these issues, others are not. These conflicts and
aggressions can become bullying. Because this bullying occurs between friends, victims often
feel compelled to maintain the friendship despite their suffering. For bullying victims, these
friends, despite their physically or relationally aggressive behaviors, serve a critical role as a

23

buffer from the bullying of other peers. Young victims may not be able to differentiate between
bullying and teasing (Mishna et al., 2008). Much like Marwick and boyd’s (2011) “drama”,
bullying within friendships can be seen as “just” joking or teasing by young adults. While these
behaviors can be seen as bullying by adults, adolescents find it difficult to identify their “best
friends” as bullies (Mishna et al., 2008).
2.2.4 Understanding Cyberbullies
Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying adolescents cannot be as clearly identified as
the “bully”, “victim”, or “bystander” (Law, Shapka, Domene, & Gagné, 2012). Young adults are
often performing one or more roles while online, for example a young adult may cyberbully a
peer while also witnessing cyberbullies attack his or her friends (Vandebosch & Van Cleemput,
2009). Dukes, Stein, and Zane (2009) identified four different types of “bullying groups” which
are applicable in cyberbullying: “pure bullies” who bully others but who are not bullied
themselves, “pure victims” who are victims of bullying but do not bully peers, “bully-victims”
who are both bullies and victims of bullying, and “neutrals” who are neither bullies or victims (p.
673).
While cyberbullying roles are nuanced, young adults who engage in cyberbullying do
share several characteristics. Hinduja and Patchin (2013) examined the influence of parents,
peers, and teachers on cyberbullying behaviors of youth. Much like in traditional bullying,
adolescents with healthy relationships with parents or guardians are less likely to engage in
deviant behavior (Hinduja & Patchin, 2013). Similarly, friendly and respectful relationships with
educators help protect young adults from participation in bullying, drug use, and law breaking.
During adolescent development, friends play a critical role in the “socialization of youth”
including behavioral decisions (Hinduja & Patchin, 2013, p. 714). “Hanging around” with a peer

24

group who participates in drug use, bullying, and other dangerous activities increases the
possibility of a young adult also engaging in these activities (Hinduja & Patchin, 2013).
Cyberbullies are linked with “moral approval of bullying, feeling disconnected from school, lack
of perceived peer support, and under-average school grades” (Vandebosch & Van Cleemput,
2009, p. 1355). Cyberbullying researchers have found similar findings that suggest supportive
relationships with peers, educators, and parents are linked with a reduction in youth participation
in cyberbullying (Kowalski, Giumetti, Shroeder, & Lattanner, 2014).
The research is mixed on demographic differences of cyberbullies such as gender and age
(Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2009). Studies have reported conflicting findings regarding the
role of gender in cyberbullying. Depending on the study, cyberbullying has been reported as
marginally higher in males, having no gender differences, and higher in females than males
(Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2009). However, Barlett and Coyne (2014) found that age did
have a moderating effect on “any sex differences in cyberbullying behavior” (p. 475).
Considerably more research is needed to determine the possible influence of gender and age on
cyberbullying behaviors in youth, as well the influence of other demographic variables such as
family income and ethnicity.
2.2.5 Evolution of Cyberbullying Research
Scholarly research into cyberbullying as a phenomenon among adolescents appeared with
the rise of social media in the mid-2000s. Much of this research emerged from the fields of
psychology and sociology. In 2004, Ybarra and Mitchell published two articles about online
harassment among youth (Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004b). Both
researchers have published prolifically about online harassment, victimization, and online
aggression within the field of childhood and adolescent psychology. These two articles illustrate

25

the early stages of investigations into cyberbullying from a psychological and sociological
perspective.
2.2.6 The Beginnings of Cyberbullying Research
Early research into cyberbullying attempted to measure and determine the prevalence of
cyberbullying (Biegler & boyd, 2010; Vaillancourt et al., 2008). Within this research, the
reported incidence of cyberbullying among youth varies markedly. In a 2005 survey of 1500
tweens and young adults, 135 (9%) reported experiencing online harassment of some type during
the previous year (Ybarra, Mitchell, Wolak, & Finkelhor, 2006). In another 2005 survey,
researchers reported that 42% of these youth had been bullied online (Chisholm, 2006). These
two studies illustrated the difficulty of accurately measuring a phenomenon that lacks an agreed
upon definition or label.
In the initial years of cyberbullying research, four areas received considerable attention:
differentiating between traditional and online bullying, identifying characteristics of bullies and
victims, gender differences in cyberbullying, and understanding the complex roles that make up
cyberbullying interactions (Chisholm, 2006; Dooley, Pyżalski, & Cross, 2009; Kiriakidis &
Kavoura, 2010; Slonje & Smith, 2008). More recently, largely due to the groundwork of Ybarra,
Mitchell, boyd, and others, cyberbullying research has expanded into examinations of the lived
experiences of young adults. Within the past five years, researchers have begun using interviews,
focus groups, and other qualitative methods to investigate the perceptions, reflections, and
experiences of young adults (Bowler et al., 2014; Hopkins, Taylor, Bowen, & Wood, 2013;
Mishna et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2011; Ševčíková et al., 2012). Qualitative research provides
researchers with a way to investigate the how and why of cyberbullying. As discussed by
Marwick and boyd (2011), young adults have their own terminology to express their

26

understanding of cyberbullying. To improve the quality of cyberbullying research, it is necessary
to thoroughly investigate how young adults identify, describe, explain, and react to both the word
“cyberbullying” and their experiences of cyberbullying (Bowler et al., 2014). To better
understand the ways librarians can help, research into the perceptions and experiences of
cyberbullied young adults must be discussed.
2.2.7 Perceptions of Young Adults Regarding Cyberbullying
Cyberbullying researchers have examined the perceptions of young adults from a variety
of directions including definitions, understanding of aggression, motivation, and prevention and
intervention. Recently, a noticeable shift in cyberbullying research has occurred. Research has
shifted from an early emphasis on prevalence rates, characteristics, and roles of cyberbullying to
current attention on the perceptions and experiences of young adult victims.
To explore differences between researchers and youth definitions of bullying,
Vaillancourt et al. (2008) interviewed 1767 school-aged children and young adults in Ontario.
The authors discovered that the three key criteria for bullying typically identified by researchers
– intentionality, repetition, and power imbalance – were rarely mentioned by young
interviewees. Instead, the definitions of these children and young adults concentrated largely on
the aggressive behaviors of bullying. A study by Cuadrado-Gordillo (2011) focused on this
contrast between researchers’ criteria for bullying and young adults’ perceptions of bullying.
Through surveys of 2,295 young adults, the authors discovered that respondents stressed “the
intention to hurt the victims” in bullying definitions (p. 1900). Two other criteria important to
bullying researchers – power imbalance and repetition – received little attention from the young
adults surveyed. Although these two studies focused solely on face-to-face bullying, comparable

27

differences in definitions and understandings of researchers and youth also exist for
cyberbullying (Marwick & boyd, 2011; Varjas et al., 2010).
Similar to definitions of bullying and cyberbullying, researchers have explored young
adults’ understanding of aggression and violence (Hopkins, Taylor, Bowen, & Wood, 2013;
Ševčíková et al., 2012; Sticca & Perren, 2012; Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2008). Hopkins et
al. (2013) conducted focus groups of 11 to 17 year olds to investigate how participants
understand and distinguish between words relating to aggression, bullying, and violence.
Interestingly, adolescent participants understood bullying and violence as “purposeful actions
intended to cause harm”, but viewed aggression as an “experience of anger” in which the
individual may or may not have control over his or her behavior (Hopkins et al., 2013, p. 689).
The amount of control an individual did or did not possess appeared to differentiate bullying and
violence from aggression (Hopkins et al., 2013).
A rare study involving cyberbullied victims as participants, Ševčíková et al. (2012)
interviewed 16 young adults regarding how they perceived “online aggressive attacks” and when
they saw these attacks as harmful (p. 319). The participants identified three cyberbullying
“contexts”: attacks where the cyberbully is not known, attacks where the cyberbully is known,
and attacks occurring both online and offline (p. 323). When bullying spreads from a strictly
online environment into the offline world, the perceived severity of the attacks increased. The
responses of these young adults attest to the variability of bullying experiences. Cyberbullying
and traditional bullying do not occur in isolation. Instead, they can blend into one another.
Cyberbullying often crosses over into traditional bullying; likewise, traditional bullying often
crosses over into cyberbullying (Waasdorp & Bradshaw, 2015). In many cases, cyberbullies and
their victims attend the same school or live in the same neighborhood, providing online bullies

28

with one more opportunity to continue the harassment but now face-to-face (Messias, Kindrick,
& Castro, 2014).
From the viewpoint of researchers, the two main motivations for cyberbullying are the
disinhibition effect and anonymity (Mason, 2008). Less is known about what young adults
themselves view as motivations for cyberbullying (Varjas et al., 2010). In an exploratory study,
Varjas et al. (2010) looked at motivators for cyberbullying from young adults’ perspective.
Through interviews with 20 high school students, the authors found that students recognized a
variety of internal and external motivators for cyberbullying. Internal motivators, including the
disinhibition effect and anonymity, were reported more often than external motivators (e.g. lack
of consequences or non-confrontational victim). Additionally, students’ reported motivators that
had not been identified before in the literature, such as protection and “redirect feelings” (p.
272). For Varjas et al. (2010), redirected feelings refers to the desire of the bully “to release
negative feelings rather than targeting a victim based on target characteristics” (p. 272). By
exploring motivations for cyberbullying from the perspective of youth, researchers are able to
understand the experiences of cyberbullying victims and develop possibilities for intervention.
In a 2005 survey, Li investigated differences in cyberbullying experiences of Canadian
and Chinese high school-aged adolescents. Cyberbullying is not only a cause for concern in the
United States; it is a global problem (Li, 2008). While both groups of students reported
experiencing and/or witnessing cyberbullying, an interesting trend emerged regarding adult
intervention. Unlike North American students, Chinese students viewed adults as helpful for
intervening in cyberbullying; and as a result, students were more likely to report cyberbullying
behavior. This contrast in reporting may be a result of cultural differences in relationships
between teachers and students (Li, 2008). Several North American studies have highlighted the

29

reluctance of young adults to report cases of cyberbullying to adults (Mishna et al., 2008; Mishna
et al., 2009). Instead of ending bullying, young adults fear the online attacks will escalate as a
result of adult intervention (Mishna et al., 2009)
A few studies have included adolescents as research collaborators (Ackers, 2012; Bowler
et al., 2014). Providing youth with the opportunity to engage in their own cyberbullying research,
Ackers (2012) encouraged student researchers to design and distribute questionnaires about
cyberbullying to fellow students. Applying this distinctive style of research to cyberbullying
offered the author access to the unique knowledge and perspectives of children and young adults
(Ackers, 2012).
Through the construction of “cyberbullying stories” by two focus groups of adolescents
and undergraduate students, Bowler et al. (2014) introduced a framework for design suggestions
that could protect youth from cyberbullying on social media. After creating cyberbullying
narratives, the researchers asked participants to develop recommendations for intervention. Five
themes emerged from these user-generated suggestions – design for empathy, design for
empowerment, design for fear, design for attention, and design for control and suppression
(Bowler et al., 2014, p. 157). Using a more holistic understanding of cyberbullying within the
world of young adults, researchers are able to provide parents, teachers, and other adults with
targeted and responsive prevention and intervention recommendations.
2.3 The Empathetic Role of Librarians
While the important role of parents, teachers, and school administrators in cyberbullying
prevention and intervention has been intensely discussed, librarians have largely been ignored as
a potential source of support (Accordino & Accordino, 2011; Mark & Ratliffe, 2011; Mishna et
al., 2008; Moore et al., 2011; Tokunaga, 2010; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004). Yet, librarians have

30

long provided social, psychological, and emotional support to young patrons (Jones &
Delahanty, 2011; Tukhareli, 2011). Different terms and phrases have been used within LIS,
psychology, education, and sociology literature to describe this type of support. In LIS
practitioner and scholarly literature, there has not been a consistently used term or label.
Empathy, invisible care, pastoral care, general “support”, affective dimensions, developmental
support, and “library as a safe space” are a few of the many terms given to this everyday support
(Birdi et al., 2009; Cesari, 2014; Jones & Delahanty, 2011; Miller & Wallis, 2011; Shaper &
Streatfield, 2012).
While not explicitly called “empathy”, the empathetic role of librarians is highlighted in
Areas II and III of “Young Adults Deserve the Best: YALSA’s Competencies in Action”
(Flowers, 2011). Area II: Knowledge of Client Group identifies “become familiar with the
development needs of young adults in order to provide the most appropriate resources and
services” as one competency young adult librarians should possess (Flowers, 2011, p. 3). Area
III: Communication, Marketing & Outreach recognizes several empathy-related competencies
including:
Be an advocate for young adults and effectively promote the role of the library in serving
young adults, demonstrating that the provision of services to this group can help young
adults build assets, achieve success, and in turn, create a stronger community. (Flowers,
2011, p. 4)
2.3.1 Empathetic Services
International LIS researchers have explored the role of empathy in public librarianship
and libraries (Birdi et al., 2008; Birdi et al., 2009; Miller & Wallis, 2011). In a review of public
librarianship, exclusion, and empathy, Birdi et al. (2008) explored professional empathy as one

31

tool to help combat social exclusion, improve community librarianship, and connect with
patrons. Social inclusion has become an important aspect of library service in the United
Kingdom as public “policy has shifted towards the social responsibility of (particularly publicly
funded) services and facilities.” (p. 578). Empathy, defined as “the ability to see another person’s
world through their eyes”, plays a critical role in the delivery of “socially inclusive services” (p.
585). Birdi et al. acknowledged the newness of this concept in librarianship and the need for
further research of the practical application of empathy to library work.
Subsequent articles by Birdi et al. (2009) and Miller and Wallis (2011) delved deeper into
empathy in librarianship and possibilities for training library staff on empathy. The findings of
two studies by Birdi et al. (2009) suggested that although training staff about empathy is difficult
to accomplish due to “personality, belief systems and other individual characteristics”, the
development of empathic skills among staff can be fostered through the sharing of appropriate
knowledge and information (p. 88). Miller and Wallis (2011) used relational agency theory as a
framework for evaluating “empathetic social interaction” between librarians and patrons (p.
122). The authors asserted that empathy is an important characteristic of information
professionals and provided examples for when empathy is necessary including collaboration with
other staff and patrons, providing quality customer services, developing trust, and during
“information counseling or coaching” (p. 129). Although empathy is an unfamiliar concept
within LIS, it supports much of the work librarians do on a daily basis.
2.3.2 The Empathetic Researcher
The concept of researcher as reflexive has a rich history outside of LIS. In some cases,
researchers have participated as part of the data collection process through qualitative methods
such as participant observation and autoethnography (Ellis, Adams, & Bochner, 2011; Kawulich,

32

2005). Anthropology and sociology are two fields in which participant observation, ethnography,
and autoethnography have become standard data collection methods (Reed-Danahay, 2009;
Walford, 2009). As demonstrated in women’s studies, feminist researchers have incorporated
reflexivity, autoethnography, power, and positionality into their research (Ali, 2015; England,
2008; Grant, 2014)
2.3.3 Pastoral Care
Pastoral care is a concept with roots in agricultural and clerical scholarship, but it has
been applied to the educational setting since the 1970s (Best, 1999a). In 19th century, British
scholars and educators began to recognize the role that teachers had in the “general and moral
welfare” of students (Best, 1999b, p. 55). By the late 1970s, pastoral care had become deeply
entrenched in the British educational system. Marland’s 1974 publication of Pastoral Care,
widely regarded as a pivotal work on pastoral care in education, demonstrated the importance of
this concept within school systems (Best, 1999a). Recently, pastoral care has been connected
with the work of school librarians (Shaper & Streatfield, 2012). Pastoral care encompasses
several empathetic dimensions including “general support and positive relationships”,
“contributing to social inclusion, self-esteem and appropriate behavior”, and “providing
emotional support through professional engagement with individuals” (Shaper & Streatfield,
2012, p. 67-68).
An unexpected finding from a survey of school librarians in the U.K., Shaper and
Streatfield (2012) uncovered the heavy importance school librarians place on the pastoral role
they provide students. Parents, teachers, school administrators, and the community often
overlook this “one-on-one pastoral engagement” between librarians and their young patrons

33

(Shaper & Streatfield, 2012, p. 68). In cyberbullying support, pastoral care can take the form of
bibliotherapy, outside referrals, programming, workshops, and mentorship.
2.3.4 Library as a Safe Space
The library as a safe and supportive space for youth has been discussed regularly in
practitioner publications like Library Journal and School Library Monthly (Cronin, 2001; Jones,
2008; Morris, 2013; Tukhareli, 2011). These discussions typically provide practicing librarians
with suggestions for designing welcoming library spaces, lists of professional resources for
supporting adolescents, and anecdotes of librarians’ interactions with vulnerable young patrons.
Books are highlighted as one tool librarians can use to reach out to children and young adults.
The professional term within LIS for this service is bibliotherapy. Bibliotherapy is “the
systematic use of books to help people cope with mental, physical, emotional, or social
problems” (Tukhareli, 2011, p. 2). Reading as a form of therapy is well-established in health
care, psychology, education, and LIS literature (Bratton, 1957; Forrest, 1998; Schlenther, 1999).
While librarians are not trained therapists or social workers, they are trained in reader’s advisory,
reference, and collection development, which support the delivery of bibliotherapy (Morris,
2013).
Along with providing access to information, librarians encourage “positive peer
relationships”, “problem-solving skills”, “social skills”, and stress management (Jurkowski,
2006, p. 81). All of which take place in the “safe haven” of the library (Cronin, 2001, p. 70).
Libraries and librarians offer patrons a welcoming, non-judgmental, and supportive environment
for leisure, school, and work activities (Jurkowski, 2006). For some young adults, libraries
function as safe spaces; refuges from difficulties at school, work, or home (Jurkowski, 2006).
The physical library is a natural space for sharing, exploration, interaction, and reflection by

34

young patrons (Jurkowski, 2006). Some youth may not have the opportunity to freely take part in
these activities while at home or school. Librarians serve as non-threatening role models without
the supervisory persona of teachers, parents, religious leaders, or school administrators (Braun et
al., 2014). Without this obvious imposing presence, cyberbullied, stressed, or otherwise troubled
young adults may feel more comfortable expressing fears, frustrations, doubts, and uncertainties
to librarians.
2.4 Cyberbullying Prevention and Intervention in the Library
Braun et al. (2014) described public and school libraries as “connected learning centers”
where the “personal, work-related, and academic” learning of young adults are supported (p. 10).
In addition to the more traditional library services of readers’ advisory, reference, and collection
development, librarians have the opportunity to take more of a leadership role in teaching digital
literacy skills that can prevent cyberbullying. These skills include analyzing personal online
choices, online message interpretation, online content creation, understanding media issues, and
taking action (Braun et al., 2014). Regular after-school workshops, discussions, and
programming about online safety, online privacy, online interactions, and empathy are
recommended (Agosto et al., 2012). There are currently libraries that are incorporating digital
literacy into the programming and activities they already offer. For example, the New York
Library Association has partnered with the New York Office of Cyber Security to produce New
York Libraries: Leading the Way to Digital Literacy. Through “train-the-trainer” workshops,
library staff learns how to train the public about digital literacy in a more standardized and
uniform way (DLNY, 2015, ¶ 7).
Teen Tech Week (TTW) is an annual national initiative supported by YALSA. The
purpose of this week is to “ensure that teens are competent and ethical users of digital media”

35

(YALSA, 2015, ¶ 3). By connecting mindfully with young patrons through programming, events
like TTW, and one-on-one informal training, librarians serve as mentors, partners, and allies
rather than “authoritative” adults (Braun et al., 2014, p. 20). Through relationships formed during
library activities, programming, and relaxed interactions, librarians’ further support young adults
by connecting them, as needed, to local community organizations (e.g. crisis centers, suicide
hotlines, or teen pregnancy support centers) (Braun et al., 2014).
2.4.1 21st Century Skills
While a significant amount of cyberbullying research emphasizes intervention, it is “more
effective and much more beneficial” to focus on eliminating cyberbullying before it occurs
(Agosto et al., 2012, p. 41). For prevention of cyberbullying, education on digital literacy, digital
citizenship, and healthy online relationships is key (Agosto et al., 2012). In many cases,
librarians already support this type of education by regularly serving as information literacy
instructors. Librarians have a critical role in educating the public, in particular tweens and young
adults, about the responsible use of digital technologies (Braun et al., 2014). Serving as
“knowledge navigators” and “technological gatekeepers”, librarians assist young patrons in
understanding online information overload, honing technology skills, and recognizing the
complex messages shared through an online environment (Melchionda, 2007, p. 133).
The Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2014) developed a framework that “presents a
holistic view of 21st century teaching and learning” (¶ 1). One focus of this framework is on the
information, media, and technology skills students should possess in order to participate fully in
the digital world around them. Along with academic knowledge, skills such as problem solving,
collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking are necessary to successfully participate in today’s
online world (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2014). For social media in particular,

36

supporting the development of these skills in the library or classroom can have an impact on the
ways in which youth engage online.
This slight shift in focus within education from teaching strictly academic-related skills
towards teaching all encompassing life and career skills reflects a similar shift in library services
as noted by Braun et al. (2014). Although the 21st Century Skills are geared towards classroom
instruction, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) (2009) modified and applied
these skills to better reflect the services that libraries and museums offer adolescents. For
preventing and intervening in cyberbullying, librarians are already developing programming,
informal activities, and one-on-one training that address the information and media literacies
supported by this framework.
2.4.2 The Whole Child
In 2007, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) began
the Whole Child Initiative as “an effort to change the conversation about education from a focus
on narrowly defined academic achievement to one that promotes the long term development and
success of children.” (ASCD, 2014, ¶ 4). This initiative focuses on five tenets -- healthy, safe,
engaged, supported, challenged – that should be supported within the community and schools
(ASCD, 2014). Educating the whole child involves educating students about “effective listening,
conflict resolution, problem solving, personal reflection and responsibility, and ethical decisionmaking.” (ASCD, 2013, ¶ 7). Feeling safe, both physically and emotionally, is critical for
successful learning, engagement, and relationship development. Cyberbullying and face-to-face
bullying can make previously safe and supportive environments, like home and school, terrifying
for victims.

37

Applied in the Whole Child approach, socio-emotional learning is a process that “focuses
on development of social-emotional competencies” (Yoder, 2013, p. 2). Not only are socioemotional competencies essential for future success, but these competencies also encourage
youth to seek help when needed, manage difficult situations, and understand emotions (Yoder,
2013). Young adults who are well-developed in these socio-emotional competencies are better
able to understand and manage their own emotions, identify social cues, and predict the feelings
and emotions of others; the development of such skills are valuable when combating
cyberbullying (Yoder, 2013).
2.6 Summary
Today’s young adults have been raised in a digital world in which instant communication
and continuous connection is commonplace (Itō et al., 2008). Social media provides adolescents
with a space to reinforce offline friendships, meet new friends, and construct identities (boyd,
2008). Along with friendships, young adults are going online to create, share, and evaluate
information. These digital activities combine work and play, school and home; encouraging
learning to occur outside of the structure of the traditional classroom. Social media can be a
place for positive mental and social development of youth (boyd, 2008)
Research into young adults’ use of social media rarely makes distinctions between the
online activities of urban, suburban, and rural young adults (Ahn, 2011; boyd & Heer, 2006;
Subrahmanyam et al., 2008). However, like urban and suburban youth, rural adolescents are
active Internet users and increasingly engaged on social media (FRS, 2013). Because Internet
connectivity can be difficult to access in rural and remote areas, rural youth often rely on school
and public libraries to go online (Braun et al., 2014). In rural libraries, young adults find not only

38

access to reliable Internet, but also a safe and nurturing environment for learning, relaxing, and
socializing (Smith, 2003).
As rural youth become more connected, risk for exposure to cyberbullying and other
online violence grows (Madden, 2012). Cyberbullying is a form of online aggression carried out
between peers, similar in some ways to traditional face-to-face bullying, but different in others
(Agosto et al., 2012). Unlike face-to-face bullying, cyberbullying can occur anywhere and at
anytime, leaving young adults feeling depressed, anxious, and fearful (Kiriakidis & Kavoura,
2010). These experiences have a negative and long-lasting impact on the health and happiness of
a young adult (Giménez Gualdo et al., 2014; Messias et al., 2014).
In prior research, educators, parents, and school officials have each been discussed as
sources of help and guidance for cyberbullied young adults (boyd & Hargittai, 2013; D’Auria,
2014; NSF, 2012). However, librarians as a source of support for victims have yet to be
thoroughly examined. For many youth, the library is a safe and welcoming space from
sometimes-difficult home and/or school lives (Jones & Delahanty, 2011; Shaper & Streatfield,
2012; Tukhareli, 2011). This study will illustrate how rural librarians use empathy to support all
rural young adults, and how this type of support is particularly important for cyberbullied rural
young adults.
In this study, I analyzed the perceptions of both rural young adults and rural school and
public librarians regarding support for rural cyberbullied young adults. This study presented and
examined empathetic services as one avenue for librarians to help young victims of
cyberbullying. In the following chapter (Chapter 3), the methods used to conduct these
investigations will be addressed.

39

CHAPTER THREE
METHOD
This chapter will review the study’s problem, importance, research questions, purpose,
methodology, and impact. The main intention of this chapter is provide an overview of the
study’s data collection and analysis process.
3.1 Restatement of Problem
Young adults’ use of social media has grown quickly. In 2006, 55% of young adults used
social media; in 2012, 81% reported being social media users. (Madden et al., 2013). As
adolescents have become more engaged with social networking sites, they are sharing more
information about themselves online. Through profiles, posts, and uploads, young adults are
offering photos, addresses, phone numbers, and locations (Madden et al., 2013). As a result of
this openness, young adults leave themselves vulnerable to online harassment including
cyberbullying. In a 2011 survey of online young adults, Lenhart et al. found that 88% had
observed mean or cruel behavior on social media. Fifteen percent of those surveyed reported
being the target of such attacks (Lenhart et al., 2011). Although not every unkind post or
message on social media constitutes cyberbullying, these behaviors can quickly escalate and
have serious repercussions. To help cope with these experiences, young adults need the support
of adults, friends, and communities.
3.2 Restatement of Importance/Significance of Problem
Typically in cyberbullying cases, young victims are reluctant to seek help from adults
(Sticca & Perren, 2012). Believing adults are unable to intervene, that intervention will cause the
harassment to worsen, or that intervention will cause online privileges to be taken away, victims
often attempt to solve the problem themselves or with the help of friends (Juvonen & Gross,

40

2008; Mason, 2008). While parents, grandparents, and teachers have been examined as sources
of support for victims, little research has focused on the supportive role of librarians. Young
adults are frequent users of both public and school libraries, which are safe and neutral spaces for
“adolescents to grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially” (Braun et al., 2014, p. 1).
Librarians have a more relaxed and informal relationship with teens when compared with the
relationships between teens and teachers, principals, or parents. Because of this, librarians serve
an important “non-supervisory” role in the lives of youth (Braun et al., 2014, p. 10). This role
encourages adolescents to share feelings, concerns, and experiences with librarians that they may
be reluctant to admit to a parent or teacher. As a result, librarians can, and often already do
without being aware, help cyberbullied young adults in conjunction with parents, teachers, and
other community members. Librarians, through day-to-day interactions with young patrons, offer
guidance through programming, readers’ advisory, informal instruction, and empathetic services
(Jones, 2008; Tukhareli, 2011).
3.3 Restatement of Research Questions
This study integrates three perspectives: rural young adults, rural school librarians, and
rural public librarians, especially as they pertain to empathetic services provided to cyberbullied
young adults. This study addressed the following questions:
RQ1: What types of empathy and support have rural young adults received from rural
librarians?
RQ2: What empathy and support do rural young adults want to receive from rural
librarians?
RQ3: What empathy and support do rural librarians provide rural young adults?
RQ4: What empathy and support do rural librarians want to provide rural young adults?

41

3.4 Restatement of Purpose
The purpose of this study is to highlight the important, but often unacknowledged, role
empathy plays in the everyday work of rural public and school librarians. Through semistructured interviews and structured video autoethnographies with rural adolescents and rural
school and public librarians, the honest and expressive voices of these young adults, public
librarians, and school librarians can be heard. Without the input and reflections of each
population, it is challenging to develop staff training, programming, and services that
successfully support and help young patrons, specifically those who are victims of online
violence (Bowler et al., 2014).
Librarians will be highlighted as a potential source of support for cyberbullied young
adults. Parents, teachers, and school administrators have been promoted as resources for young
adults to seek out when experiencing and/or witnessing cyberbullying (boyd & Hargittai, 2013;
D’Auria, 2014; Messias, Kindrick, & Castro, 2014). Librarians are often overlooked or relegated
to “other adults” classification. However, librarians provide mental, emotional, and
psychological support to patrons during day-to-day duties (Shaper & Streatfield, 2012).
“Empathetic services” is one avenue through which librarians can support cyberbullied young
adults.
3.5 Methodology
3.5.1 Research Design Overview
This study combined two qualitative methods – structured autoethnography and semistructured interviews. Qualitative research explores the “whys and hows of human behavior,
opinion, and experience,” two questions that are specifically asked in this dissertation (Guest et
al., 2013, p. 1). The use of qualitative methods in research allows investigation of problems that

42

would be difficult to achieve through more quantitative and highly controlled methods (Guest et
al., 2013). Used in combination, structured autoethnography and semi-structured interviews
contributed to a deeper understanding of empathetic services and cyberbullying from the
perspectives of young adults and the librarians who serve them. A diagram of the study’s data
collection and analysis procedures can be found below:

Figure 3.1: Data Collection and Analysis

3.5.2 Semi-Structured Interviewing
The interview method is one of the most frequently used methods for data collection
(Doody & Noonan, 2013). Semi-structured interviews permit researchers to collect rich and
complex data, “understand people’s lives as they are lived” (Doody & Noonan, 2013, p. 28).
Through the interview process, the inner lives of interviewees can be discovered (Mason & Ide,
2014). While interviewing, researchers explore questions or problems that may be difficult to
investigate through more quantitative data collection methods. For exploratory research, like this
study, interviews are valuable as they allow a researcher to improve knowledge of a new or little

43

understood area. For interviewees, the interview method provides an opportunity to share
experiences, thoughts, concerns, and stories with another human being (Mason & Ide, 2014). In
this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven rural adolescents and seven
rural school and public librarians before the participants recorded the structured
autoethnographies.
3.5.3 Structured Autoethnography
Ethnography can be a misunderstood term among researchers (Walford, 2009).
Ethnography has been characterized by some as encompassing all qualitative research, and
described by others as strictly a tool for anthropologists (Walford, 2009). Despite terminological
confusion, ethnography allows researchers “the best opportunity to examine various phenomena
as perceived by participants” (Shaffir, 1999, p. 676). Structured autoethnography falls under the
umbrella of ethnographic research, but it is distinct from the more classical approaches such as
participant and unobtrusive observation (Schensul & LeCompte, 2013). This method allows for
collection of an individual’s (whether a researcher or participant) personal narratives and
reflections through written, audio, and/or visual recordings (Coffey & Atkinson, 1996).
Structured autoethnography can be compared to semi-structured interviewing (Hampshire, Iqbal,
Blell, & Simpson, 2014). Structured and semi-structured interviews “utilize a protocol that
contains planned questions in order to avoid digression from your data collection plan” (Chang,
2008, p. 104). In this study, structured autoethnography took the form of video entries recorded
by seven rural young adult and seven rural librarian participants. Participants were given prewritten prompts to help guide the video responses they recorded.
In this study, I took part in reflective research by maintaining a written journal
throughout data collection and analysis. This journal allowed me to reflect on the design of the

44

interview questions and video prompts; each interview experience; and capture personal
reflections during the data collection process. Notes, comments, and questions were recorded in
this journal before, after, and as needed. The journal supplied me with ideas for possible codes
and categories used during subsequent analysis. In part, I structured this journal to flow along
with each interview and video autoethnography, serving as a place where I documented my
reflections, concerns, struggles, failures, and success while collecting data for this study.
3.5.4 Target Population and Sample
I collected data within four counties of rural Southwest Georgia. I selected this region for
several reasons. First, I grew up in Lee County, Georgia, one of the 14 counties within Southwest
Georgia. Prior to entering the doctoral program in the School of Information at Florida State
University, I worked as a librarian in one of the public library systems within this region. Due to
my previous librarian work in this area, I am familiar with the local librarian community and
school and library systems. But, truthfully, I chose this region because I love Southwest Georgia
and its people. I am a passionate advocate for small and rural libraries, who recognizes the
importance of these libraries in their communities and the need for significant research about
rural libraries, rural youth, and rural communities.
One single-county school district and three public library systems in three separate
counties of Southwest Georgia served as sites for recruiting teens and librarians. A total of 14
participants took part in this research: seven young adults (four female, three male) and seven
librarians (three school, four public). Figure 3.2 provides the pseudonym, gender, age, and
library or non-library user status for each young adult participant. Figure 3.3 provides the
pseudonym, gender, librarian status, and age for each librarian participant.

Figure 3.3 Librarian Participants
Because this study is exploratory and not intended to be generalizable, a random sample

was not required. Instead, I used existing contacts in my social network and relied upon snowball
sampling to recruit participants who met the study’s required criteria (Oliver, 2006). Youth
participants were not recruited on school grounds. In fact, the majority of this study’s data
collection occurred during summer break. Youth participants were recruited via study flyers in
local public libraries, coffee shops, youth church groups, and through recommendations from

46

participating librarians. The criteria for this study were broad. Young adult participants needed to
be between the ages of 12 and 18 and live in Southwest Georgia. Librarian participants needed to
posses a MLIS/MLIS degree and work in a school or public library in Southwest Georgia.
Southwest Georgia is comprised of 14 counties with an economy driven largely by
agriculture, manufacturing, and construction (University System of Georgia (USG), 2013).
According to the 2013 U.S. Census Community Survey, the area has a population of
approximately 356,405, and a racial make up of 52.4% Caucasians, 43.1% African Americans,
and 4.9% Hispanics. The four counties are similar in percentage of youth residents. In County
One, 23.6% of the population is under 18 years old (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015a), and 26.9% of
County Two’s population is under 18 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015b). In County Three, 25.4 % of
the population is under 18 years old (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015c), and 24.7% of County Four’s
population is under 18 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015d). Overall, 24.9% of Georgia’s population is
under 18 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015a). In many ways, Southwest Georgian youth live in an
impoverished and struggling environment. Historically, Southwest Georgia has struggled with
persistent poverty and this trend continues into the 21st century (University of Georgia (UGA),
2003). Poverty has had an impact on the quality of life for Southwest Georgian youth including
“disproportionately high rates of juvenile arrests, high school dropouts, infant mortality, and teen
pregnancy” (UGA, 2003, p. 6).
3.5.5 Data Collection Procedures
For practical reasons, I began data collection with the seven rural librarian participants. I
needed to interview the rural school librarians before the school year finished. Additionally, I
needed to interview the rural public librarians before summer reading programs began. First,
these participants attended a brief orientation session via e-mail. Busy with the nearing end of the

47

school year, the librarian participants preferred an e-mail orientation session. Over the course of
these e-mails, I provided details about the research process including what to expect, benefits
from participating, any consequences of participation, and scheduled the interviews. Prior to
scheduling the librarian interviews, I developed an interview script. This script can be found in
Appendix A.
After the script was finalized and interviews scheduled, interviews with the seven
librarians began. These interviews were slightly longer than those with the rural teen
participants. The librarian interviews averaged about 50 minutes in length, with water, snacks,
and/or restroom breaks available if needed. Each interview was conducted in a private room in
the participant’s library. Only the interviewee and myself were present during these interviews.
The prepared questions for the librarians served as a guide and provided structure for the
conversation. However, questions, at times, were omitted, adjusted, or added depending on the
responses of each participant. At the end of each interview, I thanked the participant and shared
my contact information for any questions or concerns that may arise later.
At the close of each librarian interview, I discussed the structured autoethnographies,
including what would be expected of each participant (record one video entry), how long the
video entry should be (approximately 10 minutes), how to upload the entry to the secure website
selected for the project, and a tutorial on the basics of video-recording (if requested). Librarian
participants received a $25 gift card upon completion of the semi-structured interviews and
structured autoethnographies. Each gift card was included along with a personalized thank you
note mailed to each participant.
For the structured autoethnographies, I provided the librarian participants with prompts
composed of brief instructions and five questions. These prompts served as a guide and include

48

hypothetical scenarios (“What if?”), allowing participants to reflect on their own experiences
with support for rural young adults, librarianship, and cyberbullying. The librarian prompt can be
found in Appendix B.
Each participant recorded a video entry on a personal electronic device (a camera phone,
a camera attached to a computer/laptop/iPad, etc.). After the participant recorded this entry,
he/she uploaded the file to the chosen secure website. In this study, I selected FSU Dropbox
Service because of security, ease of use, and reliability. The content of this Dropbox Service was
accessible only by me. As each of the seven of the librarian participants submitted their entries, I
began analysis. Once all seven librarians submitted their videos, I had collected approximately
64 minutes of content for emergent themes.
I continued data collection with the seven rural young adult participants. First, these
participants attended a brief orientation session via e-mail. Since the teens preferred the online
option instead of offered phone or face-to-face meetings, an e-mail orientation was used. Over
the course of these e-mails, I provided details about the research process including what to
expect, benefits from participating, any consequences of participation, and then scheduled the
interviews. Prior to scheduling the teen interviews, I developed an interview script. This script
can be found in Appendix C.
Once the interview script was developed and interviews scheduled, I started interviewing
the seven rural young adult participants. Five of the teen interviews took place face-to-face in a
private room of a participating public library. One teen interview took place face-to-face in
private room of a school library. The final teen interview took place online over FaceTime. Only
the adolescent interviewee and myself were present during each interview. Before the start of
each interview, I discussed the process with the interviewee, including the ability to end the

49

interview at any time. I also briefly described how the recorded interview would be used and
encouraged the participant to ask questions. Each young adult interview lasted approximately 30
minutes with water, snacks, and/or restroom breaks available if necessary. The prepared
questions provided structure for the interview process, but the participants controlled the
direction of the conversation. Questions were omitted, changed, and added to the script
depending on the responses of the teen participants. At the end of each interview, I thanked the
participant and provided contact information in case of any follow-up questions.
At the close of each rural young adult interview, I explained the structured
autoethnographies, including what would be expected of each participant (record one video
entry), how long the video entry should be (approximately 10 minutes), how to upload the entry
to the secure website selected for the project, and a tutorial on the basics of video-recording (if
requested). Young adult participants received a $25 gift card upon completion of the semistructured interviews and structured autoethnographies. Each gift card was included along with a
personalized thank you note mailed to each participant.
For the structured autoethnographies, I provided the rural teen participants with prompts
composed of brief instructions and four questions. These prompts served as a guide and include
hypothetical scenarios (“What if?”), allowing participants to reflect on their own experiences
with social media, friendship, cyberbullying, and adult support. The teen prompt can be found in
Appendix D.
Once the teen interviews were completed and all participant videos were collected, the
data collection process for the study officially ended. During data collection, transcription and
data analysis had been ongoing.

3.5.6 Data Analysis Procedures
For the purposes of this study, I selected Charmaz’s approach to grounded theory as the
most appropriate data analysis tool. Developed by Glaser and Strauss in 1967, grounded theory
refers to “the discovery of theory from data – systematically obtained and analyzed in social
research” (Charmaz, 2000, p. 1). Grounded theory can be incorporated into both qualitative and
quantitative research, and function as both a research method and an approach to theory
construction (Scott, 2009). Different variations of grounded theory currently exist including
Charmaz’s (2000). This study applied Charmaz’s approach to grounded theory. One appeal to
her approach are these encouraging words from Charmaz (2006), “Grounded theory methods
foster seeing your data in fresh ways and exploring your ideas through early analytic writing.”
(p. 2). Charmaz’s work is reflective of the need in exploratory research for “systematic, yet
flexible guidelines for collection and analyzing qualitative data”(2006, p. 2). Because this study
is exploratory, the emergence of categories and themes from the data itself was needed to help
develop a clearer understanding of the research questions. Although grounded theory is
commonly used for theory construction, this study used grounded theory to assist in discovering
key categories that will eventually be used to help refine relational communication theory for
future application in LIS research (Dey, 1999).
I consistently engaged in memoing during each phase of the analysis (Charmaz, 2006).
Memoing is an integral component of grounded theory during which a researcher keeps notes on
data collection, coding, relationships between codes, theory development, and the overall
research process (Scott, 2009). Additionally, memoing assisted in the eventual creation of this
study’s codebook.

51

When using grounded theory, data is analyzed as it is collected (Scott, 2009). Each of the
four sections of data (interviews with rural librarians, video entries with rural librarians,
interviews with rural young adults, video entries with rural young adults) underwent collection
and analysis simultaneously. I became familiar with the data by carefully transcribing each
interview and video entry, and through multiple listening’s of interview audio recordings and
multiple viewing’s of participant videos. After transcription, I began with initial coding. Initial
coding involves open coding, a process in which the data is carefully scrutinized for emerging
categories or themes (Charmaz, 2006). Through the mechanical process of transcription and open
coding, the researcher will discover potential categories, links, and meanings (Braun & Clarke,
2006.) Along with the words said by the participants, I kept records of any non-verbal
expressions made during the interviews and videos (e.g., shrugs, eye rolls, pauses, sighs). Data
was visited and revisited multiple times until codes and themes become formalized (Scott, 2009).
Through “constant comparative methods”, data was closely reviewed and compared against one
another for similarities and differences (Charmaz, 2006, p. 54). This process occurs throughout
the data collection and analysis periods (Dey, 1999)
One of grounded theory’s strengths is its flexibility, a strength that is particularly useful
in exploratory research like this study (Charmaz, 2006). Grounded theory can be used alongside
other qualitative methods including thematic analysis. The flexibility of grounded theory allows
researchers to interpret and reinterpret themes until a clearer understanding of the data is
achieved (Charmaz, 2006). The researcher applied an inductive approach when analyzing the
data (Cho & Lee, 2014). Themes emerged from the data based on what the researcher is
investigating and the researcher’s understanding of the area being investigated (Srivastava &

52

Hopwood, 2009). Through this “deeply reflective process,” new insights, connections, and
understandings can be attained (Srivastava & Hopwood, 2009, p.77).
3.5.7 Reliability and Validity
For qualitative researchers, the terms “reliability” and “validity” have different meanings
than the reliability and validity applied in quantitative research (Golafshani, 2003). In
quantitative research, credibility “depends on instrument construction”, but in qualitative
research, “the researcher is the instrument” (Golafshani, 2003, p. 600). The use of narrative
inquiry in the form of structured autoethnographies and similar qualitative methods requires
reimagining of reliability and validity (Webster & Mertova, 2007). Within the qualitative
paradigm, the researcher is fully involved and engrossed in a research project (Webster &
Mertova, 2007). As a researcher begins to explore the lived experiences of a population or
culture while also reflecting on his or her experiences, remaining objective, the goal in
quantitative research, becomes difficult (Golafshani, 2003). Reliability and validity are not seen
as two separate concepts, but instead are seen as interrelated and incorporating related concepts
such as trustworthiness, confirmability, and credibility (Morse et al., 2008).
To ensure reliability and validity in this study, triangulation is one technique that was
applied. Triangulation is “a strategy (test) for improving the validity and reliability of research or
evaluation findings” (Golafshani, 2003, p. 603). Two qualitative methods, semi-structured
interviews and structured autoethnography, offset one another’s limitations and supported one
another’s strengths (Shenton, 2004). Used together, insights and reflections gathered from one
method helped when analyzing the other and provided for a deeper understanding of the data.
Member checking is a well-established tool for assessing trustworthiness in qualitative
research (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Through member checking, participants will “judge the

53

accuracy and credibility of the accounts” (Creswell, 2013, p. 252). This tool provides a number
of benefits for qualitative research including valuable perspectives of the population group(s),
error correction, confirmation of interpretations, and additional observations (Cohen & Crabtree,
2006). One rural young adult and one rural librarian participant provided feedback on the themes
and interpretations developed by the researcher. After data analysis ended, I shared one
anonymized librarian interview and video transcript to a selected rural librarian participant and
one anonymized young adult interview and video transcript to a selected rural young adult
participant. All names and identifying comments were removed in all documents provided to the
two participants. The participants had a short period of time to review the findings
(approximately one week). Then, the researcher and participants had an informal meeting to
discuss the findings.
When initial coding was completed, one additional coder, drawn from my professional
community, analyzed a select number of interview and video transcripts. According to Creswell
(2013), the use of coders provides an outside check on “the highly interpretative coding process”
(p. 253). For this study, intercoder agreement refers to the shared coding and themes among a
group of coders (Carey, Morgan, & Oxtoby, 1996). The coder was supplied with the study’s pilot
codebook and data coding instructions; then the researcher and additional coder separately coded
four transcripts: one librarian interview, one librarian video, one teen interview, and one teen
video. Due to the exploratory nature of this study and the small amount of data collected,
statistical analysis of intercoder agreement was not necessary. Instead, after the completion of
coding, I met with the coder to review, line-by-line, the codes we each assigned to the four
transcripts. Due to slight differences and disagreements between the coder and myself, a small
amount of corrections, additions, and clarifications to the codebook was necessary.

54

3.5.7 Establishing Credibility with Participants
Because this study focused specifically on the voices and narratives of rural librarians
and rural young adults, I placed heavy importance on establishing credibility with participants
and ensuring that participant voices were truly represented (James & Busher, 2006). Credibility
works alongside reliability and validity in establishing the trustworthiness of a study (James &
Busher, 2006). In research, it is necessary to establish credibility with the participants and
establish the credibility of the research findings (Cutcliffe & McKenna, 1999). As discussed in
the previous section, determining the credibility of findings relied upon member checking,
triangulation, and my knowledge of the research area.
I established credibility with rural librarian and rural adolescent participants in several
ways. During the librarian and adolescent e-mail orientations, before data collection officially
began, I introduced myself, thanked the participants for their involvement, and expressed
enthusiasm for the project. I engaged with adolescent and librarian participants in a professional
and courteous manner throughout the project. Participants were encouraged to contact me with
any questions or concerns. Additionally, the informed consent/assent/permission forms
demonstrated my professional and ethical considerations. These forms detail the steps I took
during the study to ensure participants were treated respectfully and appropriately.
3.5.8 Advantages and Disadvantages of the Methods
3.5.8.1 Semi-Structured Interview Advantages
The interview method is highly flexible and can be adjusted to fit the requirements of
different participant groups, such as age, ethnicity, disability, or reading/writing abilities
(DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). There are several formats available for interviews including
face-to-face, e-mail, text, or video (Meho, 2006). Specific formats may be necessary depending

55

on location, time, or special circumstances of an interviewee or researcher. Using semistructured interviews, researchers are able to adjust questions, develop new questions, provide an
explanation for a question, present a probe, and ask for more detail about a participant’s response
(Doody & Noonan, 2013). Likewise, interviewees can ask for clarification about a question or
request additional information about the study or their participation. Because there are
opportunities for clarification and detailed responses, more complex questions than those
typically asked in surveys and focus groups can be presented (Doody & Noonan, 2013).
Interviews can be useful for supporting other data collection methods used in a study.
This is refers to methodological triangulation, or “using more than one method to gather data.”
(Wilson, 2014, p. 74). Through triangulation, the validity of a study’s design can be improved
(Wilson, 2014). Along with increasing validity, the interview method adds to the information
gathered through other methods including surveys, experiments, or observation. Interviews may
provide support for data collection through these methods or suggest new directions for future
research. In this study, semi-structured interviews supported data gathered from the structured
autoethnographies.
3.5.8.2 Semi-Structured Interview Disadvantages
The interview method has several limitations that should be considered when designing a
study involving this method. Participants may feel uncomfortable sharing information with
researchers, especially about sensitive or culturally taboo topics. The interview process, with its
many questions and probes presented by the researcher, may appear intrusive or cruel to
participants (Doody & Noonan, 2013). Researchers strive to develop an engaging and friendly
relationship with participants, but establishing rapport can be difficult to build and maintain
(Mealer & Jones, 2014). Rapport is the “trusting relationship with research participants” that

56

encourages them to “overcome the barriers and fears that would prevent honest disclosure”
(Mealer & Jones, 2014, p. 34). When rapport is achieved, an interviewee will feel comfortable
sharing experiences, feelings, thoughts, and concerns with a researcher.
The interview method can be time-consuming, mentally exhausting, and expensive
(Doody & Noonan, 2013). Each interview must be recorded, either through audio, video, written,
or a combination of these formats (Mealer & Jones, 2014; Meho, 2006). Technical issues may
occur during an interview, which may disrupt the flow of an interview and confuse the
participant (Myers & Newman, 2007). The recorded interviews will need to be transcribed and
then analyzed. Interviews provide a significant amount of information, which is both an
advantage and disadvantage. Even when analysis software is purchased and used, any data
analysis will require substantial time and energy (Doody & Noonan, 2013). Depending on the
participant group, small incentives such as gift cards or extra credit may be necessary.
“Incentives can be used to recruit subjects in many situations without any ethical qualms where
all other ethical criteria are met” (Grant & Sugarman, 2004, p. 732). The cost of these incentives
for the researcher can quickly grow as the number of needed participants increases.
2.5.8.3 Structured Autoethnography Advantages
Autoethnography involves analysis of a researcher’s personal narratives or the personal
narratives of participants in a cultural group or population through the lens of relevant literature
(Richards & Morse, 2007). In structured autoethnography, the researcher places some restraints
of the narratives of participants often through the use of specific questions or prompts (Chang,
2008). By doing so, the researcher is able to draw responses that fall within the area of the
research questions under study (Chang, 2008). Chang (2008) describes autoethnography as
“researcher-friendly”, because this method offers researchers an intimate look at primary data (p.

57

52). When compared with research conducted using other methods, autoethnography allows for
easier data collection, analysis, and interpretation, particularly if a researcher is using himself or
herself as a primary source (Richards & Morse, 2007).
Another advantage of autoethnography is the self-reflection and self-examination this
method encourages in researchers and participants (Chang, 2008). Whether a researcher writes a
narrative or analyzes the narratives of participants, he or she is looking both outward and inward
during this process (Reed-Danahay, 2009). For researchers, autoethnography offers valuable
insider and outsider perspectives (Reed-Danahay, 2009). First, the researcher externally analyzes
the norms, characteristics, beliefs, and values of a population or cultural group (Richards &
Morse, 2007). Then, while interpreting the writings of participants, the researcher experiences a
deeper awareness of cultural meanings and behaviors through the analysis of the insider views
participants provide through their narratives (Spry, 2001)
For readers, autoethnography offers a more appealing and intimate read than that of more
traditional academic writing (Chang, 2008). Instead of detached and theoretical reports,
autoethnography incorporates personal stories, authentic voices, and illustrative descriptions into
an examination of self-reflection and personal scrutiny (Chang, 2008). Often, autoethnography
research is written in first-person voice, highlighting the storytelling roots of this method (Forest,
2007). This type of writing encourages the reader to “relieve the experience rather than interpret
or analyze what the author is saying” (Schwandt, 2007, p. 17); experiences that can be difficult
to achieve within the quantitative paradigm.
3.5.8.4 Structured Autoethnography Disadvantages
While offering many advantages, there are challenges to conducting autoethnography that
should be examined. A key disadvantage to autoethnography is the tendency to stress narrative

58

over analysis and interpretation (Chang, 2008). Because self-narratives are entertaining to both
researchers and readers, it can be tempting to construct intricate stories and neglect the research’s
true purpose (Chang, 2008). To avoid storytelling without analysis, researchers must be mindful
of the intended function of collecting autoethnographies.
Another disadvantage relates to ethical concerns over confidentiality. There is a danger of
assuming confidentiality is not necessary when using autoethnography (Spry, 2001). This is
particularly true when researchers play multiple roles of author, informant, and researcher
(Chang, 2008). However, protecting confidentiality is as important in autoethnography as in any
qualitative or quantitative method. At times, the sharing of stories and reflections may involve
discussing the stories, names, and locations of others. It is necessary to protect the confidentiality
of anyone identified in a narrative, whether or not he or she is participating in the research
project (Chang, 2008). During reporting of research findings, fake names and locations should be
used. While recording the video entries or interviewing in this study, participants were not asked
to reveal full names or information that might identify someone else.
3.6 Research Permissions and Ethical Considerations
When questioning participants about sensitive, controversial, or difficult topics, a
researcher should strive to avoid causing the participant mental harm (Mealer & Jones, 2014).
This may involve providing psychological assistance if a participant become stressed or upset
during a research project (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). There is always the possibility of
unintentionally harming a participant as a result of interview questioning or conversations
(DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). Researchers should make every effort to protect those
participating in a study and allow the participant the opportunity to withdraw participation at any
time (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). Prior to beginning data collection for this study, the

59

researcher developed a safety plan to be used if a rural teen or adult participants became
distressed or extremely uncomfortable during an interview. The safety plan for adult participants
is a slightly modified version of the plan for young adults. The safety plan for young adult
participants can be founds in Appendix F.
After receiving IRB approval, I acquired written permission to conduct research from the
school board of the participating school system and library directors of the participating library
system. Recruited rural young adults were required to sign an informed assent form before
participating. An example of this assent form can be found in Appendix G.
The assent form clearly and simply describes what was asked of the adolescent
participants, what the purpose of the study is, and how the adolescent could agree or decline to
participate. At least one parent or guardian of a participating young adult was required to sign a
parental permission form. The permission form outlined the basics of the study, the involvement
of the young adult, risks and benefits, confidentiality, and the voluntary nature of the study. An
example of this form can be found in Appendix H.
Each rural librarian signed an informed consent form prior to participating. The consent
form briefly discussed the focus of the study, the procedures of participation, risks and benefits,
confidentiality, compensation, and ability to decline participation. An example of this form can
be found in Appendix I.
The language in all three forms is clear, direct, and easy to understand. My contact
information, including phone, e-mail, and mailing address, is provided on each form, as well as
my major professor’s name and contact information. The three forms -- assent, consent, and
parental permission -- are based on templates provided online by Florida State University’s
Human Subjects Office (FSU, 2015).

60

Privacy and confidentiality are crucial in research, as participants may reveal personal
information. I protected and securely stored the recordings and transcripts of the interviews and
autoethnographies of the participants (Mealer & Jones, 2014). Interview and video recordings
and transcripts were maintained in my password-protected laptop. Only I had access to this
laptop. Participants uploaded their video recordings to the FSU Dropbox Service that I selected
strictly for this study. Only I could retrieve this content. During the entirety of the data collection
and analysis process, only I had access to participant names and contact information, video and
interview recordings, transcripts, and any other related documentation. Once the study has been
completed, I will securely store these documents for one year. At the end of this one-year period,
I will destroy all lists of participants, recordings, and transcripts. Signed informed
consent/assent/permission forms will be safely maintained until three years after the completion
of the study. After three years have elapsed, I will destroy these forms.
During any subsequent dissertation reporting or publications related to the study, the
confidentiality of participants’ identities will be maintained. Fake or code names have been given
to participants to protect any information shared during video entries and interviews. The names
of the participating schools and public libraries will not be revealed at any point during reporting
or publishing. Throughout the research process, it is important that participants feel confident
that the information they provided shared with the researcher is safe and protected. I routinely
checked with participants to ensure that they were comfortable with their participation, knew
what to expect of this participation, and felt confident with their involvement in the research.
3.7 Impact of Research
The impact of this study is a potential improvement in both LIS research and practice.
Investigations into empathy in the library and those similar “softer” skills involved in

61

librarianship are limited (Birdi et al., 2008; Birdi et al., 2009). This study introduced “empathetic
services” as one opportunity for supporting cyberbullied young adults. Although cyberbullying
occurs through the public medium of social media, these aggressive behaviors are often invisible
to those outside of the teenage world (Ackers, 2012). Young adults are reluctant to share these
experiences with parents, teachers, or principals; as a result, adults are often unaware of the
extent and seriousness of these online attacks (boyd & Hargittai, 2013). However, librarians
perform a different role in the lives of teens, a role with different power and relationship
dynamics than that of parents and teachers. Because librarians have this more informal and
relaxed relationship with teen patrons, young adults may feel more comfortable expressing
challenges, negative experiences, and anxieties with librarians. Through the voices and narratives
of librarians and young adults, this study draws attention to critical importance of empathetic
services in the day-to-day work of rural librarians.
Librarians have long played a supportive role in the lives of patrons, particularly young
patrons, as part of everyday library duties. Currently, there is a limited amount of practitioner
and scholarly literature focusing on the supportive role of librarians and libraries for cyberbullied
victims (Agosto et al., 2012; Shanahan & Farmer, 2010). However, through empathetic services,
literacy instruction, digital citizenship training, and similar services, librarians have a crucial,
although presently unacknowledged, role in preventing and intervening in cyberbullying. A
possible future application of this research would be research-driven recommendations about
cyberbullying support for both school and public librarians. These recommendations could be
used as reference if a librarian suspects a case of cyberbullying or cyberbullying victimization
during an interaction with a young patron. Ideally, these recommendations will be further

62

developed through additional research and aid in the construction of an eventual best of practices
cyberbullying toolkit.
3.8 Summary of the Method
In this study, I used two qualitative methods: semi-structured interviews and structured
autoethnography. Through semi-structured interviews, researchers are permitted to participants’
understandings and unique perceptions about a specific topic or area under study (Turner, 2010).
Through autoethnography, the personal narratives, experiences, and voices of participants can be
analyzed and connected to better understand a cultural group (Ellis, Adams, & Bochner, 2011).
Charmaz’s approach to grounded theory will be used as a framework for data analysis. This
approach draws attention to categories and theory emerging directly from the data, as well as the
ability to interpret and reinterpret developing codes and categories (Charmaz, 2006). The
findings of these analyses will be discussed in Chapter 4.
Ethical considerations ensured the confidentiality, respect, and comfort of participants.
This study included both librarian and adolescent participants from four rural counties in
Southwest Georgia. Because minors were involved in this study, assent forms were required for
adolescent participants along with parental permission forms signed by at least one parent or
guardian. The school and public librarian participants were required to sign an adult consent
form. All forms were signed before data collection began.

63

CHAPTER FOUR
FINDINGS

In the previous three chapters, I provided an overview of this project, discussed the
relevant literature, and presented the research methods used in this project. Applying Charmaz’s
approach to grounded theory, I analyzed the rural librarian and rural teen interviews and video
autoethnographies concurrent with data collection and subsequent transcription. These
simultaneous analyses allowed me to undercover the types of support rural young adults received
from rural librarians; support rural young adults wanted to receive from rural librarians; support
rural librarians provided rural young adults; and the support rural librarians wanted to provide
rural young adults. In this chapter, I will present the findings of my analyses.
4.1 Results
In the following sections, I will discuss the results from my analyses in an effort to
explore my four research questions.
4.1.2. Analysis 1: Interview Transcript Analysis and Presentation of Codes
Both rural librarian and rural teen participants took part in individually scheduled
interviews during the summer of 2015. Librarian interviews lasted approximately 60 minutes
while teen interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes. Each interview took place prior to the
participant recording and submitting his/her video autoethnography. Since these interviews were
semi-structured, I constructed a brief series of questions before the interviews specifically for
each participant group: one set of questions for the rural librarians and another for the rural
young adults. While these questions provided structured for the discussion, I introduced
additional questions and probes as each interview progressed.

64

Now, I will present the categories and codes used during my interview analysis process.
The categories and codes were created through a combination of open coding and in vivo coding.
The use of in vivo coding in my research was critical as it allowed me to focus more intensely on
the actual words, perceptions, and reflections of the participants. Any in vivo coding is indicated
by quotation marks. I will begin with an introduction to the categories and codes for the rural
librarians; and follow with an introduction the categories and codes for the rural young adults.
For conciseness and readability, I did not include the many sub-codes and additional coding
notes and related detail in this portion of the chapter. Those sub-codes, notes, and participant
quotes will be presented later in the chapter as a master list of categories of codes.
In Appendix J, the four categories and related 34 codes used for the interview transcripts
are presented for the rural librarian participant group. In Appendix K, the four categories and
related 32 codes used for the interview transcripts are presented for the rural young adult
participant group.
4.1.2.1 Analysis of Rural Librarian Interview Transcripts
One category that emerged from the analysis is librarian roles. For the participants, the
major codes in this category were balancing professional and emotional roles as librarians,
developing professionally as a library leader, supporting both teachers and parents, identifying
what librarians “should” do, and significant discussion of “traditional” librarian work mainly
collection development.
The balancing professional and emotional roles code developed largely in response to my
questions about support for cyberbullied teen patrons and librarianship. Included in this concept
of balancing professional and emotional roles were discussions of cyberbullying coping and
avoiding techniques, concerns about legal consequences, and expressed desire for more training

65

on providing social, emotional, and psychological support. The code library leadership was
demonstrated particularly strong among school librarians. This code referred to taking on
additional roles in the school or community, supporting the school, community, and/or library
through activities, and overtly seeking more responsibilities. Both school and public librarian
participants discussed their support of parents and teachers. However, school librarians more
often highlighted how they supported teachers and administrators in their day-to-day work while
public librarians highlighted the ways in which they supported the parents of youth patrons and
overall rural community. The school librarians’ supportive (and diverse) role to teachers is
demonstrated in this quote from Jessica, a middle school librarian: “A lot of my work is focused
on technology in the labs with the kids. The school is down one IT person. I do classroom visits
every once and awhile. The teachers there are very self-sufficient and knowledgeable about tech.
I’m always around the school. I take pictures for the newspaper and scrapbooks.”
Rural librarian participants frequently commented on what librarians “should” do.
Included in this code are comments about wanting to do more as librarians, personal expectations
of how librarians should respond in different situations, and expectations of the profession as a
whole. One of the more rich codes is “traditional” librarian work which involved discussion
about the importance of building and maintaining a Young Adult collection, importance of
readers’ advisory (RA), importance of reading, and having physical and online resources in the
library about sensitive topics such as cyberbullying, bullying, and homosexuality. Both school
and public librarians spent a significant amount of time during the interviews talking about the
key role of a library’s collection in supporting students intellectually, developmentally, and
emotionally.

66

Secondary codes in this category include referring teens to other adults (per Georgia’s
Mandatory Reporting Law in Georgia; O.C.G.A. § 19-7-5), changes in the need for librarian
support of teens, and advocating for teens. When discussing a hypothetical situation in which a
youth reported cyberbullying to a librarian, all of the participants indicated that they would refer
the teen to another adult. The commonly identified adults were school counselors or principals
by the school librarians and Department of Family and Children’s Services (DEFACS) by the
public librarians. An excerpt from an informational guide provided by Georgia Public Library
Service highlights how public librarians have been taught to respond to sensitive situations
involving abuse, neglect, and bullying, “Because Georgia’s public libraries provide both
education and recreational programs to children, anyone who is employed by, or volunteers at, a
public library that serves children is now a mandatory reporter” (Minor, 2012, p. 1). The code
“changing needs” reflects participating librarians understanding of the changes which are
occurring locally and nationwide in the need for librarian support among teens. The school
librarians revealed their desire for more training and more collaboration with teachers to help
better meet these changing patron needs. While participating librarians did not explicitly refer to
themselves as advocates for teens, they did discuss interactions with parents, teachers, police
officers, and other adults when advocacy played a prominent role.
Another main category that appeared in interviews with rural librarians was empathetic
support. The major codes that fell within the category include understanding teens, relating to
teens, helping teens, listening to teens, talking with teens, respecting teens, library space, and
mentoring teens. Both rural school and public librarians believed they understood (perhaps not
fully) their young adult patrons, which they felt improved the quality of their work. This
understanding of teens included behaviors, attitudes, tendencies, inclinations, habits, and

67

emotional-psychological maturity. Rural librarians, especially new career librarians, frequently
commented on their ability to relate to teens and displayed an awareness of being able to do so.
Helping, listening, talking, and respecting are all related activities in which the librarians
described engaging in during their day-to-day work with young adults. This empathetic support
by early career librarians is demonstrated in this quote from Kevin, a public librarian, “If I notice
a stressed or upset teen, I would just talk to them. I would ask what’s wrong or what’s
happening. If the teen was going through something serious (like suicide), I would find some sort
of resources either online or in print. That’s what I would have wanted as a teen. The biggest
thing when dealing with distressed kids is just to talk to them.”
Rural school librarians, in particular, viewed themselves as wanting to be more helpful
towards students and teachers as well as demonstrating their respect for students and teachers.
Library space was by far one of the more enthusiastic discussion points for both rural public and
school librarians. Yet again, it was the school librarians who spoke repeatedly about making the
library a warm, welcoming, and safe for students. The importance of library space and design is
illustrated by Elizabeth, a school librarian, “[Name of co-worker] and I have created this
environment by not being so rigid about rules. We’ve remodeled the library, made it larger, and
painted the walls red and black. We also bought welcoming furniture for the library. This helps
show that librarians are welcoming too. I respect students.” School and public librarians partially
constructed this inviting space through library design including selecting appropriate color
schemes, purchasing comfortable furniture, creating elaborate book displays, and adding a
designated area in the library for teens to relax. But librarians also commented on their individual
approaches to how they engage with young adult patrons and their customer service
philosophies. Mentoring occurred through librarians working with teen volunteers as part of

68

more formal, regular volunteering and occasional informal volunteering. Rural school librarians
commonly had students with scheduled weekly volunteering who helped out with shelving,
programming, inventory, etc. Rural public librarians encountered more as-needed volunteering
from young adults, which included those teens participating as part of a youth service group or
organization or to satisfy required volunteer hours for school.
Relationships, a third category, also appeared frequently in the interview transcripts.
These relationships were with teens, teachers, school administration and, parents. Largely, the
rural librarians discussed how they played a supportive role in these relationships. Librarians
described the meaningful relationships they had with teen patrons. In each of the interviews with
school librarians, comments were made about the differences between the teen/teacher
relationship and the teen/librarian relationship. The public librarians commented on the contrast
between the teen/librarian relationship and teen/teacher relationship but also differences from the
teen/parent relationship. Librarian ascribed positive, negative, and neutral labels on their general
relationships with teens. Overwhelmingly, the relationships between the librarians and teens
were positive with occasional negative interactions with young patrons (e.g. when a librarian had
to quiet down a rowdy group of kids). These positive relationships between librarians and teens
and the contrast between teen/librarian and teen/teacher relationships are illustrated in this quote
from Margaret, a high school librarian, “I have a good relationship with the teens at my school.
[Coworker’s name] and my philosophy is when students walk through these doors they want to
have a positive environment. I don’t know about any prior issues or classroom problems. I want
to be helpful, in whatever way that is.”
Only one librarian, a public librarian, described her relationship with teen patrons as
neutral. This label stemmed from her perceived inability to connect with her area’s teens and her

69

confusion over the changing nature of teen services in the general library world. School
librarians saw their relationships with teachers and parents as supportive. School librarians
provided support for teachers through technology and information and supported parents through
sharing of information via social media and e-mails. The relationship between librarians and
school administration were more nuanced with school librarians supporting school
administration through their work, but also receiving support, referrals, and demands from
administration.
One final yet surprisingly smaller category, rural libraries, arose from analysis. School
librarians rarely mentioned the rural location of their school libraries and school system, yet
pubic librarians recognized the role that rurality played in the work they did with young adults.
Rural school librarians referred to students, teachers, administration, parents, and the school
environment, but rarely to the rural community they lived and worked in. Rural public librarians
commented on the impact transportation, funding, poverty, and staffing; something the school
librarians never mentioned. Molly, a public librarian mentioned the struggle of transportation for
rural libraries and librarians, “That’s a serious problem in rural communities. If you’re 15 and
live 10 to 15 miles out of town, trying to get to the library, even if you want to come, isn’t easy.
Teachers assume that everyone has technology and printer abilities, and that’s not the case. Kids
get a computer assignment and they can’t get to library (because of transportation). By the time
a parent gets home from work, the library is closed. That’s another thing the library is trying to
address. It’s an issue I ran into in my home. For a homework assignment, one of my kids had to
watch a television show. We don’t have cable or television. We occasionally get videos from the
library. We don’t have TV. We don’t have Internet at our house. Other than our weekly trips to
the library, I have no technology. It blows teachers minds when kids tell them that. One of our

70

goals at the library is to make technology more accessible. We still haven’t solved the
transportation problem.”
4.1.2.2 Analysis of Rural Young Adult Interview Transcripts
Four major categories developed during my analysis of the rural young adult interviews:
classification, relationships, dealing with cyberbullying/drama, and libraries and librarians.
Young adults spent a considerable amount of time delving into different aspects of cyberbullying
classification. This includes male/female differences in cyberbullying, identifying “drama”,
dating and relationship conflicts, “toxic people” online, cyberbullying roles (victim, bully, and
bystander), the dual nature of cyberbullying, and maturing out of cyberbullying. Participants
clearly differentiated between the classification of drama and cyberbullying, particularly when
referring to relationship and dating conflicts. Joshua, a tenth grader highlighted this, “Frankly, its
mostly girls. You hear about guys talking about all that crap too. Guys are more likely to talk
about fighting. It’s more physical. With girls, it’s more about talking behind each other’s backs.
It’s often people causing drama at school.” Several participants described “toxic people” who
trolled, trash talked, or harassed friends and strangers while online. Toxic people and
cyberbullies at times were one in the same.
However, in other instances, for example during online video gaming, toxic people were
described as limiting their harassment to single instances of mean or hurtful remarks instead of
the consistent harassment typical of cyberbullying. All of the participants had witnessed
cyberbullying in some form but only two had actually experienced cyberbullying. Interestingly,
none of the young adults acknowledged that they participated in any cyberbullying or bullying,
but several did participate in attempts to end the cyberbullying of friends.

71

The category of relationships reflects the major relationships that are important in the
daily life of a teen: friends, general adults, “helpful adults”, and religion/church. Friends were the
first line of defense for many rural teen participants in cases of cyberbullying. Friends formed a
support group to which teen participants could turn to for support if they were cyberbullied or
harassed online. These friends included both face-to-face and online friends. Mary, a recently
graduated senior demonstrated the importance of her friend support group, “One friend had the
ex-girlfriend of an ex-boyfriend commenting on her Instagram pictures. This person did it just
because she could. My friend first reached out to our friend group through group chat. She said
she didn’t know what to do or say about these comments. We all told her not to get involved with
it; it’ll cause problems. But my friend started commenting back to the bully. She asked, “why are
you saying these things, you don’t need to be doing this”. It only caused more flames to come up
because the bully started commenting back. They started private messaging each other; just
being mean and saying mean comments.” One teen participant, Joshua, who is a gamer discussed
the strong relationships he had built with fellow gamers through online gaming. Both face-toface and online friends were described as trustworthy, empathetic, and supportive. Teens
identified several groups of adults who offered varying degrees of support and empathy
including teachers, principals, counselors, librarians, clergy, and police. Parents and teachers
were most often mentioned as being supportive, as well being teen participants go-to for difficult
situations like cyberbullying.
Rural young adult participants also mentioned the characteristics of a “helpful adult”.
These characteristics included trust, ability to comfort, confidentiality, empathy, maturity, being
nice, and general friendliness. Teens identified this type of adult as the preferred person in which
confine about cyberbullying or bullying. According to the majority of teens, any adult who

72

possessed these characteristics could be helpful, responsible, and responsive for a teen. While
religion and faith were rarely overtly mentioned during interviews, several teens identified
religion as a part of their daily life and important for their overall well-being. In particular, one
teen that had been cyberbullied stated that she found comfort in her faith and youth group during
challenging times such as cyberbullying. Another teen mentioned a close friend who sought out a
youth pastor instead of a parent to report being cyberbullying by a former boyfriend.
Another major category from the interviews is dealing with cyberbullying/drama. Rural
young adult participants offered a range of coping mechanisms, male/female differences in
coping and dealing with cyberbullying/drama, technical possibilities, and reporting routes to help
deal with cyberbullying/drama. These codes included diminishing, “not letting it get to you”,
education in school, male/female differences, dealing with it alone, ignoring it, avoiding it,
helpful social networking site features, reporting to friends, reporting to an adult, and not
reporting to adult. Teens often diminished cyberbullying, relabeling these behaviors instead as
drama, “meanness”, or “toxic” people. Several teens claimed that they didn’t let it get to them or
they didn’t get involved with “that sort of stuff”. Teens also offered, “not letting it get to you”
and “not get involved” as advice for their peers to avoid cyberbullying. Several other coping
techniques were suggested such as dealing with it alone, ignoring it, and avoiding it. Young adult
participants appeared mostly to want to deal with cyberbullying alone and keep it quiet or within
their small social circle. Another quote from Mary, a recently graduated Senior, spoke to this
feeling, “For some teens they would push it until it became time for legal action. They think they
can deal with it themselves. I’m like you’re only 16 or 17. You don’t know everything yet. I
think maybe they think that dealing with that would be a symbol that they were grown up or
proving to themselves that they could deal with this. Even though you’re supposed to be older at

73

that age, you shouldn’t have to deal with things like that. Especially when you’re a teenager and
so vulnerable to what people say.” More so than the female teens, male participants suggested
using specific features of social networking sites such as privacy settings, blocking, and
unfollowing as ways to avoid or deal with cyberbullying. These were typically the first step these
teens would take when encountering a cyberbully.
Friends were the first group to which teen participants stated they would report
cyberbullying. As discussed earlier, friends were empathetic, offered advice, and provided
support for cyberbullied friends. Yet, the participants’ acknowledged that there was a limit to this
help and claimed that at times help from friends could be ineffective. Usually, teens would report
to an adult in extreme cases, when it “crossed that line”, became “too much to handle”, or
involved “self-harm”. The teens pointed out that there were stigmas attached to seeking adult
help, especially seeking help from a school counselor. Again, like with friends, teen participants
acknowledged that there were limits to how much adults could help and that, at times, this help
seemed ineffective. However, a number of teens interviewed described the adults they would
turn to for help as “helpful” “friendly”, and “empathetic”. The participating young adults offered
many reasons why they would not seek help from adults. These discussions with teen
participants included more emotional language and discussion of feelings. The teen participants
saw themselves and their peers as being scared, ashamed, and wanting to appear perfect. The
teens admitted that part of the reason they may choose not to report to an adult is because they
want to seem mature and present themselves as an “adult”. They also didn’t want to “make a big
deal” out of the cyberbullying and feared repercussions as a result of reporting to an adult such
as getting in trouble, losing their devices, and losing internet privileges.

74

The final category, libraries and librarians, arose from responses to direct questions about
teen participants’ library use, interactions with librarians, and librarians as supportive. Teens
overwhelmingly viewed librarians as an information source and educational resource. When
asked how librarians could prevent and intervene in cyberbullying, teens recommended that
public librarians take the lead in providing education about cyberbullying and digital safety to
both parents and teens. The teens reported receiving some sort of education annually during the
school year through classroom visits by a local police officer who discussed bullying and
cyberbullying.
However, the participants also felt that public and school librarians could be a resource
for additional information about cyberbullying and bullying for parents, teens, and teachers. Two
areas in which teens thought librarians could help cyberbullied teens were through conversation
and advocacy. Teens described librarians as potential “helpful adults” whom some teens may
feel comfortable opening up to through casual, everyday conversation and interactions. In
response to my question concerning how librarians can help, one teen participant, David, a
recently graduated Senior stated, “I think the most organic way is just conversation. You’ve got a
kid that comes in on a weekly basis and you develop a relationship with that person. That’s the
easiest way to go about being a kind of advocate or support system for that person if they’re
dealing something.”
The participants also saw librarians as possessing the ability to advocate for teen. One
teen mentioned librarians as advocating for teens with teachers and school administrations and
providing support in difficult times. Another teen mentioned librarians as being able to provide
general advocacy out in the community and helping raise awareness about teen issues. Young
adults participants described their use of both school and public libraries. Three of the young

75

adults participants had helped out in the school and public library through regular volunteering.
In each case, the participant sought out the volunteer opportunity in his/her library. Most of the
teens identified the library as a space, for example a space for meeting, a space for working, and
a space for hanging out with friends. Several of the teens described their library use as declining
once they entered middle school. One quote from Emma, a ninth grader, illustrates this transition
in library use, “I used to go to the library a lot to check out chapter books. Once I started middle
school, my reading and library use slowed down. My friends kinda use the library. It depends on
the group of friends. I have friends in different social circles. I mostly use the library to check out
books.” Many reasons for this decline were given including less of an interest in reading,
wanting to own copies of books, and a growing interest in eBooks. The participants had varying
types of relationships with their librarians. Those who had volunteered at a library or attended
the same church as their librarian spoke more often about their relationship with specific
librarians. Other teens had only casual and infrequent interactions with librarians during class
visits to their school libraries or family visits or meetings at public libraries.
4.1.3 Analysis 2: Video Transcript Analysis and Presentation of Codes
Following the interviews, rural librarian and rural teen participants recorded a single
video autoethnography entry during which they responded to a pre-written prompt. The rural
librarian prompt was composed of five questions that focused on the librarian’s experience with
cyberbullying, types of support he/she currently provides young adults, types of support he/she
believe that young adults should be provided, and hypothetical questions about support of
cyberbullied teens. The rural young adult prompt was made up of four questions that
concentrated on each young adult participant’s experience with cyberbullying, suggestions for
coping with cyberbullying, advice and information given to a hypothetically cyberbullied friend,

76

and ways of seeking help for cyberbullying from an adult. The length of the librarian video
entries averaged about 9 minutes while the teen videos averaged about 6 minutes. Each
participant recorded his/her video using an electronic device with an attached camera (i.e. laptop,
smart phone). After completing the recording, each participant uploaded the file to a secure
website (FSU Dropbox) from which only I could promptly and safely download the file.
Many of the same categories, codes, and sub-codes used for the interview transcripts
were used for analyzing the video entries. The shared use of these categories and codes was
logical as both the interview questions and video prompts were based upon my four research
questions and my previous research on cyberbullying, empathy, and youth services.
Additionally, my rural librarian and rural young adult video prompt questions were designed
based on the interview responses. In Appendix N, I will present this study’s master list of
categories, codes, and representative quotes for rural librarian participants. In Appendix O, I will
present this study’s master list of categories, codes, and representative quotes for rural young
adult participants.
In Appendix L, the four categories and related 30 codes used for the video
autoethnography transcripts are presented for the rural librarian participant group. In Appendix
M, the four categories and related 22 codes used for the video autoethnography transcripts are
presented for the rural young adult participant group.
4.1.2.1 Analysis of Librarian Video Autoethnography Transcripts
One category that emerged came from a direct video prompt question about experiencing
and/or witnessing cyberbullying. All but one rural librarian had witnessed cyberbullying in some
form. There are four major codes for this category: dealing/coping with cyberbullying,
cyberbullying among adults, understanding adult online behaviors, and not understanding adult

77

online behaviors. One young librarian had witnessed cyberbullying among a group of friends and
explained that he believed his experience made him more attuned to more emotional and
psychological development of teens. Kevin, a public librarian, explained, “Librarians should
provide abuse and bullying protection and talking with teens on a regular basis goes a long way
in determining what is actually going on with them. Teens are more difficult to provide support
for since bullied and abused teens become uncommunicative.” For other librarians, it was
difficult to gauge what impact witnessing these aggressive online behaviors has had on their
interactions with teens and the types of support they offer teens. Overall, the librarians identified
adult aggressive online behaviors, like trolling and meanness, as drama, not cyberbullying.
Several expressed confusion over why adults would engage in these types of hurtful behaviors
while others offered clear and precise explanations of why they believed adults participated in
online drama.
A second category, librarian roles, relates closely to the same category from the librarian
interviews. Codes from this category include balancing professional and emotional roles,
referring teens to other adults, mandatory reporting, library leadership, “changing needs”,
collection development, formal instruction/programming, what librarians “should” do,
“traditional” librarian work, collaboration, and advocating for teens. Librarians articulated the
challenges of balancing their professional and emotional roles in the library. Each librarian
expressed discomfort with overstepping professional boundaries and becoming too involved in a
young patron’s life. Another quote from Kevin, a public librarian, helps highlight this
discomfort, “I'm a little hesitant to say kids and teens should be supported for everything in their
local library. While some things I am more than comfortable providing like resources or
information, I'm not a social worker, legal council, or law enforcement officer so some of the

78

support has to come from more appropriate people.” To help with this discomfort, librarian
stated that they would refer teens to other adults such as counselors, principals, or parents in
instances of suspected cyberbullying, bullying, or abuse. Examples of library leadership arose
from the additional roles librarians took on to assist and support teens, planning for more
sensitive topic related staff training, and an expressed desire by school librarians for more
collaboration with counselors and teachers to better support teens.
During the videos, both rural school and public librarians spoke about the importance of
their young adult collection in supporting teens. Librarians discussed the need for having
sensitive topic print and online resources available in their library collections, desire to add more
sensitive topic resources to their collections, and hoped to share these resources and materials
with teachers and counselors. Similar to collection development, the librarians discussed
developing and providing formal instruction and programming both in the library and as part of
planned class visits. School librarians in particular discussed collaborative programming that
could be developed in part with school counselors, teachers, and the local police department.
Similar to the librarian interviews, there was significant discussion about what librarian
“should” do service-wise in general as well as specific situations. Librarians also focused on the
“traditional” librarian work they do for both adult and young adult patrons. This traditional work
included working reference, collection development, readers’ advisory (RA), and technology
support. While these activities seemed to form the core of the work participating librarians saw
themselves as engaging in daily, they also expressed a desire to do more and take on additional
roles. Rural school librarians expressed a desire for collaboration with counselors, teachers, and
school administration in developing programming and selecting materials that target sensitive
issues. The code advocating for teens reflects the concern librarians felt about overstepping

79

professional boundaries yet wanting to promote the safety and well-being of their young adult
patrons. Librarians would advocate for teens by understanding teens’ emotional and
psychological development, selecting resources and materials that teens may need, and appealing
to other like-minded adults for help.
A third category, empathetic support, is another category reflected in my interviews with
rural school and public librarians. Many of the same codes from my analysis of the interviews
were found in the videos. However, some codes were more present in the videos than in the
interviews. These codes included impact on teens, diminishing empathetic support, and offering
encouragement and reassurances. Librarians continued to comment upon how they are able to
understand teens, relate to teens, provide customer service, help, listen, talk, and respect teens.
These elements of empathetic support are illustrated in a quote from Molly, a public librarian,
“Anyway, even with a good parental relationship, kids might question their parents' advice,
thinking that they don't know what they're talking about or that they're just sugar-coating. In this
situation, I think both teachers and librarians might have an opportunity to present similar advice
from a different perspective that, for the kid, might seem more credible and easier to hear than it
would have been from a parent.”
During the videos, rural librarians highlighted how much they worried about teens
patrons and how often they offered encouragement and reassurances. In most of the videos,
while mentioned cyberbullying, librarian discussions of the encouragement and reassurances
they offered were followed by acknowledgement that they would also refer the teen to an outside
adults. Librarians also played down the empathetic support they provide young patrons. Usually
the librarians highlighted with pride their young adult collection, print and online resources, and
readers’ advisory. The more supportive, encouraging, and mentoring role librarians played for

80

teens usually appeared in the video entries as an afterthought. Rural libraries, the final category
in my librarian video analysis, were more present in the public librarian videos than school
librarians. School librarians rarely mentioned the rural community the school system resided in,
yet public librarians appeared well aware of the challenges of a rural environment, how the
library supported its rural community, and the impact that the library had on the community
itself. School librarians tend to focus on the school and school system they worked in.
4.1.2.2 Analysis of Rural Young Adult Video Autoethnography Transcripts
Before beginning data collection for this study, I believed the teens’ video entries would
be a rich source of data. However, what emerged, in many ways, was a recitation of data
collected during the teen interviews. The video entries from the rural librarians were where the
majority of the insightful categories and codes developed for the autoethnographies. From the
teen video entries four categories appeared experiencing/witnessing cyberbullying, reporting
cyberbullying, dealing coping with cyberbullying, and empathetic support.
The first category, experiencing/witnessing cyberbullying/drama, illustrates the young
participants experiences with cyberbullying and drama. Only two of the participants had
experienced cyberbullying, but they had all witnessed cyberbullying through casual social media
use. The participants openly discussed the online “drama” among their peers and provided labels
for cyberbullying, drama, online harassment, and aggression. In these videos, a few teens
attempted explain the behavior of cyberbullies, why their peers would engage in these types of
activities. They also tried to understand and empathize with the teen victims of cyberbullying,
giving reasons for how and when they should seek help from friends or adults. Yet, other teens
expressed confusion over cyberbullying and bullying in general. One quote from Mary, a
recently graduated Senior expresses this confusion, “I’ve never personally experienced

81

cyberbullying, but I’ve witnessed it with some of my friends. One of my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s
ex-girlfriend started commented on pictures on Instagram and calling her names. My friend made
the mistake of commenting back and starting what you could call an online feud. I had a friend’s
ex-boyfriend harassing her through text messages, randomly sending rude messages, and not
explaining why he was saying these things. My friend didn’t know how to handle it.” The
participants spent a small portion of their videos trying to understand cyberbullies and the
victimization that occurred within their peer groups.
The majority of the video entries focused explicitly on two categories: reporting
cyberbullying and dealing/coping with cyberbullying/drama. Rural young adults participants
provided advice on when victims should report, how to select someone to report to, possibilities
on whom to report to such as friends and adults, and offered reasons for why victims may choose
not to report cyberbullying. Most of the teens admitted that they would deal with the
cyberbullying alone or talk it over with a friend, only in serious cases would they report to an
adult. The supportive and empathetic relationships that the teen participants had developed while
at home, school, and church played a key role in deciding whom to report to.
Like in the interviews, rural teens stated that they would report to friends first and then to
adults when the cyberbullying became too much to handle. To deal with cyberbullying/drama,
teens mentioned many of the same ways as in the interviews such as ignoring it, avoiding it, not
getting involved, and using features of social networking sites. A quote from Emma, a ninth
grader, illustrates how teens may choose to deal with cyberbullying, “For one, I would talk to
them first to see how it was affecting them. If it wasn’t bothering them, “it’s no big thing.
Whatever”, then I would say ignore it and maybe tell an adult you trust about it just so they can
get involved with it and hopefully stop it and find out who it is. But they are really taking it

82

harsh, I would still tell them to ignore it and really seek someone’s help so they don’t do
anything to hurt themselves because of the words people are saying.” A few teens mentioned
self-censorship, strictly monitoring what they say online or whom they interact with while
online, as one way to avoid cyberbullying. Again, as in the interviews, many of the rural young
adult participants tried to diminish cyberbullying, encouraging others to not let it get to you and
describing it as not a big deal.
In many ways, the final category, empathetic support, served to support the other three
categories. Each teen discussed seeking support from friends, school/church/peer groups, and
adults. The teens described the type of adults they would report cyberbullying to as helpful,
empathetic, and friendly. David, a recently graduated Senior discussed support for cyberbullied
young adults, “People know cyberbullying is an issue, and it certainly is. The best information I
could give to anybody is not to say, “Hey look. This has happened before.” They’re not looking
for that type of answer. They’re looking for someone who is going to support them personally.
They’re looking for some type of support. The best answer I could give is to suggest going to get
that support. There are many venues and outlets for great support system out there. So, that is
what I would suggest to people. Those people who have that age and experience. They would
need that confidential factor. Obviously someone who you have a relationship with. That always
makes the process go much easier.”
Since a few of the video autoethnography prompt questions asked what advice and
information the participant would give cyberbullied friends, many of the responses from teens
included descriptions of the types of people to report the cyberbullying. These characteristics
included someone the hypothetical friend is comfortable with, someone who provides empathy,

83

someone mature, someone who the friend can easily talk to, and someone whom the friend feels
secure sharing information.
4.1.3 Analysis 3: Integration and Presentation of Master List of Categories and Codes
Because of the similarities between the interview and video categories and codes for both
participant groups, integration of the separate lists (interview and video) into a master list of
categories and codes went smoothly. The master list of librarian categories, codes, and related
participant quotes can be found in Appendix M. The master list of librarian categories, codes,
and related participant quotes can be found in Appendix N.
4.1.4 Analysis of Researcher’s Journaling
Throughout the data collection, data analysis, and write up of this project, I maintained a
journal to record insights gleaned from encounters with participants and analysis of the data.
Along with memoing, this journal provided me with another location for thinking through my
experiences and collected data. I wrote in this journal after each interview and after viewing each
video. I also continued journaling while writing up this project. Through journaling, I was able to
flesh out a few of the categories from both the librarian and young adult interviews and librarian
and young adult video autoethnographies.
Although manual coding offered me the majority of opportunities to develop categories,
codes, and sub codes, this journal was helpful when I reflected upon the those categories that
seems confusing or conflicting to me as the researcher. For example, using notes from my
journal, I noticed that the librarian category of rural libraries and librarians appeared only in the
interviews of rural public libraries. The rural community and its citizens were never mentioned
in school librarian interviews. While I still do not have a solid understanding of why there is this
contrast, it did give me one avenue for future research. In another project, I could investigate

84

how rural school and public libraries differ in their view of the community or the communities
they service, whether this community only contains the school (perhaps for school librarians) or
whether this community includes the outside community (such as public librarians understanding
of community).
4.2 Summary
The results of the qualitative analysis, based upon grounded theory, of the rural librarian
and rural young adult semi-structured interviews and rural librarian and rural young adult
structured video autoethnographies were presented in this chapter. In this study, seven rural
librarians and seven rural young adults from Southwest Georgia engaged in individual interviews
and single-entry video autoethnography.
Four categories and 34 related codes emerged from my analysis of the rural librarian
participant group’s interview transcripts. These categories are librarian roles, empathetic support,
relationships, and rural libraries. Four categories and related 32 codes surfaced from my analysis
of the rural young adult participant group’s interview. These categories are classification,
relationships, dealing with cyberbullying/drama, and libraries and librarians.
Four categories and 30 related codes emerged from my analysis of the rural librarian
participant group’s video autoethnography entries. These categories include
experiencing/witnessing cyberbullying/drama, librarian roles, empathetic support, and rural
libraries. Four categories and 22 related codes appeared from my analysis of the rural young
adult participant group’s video autoethnography entries. These categories included
experiencing/witnessing cyberbullying/drama, reporting cyberbullying, dealing/coping with
cyberbullying/drama and empathetic support. In Chapter 5, I will close with a discussion of these
findings and presentation of my conclusions.

85

CHAPTER FIVE
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this study, I conducted semi-structured interviews with seven rural librarians and seven
rural young adults. Following the interviews, each librarian and young adult participant
submitted one video entry in which they responded to a pre-written prompt. In the previous
chapter (Chapter 4), I introduced the finding gleaned from my analysis of these interviews and
video autoethnographies. In this chapter, I will expand upon this analysis by discussing in depth
these findings and offering some conclusions.
5.1 Restatement of the Problem
Young adults’ use of social media has grown quickly. In 2006, 55% of young adults used
social media; in 2012, 81% reported being social media users. (Madden et al., 2013). As
adolescents have become more engaged with social networking sites, they are sharing more
information about themselves online. Through profiles, posts, and uploads, young adults are
offering photos, addresses, phone numbers, and locations (Marwick et al., 2013). As a result of
this openness, young adults leave themselves vulnerable to online harassment including
cyberbullying. In a 2011 survey of online young adults, Lenhart et al. found that 88% had
observed mean or cruel behavior on social media. Fifteen percent of those surveyed reported
being the target of such attacks (Lenhart et al., 2011). Although not every unkind post or
message on social media constitutes cyberbullying, these behaviors can quickly escalate and
have serious repercussions. To help cope with these experiences, young adults need the support
of adults, friends, and communities. In this study, I focused on four research questions:
RQ1: What types of empathy and support have rural young adults received from rural
librarians?

86

RQ2: What empathy and support do rural young adults want to receive from rural
librarians?
RQ3: What empathy and support do rural librarians provide rural young adults?
RQ4: What empathy and support do rural librarians want to provide rural young adults?
5.2 Review of the Method
This study focused on three populations, young adults, school librarians, and public
librarians, in rural Southwest Georgia. Both rural public and school libraries have been
particularly hard hit by the recent recession and funding reform (Molnar, 2014; Stegner, 2007).
Even before the recession, rural libraries lacked the equivalent funding and human resources of
urban and suburban libraries (Barron, 1995). Inexpensive and quality training and professional
development is greatly needed in rural libraries (Mehra, Black, & Lee, 2010). In a minor way,
this research supplements the insufficient amount of research on rural libraries and rural patrons
as well as provides suggestions for improving youth services in rural areas.
I used semi-structured interviews and video autoethnographies to collect the data for this
study. First, I interviewed seven rural librarians in individual semi-structured interviews lasting
approximately 45 minutes. Subsequently, I interviewed seven rural young adults in individual
semi-structured interviews lasting approximately 30 minutes. After the interview phase was
completed, I asked both the librarian and young adult participants to record one video
autoethnography lasting approximately 5 to 10 minutes during their own time. Rural school and
public librarians were contacted through my existing personal and community social network;
rural young adult participants were recruited through recommendations from these librarians,
regional youth organization leaders, and church youth pastors.

87

I used Charmaz’s (2006) grounded theory approach to data analysis as a guide for data
collection and analysis. Because of its exploratory nature, this study emphasized Charmaz’s
elements of code development and theme discovery (Heath & Cowley, 2004). The categories and
codes revealed during this study’s data analysis have the potential to support the future use of
relational communication theory in LIS and cyberbullying research. Categories and codes were
developed for both the interviews and video entries, and then combined to create a master list of
the project’s categories and codes.
Throughout data collection, I maintained a written journal. This journal allowed me to
reflect on each interview; the design of the interview questions and video prompts; and captured
personal reflections during the process. Notes, comments, and questions were recorded in this
journal before, after, and as needed during data collection. The journal supplied me with ideas
for possible codes and categories used during subsequent analysis.
At the completion of data collection, I began memoing. As Saldaña (2010) noted, “the
purpose of analytic memo writing is to document and reflect on: your coding process and code
choices; how the process of inquiry is taking shape; and the emergent patterns, categories and
subcategories, themes, and concept in your data” (p. 33). Memoing is an established practice in
qualitative research (Saldaña, 2010). Through the act of memoing, a researcher can stay
connected with his/her data and “engage in critical reflexivity” (Charmaz, 2006, p. 163).
5.3 Discussion of Findings
In the following sections, I will discuss the findings and their implications for each
research question.

88

5.3.1 RQ1: What types of empathy and support have rural young adults received from
rural librarians?
My first research question asked what types of empathy and support rural young adults
have received from rural librarians as part of their experiences in the library.
5.3.1.1 Received Empathy and Support: Information Resource But Also Just Books
A recent release from Pew Research Center (2014) reported that, within the past year,
young adults are more likely than older adults to have used a library. Yet, this same report also
highlighted that young adults “know where their local library is, but many say they are
unfamiliar with all the services it may offer” (Zickuhr & Rainie, 2014, p. 3). Young adults are
using rural school and public libraries; and rural school and public librarians are providing
services to young adults. Walter and Mediavilla (2005) demonstrated teen use of online reference
exchanges through a Live Homework Help services. In an ethnographic study of a neighborhood
public library use by families, the researchers found that these libraries were used to support
literacies taught in school as well as informally engage in literacy through conversations between
patrons and library staff (Ward & Wason-Ellam, 2005), Luo and Weak (2013) assessed how
teens use text reference services and found that teens are using these type of services largely for
school-based questions.
In my project, the categories “information source” and “library use” demonstrate the
conflict in the nature of teen library use. The participating rural young adults commented that
they went to the library for help with specific school assignments and to locate books for
personal or school-related reading. They viewed librarians are one more source of information
that exists along with teachers, parents, and the Internet. However, many of the participating
rural young adults were no longer active users of the library. The participants described their

89

library use as beginning to drop off after middle school. They would occasionally use the school
library but rarely the public library unless taking a younger sibling to check out books. This is
demonstrated in Sarah’s, an eighth grader, comment, “I read a good bit, but I don’t use the
library much. I like eBooks. If I went to library, it would be because I needed to go with my little
brother. Occasionally, if I was bored, I would go to look at the books.”
The comments from the participants and the literature suggest that there is a change
occurring in young adult library services. The recent YALSA report, “The future of library
services for and with teens: A call to action” speaks to this change in library services for teens
(Braun et al., 2014). A few of the teens participating in my study have continued their library use
past middle school. In fact, two of the seven teen participants are highly engaged with their
school or public library. However, for the majority, library use appears to have tapered off at
some point during middle school. Changes will be needed in both how young adult services in
the school and public library are provided (e.g. programming, book clubs) and what types of
services are provided for young adults. Understanding these changes will require additional
research beyond the scope of my exploratory study.
5.3.1.2 Received Empathy and Support: Mentorship
Young adults receive mentorship in several ways through their involvement and use of
the library. Although mentorship of youth by librarians is usually not formalized, one-on-one
instruction and daily interactions provide librarians with opportunities for mentorship of youth
(Bannon, 2012). More structured mentorship is commonly delivered through young adults
engaging in volunteering within their libraries. The literature in LIS on mentorship of librarians,
particularly academic librarians, is rich and thoughtful (James, Rayner, & Bruno, 2015; Kern &
Popp, 2013); however, there is little research into mentorship of youth by school or public

90

librarians within LIS. This absence is unfortunate because “high quality mentoring relationships
have prompted child health through improvements in academic performance, positive feels of
self-worth, perceived social acceptance, relationships with others, and decreases in high-risk
behaviors like alcohol/tobacco us and violence” (Coller & Kuo, 2014, p. 316). A more modern
take on teen mentorship in libraries is taking place as part of tech enriched spaces like
YOUmedia Chicago (Bannon, 2012). Through the guidance of YOUmedia librarians, teens
engage, learn, and play with technology.
Examples of the mentoring my young participants received appeared frequently in
discussions of the categories of library volunteering and teens’ casual conversations with
librarians. Three of my teen participants had volunteered in their public or school library. Two
teens had regular volunteer positions in their school library and one teen had a more relaxed and
informal volunteer position in his public library. Sarah, an eighth grader spoke about her
volunteer experiences, “One afternoon in the library, I asked if there was anything I could do to
help. The librarians said that they didn’t have anything then, but they could come back later. The
librarians talked with my teachers and I started working. By the eighth grade I was used to it so I
asked if I could work there again.” These participants spoke highly of the librarians and
referenced the work they did in the library as important and worthwhile. Along with gaining
work experience, these teen volunteers also developed close relationships with the librarians they
assisted. This type of mentorship provided participants with job training, informal guidance,
hands-on work experience, and social interaction with non-parental adults.
It is noteworthy that so many of the participants (three out of seven) volunteered in the
library at some point. More research must be conducted into teen mentorship, volunteering, and
the impact of this mentorship on young adults and librarians. Campbell, Haines, Koester, and

91

Stoltz (2015) discussed school librarians’ media and technology mentorship of teens by school
librarians, but librarians’ mentorship has an impact on much more than teens’ media skills and
use. Since this is a small exploratory study, I could not touch on every aspect of mentorship that
occurs between a teen and a librarian. However, judging from the interviews conducted, this
mentorship had a role in the maturity and intellectual development of young volunteers.
5.3.1.3 Received Empathy and Support: “Helpful Adults”/Empathy
For teens, librarians, like many adults, are seen a helpful and friendly adults to whom
they can turn to for many types of information needs. Agosto, Paone, and Ipock (2008)
investigated gender differences in use and perceptions of U.S. public libraries and found that
young females had a “tendency to rate libraries as more useful in helping them meet their
personal information needs” (p. 387). Libraries and librarians form an additional security net,
alongside parents, church, and youth organizations for teens that may be struggling mentally,
socially, or developmentally (Braun et al., 2014). Through compassionate services such as
bibliotherapy, librarians use books, materials, and resources to meet the needs of young adults
suffering from social, emotional, mental, physical, or even sometimes simple every day problems
(Tukhareli, 2011).
While not explicitly identifying librarians as the main people they would turn to in a
cyberbullying experience, young adult participants included librarians among a list of helpful
and compassionate adults whom they could reach out to. Mary, a recently graduated Senior
stressed in her video, “The most helpful people would be your friends, because sometimes a lot
of the online fights happen among your friends. They are usually the ones who can support you
and have more empathy for you. And trusted adults in your community such as teachers,
counselors, parents, pastors, librarians, community leaders. They are the ones who have more say

92

in these situations and can make a difference rather than just the student trying to defend
themselves.” During conversations, the teens expressed a librarian’s dual ability to provide
information while also offering compassion and empathy. For many of the teens, librarians filled
the same supportive roles as teachers, counselors, and pastors.
Clearly, for young adults who are regular library patrons, as a few of the teen participants
in my study were, librarians could be included in a potential list of helpful and empathetic adults.
For young adults that were not active library users, as several of the teen participants in my study
were, librarians may still be included in a similar list of helpful adults. The teen participants in
my study were a balanced mixture of users and non-users. Non-library using teens reported that
any helpful, friendly, and “nice” adult could be a resource for cyberbullied young adults. This
study is limited in scope, but the participants as a whole perceived librarians as helpful and
useful resources for both information and personal needs. Additional research could clarify
library-using and non-library using young adult perceptions of librarian support.
5.3.2 RQ2: What empathy and support do rural young adults want to receive from rural
librarians?
My second research question asked what types of empathy and support rural young adults
would like to receive from rural librarians during their future experiences in the library.
5.3.2.1 Wanted Empathy and Support: Educational Resource
Teens use the library and engage with librarian for a variety of purposes that
encompasses both their school and personal lives (Howard, 2011). Personal information seeking
and school-related inquiries are often cited in the literature when discussing teen use of school
and public libraries (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2005, Gross, 1999, Hughes-Hassell, HansonBaldauf, & Burke, 2008). Librarians have new arenas in which to educate teen and adult patrons

93

including digital literacy, digital citizenship, and digital use (Braun et al., 2014). Teens are not
alone in their need for education about online ethics and responsible engagement with online
communities. Adults, especially parents, need to know how to monitor and assess their personal
social media use and the use of their children (Madden, 2012). Agosto, Forte, & Magee (2012)
highlight the need for librarians to be educated and informed about cyberbullying.
Much like the rural librarian participants, rural young adult participants wanted librarians
to play more of a role in education. This code of education includes education of parents,
teachers, school administration, and teens. Several young adult participants highlighted the
ability of librarians to support cyberbullied young adults through education of parents and young
adults. Teens commented on the need for more adult awareness of cyberbullying and bullying
among their age group. One example from an interview with Mary, a recently graduated Senior:
“The biggest part for the librarians is to inform the parents first. Because that’s the main
audience - adults who use the library. First things first would be to inform the parents
about cyberbullying and how to protect their child, not just putting restrictions but how to
talk to their child, what they do online, what social media sites they use. And educate
children and teens on the steps that need to be taken if someone is harassing you online
and on specific sites. What action you can take. The library is a public place. I trust my
librarians.”
Education of children, young adults, and adults through library programming, services,
and resources has a long tradition. What is unique about the comments of the young adults in my
project is the increased awareness of cyberbullying they desired among parents and the use of
education to increase this awareness. School and public librarians can use the instructional skills
and qualifications they already possess to create programming, workshops, and presentations for

94

use within and without the library. School librarians can support cyberbullying education of
teachers and parents by distributing information and resources directly to them and support
cyberbullying education of teens through in library and in classroom presentation and
workshops. Public librarians can supplement this education through age specific workshops and
programs on cyberbullying, ethical social media use, and social media management.
5.3.2.2 Wanted Empathy and Support: Advocacy
Librarians advocate for their young adult patrons on a daily basis. One of YALSA’s core
professional values for teen services professionals is social responsibility, which includes
advocating for “the education, development, and recreational needs of teens, especially as they
relate to library services” (YALSA, 2015, p. 7). Librarians advocate for teens on a local, state,
and national level, but the majority of advocacy librarians provide comes through day-to-day
interactions with teens at a circulation or reference desk (Braun et al., 2014). Teens are often
unaware of this advocacy on their behalf, but it comes across when librarians build positive and
nurturing relationships with teens.
Two teen participants explicitly discussed librarians as advocates for teens in conjunction
with parents, teachers, and other adults. The “advocacy” category emerged as teens discussed the
need for more cyberbullying awareness and education of adults and the lead role librarians could
take in advocating for teens. The participating teens expressed a need for adults to be supportive
of them, particularly when reporting cyberbullying. As Emma, a ninth grader explained, “If the
teachers heard it (cyberbullying) from another teacher or a librarian, they would take it more
seriously. I would tell my school librarians. I feel close to them and would feel comfortable
talking to them”. This teen demonstrated a potential need for a librarian to advocate for her and

95

other teens to teachers. The librarian serves as a voice for teens that do not feel they will be heard
or believed by teachers.
Although this project did not focus on advocacy, advocacy plays a part in cyberbullying
support and empathetic services. There is little research in LIS on teen perceptions of librarian
advocacy or librarians as advocates. To promote and demonstrate the services that libraries
provide young adults, it is critical that this age group is aware of the advocacy role that librarians
play. What emerged during my transcribing and coding is that library advocacy is supported by
empathy in the library and being empathetic as a librarian is a requirement of advocating for
teens.
5.3.2.3 Wanted Empathy and Support: Empathy
Empathy in the library has been investigated over the past decade in a small amount by
British researchers (Birdi et al., 2008; Birdi et al., 2009; Shaper & Streatfield, 2012). Shaper and
Streatfield (2012) labeled empathy as pastoral care and reported that school librarians see
themselves as more than just librarians. They are also “teachers, social workers, security guards,
life coaches, a friendly smile, a strict word” (p. 67). In their research, Birdi et al. (2008, 2009)
focused on the role of empathy in public libraries, especially the role it plays in social inclusion.
Young adults, particularly those who are cyberbullied and/or vulnerable, need a network of
compassionate, knowledgeable, and empathetic adults (Agosto et al., 2012).
The empathetic role of the librarian is demonstrated in the following quote from Mary, a
recently graduated Senior, “Teachers are more concerned with your learning and you have more
fear of your teachers (grades). Librarians, they’re just fun. You don’t have any animosity about
grades or doing something bad. They’re just in charge of books. If you wanted to know where a
book was, it was never scary to ask them. It would be scarier to ask your teacher”. Teens need

96

empathetic, helpful, and trusting adults in their lives. Teen participants repeatedly discussed the
need for helpful, kind, compassionate, and empathetic adults whom cyberbullied or troubled
young adults could appeal to. As indicated by teen participants’ interviews and videos, librarians
can be one of the adults who provide this emotional, social, and psychological support for teens.
This exploratory project is one of the few investigations into the empathetic role of the
librarian. Since this project is small, it is difficult to expand these results to youth and librarians
outside of small, rural public and school libraries of Southwest Georgia. There is no research
about how patrons (youth or adult) understand or perceive this empathetic role of librarians.
Additional research into the perceptions and thoughts of patrons who have received this type of
support would help clarify how the provision of empathy can be improved and expanded upon
through already existing library services.
5.3.3 RQ3: What empathy and support do rural librarians provide rural young adults?
My third research question asked what types of empathy and support school and public
librarians perceive themselves as providing young adults during interactions with young adults in
the library.
5.3.3.1 Provided Empathy and Support: Information Resource
Librarians assist young patrons with their information needs every day. Indeed the
reference interview is one of the standards of any MLIS student’s education (Dervin &
Dewdney, 1986; Taylor, 1968). Whether is face-to-face on the reference desk or virtually
through Ask a Librarian or text messaging, librarians help young patrons satisfy their
information needs through available print and digital resources (Melchionda, 2007; Radford,
2006a). Librarians have learned to adjust the delivery of information in this new digital world by

97

incorporating social media, texting, and Makerspaces into their libraries’ services (Cahill, 2011,
Forte, Agosto et al., 2013, Sebrine et al., 2013).
Participating librarians in this study talked at length about the services they provide
young adults and how they help these young patrons with any type of information need. The
categories “traditional” librarian work, collection development, and what librarians “should” do
attest to the heavy importance these librarians placed on being an information resource for their
young adult patrons. These librarians often talked about being there for teens when they needed a
book, help with a school assignment, and providing readers’ advisory. Elizabeth, a high school
librarian, illustrates this support, “We [she and coworker] let students know that there are lots of
place to get information besides websites and direct them where they need to go to get the
information. [Name of coworker] will let students go back to her office before the books are
cataloged to pick out what they want. I help and support student in whatever they need to know.”
Additionally, the librarians saw the development of a strong young adult collection as an
important competent of their value as a librarian and the value of their library. Librarians were
also aware of the increased need of having sensitive physical and online resources available for
teens in these collections (e.g. books on bullying, cyberbullying, homosexuality, rape).
What came across during interviews and videos of participating librarians was the hyper
awareness that these librarians had of their supportive information role. The librarians focused
largely on the more traditional librarian tasks of readers’ advisory, resource gathering, and
collection development; tasks that are evolving as teens become increasingly engaged online.
This study did not investigate the librarians’ perceptions or feelings about the changing role of
the library in the lives of young adults (Horrigan, 2015). The role and importance of libraries has
seen a shift, as demonstrated by a recent Pew Research Center report. Libraries are in a state of

98

transition including a shift in use by patrons, such as young patrons, in the U.S (Horrigan, 2015).
Further research into how librarians are adjusting and modifying their services and approach to
providing these services in this digital age is needed.
5.3.3.2 Provided Empathy and Support: Instructional Resource
Librarians support young adult patrons through instruction in the form of formal in-house
programing, in-class visits, informal one-on-one guidance, and through librarian-designed
bookmarks, flyers, and handouts (YALSA, 2015). Cyberbullying and digital citizenship
education are two areas where librarians are beginning to turn their attention (Agosto et al.,
2012). Whether librarians are assessing cyberbullying as a media literacy challenge or online
safety danger, they are creating tailor-made programming and formal instruction to educate
teens, parents, and members of their community (Bhat, Chang, & Linscott, 2010; Childnet
International, 2007). Often this instructional role focuses on young adult patrons, but librarians
do and should provide resources for the support system of a teen that includes teachers, families,
and communities (D’Auria, 2014).
The librarians in this study discussed their instructional role as equally as important as
their informational role through codes such as “formal instruction and programing”, “supporting
parents”, “supporting teachers”, and “library leadership”. Both school and public librarians
would frequently highlight instances of one-on-one instruction with teens in the library. A quote
from Margaret, a high school librarian, highlights this role, “My main role is helping with
technology use and helping when they have questions – what to read, read-a-likes, series. It may
be a simple question about creating headers on Word. But to them that matters. I’ll sit down and
help individual students. It’s important so I’ll will try to do that.” The middle and high school
librarians offer less in-library programming but more in-class instruction as requested by the

99

teachers. However, for these librarians, this instruction carried over beyond young adults and
included teachers, school administrators, and parents. The school librarians, in particular,
reported a growth over the past decade in their instructional support of teachers. The rural public
librarians discussed the educational component with less intensity as the school librarians but
were more open about the leadership role in education they took up in their communities. Public
librarians appeared more engaged in educating the entire community, focusing less on specific
age groups or populations and more on supporting the educational and instructional needs of the
community as a whole including teens.
Clearly, the informational and educational support of young adults patrons is a place of
pride for the participating librarians. In most cases, the librarians expressed a need to do more for
their teen patrons either by engaging in more professional development on different issues,
offering more in-library programming, or collaborating more with teachers and other members of
the community to improve services. The participating librarians focused on more traditional
programming and instruction topics rather than socially conscious and sensitive issues like
cyberbullying. Additional research on the changing nature of library programming and
instruction is needed as librarians take on more socially responsible roles in their communities
and schools.
5.3.3.3 Provided Empathy and Support: Social/Emotional/Psychological
For librarians, providing social, emotional, and psychological support typically goes
along with other provided services such as readers’ advisory, one-on-one tutorials, library
design, and informal conversations during programming (Cesari, 2014; Cronin, 2001; Jennings
& Greenberg, 2009; Jones, 2008). While this support is rarely highlighted in LIS literature, it can
be seen in various articles regarding dealing with sensitive topics, supporting troubled teens, and

100

in the construction of a young adult collection (Jones & Delahanty, 2011; Juntunen & Saarti,
2000). Librarians as an empathetic and compassionate figure in the library have a long and
complicated history, dating back to Maxfield’s (1954) recommendation for Counselor Librarians
in academic libraries. Even at times borrowing from the fields of business, psychology, and
communication, some LIS researchers have sought ways to improve the social, emotional, and
psychological support they provide patrons of all ages (Maxfield, 1954; McGuigan, 2002;
Radford, 1996).
The category of empathetic support emerged naturally during interviews and in the video
entries of the librarians. Most of the librarians did not appear aware of the social, emotional, and
psychological support (or empathetic services) they so often provided their young patrons.
However, they spoke frequently about attempting to understand young adults, worked on relating
to teens, providing equal customer service, and spent time discussing the impact their work had
on young adults library users. The words “helping”, “listening”, “talking”, and “respecting”
arose during conversations in regards to the everyday work of librarians. Jessica, a middle school
librarian, described this support, “As a media specialist, I feel that we need to be open to all
kids”. Additionally, almost all of the librarians discussed a need to build the school library or
teen space in the public library into a comfortable, safe, and welcome environment. The
librarians mentioned the design of the library and their attempts through changes in furniture,
color schemes, and books displays to welcome young adults into the library.
While few of the librarians overly spoke about their social, emotional, and psychological
support of teens, it appeared casually through discussion of the more traditional librarian tasks
and roles. This supportive role did not appear as present in the participant librarians’ minds as
the informational and instructional support they provide. Often, when the interview would

101

openly approach the idea of social, emotional, psychological support, the librarians mentions of
school counselors, parents, and Mandatory Reporting laws would enter the conversation. The
social, emotional, and psychological or empathetic support librarians offer patrons, especially
young patrons, has rarely been researched in LIS literature (Birdi & Wilson, 2008). This project
highlights the lack of awareness of this role by librarians and the tendency of librarian to
diminish the importance of this role in the work of a librarian. A broader study including
librarians from urban and suburban libraries and communities would be helpful to further reveal
the importance and influence of this empathetic support.
5.3.4 RQ4: What empathy and support do rural librarians want to provide rural young
adults?
My fourth research question asked what types of empathy and support would rural school
and public librarians like to provide young adults during their interactions with young adults in
the library.
5.3.4.1 Wanted Empathy and Support: Information Resource
Librarians assist young patrons with their information needs every day. Indeed the
reference interview is one of the standards of any MLIS student’s education (Dervin &
Dewdney, 1986; Taylor, 1968). Whether is face-to-face on the reference desk or virtual through
Ask a Librarian or text messaging, librarians help young patrons satisfy their information needs
through the print and digital resources that they have available (Melchionda, 2007; Radford,
2006). Librarians have learned to adjust the provision of information in this new digital world by
incorporating social media, texting, and Makerspaces into their libraries’ services (Cahill, 2011,
Forte, Agosto, Dickard, & Magee, 2013, Sebrine et al., 2013).

102

Although librarians stated that they believed they already provide high quality library
services to young adult patrons, they saw areas for improvement. As demonstrated through codes
relating to “more training”, “more collaboration between teachers and librarians”, “changing
needs” and simply “wanting to do more” within the library setting, librarian spoke to the
professional and personal expectations that they have for their informational role in the library.
During discussions about cyberbullying, digital citizenship, and life skills, librarians were eager
to discuss ways in which they could add to or improve the services they are currently providing
young adults. Librarians wanted to provide more and different types of information to teens by
supplementing the print and digital resources that they had. Many of the librarians recognized
that the information needs of young adults are changing and that librarians must be aware of
these evolving needs. While librarians were largely focused on the more traditional provision of
information such as through collection development, readers’ advisory, and technology support,
they were also keenly aware of the impact that technology has had on the provision of
information and the more digitally focused information needs of young adults. This staying
current and wanting to know more about what information teens need from actual teens is
expressed by Ashley, a public librarian, in the following quote from an interview, “If I’m
missing the boat and something’s out of date, you (the teens) have to tell me. I don’t know
because I’m old. If I’m really off base with something and we’re not doing the type of
programming you want, you need to tell me.”
Part of the interviews and videos highlighted the increased awareness librarians had of
the changing information demands of young adults. Partially this informational role speaks to
another code of “balancing professional and emotional” because in some of the examples
provided by the participating librarians, the information requested was of a more personal and

103

less school-oriented direction. This is one instance where relational communication theory is
demonstrated as the librarian providing information with both content dimension (the
information shared) and relational dimensions (how the information is communicated). This
project is one small step towards beginning discussions about the interconnectedness of
information sharing and positive relationship building between librarians and young adults.
5.3.4.2 Wanted Empathy and Support: Instructional Resource
Librarians support young adult patrons through instruction in the form of formal in-house
programing, in-class visits, informal one-on-one guidance, and through librarian-designed
bookmarks, flyers, and handouts (Young Adult Library Services Association, 2015).
Cyberbullying and digital citizenship education are two areas where librarians are beginning to
turn their attention (Agosto et al., 2012). Whether librarians are assessing cyberbullying as a
media literacy challenge or online safety danger, they are creating tailor-made programming and
formal instruction to educate teens, parents, and members of their community (Bhat, Chang, &
Linscott, 2010; Childnet International, 2007). Often this instructional role is focused on young
adult patrons, but librarians do and should provide resources for the support system of a teen that
includes teachers, families, and communities (D’Auria, 2014).
Like serving as an information resource, participating librarians also wanted to improve
the quality and quantity of their instructional and educational role. This awareness seemed most
obvious among school librarians. The codes “supporting teachers”, “library leadership”, and
“advocating for teens” demonstrate this increased need to support young adults through
education that is tailored to their needs. School librarians spoke frequently about wanting to take
up more of a teacher role whether in the classroom or teaching within the library. Public
librarians focused more of improvements that could be made to in-house programming,

104

particularly education about life skills, college readiness, and career support. This type of desired
programming appeared in conversations with librarians who wanted to assist young adults in
their lives post-young adulthood. They realized that this education is not being satisfied in
schools or through other community organization and believed that it is up to the public library
to assist in some way. As Lisa, a public librarian noted, “We would like to see more movement
towards getting them prepared for life after high school or even in high school. Like, how to do a
job interview, how to dress for an interview, how to do a resume. These are the types of
programs that we tend to have teens turn out for”.
Throughout librarian interviews and video entries, the participants demonstrated an
intense awareness of understanding young adult behavior, inclinations, habits, and emotionalpsychological maturity. This awareness suggests that a compassionate and empathetic
relationship exists between librarians and their young adult patrons. Using these relationships,
librarians hoped to designed and conduct instructional programming that best met the needs of
their young patrons. There was not a suggestion that librarians designed and conducted a formal
scan of the information and instructional requests of local teens. Instead, librarians hoped to
design and provide programming and instructional services based upon personal interactions and
exchanges with their teen patrons.
5.3.4.3 Provided Empathy and Support: Social/Emotional/Psychological/Empathetic
For librarians, providing social, emotional, and psychological support typically goes
along with other provided services such as readers’ advisory, one-on-one tutorials, library
design, and informal conversations during programming (Cesari, 2014; Cronin, 2001; Jennings
& Greenberg, 2009; Jones, 2008). While this support is rarely highlighted in LIS literature, it can
be seen in various articles regarding dealing with sensitive topics, supporting troubled teens, and

105

in the construction of a young adult collection (Jones & Delahanty, 2011; Juntunen & Saarti,
2000). Librarians as an empathetic and compassionate figure in the library have a long and
complicated history, dating back to Maxfield’s (1954) recommendation for Counselor Librarians
in academic libraries. Empathy’s connection to librarianship appears in the LIS literature through
the work of a few British researchers who looked specifically about public libraries, empathy,
and social inclusion (Briony Birdi & Wilson, 2008; B. Birdi & Wilson, Hin Man Tso, 2009;
Wilson & Birdi, 2008). Even at times borrowing from the fields of business, psychology,
communication, some LIS researchers have sought ways to improve the social, emotional, and
psychological support they provide patrons of all ages (Maxfield, 1954; McGuigan, 2002;
Radford, 1996). In the last few years, larger public libraries have introduced in the concept of
including social workers or social work philosophies in the services these libraries provide
patrons (Nemec-Loise, Jenna, 2014;Westbrook, 2015).
Empathetic services, those structured activities carried out one-on-one or in groups and
everyday unstructured interactions in which the role of the librarian is to provide social,
emotional, and psychological support, can be seen as regularly provided as a result of interviews
and videos with participating librarians. Both school and public librarians discussed the one-onone support they provide students through technology tutorials, readers’ advisory, casual
interactions in the library, and during programing. Librarians also discussed their use of library
space to provide a comfortable, safe, and welcoming environment for their teen patrons.
Participating libraries recognize that the relationship that they have with teens is different that the
relationship teens have with teachers, parents, and school administration. As Jessica, a middle
school librarian noted “I have a good relationship with the students. It’s different from student’s
relationship with teachers. They can talk to me or [other librarian in school library] about things

106

they may not be able to with a teacher. I have a lot of students who come in that maybe don’t get
the attention they need in the classroom. But they get it in the library.” However, librarians often
diminished or overlooked this supportive role they play in the lives of young adults. Instead, the
librarians focused on the informational and instructional support they offer students. The
participating librarians appeared to struggle when articulating how they support students on a
more personal, social-emotional level even though they offer anecdotes about students sharing
personal and sometimes private information with them.
Even though the rural librarians could not clearly identify the
social/emotional/psychological or more empathetic support they provide young patrons, this type
of support emerged through the librarians’ interviews and videos as necessary when working
with teens. This is particularly true when the librarians highlighted the types of support they
would like to offer teen patrons in their library. The librarians were uniquely aware of the social,
emotional, and psychological development of the teens they serve. While the librarians may not
have been able to label this support, they appeared to be conscious of the impact the work they
had on teen patrons and saw their work as having some role in the happiness and wellbeing of
these patrons. In short, their professional work mattered and the health and happiness of their
young patrons mattered to the librarians.
5.3.5 What Happened to Cyberbullying?
This project began as an exploration of how rural school and public librarians can be a
source of support for rural cyberbullied young adults. However, very quickly in the interviews
with rural librarians, the conversations turned away form specific support for cyberbullied rural
young adults and turned towards more general support for rural young adults. The librarian
participants reflected upon the services they provide their young adult patrons and spoke about

107

the ways in which they provided social, emotional, and psychological to all patrons, not just
troubled, awkward, or otherwise outsider young adults. They provided this support while
performing different roles including educational, instructional, and mentoring. Overall, what
emerged from the interviews with the rural librarians participants are expressions of everyday
support for rural young adults. Often, without being fully aware, the participants highlight the
manner in which they provided comfort, encouragement, and reassurance for their rural young
adult patrons on a day-to-day basis.
Because the rural librarian prompts for the structured video autoethnography contained
specific questions about support for cyberbullied rural young adults, those discussions typically
stayed focused on their support for young cyberbullied victims. In their responses to the provided
prompt, the rural librarian participants carefully explained what they would do in a situation
involving a cyberbullied young adult. In each of participant’s video, they carefully balanced their
professional and emotional boundaries. Yet, even in these videos, the rural librarians offered
examples more general support that they provide rural young adult patrons on a regular basis.
Perhaps the participating rural librarians were better able to see themselves as playing a
supportive role on a broader scale than strictly focusing on supporting cyberbullied young adults.
In many ways, their support of cyberbullied young adults was swift and to the point. Because
Georgia librarians are mandatory reporters, the participants were quick to include references to
being mandatory reporting and seeking outside help (e.g. DEFACS, school guidance counselors)
if a cyberbullying situation arose.
5.3.6 What Happened to the Rural Context?
Despite the rural context shaping the communities in which patrons need support, the
rural librarians rarely mentioned or acknowledged their rural location. This was a surprising

108

finding because this study focused specifically on rural librarians and rural young adults. The
expectation was that the librarian participants would discuss their rural environment and various
pros and cons of working within this type of environment. While a few of the rural public
librarian participants discussed the rural communities that their librarians served, only two of
these librarians spent significant time discussing their rural environment and population. The
rural school librarians did not mention the rural community outside of their school. Instead, these
participants focused on the school environment including administration, teachers, and students.
5.4 Limitations and Reflective Considerations
This study is exploratory and used two qualitative methods for data collection and
analysis. Quantitative methods were not be used in this project. As a result, the findings are not
generalizable to the entire young adult or librarian populations. Data collection occurred in four
rural counties of Southwest Georgia and involved rural young adults and rural librarians.
Because this study focuses on rural youth and librarians, the experiences, thoughts, and beliefs of
urban and suburban teens and librarians are not reflected in the findings. Instead, this dissertation
offers directions for further research and recommendations for practitioner application.
This study focused on the complex and controversial topic of cyberbullying, as well as
the sensitive subject of social, emotional and psychological support of cyberbullied victims. At
times, some young adult and librarian participants appeared reluctant to share personal stories
and reflections with the researcher (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). Participating young
adults may have been concerned that the researcher would share these narratives with parents,
teachers, or friends, while librarians may have been concerned about the impact of sharing
personal views and/or opinions may have had on their job. Researching sensitive topics can be an
emotional and experience for both participants and researchers (Dickson-Swift et al., 2007).

109

Developing and maintaining rapport with the participants is essential to avoid negatively
impacting the quality of data collected and negatively affecting the mental and emotional health
of participants (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006; Dickson-Swift et al., 2008). Through
intensive reading appropriately about ethically interviewing minors about sensitive topics and the
challenges of sensitive research, the researcher developed a plan for potential emergency
situations encountered while interviewing (i.e. dealing with distressed teen participants).
Along with providing room for category and code development, participating in
journaling allowed me to be a more reflexive researcher. Due to the sensitive nature of
cyberbullying and the emotional experiences of young adults, this journal provided me with a
location to deal with the emotional toll of research. The emotional challenges of research and
being a researcher are rarely openly discussed in LIS literature but can be found in other fields
such as women’s studies (England, 2008; Grant, 2014). Particularly when researching sensitive
topics and involving a young population, data collection and analysis can become a very tiring
and emotionally draining experience for a researcher. For me, this occurred frequently during
this research project’s data collection and analysis. Additionally, the Southwest Georgia region is
both home and a former work environment for me. Because of this, the diary-like method of
autoethnography offered me a place to evaluate my own prejudices and assumptions related to
the research location and environment.
5.5 Conclusion
Rural school and public librarians provide a variety of services to their young adult
patrons. This small, exploratory project examined the provided and wanted library services from
the perspective of rural young adults and the provided and wanted library services from the
perspective of rural school and public librarians. The provision of these services are supported by

110

empathetic services, the structured activities carried out one-on-one or in groups and everyday
unstructured interactions in which the role of the librarian is to provide empathy. This project is
an early investigation into concept of empathetic services and its role in librarian support of
young adults.
5.5.1 Future Directions for Research
Future directions for research include a broader study involving urban and suburban
librarians and young adults, which would highlight any similarities and differences regarding
empathetic services that may exist between these different types of communities and libraries. In
future research, I will continue to test out the relational communication theory and empathetic
services models that I have developed during this project. Additionally, because teen mentorship
by librarians emerged as major theme and currently lacks research, I see another exploratory
study investigating librarian mentorship of teens and the impact of this mentorship for both
librarians and teens.
Another future direction for research is the potential to use relational communication
theory as a framework for understanding empathetic services and librarian-patron interactions.
Relational communication theory provides support for the need to provide empathetic services.
Through interpersonal communication and the expression of verbal and nonverbal signals,
librarians are able to offer empathy, compassion, and social-emotional support to patrons while
at the same time performing their informational and education roles. Using this theory as a
framework, we can see how information not simply passed along from sender to receiver without
containing any social, emotional, or psychological aspects. Instead, relational communication
theory demonstrates that information transition is a complex and, sometimes, emotionally filled
experience. The theory has ties to research by established LIS researchers such as Dervin (1992),

111

Kuhlthau (1991), and Taylor (1968). As Kuhlthau (1991) discussed in the process of information
seeking, from the user’s perspective, is composed of cognitive and affective elements. In each
stage of her information search process (ISP), a user or, relating it to the present project, a young
adult experienced feelings such as uncertainty, optimism, frustration, and relief (Kuhlthau,
1991). These are feelings that a librarian helps assuage through interpersonal communication and
empathy at the circulation or reference desk.
Additional directions for future research include exploring librarians and concepts of
help. Librarianship has been considered a service profession, a service-oriented profession with
the goal of assisting patrons (Asheim, 1979). More exploration is needed in librarians as
providers of help and how they understand this provision of help. Another direction for research
is the idea of empathy as a teachable skill. There has been much discussion regarding the
teaching of empathy within healthcare professions (Hojat et al., 2002; Ozcan, Oflaz, & Bakir,
2012). Could empathy and empathetic services be taught with an MLIS course? Would there be a
benefit to adding training about empathy and empathetic services to a MLIS program? Several of
the rural librarians participating in this study discussed the lack of education they had received
about empathy and support within their MLIS coursework and on the job. These rural librarians
also expressed an interest in receiving more training in these areas. Research focusing on these
questions would benefit not only LIS research but also librarianship as a profession.
5.5.2 Implications for Practice
There are several implications of this research for librarianship practice. This project
reveals the important role of empathy in providing library services to young adults. It presents
the concept of empathetic services as one way to describe the empathy that is offered to young
adults in the library. This exploratory project reveals the way in which all library services,

112

particular those for young adults, are supported by empathetic services and empathy in library.
This project also reveals the lack of training these participating librarians believe they have had
regarding empathetic services and social, emotional, and psychological support. Whether this
gap is a result of training lacking in MLIS programs or on the job, the interviews and video
entries of these librarian demonstrate that the participants believe that their work could be
improved by additional professional development training that could better assist them in
providing empathetic services to teens.
5.5.3 Implications for Research
There are several implication for this research for the field of LIS. By offering a term,
“empathetic services”, and clear definition, this project will aid in fostering communication
about empathy in the library within the overall library community. Through the introduction of
empathy in the library, other researchers could continue investigations into this infrequently
research but important role within librarianship. Finally, this project presented a rarely used
qualitative method in LIS, autoethnography, as one possibility for conducting compelling and
thoughtful research with different population groups.

APPENDIX F
SAFETY PLAN FOR YOUNG ADULTS
This research is being conducted in Georgia and will follow the state’s cyberbullying
laws and policies. The Department of Education in Georgia requires each school district to have
policies in place regarding prohibition of bullying (face-to-face and online), handling bullying
incidents, consequences of bullying activities, and procedures on informing the parent/guardian
of both the victim(s) and perpetrator(s). School administrators, teachers, librarians, and staff are
required to report credible harassment or bullying of a student. Like school librarians, public
librarians are mandatory reporters of suspected child abuse. Although the researcher is not an
employed public librarian in the state of Georgia, she will make every effort to report specific
cases of cyberbullying to a parent/guardian, school principal, or police. However, the researcher
will only report a case of cyberbullying if requested to do so by the participant.
•

If a young adult participant reports an on-going or past cyberbullying, specific situation,
the researcher will ask the participant if he/she would like the cyberbullying to be
reported to his/her school principal. The cyberbullying behaviors will only be reported at
the participant’s request.

•

If the participant requests his or her cyberbullying experience reported, the researcher
will contact the school principal where the participant attends school and/or the parent of
the participant.

•

If the participant does not want the cyberbullying reported, the researcher will encourage
the participant to share these experiences with a parent, teacher, or school counselor. The
researcher will provide the participant with the names and phone numbers of the middle
and high school principals and school counselors within the local school district.

121

The participant will be reminded at the beginning of the interview that participation is
voluntary and that the interview can end anytime he/she wants. During the conversation, the
researcher will observe the participant’s facial features, gestures, and body language for signs of
distress. If signs appear, the researcher will again remind the participant of the voluntary nature
of the interview.
If a young adult participant becomes extremely distressed during an interview, the
researcher will pause the interview. The participant will be encouraged to take a 10-minute cool
down period. This will provide the participant an opportunity to excuse him or herself to visit the
restroom, check his/her phone, read, listen to music, and/or stretch. These interviews will take
place in a private room of the local public library. The resources at this library will also be
available to the participant to help with relaxation. These resources include books, music, quiet
spaces, computers, and games.
After this 10 minute cool down, the researcher will ask if the participant would like to
continue the interview. If the participant would like to continue, the interview will restart.
If the participant does not wish to continue, the interview will end. Once the interview
ends, the researcher will ask if the participant would like a parent or guardian contacted. If the
participant would like a parent or guardian called, the researcher will use a phone number
provided on the parental/guardian permission form. The researcher will provide the participant
with a list of local bullying support groups, therapists, school counselors, and relevant local
youth organizations. The researcher will encourage the distressed participant to reach out to
someone about his/her experience.
If the participant does not want anyone to be contacted, the researcher will give the
participant time to calm down and become comfortable before leaving the interview room. The

122

researcher will also provide the youth with a list of local bullying support groups, therapists,
school counselors, and relevant youth organizations.
One week after the interview, the researcher will contact the participant by a phone
number or e-mail address provided by the participant. During this phone call or e-mail, the
researcher will ask the participant how he/she has been feeling since the interview. The
researcher will also ask if there is anything the she can do to help, such as providing additional
resources, groups/organizations to contact, and/or other information.

questions you may have before agreeing to take part in this study.
Procedures:
If you do agree, you will take part in in a 30-minute conversation with me. You will be asked
about your social media use and experiences being cyberbullied and/or witnessing cyberbullying.
You will also be asked about the effects of cyberbullying. You do not have to share about
anything you are uncomfortable discussing. This study may help librarians and other adults learn
ways to help victims of cyberbullying.
After this interview, you will record one video entry using your smart phone, laptop, or other
device. I will provide you with a short list of questions for you to respond to during the video.
Recording this video should take about 10 minutes. After you finish recording, you will upload
the video to a secure website. The researcher will only use the video for transcription purposes.
Your video will only be accessible by the research team. No one else will see this video. Your
video will not be available to anyone else. Once your video has been transcribed, it will be
deleted.
Please talk this over with your parents or guardians before you decide whether or not to
participate. We have asked your parents or guardians to give their permission for you to take part

124

in this study. But even if your parents or guardians say, “yes” to this study, you can still decide to
not take part and that is okay.
Risks and Benefits:
The risks in this study are questions about cyberbullying, consequences of cyberbullying, and
“what if” cyberbullying scenarios that may be somewhat sensitive. You will be asked about your
experiences being cyberbullied and/or witnessing cyberbullying. You will also be asked about
the effects of cyberbullying. You do not have to share these experiences if you do not feel
comfortable doing so. If you feel uncomfortable at any point while recording the video or
discussion, you can end participant.

only be used by the researcher to take notes and will only be seen by researcher team. In no way
will these records be available to others or made public. After the video and audio recordings
have been transcribed, they will be deleted.
It will not be possible to figure out your responses once the videos have been transcribed. All
documents will be kept securely for one (1) year after this study ends in a password-protected

125

laptop accessible only the researcher. At the end of this one-year period, all video and audio
transcripts will be deleted.
If you discuss a specific ongoing or previous case of cyberbullying during the video or interview,
the researcher will make every effort to report this cyberbullying experience to a parent/guardian
or school principal. However, the researcher will only report a case of cyberbullying experience
if you ask her to report it. Your consent is important to the researcher.
Voluntary Nature of the Study:
If you do not want to be in this study, then you do not have to participate. This study is
voluntary, which means that you decide whether or not to take part in the study. Being in this
study is up to you, and no one will be upset in any way if you do not want to participate or even
if you change your mind later and want to stop.

APPENDIX H
PARENT/GUARDIAN PERMISSION FORM
My name is Abigail Phillips, and I am a doctoral student from the School of Information at
Florida State University. Your child is invited to be in a research study about how librarians can
be a source of support for cyberbullied teens. We are asking that your child to take part because
he/she is in the age group we want to study. We ask that you read this form and ask any
questions you may have before agreeing to allow your child to take part.
Procedures:
The purpose of this study is to find out what types of support teens think would best help
cyberbullied teens. It is also designed to find which types of support librarians believe they
should provide cyberbullied teens. If you agree to allow your child to participate, he/she will
participate in a 30-minute discussion with me. Your child will be asked to briefly discuss what
he/she defines as cyberbullying, his/her experiences being cyberbullied and/or witnessing
cyberbullying, and what advice or help your child would give a cyberbullied friend. This
discussion will be audio recorded by the researcher. After the audio recording has been
transcribed, this recording will be deleted.
After this interview, your child will be asked to record a single 10-15 minute video entry. Then,
your child will upload this video to a secure website. This video will only be used by the
researcher for transcription purposes and will only be accessible by the research team. This video
will not be available to anyone else. Once your child’s video has been transcribed, the video will
be deleted.

128

Risks and Benefits:
The risks in this study are questions about cyberbullying, consequences of cyberbullying, and
“what if” cyberbullying scenarios that may be somewhat sensitive. Your child will be asked
about his/her experiences being cyberbullied and/or witnessing cyberbullying. Your child will
also be asked about his/her thoughts regarding the effects of cyberbullying. It is not necessary
that your child have experience with bullying or cyberbullying. Your child does not have to share
these experiences if he/she does not feel comfortable doing so. If your child feels uncomfortable
at any point during the video recording or discussion, he/she can end participation.
While there are no direct benefits to you or your child if he or she takes part in the study, the
study’s findings may help librarians and other adults learn ways to improve the help currently
provided to young victims of cyberbullying.
Compensation:
Each child in this study will receive a $25 gift card upon completion of his or her participation.
Your child also may receive credit for volunteer or community service hours if desired.
Confidentiality:
The records of this study will be kept private and confidential to the extent permitted by law. In
any sort of report I may publish, I will not include any information that will make it possible to
identify you or your child. Your or your child’s name will never be revealed during reporting of
this research. All documents will be stored securely and only the research team will have access
to these documents.

129

The videos will only be used by the researcher for transcription purposes and will only be
accessible by research team. In no way will these videos be available to others or made public.
After the video and audio recordings have been transcribed, they will be deleted.
It will not be possible to figure out your child’s responses once his or her video has been
transcribed. All documents will be kept securely for one (1) year after this study ends in a
password-protected laptop accessible only the researcher. At the end of this one-year period, all
video and audio transcripts will be deleted.
If your child discussed a specific ongoing or past case of cyberbullying during the video or
interview, the researcher will make every effort to report this cyberbullying experience to you or
a school administrator. The researcher will only report a case of cyberbullying experience if your
child requests her to do so. The consent of your child is important to the researcher.
Voluntary Participation:
Your child’s participation in this study is completely voluntary. Your child may skip any
questions he or she doesn't feel comfortable answering. Your decision whether or not to allow
your child to take part will not affect your current or future relationship with Florida State
University or with your child’s school. If you decide to allow your child to take part, your child
is free to not do the interview or video, skip any questions, or stop at any time. You are free to
withdraw your child at any time without affecting your relationship with the University or your
child's school.

APPENDIX I
ADULT CONSENT FORM
You are invited to participate in a research study of cyberbullying and librarian support for
cyberbullied young adults. You have been selected as a possible participant because you work as
a professional librarian in a rural community. Please read this form and ask any questions you
may have before agreeing to be in the study.

This study is being conducted by Abigail Phillips,

Doctoral Candidate, School of Information, Florida State University.
Background Information:
The purpose of this study is to understand what types of support librarians believe should be
provided to cyberbullied young adults. The perspectives of young adults, school, and public
librarians are necessary to improve these support services.
Procedures:
If you agree to be in this study, we would ask you to do the following things:

(1) record one

video entry lasting about 15 minutes, and (2) participate in an approximately 45 minute interview
session with the researcher. This interview will occur one week after you complete recording the
video entry and will take place in a private room in the local public or school library. This
interview can occur during or outside of your work hours. The researcher will fit her schedule to
whatever time and day work best for you.
Risks and Benefits:
The study has minimal risks. You may be asked sensitive questions about cyberbullying
including experiences with cyberbullied young adults and “what-if” scenarios. If you feel
uncomfortable at any time with the questions or your responses, you do not have to respond or
may respond in a way that feels more comfortable to you. The benefits to your participation

132

include advancing the librarian profession and discovering ways to improve the services you
currently provide young patrons.
Compensation:
You will receive payment in the form of a $25 gift card. You will receive this payment upon
completion of interview with the researcher.
Confidentiality:
The records of this study will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. In anything I
may publish, I will not include any information that will make it possible to identify you, your
school and/or library. Your name or the name of your school and/or library will never be
revealed during reporting of this research. All documents will be stored securely and only the
research team will have access to these documents.
Videos will only be used by the researcher for transcription purposes and will only be seen by
research team. In no way will these videos be available to others or made public. After the videos
have been transcribed, they will be deleted.
It will not be possible to identify your responses once the video has been transcribed. All
documents will be kept securely for one (1) year after this study ends in a password-protected
laptop accessible only by me. At the end of this one-year period, all video and audio transcripts
will be destroyed.
Voluntary Nature of the Study:
Participation in this study is voluntary. Your decision whether or not to participate will not affect
your current or future relations with the University or your library/school system. If you decide
to participate, you are free to not answer any question or withdraw at any time without affecting
those relationships.

“I’ve never experienced
cyberbullying as an adult,

cyberbullying as a
teenager on Facebook
through harsh public
comments on status
updates and pictures.
Teens bashed the
appearance of another
teen. Eventually, the abuse
escalated and it was
brought to the attention of
school administrators. The
bully was required to
attend anger management
courses and workshops on
dealing with others

“Sometimes in a rural area
you run into people who
don’t understand literacy
(reading levels). Her dad
was functionally illiterate.
He read on a 3rd or 4th
grade level. “Some of the
kids who come in are

141

facing that. Their parents
may not be illiterate, but
they don’t have a high
reading level.” (23:14). It’s
more noticeable in rural
areas cause of the
population. You do pick
up clues about illiteracy
and they are passing that
on to their kids.” (Molly,

“There’s a lot of drama in

sometimes I get sucked in.
I did over eighth grade.
I’m definitely not going to
do that again. All the girls
talk about how they hate
drama, but they start all
this stuff. They’ll talk bad
about their friends. They’ll
call each other bad names.
I stay out of it by only
being friends with people
who don’t do that. It’s all
about popularity and
stuff.” (Sara, Eighth

“Frankly, it’s most girls.
You hear about guys
talking about all that crap
too. Guys are more likely
to talk about fighting. It’s
more physical. With girls,
it’s more about talking
behind each other’s backs.
It’s often people causing
drama at school.” (Joshua,
Tenth Grader)

Relationships

With friends (I)

“One friend had the exgirlfriend of an exboyfriend commenting on
her Instagram pictures.
This person did it just
because she could. My
friend first reached out to
our friend group through
group chat. She said she
didn’t know what to do or
say about these comments.
We all told her not to get
involved with it; it’ll cause
problems. But her friend
started commenting back
to the bully. She asked,
“why are you saying these
things, you don’t need to
be doing this”. It only
caused more flames to

144

come up because the bully
started commenting back.
They started private
messaging each other; just
being mean and saying
mean comments.” (Mary,

“For some teens they
would push it until it
became time for legal
action. They think they can
deal with it themselves.
I’m like you’re only 16 or
17. You don’t know
everything yet. I think
maybe they think that
dealing with that would be
a symbol that they were
grown up or proving to
themselves that they could
deal with this. Even though
you are supposed to be
older at that age, you
shouldn’t have to deal with
things like that. Especially
when you’re a teenager
and so vulnerable to what
people say.” (Mary,

“I think a librarian can be a
person someone could go
to if they were being
cyberbullied. If the
librarian monitored the
sites the teens were going
on, it would help a lot. But
if something happened
online while you were at
the library, you wouldn’t
want to tell someone about
that. You would feel like
you would get in trouble or

the computer).” (Emma,

In response to how
librarians can help: “I think
the most organic way is
just conversation. You’ve
got a kid that comes in on
a weekly basis and you
develop a relationship with
that person. That’s the
easiest way to go about
being a kind of advocate or
support system for that
person if they’re dealing
something” (David,
