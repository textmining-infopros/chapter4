Abstract

A Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding the Role of Athletic and Racial
Identities on the Health Information-Seeking Behaviors of
African American Male Athletes

In this dissertation, the researcher used a mixed-method approach to explore the
health information-seeking behaviors of African American male athletes aged from
18-34 who were not affiliated with a school or a university sponsored athletic
program. The researcher collected data from 12 in-depth, semi-structured participant
interviews and from paper surveys completed by African American male athlete
members of Purpose Driven Gym. This dissertation provides a more holistic
understanding of how African American male athletes access and evaluate health
information outside of a higher institution setting and explores the influence of
athletic identity, racial identity, and other background characteristics on African
American male athletes’ health information-seeking behaviors. This research draws
attention to the ways that race, gender, educational attainment, and socioeconomic
status can create health disparities by impacting information-seeking behaviors. It
contributes to the field of library and information studies by enhancing knowledge
about the health information-seeking behaviors of African American male athletes.
The researcher used descriptive statistics to analyze background characteristics, the
Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS), the Multidimensional Inventory of
Black Identity (MIBI). The researcher used the data from the twelve interviews to

ii

contextualize the health information-seeking behaviors of African American male
athletes in south central Wisconsin. The qualitative findings showed that athletic
identity had a role in health information-seeking behaviors. The quantitative results
indicated that racial identity scores did not play a role in the health informationseeking behaviors among the African American male athletes who participated in this
study.

Honest dialogue on race in America makes people uncomfortable. Exploring
disparities in accessing information by race often leads to difficult yet engaging
conversations. I have learned throughout my doctoral process that one must become
uncomfortable in order to evolve, challenge personal biases, and begin the critical
thinking process. I contributed this development to my research and teaching experiences
during my doctoral program. I am eternally grateful for the privilege of being a teaching
assistant (TA) in Professor Greg Downey’s LIS 201: The Information Society and
Professor Rebekah Willett’s LIS 202: Informational Divides and Differences in a
Multicultural Society. Teaching has equipped me with the strategies, confidence, and
ideas to assist me in communicating classroom expectations for managing controversial
and uncomfortable conversations. My teaching experiences have taught me that writing is
thinking. I have learned that in-class writing assignments can be an effective learning tool
for student engagement. Writing encourages students’ active and critical thinking skills
and provides an environment for students to connect their own thoughts to the assignment
which has led to active and healthy student discussions. These experiences have truly
prepared me to become a future junior faculty member. I hope that my dissertation will
promote further discussion on race, athletes, and barriers to health information.
I would like to thank the extraordinary members of my committee for their
guidance throughout this process; your time and effort has been truly appreciated, and it
has been an honor and privilege to learn from such critical scholars in the field. I thank
Professor Ethelene Whitmire for agreeing to serve as my advisor and chair of the
committee. Additionally, I would like to thank Professors Eschenfelder, Arnott-Smith,

v

Rubel, Willett, and Downey for agreeing to serve on my committee and providing
invaluable guidance and commitment. I truly appreciate all of your time and assistance—
but more importantly, your tutelage, advice, and guidance. All of you had a hand in
cultivating my scholarly guidance—and for that, I am truly appreciative.
I would like to give a huge thank you and fist bump to my cohorts in the SLIS
doctoral program—those who graduated before me and those who are still in the struggle.

have become a reality.
Last, but not certainly least — thank you God for being the head of my life, my
supernatural source, and my light. Doctoral studies is a daunting task that took me some
time to complete. Throughout my doctoral tenure, I had to remind myself that dreams
deferred are not dreams denied. Trust the process. Often the process can lead one to
become depressed, lonely, and frustrated. Throughout my matriculation, I was often
asked why I am so positive and happy when other doctoral students looked stressed and
unhappy. What you saw was the God in me. There were many days I wanted to give up

viii

but God always had a ram in the bush. God made a way out of no way countless times by
releasing favor and sending breakthrough and victory. During my low moments (yes, I
did have low moments), God stepped in and always found a way to give me an
encouraging word or placed an angel(s) in my path to direct me. My doctoral career has
not been all ice cream and cake with rainbows and unicorns. There were days full of
missteps, political incorrectness, and a bucket load of foolishness. For those who are
taking the time to read this, if I could give any words of advice for your future dreams
and goals, I would tell you to start a relationship with God and I triple dog dare you to
trust Him. I have good news for you, He won’t fail you. As it is said in Philippians 4:13,
“I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me.”

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
This dissertation was inspired by my personal experience as an African American
medical librarian living in an urban city. In my city, young men often dream of becoming
professional athletes, yet experience life from a socioeconomic and education
disadvantage, given that Wisconsin is one of the worse places for African Americans to
live in the U.S. (Schneider, 2015). In Wisconsin, the high school graduation rate for
African Americans is 66.1%, ranking 40th among the 50 states (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2015). Wisconsin’s graduation rate gap between African American
and White students is the widest in the nation. The disparity in high rates of suspensions
among African Americans compared to White students also leads the former to drop out
of school and subsequently become involved in criminal activity. Wisconsin is also
unfavorably known for its high incarceration rate of African American males. According
to a report completed by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Employment and
Training Institute, more than half of all African American men between the ages of 30
and 40 have served time (Pawasarat & Quinn, 2013). In south central Wisconsin, a
metropolitan area, the racial disparities for African Americans are just as alarming.
Statistically, the impact of Wisconsin’s academic achievement gaps and high suspension
and expulsion rates are factors that contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline, which
describes the driving of young children out of the educational system and driven into the
criminal justice system. Although young African American males aspire to a better life,
more specifically by nurturing visions of becoming professional athletes, in stark reality,
they are battling underachievement or failure in school as well as high rates of crime and
poverty that are embedded in their communities (Pawasarat & Quinn, 2013).

2

My inspiration for this research began when observing my two athletically-gifted
nephews engaged in a conversation about nutrition and muscle-building during dinner.
My nephews did not have the privilege of having a father in the household. Reared by a
college-educated single mother of four, my nephews excelled academically while
embracing leadership roles both at school and within their respective sports: soccer and
basketball. Without a father in the household, statistically, my nephews were supposed to
underperform academically, but it is my belief this did not happen because of the positive
reinforcement and active role of the immediate family. My nephews have the privilege of
not only having a mother who is college-educated, but also aunts who stressed the
importance of education along with their grandparents. There were always high
expectations from their mother and entire family of not only doing well in school but
graduating from high school and a prestigious college with the hopes of receiving a
“good and stable” job. Unexpectedly, my nephews’ dinner conversation during the
holiday season inspired this dissertation research. Listening to their conversation, I
overheard the youngest nephew say that he would text his coach a nutrition question.
This made me wonder where young, African American male athletes find health
information, and how being an African American male athlete influences a young man’s
health information-seeking behaviors.
This study has evolved over the course of 5 years. An exploration of the health
information-seeking behaviors of adolescents of color led to an examination of the health
information-seeking behaviors of athletic coaches, school nurses, and raised the question
of how coaches and school nurses address health questions posed by African American
student athletes. Using Elfreda Chatman’s Life in the Round (1999) as a theoretical

3

framework, my study of athletic coaches revealed that if athletes of color have questions
beyond sports-related injuries, coaches take a hands-off approach and direct all health
questions and concerns to other experts in the school (e.g., school nurse, social worker,
and school psychologist). Primary analysis of 10 coaches indicated that regardless of the
race and ethnicity of the adolescent athlete, coaches preferred not to venture outside of
their circle of information until it became critical. In a small world of middle and high
school athletics, health information-seeking behaviors are atypical. When something
happened beyond a coach’s knowledge of sports expertise, the coach appealed to experts
such as the school nurse and the social worker for assistance instead of doing an Internet
search. When athletic coaches sought health information, they often sent the student
athlete with the question to the athlete trainer or school nurse for an answer.
Armed with my prior analysis of coaches, I decided to research school nurses and
their role in responding to the health information-seeking needs of student athletes of
color. Using Gloria J. Leckie’s General Model of the Information-Seeking of
Professionals (Leckie, Pettigrew, & Sylvian, 1996) as a theoretical lens, my research on
school nurses revealed that they promote health by addressing health disparities, thereby
improving the health of vulnerable populations who are often in the position of being
uninsured or underinsured and lacking access to necessary medical and dental care.
School nurses are often viewed as the stewards of information to their peers and
community members such as students, teachers, support staff, and administrators. As a
result, school nurses bridge the health information gap, especially for students from
uninsured and under-insured families. They help to secure transportation to and from the

4

students’ appointments, find appropriate medical and dental service for Medicare
recipients, and provide other needed health information.
The implications of both analyses of student athletes’ use of coaches and school
nurses as sources for health-related information are vast, and present useful insights to
librarians. Interestingly, librarians are not included in the information world of coaches.
The coaches indicated that they were not aware that librarians could serve as a source for
health information. Most athletic coaches were oblivious to whether their athletes,
regardless of color, used a school or public library in general; the coaches knew even less
about whether the athletes used libraries to find answers to their health-related questions.
This study also offers insight into why school nurses did not include librarians as an
informal or formal source for health information. The school nurses’ worldviews indicate
that they believe themselves to be better equipped to serve as a resource for health
information. The study revealed that unless school nurses have cultivated a relationship
with a school or public or health sciences librarian, they will not seek information outside
of their existing network. Insights revealed in this study can equip librarians with facts to
better understand patterns in the information-seeking behaviors of school nurses as well
as to learn about the types of health-related inquiries posed by students of color. These
findings also have important practical implications for librarians who can use Leckie’s
model to explain and understand the information-seeking behaviors of school nurses and
the target population they serve. From here, practicing librarians can build a list of best
practices within library and information studies.
Following explorations of the roles of coaches and school nurses in the health
information-seeking behaviors of student athletes, I decided to focus my dissertation

5

research on the health information-seeking behaviors of African American athletes not
affiliated with a school or a university sponsored athletic program. My research
investigated the experiences or problems this group might face given their limited or
complete lack of access to some of the resources available to student athletes. I was
unsure if the same rigid expectations of health information-seeking behaviors hold for
both African American male athletes enrolled in schools and African American male
athletes who are not affiliated with a school. I wondered whether these two groups
experience similar challenges and constraints with regard to seeking health information.
In this mixed-method study, I explored the health information-seeking behaviors
of African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. By interviewing and
analyzing participants within this setting, I explored how racial and athletic identities
provide insight into the complexity of African American male athletes’ health
information-seeking behaviors. I sought to understand the underlying reasons for African
American male athletes in a non-school environment to seek health information as well
as the ways they go about seeking that information. The findings of this study will
contribute to the knowledge about the health information-seeking behaviors of African
American male athletes.
My research unfolds in five chapters. In Chapter 1, I will provide the rationale for
this study, an explanation of the three theoretical perspectives that guide the dissertation,
and an overview of the research questions. In Chapter 2, I present the literature review. In
Chapter 3, I will delve deeper into the research questions and the variables to be analyzed
and describe the data collection. Chapter 4 contains a description of the findings, while
Chapter 5 presents my reflections, discussion, and conclusions. This research study will

6

contribute to the field of library and information studies by enhancing knowledge about
the health information-seeking behaviors of African American male athletes.
In general, I define an athlete as an individual with the energy, strength, and skill
to excel in one or more competitive sports. In the African American community, athletic
success has special implications for young men. Becoming an athlete is often viewed as a
pathway for them to escape social ills within lower income communities that are laden
with crime, incarceration, high mortality and unemployment rates, and racial segregation
(Beamon, 2008). Moreover, many African American males view athletics as a vehicle for
educational and professional success (Morris & Adeyemo, 2012). Because the media
rarely portrays images of successful African American males outside of the sports and the
entertainment fields, many young African American males prioritize athleticism as their
ticket to upward mobility (Harris, 1994).
To explore athleticism and its varying implications in young African American
males, many researchers have used African American student athletes as subject
participants (Beamon, 2008; Bimper & Harrison, 2011; Foster, 2009; Harrison, 2008;
Hawkins, 2010; O’Brien, 2012; Southall, 2012; Young, 2007). Missing from the
literature are studies of health information-seeking behavior and athleticism in the
broader community of young African American men (ages 18 through 34) who are not
involved in school/university-sponsored athletic programs. Moreover, there is a dearth of
research seeking to understand the interplay between athletic and racial identities of
African American males utilizing a mixed methods approach. Unlike existing studies, I
addressed how an individual’s athletic and racial identities influence their health
information-seeking behavior.

7

To address these gaps in the literature, I defined an athlete as a member of
“Purpose Driven Gym” (a pseudonym for a boxing training gym in a Midwestern
community from which participants were recruited for this research) who participates in
one or more activities at the gym, including boxing, bodybuilding, or powerlifting. This
broad definition allows the findings from this study to be extrapolated to other nonstudent communities.
Relevance of the Topic to Library and Information Studies
Determinants exist that lead to health and well-being inequalities. According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2014), African Americans are
more likely to develop preventable medical conditions as compared to other populations.
African American males have the shortest life expectancy of all racial/ethnic populations
in the United Sates, which is impacting the social determinants of health in the African
American community (National Center for Health Statistics, 2013). The CDC has defined
social determinants of health as “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live,
work and age,” which are, in turn, responsible for health inequalities (HealthyPeople.gov,
2014). In this context, African American men suffer far worse health than any other racial
and ethnic population in America. According to the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services Office of Minority Health (2010), 70% of African American men were
obese in 2010. The 2012 National Health Interview Survey indicated that African
American men experience disproportionate ill health due to various reasons including a
lack of affordable health services, poor health education, poverty, lack of health
insurance, and insufficient medical and social services that cater to their demographic. In
addition, racial discrimination adversely affects the physiological health of African

8

Americans (Williams, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2008). African Americans are notorious for
delaying their health information-seeking, and are more likely to suffer high morbidity
and mortality rates from untreated chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke,
and diabetes (Williams et al., 2008). According to researchers at the University of North
Carolina, the mistrust of doctors delays African American men from seeking preventive
care (Hammond et al., 2010).
Athleticism is viewed as a pathway for African American males to escape poverty
and crime ridden neighborhoods. African American males frequently view athletics as a
vehicle to pursue educational and professional success. In the literature, scholars have
primarily focused on the exploitation of African American male student athletes at
Division I colleges and universities (Hawkins, 2010; O’Brien, 2012). The exploitation of
athletes has been widely researched as well (Anderson & South, 1993). Researchers have
documented the negative connotation and experiences of African American athletes to
focus on athletics instead of academics; in the classroom, these students often are
stereotypically labeled as a “dumb jock.” These dismal graduation rates are often due to
leaving college without their degree due to compounding factors such as coming to
college ill-prepared for academic studies and there are incentives to in place to reward
superior physical athletics and less emphasis on academic achievements. Many of the
above-named research utilized African American athletes as subject participants;
however, few have addressed the need to qualitatively understand the importance of
racial identity of African American males.
The health information-seeking behaviors and experiences of African American
student athletes at a large, predominately White, Division I, Midwestern public university

9

have been well cited in the research literature. Researchers have found empirical
evidence of exploitation of intercollegiate African American male student athletes in their
academic and occupational achievements (Beamon, 2008; Bimper & Harrison, 2011) and
little academic support often reflecting lower graduate rates of African American student
athletes versus their White student athlete peers (O’Brien, 2012). Although researchers
have investigated Black men’s health (Plowden, 2003), data on African American
athletes’ health information-seeking behavior literature is limited.
While these studies provided information on racial health disparities among
African Americans, there has been little empirical research in the library and information
studies (LIS) literature on variables such as racial identity and male athletes in
association with health-seeking behaviors. The purpose of this study was therefore to
examine the health information-seeking behaviors of African American males who are
non-students. One goal of this study was to determine how the racial identity of African
American males who are members of Purpose Driven Gym influence their health
information-seeking behaviors. This study will draw attention to race and ethnicity,
gender, low educational attainment, and socioeconomic status as factors affecting
athletes’ health information-seeking behaviors (Hellison, 2009; Mechanic, 2005; Syme,
2008).
Potential Contributions
I aimed to make several contributions to the LIS literature. The results of this
study will shed more light on important questions, such as how African American
athletes define themselves (Bimper & Harrison, 2011; Cokley & Chapman, 2008; Sellers,
Copeland-Linder, Martin, & Lewis, 2006; Yip, Seaton, & Sellers, 2006) and the

10

importance and centrality athletics has in a person’s life (O’Brien, 2012). It will also fill a
gap in the field by providing more research on African American athletes and their
athletic and racial identity (Brown et al., 2003; Harrison, Harrison, & Moore, 2002;
Harrison & Moore, 2007). This study can provide librarians with empirical evidence to
better understand patterns in the information-seeking behaviors of African American
male athletes as well as to learn about the types of health-related inquiries posed by these
athletes. These findings have important practical and research implications for librarians
who can utilize Abrahamson and Fisher’s model (Abrahamson, Fisher, Turner, Durrance,
& Turner, 2008), to explain and understand the information-seeking behaviors of African
American male athletes. According to Abrahamson et al., little research exists about lay
information mediaries’ (LIM) usage of the health sciences library reference services. My
research will contribute to revising Abrahamson and Fisher’s (2007) model with an
addition of the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity and the Athletic Identity
Measurement Scale to better understand the health behaviors of African American male
athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. Additionally, I investigated Abrahamson and Fisher’s
conceptual model, the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (Sellers et al., 1998)
and the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (Brewer, Van Raalte, & Linder, 1993) to
understand the complexity of African American male athletes’ health informationseeking behaviors.
Using structured interviews and a survey as a methodology, I adopted and
modified the Lay Information Mediary Behavior questionnaire based on the Abrahamson
et al. (2008) article. The questionnaire elicited participants’ demographic information,
behavior experiences, and health information source behaviors. I asked African American

11

male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym about their health information-seeking behaviors
and any barriers to their information-seeking. I aimed to provide a more holistic
understanding of how African American male athletes access and evaluate health
information. Additionally, LIS scholars (as well as researchers in other fields) can create
policies and/or models to respond to the needs of everyday health information problems
by investigating information behaviors using a micro-level form of analysis.
Conceptual Frameworks
This study is framed and rooted in three disciplinary theoretical perspectives:
information studies (Abrahamson et al., 2008), personality psychology (Sellers et al.,
1998), and sport psychology (Brewer et al., 1993). All three disciplines contributed to the
development of the research and interview questions. After the study’s themes emerged, I
reflected on all three theoretical perspectives to determine whether the data were
consistent with these perspectives.
Lay Information Mediary Behavior
Lay Information Mediary Behavior (LIMB) was derived from Abrahamson and
Fisher’s (2007) research. Using a conceptual model, Abrahamson and Fisher investigated
participants’ lay information mediary behavior through four concepts: stages, contexts,
characteristics, and effects (outcomes). Lay information mediary behavior (LIMB) theory
in this study involved African American athletes who seek information in a nonprofessional capacity on behalf of others. The lay information mediary seeks information
for oneself or for a third party (agent, muse, or proxy) who has had an information need
imposed upon him or her. I used only the Searching for Yourself survey of the lay
information mediary theory in my dissertation. For this dissertation, I focused on the

12

questionnaire to obtain participants’ demographic information, participants’ behavior
experiences, and health information source behaviors (Figure 1).
Lay information mediary behaviors occur in stages, beginning when information
is first sought and ending when it is applied or used. The stages of lay information
mediary behaviors include initiation, seeking, sharing, managing, feedback, and
application of the information. Initiation refers to information-seeking or requesting help.
Managing includes possible storage of information. Feedback is given to the athletes, and
finally the application or use of information culminates the information-seeking behavior
loop. This study included young, male African American athletes seeking information inperson, for a third party, and online (i.e., blogs, wikis, Twitter, email, and instant
messaging).
A variety of cognitive, physical, social, and affective motivations that influence
lay mediary behaviors represent barriers to information-seeking. Such motivations can
include poor literacy, poor or inadequate grasp of language, unfamiliarity with culture,
affective load, illness, time constraints, and inadequate information and/or technology
access, according to Abrahamson and Fisher (2007). These motivations can have an
effect on the behaviors that a person exhibits while seeking information.
Contextual factors may also affect the participants’ cognitive, affective, physical,
and social state at the time of information-seeking. Characteristics related to motivations
may include intentional problem solving or incidental information-seeking (which is
seeking information for curiosity’s sake). The cognitive factors include thoughts, grey
matter, and the desire to learn or to fill a knowledge gap. The affective factors relate to
emotions. The physical factors include physical state, health, physical-geographic

13

situations, and the social factors include social capital and social networks. The effects
are represented as the outcomes in the model. The positive outcomes include problem
solving, decision making, and task completion. Negative outcomes may occur if one is
given too much or too little information. The system includes a variety of formal
information sources such as books, databases, and different types of media.

Multidimensional Model of Black Identity
Sellers et al. (1998) developed the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity
Model (MIBI). A personality psychological conceptual framework, to understanding the
significance and qualitative meanings of being African American, MIBI uses four selfconcepts (i.e., racial salience, racial centrality, racial regard, and racial ideology) to
illustrate the qualitative meaning of race (Figure 2). Racial salience refers to the
significance or accessibility of race. For example, being the only African American male

14

in a clothing store followed by the store clerk may make race salient for one person,
while it may not affect another African American male. The person who believes race is
salient may believe he is being discriminated against as a result of racism, while the other
African American male assumes that the store clerk is busy being attentive to her job.
According to Sellers et al. (1998), racial centrality “refers to the extent to which a person
normatively defines himself or herself with regard to race” (p. 25).
Racial regard has two components: private regard, which is how an African
Americans feels about himself or herself and, public regard, which is how others feel
about the individual. Private regard refers to the extent to which individuals feel
positively or negatively about being African American. Public regard is how African
Americans are viewed by the broader society.
Racial ideology refers to “an individual’s beliefs, opinions, and attitudes with
respect to the way he feels that the members of the race should act” (p. 27). Four
components to racial ideology are (a) a nationalist philosophy, (b) an oppressed minority
philosophy, (c) an assimilation philosophy, and (d) a humanist philosophy.

Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS)
The Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS) is a psychological measurement
used to investigate how an individual identifies with the athletic role. It is to a degree
used to investigate the relationship of athletic identity to emotional trauma in the event of
a sports injury or career as an athlete termination. According to Brewer et al. (1993),
individuals make a social statement about themselves by choosing to engage in a
particular sport or physical activities. The athletic identity can also be explained as a
cognitive structure and social role that explores the positive and negative factors
associated with an athlete’s strong or weak athletic role. If an athlete has a strong athletic
identity, the individual will not succumb to a high degree of depression if sidelined with a
sports injury, whereas an athlete who identities with a weak athletic role will be
vulnerable to depression if a sports injury is sustained. I used this conceptual model to

16

quantify the significance that athletics has in the life of African American male athletes at
Purpose Driven Gym.
Research Question
The aim of this dissertation was to understand the health information-seeking
behaviors of African American male athletes who are neither students nor affiliated with
a school sports team. I developed one research question to guide the study, which was:
RQ1. How do the athletic and racial identities along with the background
characteristics of African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym influence their
health information-seeking behaviors?

17

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
To gather materials for my research, I searched the following bibliographic
databases for peer-reviewed literature written between the years 1990 and 2017:
Academic Search, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (LISTA), Proquest
Research Library, ERIC, PubMed/MEDLINE, Social Sciences Full Text,
SPORTSDiscus, and Web of Science. Major subject search terms included, but were not
limited to, the following: male, athletes, African American or Black, athletic identity,
racial identification, and race. The minor subject headings included, but were not limited
to, the following: advice seeking, health, health information, health disparities,
information behavior, information resources, information-seeking, and interpersonal
seeking.
The following section will draw upon findings from leading scholars’ research
about health information-seeking needs and behaviors of African Americans and their
health concerns. The section uncovers methods African American male athletes use when
receiving health information and where they go to look for health information. An
overview of consumer health information-seeking behaviors will follow.
Scope and Nature of the Related Literature – LIS Field
Understanding the context in which this research originates requires going to the
history of the dissemination of health information in the United States. That history set
the stage for the relationship between individuals and information about their health. It
also set precedents for patient and individual access to health information. An offshoot of
the women’s movement, which ushered in a new era of democracy, saw patients and
physicians formally initiating open relationships that led to the partnerships seen today in

18

healthcare. In 1972, the American Hospital Association published the Patient’s Bill of
Rights, which stated that “the patient has the right to receive from his physician complete
current information concerning his diagnosis, treatment and prognosis in language the
patient can reasonably be expected to understand” (American Hospital Association,
1975). The early consumer health information programs in the 1970s and 1980s bore
witness to a radical change toward empowered consumers who began asserting their new
role and questioning the state of healthcare practice (Mays, 2004). Since then,
understanding of patients’ and individuals’ relationship to health information has
evolved. Today, both general healthcare information and information about health
conditions specific to particular individuals are readily available for consumption. This
availability gives individuals more control over their health, but only if they can seek out
and access the right kinds of information.
While the topic of health information-seeking behavior is not new, only a handful
of studies have specifically explored the health information-seeking behaviors of African
Americans. Morey (2007) addressed the dearth of theory-based consumer health
information-seeking behaviors of African Americans in the library and information
studies literature by using Granovetter’s strength of weak ties as the conceptual
framework to explain and predict the consumer health information behaviors. Using
telephone surveys, Morey interviewed 216 African American men and women to
investigate where they found health information within the last six months. Morey
determined that health service professionals were the preferred source of health
information, whereas librarians were not sought after as a source.

19

When scholars have focused on the use of libraries to access health information,
they generally find that libraries are shunned. Hughes-Hassell and Agosto (2006) is one
of the few well-cited researchers within library and information studies (LIS) to examine
the health information-seeking needs and behaviors of urban adolescents by investigating
the role public libraries play in providing information to urban adolescents. According to
Lieberman and Harris (2007), young African American women utilize non-traditional
health information intermediaries such as hair stylists as an information source.
Urban adolescents seem to seek out unconventional sources for information,
relying on their communities and networks rather than on institutions of knowledge, such
as libraries. Lieberman and Harris (2007) studied beauticians as health literacy agents and
beauty salons as health-education portals for adolescent, inner-city, African American
girls. In African American communities, women are viewed as the gatekeepers of the
health of the family; furthermore, building upon that knowledge and experience, beauty
salon owners are often viewed as community leaders, especially in the lives of many
young women (Lieberman & Harris, 2007). Using beauty salon owners as lay health
educators to promote health awareness, Lieberman and Harris found that although hair
stylist are natural community leaders well positioned to disseminate health information,
barriers to using hair salons owners are the beauticians’ low literacy level and
adolescents’ mistrust of adults. These barriers limit the effectiveness of certain
community leaders such as beauty salon owners as sole sources of health information.
Barbershops are also an effective venue for health promotion among African
American males. Moore et al. (2016) showed that African American males are not going
to their primary healthcare providers for health information instead appear “less

20

comfortable with receiving medical and mental health services in churches and
barbershops” (p. 777). African American men do not typically go to the doctor. So,
meeting Black males in an environment where they are already comfortable to receiving
health information is ideal.
Other researchers have seen the potential of community leaders to provide muchneeded support to young people, raising awareness of adolescent health and the need to
educate this hard-to-reach-population (Vargas, 2005). In LIS, Agada (1999) reported on
African American gatekeepers in Harambee, an inner-city neighborhood in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. These gatekeepers focused on answering “everyday information needs and
problem situation” (Agada, 1999, p. 74). Most importantly, Agada’s research found that
traditional information services do not meet the survival needs of the Harambee residents.
This is partly due to the gatekeepers’ lack of awareness and use of potential information
sources and their distrust of information from sources outside the inner-city community.
Scholars have also studied methods used to improve health information access
within urban communities. For example, to narrow the digital divide and health
disparities of African Americans, the Edward G. Miner health sciences library at the
University of Rochester Medical Center partnered with inner city African American
churches and a community center to develop a train-the-trainer pilot project to teach
community leaders ways to find reliable health web resources (Sollenberger, Degolyer, &
Rosen, 2003). Sollenberger and colleagues primarily focused on outreach to African
Americans and connecting them with Internet access. Spink and Cole (2001), on the other
hand, investigated the information-seeking and information needs of residents of the
Parks at Wynnewood in Dallas, Texas, a low-income African American community.

21

According to Spink and Cole (2001), disadvantaged populations process health
information differently than the middle-class. The poor tend to use channels of
information-seeking such as their family physician and family members whereas the
middle-class families tend to use the media.
A review of the literature summarized that patients seeking health information
often have no library or research skills and no idea where to begin to find the answer to
their question, have difficulty interpreting conflicting information, and lack the skills to
evaluate the quality of information they discover (Perry, Kelder, Murray, & Klepp,
1992). Gittelman, Mahabee-Gittens, and Gonzalez-del-Ray (2004) stated that “to best
address the needs of patients, physicians need to have knowledge of what families
actually understand about the medical terms they use in everyday discussions” (p. 757).
The Internet has propelled the consumer health movement to the forefront of
libraries. Research has demonstrated repeatedly that more and more patients are turning
to the Internet as their source of medical information (Mays, 2004). Internet-savvy
healthcare consumers are completing their own online health information searches.
According to the results of a Pew Internet and American Life survey, patients
increasingly are turning to the Internet to learn about their conditions, research treatment
options and find support groups (Fox & Duggan, 2013). The survey showed that 74% of
the general population, and 51% of people with chronic illnesses, use the Web for
medical research. Medical professionals are beginning to recognize the value of credible
medical sites and are helping patients and the general public navigate health information
online (Fox & Duggan, 2013).

22

Analyzing the information behaviors of underserved populations at a micro-level
is often neglected in mainstream research, and an understanding of the information need,
use, and seeking behavior of ordinary people is missing from the LIS literature.
Chatman’s theories held significant implications for my conceptualization of the
everyday health information-seeking behaviors of African American male athletes.
Chatman’s theories helped me realize that information-seeking behaviors in the LIS field
is dynamic and does not follow the approach of one-size-fits-all.
Elfreda A. Chatman, creator of three theories: Information Poverty, Life in the
Round, and Normative Behavior, used common concepts to explain everyday information
behaviors. Each theory offers sufficient contributions to understanding human
information-seeking behaviors of underserved populations. Using ethnographic and
qualitative research methods, Chatman studied the small world lives—a world that
consists of members who share common experiences and viewpoints. Chatman focused
her research on understudied groups such as the elderly, janitors, retired women and the
working poor. Chatman’s chosen population to study was women, a historically
overlooked and undervalued target group by mainstream scientific research (Reid &
Kelly, 1994; Rosser, 1994). The women Chatman focused on were a society of
invisibles—persons not only isolated from mainstream scientific research, but also
frequently information deprived. Chatman explored why everyday information-seeking
behavior is the way it is. She investigated “the factors that hinder persons from making
use of relevant knowledge that is both known and accessible” (Chatman, 1996, p. 196).

23

Focus of Chatman’s Theories
Intrigued by the lifestyle of poverty and methods of information dispersion with a
small world view, Chatman applied conceptual frameworks within sociological research
to information (Chatman, 2000). The following sections define and explore Chatman’s
theories focusing on the conceptual underpinnings of sociologists Peter Berger, Erving
Goffman, and Alfred Schütz and Thomas Luckmann, scholars extensively cited by
Chatman in her work. This section of this dissertation suggests strengths and weaknesses
of Chatman’s theories and includes discussion of common concepts used by small world
and everyday information behavior researchers and suggests connections to established
library and information studies (LIS) research.
Chatman’s Theoretical Inspirations
Chatman’s (1999) scholarly work was heavily influenced by a large body of
theorists. For this paper, I selected and reviewed the work of three sociology scholars by
briefly summarizing the scholars’ work and providing a critical analysis of the concepts
that inform Chatman’s theoretical framework. Heavily influenced by Peter Berger’s of
concept of social control, Erving Goffman’s dramaturgical principles, and Alfred Schütz
and Thomas Luckmann’s concept of life-world, Chatman conceptualized these theories
for everyday life.
Peter Berger’s Social Control
Berger (1963) provided an interesting arrangement on the role of social control in
everyday life from a sociological perspective. Influenced by the writings of Alfred
Schütz, Berger viewed man’s social existence in the chapters “man in society,” “society
in man,” and “society as drama.” In the chapter “man in society,” Berger argued that

24

man is enslaved to social control, “society not only determines what we do but also what
we are” (1963, p. 93). In other words, one gains a sense of oneself by becoming aware of
one’s social location. Berger analyzed man’s fate as an individual in society by drawing
parallels between individuals and society and concludes by saying it is up to the
individual to decide the meaning of what it is to be located in society. In the chapter
“society in man,” Berger stated that society predefines man in how he grasps the world,
his experience, and existence through his worldview. Worldview is determined societally
through the language used by the society; “our language is not chosen by ourselves but
imposed upon us by the particular social group that is in charge of our initial
socialization” (Berger, 1963, p. 117). Berger assumed that there is a shared reality and
stated that “reality is socially constructed,” (1963, p. 118) which is accurately stated in
my opinion. Although the examples Berger uses are dated, they illustrate his sociological
insight; worldview does permeate policy. Berger viewed life as a stage and society as
composed of actors who play various roles, whether authentic or not. Viewed through a
sociological perspective, society’s reality is dramatic; it is uncertain and unpredictable.
Similar to Goffman’s (1959) Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Berger illustrated an
image of a dramatic model of society as life on the stage. Berger was inspired by
Goffman’s engaging and vivid examination of everyday life and specifically by his
worldview concept.
Erving Goffman’s Dramaturgical Principles
Chatman’s conceptual framework was reinforced by Goffman’s work, The
Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959). Goffman was considered a maverick in his
field and a master at observing everyday life. While working on his dissertation, Goffman

25

spent 18 months on a small island off the coast of Scotland studying the day-to-day lives
of inhabitants and their social interactions with outsiders, including himself. This
fieldwork experience allowed him to develop a vocabulary used to describe the general
features of face-to-face interactions, as well as a set of definitions and classifications.
Effectively using theatrical performances as metaphors and framework, Goffman
(1959) studied human behavior involved in social interactions by studying the minutia of
everyday life and face-to-face interaction as if it were a theatrical performance. He
described six dramaturgical principles, also known as theatrical performances, by
individuals who perform for the benefit of other people as an attempt to guide and control
the impressions formed by the individuals in an audience. Goffman theorized that there is
no real self; we all hide behind a set of masks and theatrical performances.
Using theatrical performances in the information-seeking environment has
important implications for Chatman’s theories; it exposes the invisible truths of everyday
social life. I agree with Goffman that we are all actors in our everyday life. Performances
can be either cynical or sincere, depending on whether the performer believes in the part
being played. For instance, as an advanced doctoral student, my performances in the front
region (in front of professors and peers) are starkly different from my performances in the
back region (preparation for classes by reading and studying). Living in multiple small
worlds—graduate student, daughter, sister, and aunt — my world intertwines with
Goffman’s dramaturgical performances, which are linked to Chatman’s conceptual
theories. Furthermore, theorists Schütz and Luckmann’s concept of the life-world heavily
influenced Chatman’s small world concept.

26

Alfred Schütz and Thomas Luckmann’s Life-World
Alfred Schütz died before the completion of his book, The Structures of the LifeWorld (1973). His former student, Thomas Luckmann, carried the torch by bringing
Schütz’ lifelong work on the social reality of everyday life to fruition. The authors
provided a detailed phenomenological analysis of the life-world and natural attitude of
social reality in everyday life. Schütz examined the lived experience in the everyday
social world using phenomenology in social science as a framework. Concerned with the
intersubjective character of those experiences, Schütz investigated every day, ordinary
experiences which he called life-world—the world of common-sense realities. The
concept life-world is cognitive and simply refers to an everyday way of being. The lifeworld includes situations in which individuals face the reality of the everyday social
world. The strength of Schütz’ and Luckmann’s argument is that individuals apply
typification (to serve as an example) to their life-world experience. Individuals will often
typify (characterize) a phenomenon with their own existing knowledge. For example, one
may equate a neighborhood with high levels of unemployment when viewing a young
man and his associates standing on a street corner on a daily basis, drinking and smoking.
The individual is typified as a person without stable employment and possibly a
boisterous, drunken nuisance to the neighborhood. Similarly, all individuals have models
in their life-world based on either positive or negative experiences.
Chatman’s Theories
Giving context to information behaviors, Chatman (1999) explored the everyday
needs of marginalized populations. Applying a host of sociology models to information,
Chatman’s research framed social life theory and methods into a scientific, yet reality-

27

based, micro-level analysis of underserved groups. In this section of the paper,
explanations of the four concepts are intertwined with Information Poverty, Life in the
Round and Normative Behavior theories. Additionally, small world, social norms, social
types, and worldview are critically discussed and linked with previous researchers.
What is small world? In Chatman’s (1999) article Life in the Round, the author
explained that members within a small world are connected around common activities
and interests. The small world is a world where members are socialized in their own
bubble and live in a community where the realities of everyday life are understood as fact
and status quo. The members in this world greatly impact information behaviors by
determining the value of certain information and the trustworthiness of information
sources. The small world dictates how its members communicate, maintain contacts,
search for information, stay in touch with people, and gossip. Living within this small
world, life in the round is cyclical; “information seeking beyond the small world is
neither needed nor wanted” (Fulton, 2005, p. 80). Individuals take on various
roles/performances in their small social worlds, acting as a daughter in one, a colleague in
another, a military officer in a third, and even as a criminal in another (Berger, 1963;
Goffman, 1959). Like Goffman, Berger viewed society through a sociological lens and
considers it drama. Berger (1963) believed that society is composed of actors and feels
that, “In one way or another, we are all imposters” (p. 134). Another concept in line with
Goffman and Chatman is “role distance”—members in a small world will perform for the
benefit of others outside of their world. Studying phenomenology, the authors Schütz and
Luckmann described small world as life-world. Life-world is a concept that describes the
everyday life world in which we live within. In summary, small world members want to

28

appear normal and do not want to draw unwanted attention, which results in shielding
one’s true state from others.
What are social norms? Social norms are standards of acceptable behavior in a
given context, in other words, small world members’ lifestyles and habits become the
social norms. In a small world, “information shapes collective behavior” (Fulton, 2005, p.
80). Social norms heavily influence individuals’ actions, behaviors, and thoughts. They
also dictate if it is socially acceptable to seek information beyond the boundary of one’s
small world. Activities that appear to be acceptable within one small world may appear
unacceptable and unfathomable in the context of another world. For instance, being sent
to jail or prison for a number of young minorities is a rite of passage or badge of honor
and is considered the social norm within one world, while being sent to jail/prison is an
unacceptable behavior in another small world. Berger (1963) noted that a primary
function of social norms is to tell an individual just what he or she may do and what he or
she can expect of life. Goffman (1959) used metaphors to describe social interactions
among humans. Theatrical metaphors can be applied to explain human behaviors when
social life is viewed as a performance and includes the front and back regions. The front
region is the place where the performance is given and the back region is where the
performance is prepared, a place “where the impression fostered by the performance is
knowingly contradicted as a matter of course” (Goffman, 1959, p. 112). Schütz and
Luckmann (1973) believed that social norms are linked to society, stating that “Society
defines man and is in turn defined by man” (p. 292). Schütz and Luckmann observed the
correlation between social norms and a person’s decision to search for information, “lifeworld is not my private world, but rather, is intersubjective; the fundamental structure of

29

its reality is that it is shared by others” (1973, p. 252). The sharing of this reality is what
constitutes a social norm.
What are social types? According to Chatman, social norms create and support
group-determined labels applied to certain individuals or social types. Social types refer
to one’s classification in terms of ability to acquire and use information (Fulton, 2005).
Chatman’s empirical research of women prisoners exposed the various classifications and
how that typology determines access to information and the ability to use information. In
the social world of a women’s prison, there are certain norms that create social types
where their lives seem normal and acceptable because no one has any motivation to
change it and these norms dictate one’s public behavior. For example, to survive in a
women’s prison, inmates tend to reveal and exchange information among peers only.
They never seek or share information outside of their social world boundary. Berger
(1963) believed that society exists as a network of social roles and the individual can
either accept or ignore the information within his/her social reality. For example, an
individual and/or team have discrepant roles where information is controlled; a team must
be able to keep its secrets and have its secrets kept (Goffman, 1959). Schütz and
Luckmann’s (1973) structural theories led to the social typification of everyday life. For
example, once an individual experiences a certain phenomenon, then the phenomenon
becomes typify (typical) and now belongs to a particular category of his or her experience
of the world. If one’s life-world experience is such that young men who wear their pants
hanging low are criminals, then any young man with low hanging pants, according to this
life-world experience, is now categorized as a criminal.

30

What is worldview? Worldview can be defined as “a collective perception held
in common by members of a social world regarding those things that are deemed
important or trivial” (Fulton, 2005, p. 80). The worldview is the belief system shared by
small world members. For instance, many minorities of low socioeconomic status view
the justice system as unfairly skewed against them. This may be the worldview within
one world, while in another small world worldview, the justice system is viewed as fair
and equal for all. Small world members are often devoid of information and are not
motivated to change their lives and will not cross their own boundaries until there is a
critical, relevant need. Until something tragically shakes up their small world, their
worldview remains static. Berger (1963) believed that society predefines how people
understand the world by the “language used by the society” (p. 117). Language is central
to social interaction. The similarity between Goffman (1959) and Chatman (1999) is that
worldview members have to feel a sense of belonging within their small worlds. Goffman
believed that components of the performance included the front and back regions. The
front region is the place where the performance is given, and the back region is where the
performance is prepared (Goffman, 1959). This worldview concept informs Chatman’s
small world worldview. Schütz and Luckmann (1973) examined how individuals
construct their identities and worldview within their life-world.
Information poverty. According to Chatman, information poverty is a theory and
not a concept (Chatman, 1996; 2000). Chatman (1996) described the information poor as
lacking in sources of support, as missing out on the supply of information that would
benefit them, as practicing deception as a means of self-protection from unsupportive or
threatening individuals, and as experiencing an ongoing distrust of others. Chatman

31

discovered that information poverty was not directly related to economic poverty but was
more closely linked to a “set of socially determined attitudes and norms” (Thompson,
2009, p. 120). Chatman (1996) proposed six propositions to explain information poverty:
1. People who are defined as information poor perceive themselves to be devoid of
any sources that might help them.
2. Information poverty is partially associated with class distinction. That is, the
condition of information poverty is influenced by outsiders who withhold
privileged access to information.
3. Information poverty is determined by self-protective behaviors, which are used in
response to social norms.
4. Both secrecy and deception are self-protecting mechanisms due to a sense of
mistrust regarding the interest in the ability of others to provide useful
information.
5. A decision to risk exposure regarding our true problems is often not taken due to a
perception that negative consequences outweigh the benefits.
6. New knowledge will be selectively introduced into the information world of poor
people. A condition that influences this process is the relevance of that
information in response to everyday problems and concerns.
Chatman’s findings revealed that marginalized groups have the perception that
they have no resources available to them, will engage in self-protective behaviors, and
will avoid revealing their true problems to maintain their everyday life structures and
requirements (Chatman, 1996). Berger (1963) is linked to information poverty by
providing a sociological perspective from which to view and better comprehend the

32

social world in which people live, particularly examining events or people in order to
understand how and why one category of the population behaves differently from
another. Goffman (1959) is linked to information poverty in that his research confirms
that we are all dramaturgically savvy even when alienated from information. As Goffman
noted, the key to a believable theatrical performance is to control the audience’s access to
information, so the performance itself is deemed authentic.
Strengths and weaknesses of Chatman’s theories. The strength of Chatman’s
theories relies on her examination of information behaviors of a marginalized population
group that society views as invisible. Functioning within a bubble world, information
from sources from members outside of the known social world is treated like an
infection, unless the need is so great that members cross boundaries to obtain necessary
information. Chatman’s theories have a proven record of working when analyzed at the
micro-level (Chatman, 1991; 1996; 1999).
Foundationally, Chatman understood the principles of ethnographic and
qualitative research methods. By building on the principles and concepts of sociologists
before her, Chatman was able to look for inconsistencies in the human informationseeking behaviors and present it in her theories of social life among common people. Not
only was she able to conceptualize various phenomena—social life of ordinary citizens,
who are often overlooked in empirical research—she was also able to articulate
implications for practice and research. The four conceptual themes and narratives from
the various understudied populations can be used to understand the information needs and
uses of everyday people. From here, practicing librarians can build a list of best practices
within library and information studies.

33

Chatman’s (1999) work did not address information access directly. It focused on
what information is valued and, in some cases undervalued within small worlds. In all of
her research, Chatman presented a phenomenon such as information poverty but did not
prescribe a cure for its ailment (Chatman, 1996). Chatman’s theories are limited to the
extent that they have not been proven to work at the macro-level. It is time to examine
Chatman’s theories from a macro-level perspective. For example, Chatman investigated
information on janitors (Chatman, 1991). Taking the same concept and exploring
information behaviors as a grand theory at the institutional level would usher in
contemporary theories and contribute to the understanding of human information-seeking
behaviors at the societal level. It is also an opportunity to explore Chatman’s theories in
other fields such psychology, business, and health sciences to build upon her existing
theories.
In sum, there are positive and negative reactions to Chatman’s work, but what is
most important is that her work contributed significantly to the understanding of the
social world and the human information-seeking behaviors of populations (e.g.,
university janitors, the incarcerated, aging women in a retirement community, and the
working poor and/or unemployed) largely ignored by mainstream research.
Medicine/Public Health Field/ African American Males/Student-Athletes
The concept of quality health information is widely used in humanities, the
sciences, and the social sciences. It is also used in the practice of medicine and
healthcare, and covers the fields of nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, as well as
information related to patient care, such as patient records and epidemiological databases.
The Internet provides an overabundance of access to online resources, and challenges

34

arise when the quality and reliability of the health information comes into question.
Quality health information is a sought-after commodity not only by users and librarians,
but by the whole health sector.
Empowerment
Finding quality and reliable health information has the potential to empower
consumers to lead them to make intelligent decisions to improve their healthcare
outcomes. The recent trend of medical consumerism has been to go electronic. The
Internet has facilitated this trend by providing consumers with electronic access to health
information, transforming the way health information is distributed and who has access to
it. With the advent of the Internet, along with Web 2.0 technology, information that
previously would have taken days to obtain at some financial expense could now be
downloaded in seconds (Mays, 2004). As a caveat to this easy and quick access,
consumers can be misinformed or subjected to misinformation. Some scholars have
reported that misinformation abounds on the Internet that may constitute a health risk to
the consumer (Mays, 2004).
Although the potential for misinformation exists on the internet, the number of
users relying on the Internet for their information needs continues to grow. Numerous
surveys and reports have quantified the number of users who consult the Internet for
health information. One report recently published by the Institute of Medicine stated that
70 million Americans use the Internet for health information (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer,
& Kindig, 2004). Patients are becoming better informed about their health. According to
the results of a new Pew Internet and American Life survey, patients increasingly are
turning to the Internet to learn about their conditions, research treatment options and to

35

find support groups (Fox & Duggan, 2013). The survey showed that 74% of the general
population and 51% of people with chronic illnesses, use the Web for medical research
(Fox & Duggan, 2013). Quality and reliable information is critical to making informed
healthcare decisions (Mays, 2004). Today, the Internet has transformed the way
consumer health information is distributed and who has access to that information.
Internet-savvy consumers are completing their own online health information searches.
Patrons are seeking free, quality, electronic health information written in lay terminology,
through both Internet and non-Internet users are seeking librarians for what they cannot
find (Mays, 2004).
Concerns over Quality and Quality Assurance for Health Information on the
Internet
The Internet is now a major source of health information for lay people
(Nettleton, Burrows, & O’Malley, 2005). As Internet usage has increased, medical
professionals have raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of this readily
available health information and its poor quality (Gagliardi & Jadad, 2002). Some feared
that consumers would rely on information that was not only inaccurate and unreliable, but
also harmful. While the debate continues regarding the possible benefits and risks of
health information online, the quality of information found, and the question of standards
and guidelines for assessing quality, the fact remains that eight out of 10 users choose the
Internet for access to health information (Benigeri & Pluye, 2003; Fox & Duggan, 2013).
Because quality health information has been shown to contribute to all aspects of
disease prevention and to better healthcare outcomes, library services can play a
significant role in providing quality health information to consumers (Williams et al.,
2008). Today, the Internet has transformed the way quality health information is

36

distributed and who has access. In the past, consumers who requested current, detailed
and in-depth information had to be diligent and willing to visit libraries, get help from
librarians using unfriendly databases, and read very technical medical literature. Now,
consumers and librarians have options. They have the ability to access materials through
friendlier databases and search engines, choose a preferred format for the materials (now
in several digital formats as well as in print), and select a variety of materials available to
suit all levels of understanding due to an explosion in quality-specific and easy to read
medical writing. Librarians are expert searchers. They are no longer are required to wade
through stacks of reference textbooks and miles of print journals in seeking answers to
patron’s requests. Across the nation, libraries are utilizing human, print and electronic
resources, as well as developing their own approaches to the ever-changing expectations
and health information issues. With the advent of the Internet, information that would
have normally taken days to obtain at great time and financial expense can now be
downloaded and distributed in seconds (Mays, 2004).
Reading Levels of Health Information or Language Disparities
Internet-savvy users are completing their own online health information searches,
but unfortunately most medical information is still written at a level that is difficult to
interpret and understand (Graber, Roller, & Kaeble, 1999). Although patients are seeking
quality and reliable online health information to becoming more informed and
empowering them to make intelligent decisions to improve their healthcare outcomes,
gaps in communication may cause problems. There has been increasing focus on the gap
between healthcare professionals’ and consumers’ communications. Gaps in

37

communications may occur because of misunderstanding of medication instructions, low
health literacy, and/or high stress levels after receiving devastating health news.
Librarians can be a factor in alleviating the consumer health vocabulary problem.
They can conduct impromptu one-on-one training sessions or hold group sessions to
educate consumers on common healthcare terminologies and ways to sift through healthrelated information. Librarians can also develop resources that can educate people on
common misconceptions around medical vocabulary, and also give them tools to
understand how to communicate effectively with medical professionals. These training
sessions and resources increase the likelihood that consumers will find the best health
information available and be better equipped to use it.
Low Health Literacy Skills
Literacy and health literacy are increasingly being recognized as critical factors in
determining health status.1 Graber et al. (1999) found that much Web-based material was
too difficult for most consumers, and not readable for those with low literacy levels. For
health information seekers, “if knowledge is power, librarians hold the key to
empowering millions of individuals with low health literacy skills by collecting,
developing, and making accessible health information materials in user-friendly formats”
(Ochillo & Auflict, 2005, p. 60). Librarians are also skilled in determining the
appropriateness and authenticity of the medical information they find and review for
consumers.

Healthy People 2010 defined health literacy as “the degree to which individuals have
the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services
needed to make appropriate health decisions.”
1

38

Griffith, Ellis, and Allen (2012) used focus groups to explore the role and usage
of different health information sources in the lives of 154 African American men ages 35
and older. In this study, the men preferred four sources of information for their everyday
health information: media, medical professionals, personal social network, and
community resources. Thompson, Talley, Caito, and Kreuter (2009) described that
African American men reported health concerns such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer,
stroke, and heart disease. Notably, what deterred African American men from seeking
health-related information were economic concerns such as being uninsured or
underinsured, poverty, lacking education and/or employment, conforming to community
norms, viewing their masculinity negatively, and lastly, lacking culturally appropriate
health information resources. Rooks et al. (2012) also investigated the relationship
between race/ethnicity and health information by exploring how health information that
has been sought is used outside of the doctor visit. Using logistic regression, they
determined that African Americans and Latinos were significantly more likely than
Whites to use health information, and they also sought to improve their health condition
through health information-seeking.
There is a dearth of literature exploring the health information-seeking behaviors
of African American men. Although researchers have investigated African American
men’s health (Plowden & Miller, 2000; Plowden, 2003) as well as the health informationseeking behaviors of cancer patients among African American men (Ross et al., 2013;
Thompson, Cavazos-Rehg, Tate, & Gaier, 2008; Wallington, 2008), there is little
scholarly research investigating the health information needs and behaviors of African
American men. Ajibade (2010) investigated the health risk behaviors of 127 African

39

American male college students. This study revealed that African American male college
students placed their health at risk by lack of seat belt utilization (as the driver or
passenger), tobacco use, and obesity (Ajibade, 2010). The author concluded that in order
to reduce health disparities, colleges and universities must provide health information
resources to promote better health choices as well as training in coping skills for racism
and stress which indirectly impact health. Rooks et al. (2012) investigated health
information-seeking and use between African Americans, Latinos, and Whites in the
United States. Their study not only contributed to addressing racial and ethnic minorities’
health information use within medical encounters, but it also explored racial and ethnic
minorities and Whites’ health information use outside of medical encounters. Rooks et al.
determined that those with low health literacy faced more communication challenges by
being unfamiliar with medical terminology as well as “embarrassment due to limited
understanding, and less input and power in medical decision-making” (2012, p. 177).
They determined that education was the powerful equalizer between racial and ethnic
minorities’ use of health information outside of the medical encounter.
Unlike the relative paucity of scholarly information on the health informationseeking behaviors and needs of African American men, the literature is saturated with
studies focused on the exploitation of African American male student athletes at Division
I colleges and universities (Beamon, 2008; Hawkins, 2010; O’Brien, 2012). In particular,
sociological researchers have documented the negative experiences of African American
athletes who focus on athletics instead of academics. In the classroom, athletes often are
stereotypically labeled as dumb jocks and have dismal graduation rates (Hawkins, 2010).
These dismal graduation rates often stem from their leaving college without their degrees

40

due to compounding factors such as being ill-prepared for higher education and being
focused on their athletic obligations and schedule, which often interfere with academic
work (Person & LeNoir, 1997; Robinson & Mack, 2004). Although race and sports is a
saturated topic, less is known about race and athletic identities in African American
athletes (Bimper & Harrison, 2011; Harrison et al., 2002). According to Bimper and
Harrison (2011), “African American athletes possess a modern day double
consciousness” (p. 275), and more research is needed on how sport cultures influence
how minority student athletes view themselves.
Much of the existing literature focuses on examining collegiate athletes’ identity
in football and basketball through the lens of academic performance (O’Brien, 2012),
career development attitudes (Small, 2013), and coping at predominately White and
historically Black colleges and institutions (Payne & Suddler, 2014; Rasmussen, 2009).
Using ethnographic interviews, Beamon (2008) spoke to 20 Division I former student
athletes to explore whether Division I universities are exploiting their athletic ability or
emphasizing their academic talents. Beamon highlighted that African American males
have lower graduation rates than White males. Beamon found that all 20 athletes received
a college degree but the majority of them felt that they had not fully reaped the benefits
of their college education and would not have received the degree without the athletic
scholarship. Universities emphasized their athletic role over academics. Using interviews
and one focus group, Bimper and Harrison, (2011) investigated seven African American
male student athletes (football and basketball) at predominately White university to
determine how to prevent the academic falls of athletes.

41

The athletic and racial identities of non-university affiliated African American
males is a salient but understudied topic. Little is known about health information of nonuniversity affiliated African American male athletes. Many of the above-named research
utilized intercollegiate African American athletes as subject participants; however, few
have addressed the need to understand the importance of athletic and racial identity of
African American males, qualitatively.
Abrahamson and Fisher (2007) conceptualized the lay information mediary
behavior theory by using past research on information mediaries behaviors. Abrahamson
and Fisher’s lay information mediary behavior theory model illustrates participants,
stages, contexts, and characteristics, including motivations challenges, and effects of lay
information mediary behavior. Moving from theory to practice, Abrahamson et al. (2008)
used their theory, lay information mediary behavior, as a guiding framework to study
three types of nonprofessional information mediaries (lay information mediary, direct
user, and service provider) who sought consumer health information using the North
Carolina Health Information (NCHI) website. Lay information mediary are searchers
seeking information on behalf of others or because of someone else. Direct users are
individuals search information for themselves, and service providers are healthcare
providers seeking information in a professional capacity. NCHI is an initiative developed
by the National Library of Medicine Go Local in 2003-2010, a website which provides
access to consumer health information resources to local health services and education.
Although the Abrahamson et al. (2008) lay information behavior paper has been
cited a total of 16 times in the Web of Science database, it has been used in academic
literature to provide a platform for discussing the process of information behaviors. All

42

sixteen articles citing the paper describe various information mediaries in a variety of
context of information behaviors such as Fourie and Meyer (2014), who researched
nurses in palliative care who serve as information intermediaries for patients and
caregivers of dementia patients (Kogan, Schoenfeld-Taher, & Viera, 2012) and pet
owners who search for health information for their pets. Although information mediaries
were highlighted in all the articles cited in Web of Science, none of the articles cited used
the lay information behavior theory model as a conceptual framework.
Brewer et al. (1993) was cited 250 times in Web of Science, but none of their
articles investigated the health information behaviors. Sellers et al. (1998) was cited 76
times, with none of the articles examining the health information-seeking behaviors.
Additional research is needed on how racial and ethnic minorities are interested in
finding easy-to-read information free of medical jargon and what types of health topics
are relevant to their individual needs. Several researchers have suggested that the Internet
provides opportunities for adolescents to search for health information without adult
scrutiny (Abbas, Bishop, & D’Elia, 2007). To draw more attention to and combat health
disparities among African American males, more research is also needed on how African
Americans, specifically African American male athletes, use sources of health
information to address their health information needs. More research is also needed to
identify any perceived barriers in accessing that information. Through this literature
review, I justified the need to conduct further research to understand the health
information-seeking behaviors of African American athletes not affiliated with a school
athletic program.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this dissertation was to understand the health information-seeking
behaviors of African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. The focus of the
study was on the experiences and perceptions of African American male athletes with
regard to the types of health information and information sources sought and how race
provides meaning to the participants’ information-seeking behavior. The quantitative
phase of the study involved the use of three instruments: (a) background characteristics
survey, (b) the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (MIBI), and (c) the Athletic
Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS). The qualitative phase of the data collection
included 12 semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Drawing from theories and
measurement instruments rooted in information studies, personality research, and sport
psychology, the research question that guided the data collection and data analysis phases
was, “How do the athletic and racial identities along with background characteristics of
African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym influence their health
information-seeking behaviors?”
In this chapter, I will discuss the data collection and analysis phases. The chapter
is organized by (a) setting, (b) demographics, (c) research design, (d) data collection, (e)
instruments (f) data analysis, (g) evidence of trustworthiness, and (h) challenges (i)
limitations. A summary concludes the chapter.
Setting
I conducted this study at the Purpose Driven Gym in a metropolitan area of south
central Wisconsin. Although census reports show that the racial demographic of south

44

central Wisconsin is predominantly White (78.8%), the location of the gym is generally
populated by African Americans (ZipAtlas, 2013). For the purpose of this study, I used
the terms “African American” and “Black” interchangeably to represent the participants
with African, African American, and multiracial heritage.
All 12 participants interviewed in this study are members of the Purpose Driven
Gym. The gym is located on a residential street. The gym activities range from
weightlifting to Ashtanga yoga, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, aerobics, mixed martial arts, and
boxing training. A natural bodybuilding and strongman competition is hosted in the gym
annually.
I selected the 12 participants through purposive sampling. I obtained approval
from the UW-Madison’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the owner of Purpose
Driven Gym prior to data collection. I distributed public notices (recruitment flyers)
containing the description and purpose of the study and my contact details in the gym. I
also obtained a signed informed consent form (Appendix E) from the participants prior to
data collection. .
Research Design
The research design used was a mixed-methods approach in which I
supplemented my qualitative findings from 12 in-depth, semi-structured participant
interviews with data from three paper surveys completed by participants. I chose this
mixed methodology because I am drawn to life stories and different phenomena that can
be studied through narrative approach. The benefit of interviewing individuals allowed
me to gather other people’s perspectives (Patton, 2002). Moreover, I believe that
conducting surveys and interviews is the most appropriate research method to gain fresh,

45

rich insights into the information-seeking needs and behaviors of African American male
athletes. I supplemented the interviews with validated instruments that allowed me to
quantify concepts such as athletic and racial identities that were central to my research.
The information from the surveys, coupled with the participant interviews, enabled me to
triangulate themes extracted from the data.
I chose mixed methods in order to understand health information-seeking
behaviors of African American athletes by describing: (a) the types of health information
that athletes seek; (b) their sources of information; and (c) the challenges they
encountered in this endeavor. I supplemented my findings from the participant interviews
with three survey tools. I used descriptive statistical analysis to quantitatively determine
the extent to which demographics, athletic identity, and racial identity shaped the study
participants’ health information-seeking behaviors and related informational and health
service challenges.
Data Collection
I obtained data from paper surveys and in-depth interviews from 12 African
American male athletes with membership in the Purpose Driven Gym. I acquired
approval from the UW-Madison’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the owner of
Purpose Driven Gym prior to data collection. I distributed recruitment flyers containing
the purpose of the study and my contact details in the gym. I selected the participants
through purposive sampling, specifically a snowball sampling technique. For this study, I
used purposive sampling to select a small number of African American male athletes that
would generate the most detailed information about their health information behaviors
and their athletic and racial identities. Purposive sampling technique involved using my

46

and participants’ knowledge to identify additional athletes to be included in the study
(Kemper, Stringfield, & Teddlie, 2003; Patton, 2002). I obtained a signed informed
consent form from each of the 12 participants. The informed consent form (Appendix G)
contained the purpose and nature of the study, the rights of the participants to withdraw
from the study, and the measures of confidentiality of participating in the study. The
participants were assigned an anonymous alpha-numeric respondent identifier and names
as pseudonyms to conceal their identity. The participants were also informed that the
interviews would be digitally recorded. All the gathered data were kept under lock and
key, and will be destroyed within 7 years upon the conclusion of this study.
I developed a face-to-face, semi-structured interview guide based on the study by
Fisher, Erdelez, and McKechnie (2005). The interview guide consisted of nine questions
that allowed participants to provide an in-depth analysis of their athletic and racial
identities and health information-seeking triggers and challenges (Appendix A). I
conducted the in-depth, semi-structured interviews between May 2015 and July 2015. All
the interviews were conducted face-to-face over 20 to 60 minutes, in a time and place
convenient for the participants. Given the uncertainty of the athletes’ Internet access and
abilities, I determined that paper surveys were the most efficient way to gather survey
data. I provided a $50 Amazon gift card, which served as an incentive for participating in
the study, to the participants at the end of data collection. I also gave a token of gratitude
to the owner of Purpose Driven Gym at the end of the study.
What are Interviews?
Interviews are used when seeking qualitative, descriptive, in-depth data from
people. As Dudden (2007) pointed out, “Interviewing is an exchange of information

47

using either face-to-face or telephone communication to assess individual opinions and
experiences” (p. 389). The interviewer guides the questions and focuses the study. Kvale
(1996) defined qualitative research interviews as “attempts to understand the world from
the subjects' point of view, to unfold the meaning of peoples' experiences, to uncover
their lived world prior to scientific explanations” (p. 12). I selected a qualitative approach
for this research to “seek data that helps to explain how human beings understand,
experience, interpret, and produce” (Sandelowski, 2004, p. 893).
The Purpose of Interviewing
The purpose of interviewing is to allow the researcher to gather other people’s
perspectives (Patton, 2002). It is not to test a hypotheses or to evaluate; instead,
interviews are conducted to gather stories by “understanding the experience of other
people and the meaning they make of that experience” (Seidman, 1991, p. 3). The reason
interviews are given is to get contexts or to capture thoughts. Interviews occur to find out
from people things that cannot be easily observed. For an example, it is almost
impossible to observe someone’s feelings, thoughts, and intentions, so researchers have
to ask people questions about those things to understand the meaning of their behavior.
“Interviewing allows [researchers] to put behavior in context and provides access to
understanding their actions” (Seidman, 1991, p. 4). For those researchers who enjoy
listening to, observing, and gathering stories, the interview is the method of choice.
Interviewing is an art form that can be an effective research method tool. From a
neophyte researcher perspective, interviewing is viewed as an easier method—it is
seemingly straightforward, but in reality, it is complex and labor intensive.

48

Mixed Methods Approach
Using the research question to drive the methods, I chose to use mixed methods to
confirm and understand the impact of the athletic and racial identities on the health
information behaviors of African American male athletes not affiliated with a school or
university sports program. Athletes in this study were given two closed-ended surveys
along with a semi-structured interview. I gathered the quantitative and qualitative data
simultaneously. Data analysis from the surveys and interview informed the analysis of
the other to produce in-depth information. Tashakkori and Teddlie (2009) broadly
defined mixed methods “as research in which the investigator collects and analyzes data,
integrated the findings, and draws inferences using both qualitative and quantitative
approaches or methods in a single study or a program of inquiry” (p. 286).
Instruments
Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity
Using a personality psychology lens, authors Sellers et al. (1998) developed the
Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (MIBI). The MIBI measures the salience of
racial identity and is used to explore a person’s racial self-definition as well as his or her
perception of being Black. The MIBI provided me with perspectives on how athletes
define themselves racially, and this insight helped to shape the content of my interview
questions. For example, when participants took the paper surveys, some asked me to
explain the terms used in the instruments. For example, the MIBI asked, “Blacks who
espouse separatism are as racist as White people who also espouse separatism,” to which
one participant inquired, “What is the meaning of “espouse?” Based on this feedback, I
developed a glossary of terms to ensure linguistic accessibility for each participant.

49

The MIBI has 56 questions (Appendix F). Eight questions on the MIBI measure
participants’ definition of themselves about race (racial centrality). Racial centrality is
one who defines himself or herself with regard to race. Twelve questions measure how
participants believe non-minorities judge African Americans (private and public regard).
Private regard is how African Americans feel about themselves and how other
individuals feel about them. Public regard is defined as how African Americans are
viewed by the broader society. Thirty-six questions measure their beliefs or ideology
about being African American. The assimilation philosophy refers to an individual
attempt to enter into the mainstream (nine items). The humanist philosophy is the belief
that all people belong to the human race (nine items). The oppressed minority philosophy
sees similarities as the plight of racism faced by African Americans and those of other
minority populations (nine items). The nationalist philosophy refers to one who is in
favor of being African American and prefers to connect with all Black organizations and
social environments (nine items). The MIBI uses a seven-point Likert scale ranging from
1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) that measures the constructs of racial centrality,
private regard, public regard, nationalist, oppressed minority, assimilation, and humanist
philosophies (Table 1). The seven subscales (racial centrality, private regard, public
regard, nationalist, oppressed minority, assimilation, and humanist philosophies) were
calculated by reverse coding negatively worded items and then averaging across all items
within a particular scale. Figure 2 illustrates the visual representation of the
Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity personality framework.

Definition
Racial salience refers “to the extent to
which one’s race is a relevant part of
one’s self-concept at a particular moment
or in a particular situation” (p. 24).
Racial centrality “refers to the extent to
which a person normatively defines
himself or herself with regard to race” (p.
25).
Public regard “refers to a person’s
affective and evaluative judgment of her
or his race in terms of positive-negative
valence” (p. 26).
Private regard refers to the extent to
which individuals feel positively or
negatively about being African American.
Racial ideology refers “An individual’s
beliefs, opinions, and attitudes with
respect to the way he feels that the
members of the race should act” (p. 27).
Nationalist philosophy refers to an
individual who is in favor of being Black
and prefers to associate with all Black
organizations and social environments.
Oppressed minority philosophy “sees a
link between the oppression that Blacks
face and that of other minority groups”
(p. 28).
Assimilation philosophy refers to an
individual attempt to enter into the
mainstream.
Humanist philosophy is the belief we all
belong to the human race, “humanist
viewpoint do not think in terms of race,
gender, class, or other distinguishing
characteristics” (p. 28).

51

The developers validated the MIBI instrument using 474 African American
students enrolled in an introductory psychology courses at one Historically Black College
& University (HBCU) and one Predominately White Institution (PWI) using factor
analysis (Sellers et al., 1998). The Cronbach’s alphas for the subscales ranged from low
of .60 (Private regard) to .79 (Nationalism). The means and standard deviations of each
item and subscale is illustrated in Appendix C. Permission to use MIBI in my dissertation
research was granted by Dr. Robert Sellers via email (personal communication, April 15,
2014).
In this study, I defined racial identity as the significance and qualitative meaning
that male athletes place on being African American. I used the MIBI in this study to elicit
the significance and meaning of race to male athletes and to explore how racial identity
influences their health information-seeking behavior. The study of how racial identity
influences an athlete health information-seeking behavior in the broader community of
young African American men (ages 18 through 34) who are not involved in
school/university-sponsored athletic programs is of interest.
Athletic Identity Measurement Scale
An athlete’s identity is shaped by his identification with the athletic role (Beamon
& Bell, 2002). An individual will often make a social statement about themselves by
choosing to engage in a particular physical activity. According to Brewer et al. (1993),
athletic identity is determined by the cognitive, affective, behavioral, and social
obligations associated with identifying with the athletic role. The Athletic Identity
Measurement Scale is a nine-item scale that uses a seven-point Likert scale ranging from
1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) that measures the level of importance athletics

52

has in a person’s life (Brewer et al., 1993). Sample items include “Other people see me
mainly as an athlete” and “I need to participate in sport to feel good about myself.” In this
study, I used the AIMS to quantify the significance that athletics has in the lives of the
African American male athletes.
The Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS) measures participants’ athletic
identity with seven questions that explored the positive and negative factors associated
with African American male athletes’ athletic role. I used the AIMS instrument to
measure “both strength and exclusivity of identification with the athletic role” (Brewer et
al., 1993, p. 242). High scores on the AIMS indicate a strong and exclusive athletic
identity and the creators of the instrument advocate the use of one total score. The
average total score and standard deviations of each item is illustrated in Appendix D.
The goal of the data analysis was to identify themes central to the research
question in order to locate patterns that might provide insight into the health informationseeking behavior of the participants based upon their ranges on the AIMS and MIBI. I
used the statistical software package (SPSS) to quantify the data collected from the AIMS
and MIBI.
Data Analysis
I analyzed all the scores on the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity
(MIBI), Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS) and the participants’ background
characteristics to see how the score ranges inform the health information-seeking
behaviors of African American males at Purpose Driven Gym (Figure 1). Figure 1
illustrates a conceptual framework for this study. I used descriptive statistics to measure
the athletic identity of male athletes using AIMS scores.

53

I gathered sufficient data from the paper surveys and the in-depth interviews. The
data were handled confidentially, and data analysis was conducted immediately after the
data collection in a systematic manner. I handled the qualitative data through the
computer-assisted qualitative analysis program, NVivo, to aid in coding. During the
coding process, I located patterns in the data to identify emerging themes. I conducted
content and thematic analyses to generate themes and categories to address the research
question. I used a journal to keep notes throughout the data analysis phase. The journal
was significant for reviewing the progress of the study as well as the consistency of data
analysis to minimize researcher bias.
I used a modified grounded theory to analyze the qualitative data, utilizing the
constant comparative analysis method. The method initially proposed by Glaser and
Strauss (1967) is iterative and inductive, in which each data source is compared to
another data during the coding process (Glaser, 2004). The data analysis began with open
coding to categorize the data according to patterns. At the open coding stage,
categorizing the data provided no further meaning other than grouping similar data
together. Table 2 provides the categories generated from the open coding process, by
grouping the data from highest to lowest occurrence.

I further reduced the data through “comparing incidents applicable to each
category, and integrating categories and their properties” (Glaser, 1978, p. 339). This
means that data to data comparisons were conducted initially. As the analysis progressed,
concepts and hypotheses were formed and data to concept and concept to concept
comparisons were conducted. The comparisons were continued until the data have been
saturated, wherein no further concepts emerged. As the comparisons continued, a core
concept emerged to form the main idea of the theory. The core concept was identified as
the explanation for the resolution of the main problem of the study, despite the variability
in incidences (Glaser, 2004).
Evidence of Trustworthiness
I used validity and reliability techniques to increase the trustworthiness of the
study. To increase the credibility of the study, I checked the truthfulness of the data with
the focus of the study throughout the data collection and data analysis phases. Member
checking was also conducted by verifying the data and interpretations with the
participants. The participants were asked to clarify their responses in person. Returning to
the participants (or member checking) confirmed the accuracy of the data and the
interpretations. I reached data saturation to ensure that no further data emerged. I
conducted data saturation through repeated immersion in the data (Creswell & Miller,
2000).
For transferability and dependability, all of the data sources were handled with
order and with urgency. I audited the data sources throughout the duration of the study
through organized documentation. Documentation of data allowed me to keep accurate
references and crosscheck information (Creswell & Miller, 2000).

55

Logistical and Miscellaneous Challenges
To ensure a space for privacy, I wanted to conduct all face-to-face interviews at a
local coffee shop in proximity to Purpose Driven Gym. The coffee shop was a great space
and I was able to conduct a total of three interviews there. In each interview, the
participant and I had the entire shop to ourselves without the presence of other customers.
I noted in my journal that each participant was relaxed and freely shared information
without having customers listening nearby. Due to convenience for the participants and
having multiple no-shows at the agreed-upon time and date at the local coffee shop, I
conducted the last nine interviews at Purpose Driven Gym after each participant’s
workout. Each interview was completed at a small waiting area of the gym. Often the
interviews took place during a time when the gym was nearly empty; therefore, I did not
have to compete with the noise of the exercising equipment or the other gym members. I
believe that interviewing in this environment (Purpose Driven Gym’s waiting area) may
have caused the participants to have brief responses and not fully expound on their past
experiences, even after extensive prodding from myself.
In order to get access to the participants, I became a member of at Purpose Driven
Gym. Although the gym owner granted permission to access the gym without
membership, I opposed the choice of free access. I believed that in order to build support
of my research and familiarity with the gym’s facility and its members, I needed the
members to witness my weekly workout sessions and get to know me—which, in turn,
facilitated my recruitment of participants. As a member, I took a boxing class wherein I
gained access to participants, and I believe this allowed me to establish trust and build
rapport with the African American male athletes and the gym’s trainers. I believe that

56

when potential participants observed my weekly workout sessions, they were more likely
to volunteer for the study, they felt more at ease with me during the interviews, and they
were more apt to encourage other African American gym members to participate in my
study.
Eliciting thoughtful substantive responses proved to be challenging at times
during the interviews. Never having experienced being interview for a research project,
most of the participants did not want to participate until someone else did it first. It was
not until I interviewed three participants before word spread among the African American
male athletes that the interviews were painless and took only 1 hour of their time.
Limitations
Although this study produced rich findings on the unique experiences about
African American male athletes’ health information-seeking behaviors, as well as their
athletic identity, there were several limitations. This study was limited by sample size and
methodology. The sample size of 12 participants may have not been sufficient enough to
be applicable to all types of mixed-methods studies, like a larger scaled mixed-methods
study. Because of the smaller sample, I opted to score the AIMS and MIBI surveys
differently by using the S-cubed (S3) method of data transformation for quantifying a
qualitative concept which is the aggregate of several questions measured on a Likert
scale.
Concerning the methodology used in this study, I should have asked questions
regarding their religion/spirituality, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status and
family demographic, such as if they were raised in a two-parent or single-family
household. This information would have led to more substantive demographic on each

57

participant and produced possible insights on how family demographic might inform
athletic and racial identities. Also, I could have posed more in-depth questions related to
health information-seeking behaviors related to their athletic identity. For example, I
could have distinguished the health information-seeking behaviors of participants with a
high athletic identity versus low athletic identity. Participants with high athletic identity
have access to additional sources than those with low athletic identity. Also, the AIMS
has already been fully validated and replicated, and the modifications that were made in
this study with the addition of demographic information and in-depth, open-ended
questions is untested. Future studies can remedy these limitations with a more
socioeconomically and athletically diverse African American athletic population, using
mixed methods.
Additionally, another limitation of this study, may have been the participants’ low
literacy level(s). I discovered that completing the MIBI was a time-consuming task, filled
with terminology that most of my participants had challenges in interpreting.
Alternatively, the MIBI survey instrument could be reworded and adapted to better
facilitate the participants’ understanding.
Another limitation concerning the methodology used in this study was not
including the boxing coach, gym trainers, and owner. Their voices in this study would
have provided a more robust, detailed insight into the health information-seeking
behaviors of African American male athletes. The work experience of the boxing coach,
gym trainers, and owner could have addressed the research problem from a unique
perspective needed to understand the athletic and racial identities of male athletes.

58

The lack of prior research studies on the health information-seeking behaviors of
African American male athletes is another limitation concerning this study. Only a few
scholars have specifically explored the health information-seeking behaviors of African
Americans but not male athletes. Research literature is overly saturated with studies
focused on the exploitation of African American male student athletes at Division I
colleges and universities but none focused on male athletes not affiliated with a school or
university. To date, there is no research specifically looking at the athletic and racial
identities of African American male athletes and its impact on their health informationseeking behaviors. This study can fill the gap in the research and serve as an important
opportunity to further study this underserved population.
Another limitation of this study may have been my error in unpacking the athletic
and racial identity questions asked on the survey. I could have had participants fill out the
surveys first and schedule a face-to-face interview to follow up the answers given on the
surveys after reviewing the results. To minimize the time spent with each participant (to
value the participants’ time), I had each participant fill out the survey and immediately
conducted the face-to-face interview without reviewing the survey answers. It could be
that the interviewees wrote one answer on the survey but answered it differently during
the face-to-face interview. The small, cramped interviewing space, and participants’ not
wanting anyone to overhear their answers or appear weak in front of other gym members
may be the cause of the contradictory results in this study. An interim period for review
of survey responses would have improved validity and allowed for a richer and personal
face-to-face discussion with each athlete.

59

Another potential limitation may be bias due to my race, gender, and education.
My race, gender, and affiliation with the University could have been a concern for the
athletes. This reasoning could have been a factor in the slow recruitment of the athletes.
Most people do not trust a researcher coming into a community to find answers to their
research questions. This may have been the cause for the slowness of recruitment of
participants. I was considered an outsider coming into to a close-knit community of
athletes seeking answers for my research study. To overcome the problem of being an
outsider, I joined the gym and became an active member. Not only did I use the exercise
equipment daily, I also joined the beginning boxing class to get closer to the participants.
To overcome the distrust of researchers that participants felt, I portrayed a transparent
academic who knows how it feels to be the lone minority in the classroom and in the
workforce. My decade of experience as a library practitioner and several years as a
doctoral candidate has given me the confidence and the ability to be comfortable talking
about sensitive issues such as race and health information. On this matter, I could
empathize with my participants. In light of our mutual awareness of injustices and racism
in society and my personal level of comfort in addressing those issues, I felt that
participants’ skepticism and mistrust were eased and they were more apt to trust me as a
researcher.
Moreover, this study, with its contextually specific participant populations, may
not be generalizable to the experiences of all African American male athletes but can be
transferable to other ethnicities. Nonetheless, I did not seek for this study to be
generalizable; rather, I aimed to identify authentic examples of situations and challenges

60

that young African American male athletes not affiliated with a school or university
experience while seeking health information.

61

CHAPTER FOUR: FINDINGS
In this mixed methods study, I explored the influence of athletic identity, racial
identity, and demographic characteristics on the health information-seeking behaviors of
African American male athletes. I analyzed the results from the quantitative surveys and
the twelve semi-structured, in-depth participant interviews to contextualize the health
information-seeking behaviors of African American male athletes in south central
Wisconsin. I used a concurrent, mixed-methods design to generate the results. This third
chapter contains three parts. The first section describes the analytics of the AIMS data,
MIBI data, and quantitative data on health information-seeking behaviors. I used
descriptive statistics to determine the extent to which participants’ backgrounds, athletic
identity, and racial identity shaped the study participants’ health information-seeking
behaviors and related health service challenges. The section constitutes the bulk of the
chapter and presents the findings from the constant comparative analysis of the semistructured in-depth interviews in eight subsections: African American identity, athletic
identity, environment not cultural, preferred source of health information, reason for
information-seeking method, reasons for health information-seeking, benefits of health
information-seeking, and barriers to health information-seeking. Each section begins with
a summative table of themes and sub-themes. The final section combines the qualitative
and quantitative data, tabulating the appearance of themes across those with high and low
AIMS and MIBI scores.
Research Question
I designed this study to understand the information-seeking behaviors of African
American male athletes using the following primary research question:

62

RQ1. How do the athletic and racial identities along with background
characteristics of African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym influence their
health information-seeking behaviors?
Part I. Quantitative Data and Analysis
Participants’ Pseudonyms and Demographics
The study participants consisted of 12 African American male athletes who were
assigned pseudonyms and alpha numeric codes for the analyses of this research. The
codes assigned are shown in Table 3.

While the age bracket indicated on the survey ranged from 18 to 65 years of age,
the majority of the participants in this study (58%) were between 18 and 25 years of age,
while the remainder (42%) were between 26-34 years of age. This confirmed my
expectations that the sample participants would be relatively young. In terms of
education, three athletes (25%) held Bachelor’s degrees, four (33%) reported receiving

63

some college education, four (33%) received their high school diploma and/or GED, and
one (8%) did not complete his high school education. When the participants with some
college education and Bachelor’s degrees were combined, they comprised more than half
(58%) of the participants, which signified that the participants were relatively educated.
As for ethnic affiliation, nine participants self-identified as Black American (75%), two
identified as African (17%), and one identified as Other Black (8%). The participant
demographics are shown in Table 4.

Calculation of AIMS Scores
I used the S-cubed (S3) method of data transformation to determine the high,
medium, and low ranges for the AIMS and MIBI scores. I determined that the S-cubed
method of data transformation was appropriate for quantifying a qualitative concept
which is the aggregate of several questions measured on a Likert scale. For example, the
Nationalist concept is the accumulation of nine questions measures on a seven-point
Likert scale. The S3 method considers the total number of questions and maximum and

64

minimum values (adjusts for reverse coded questions), then it establishes a range of
possible scores for the overall concept. It then calculates high, medium, and low ranges
for the overall construct. For this dissertation, I calculated the AIMS and MIBI scores
using the S3method where I obtained and converted the averages of the questions into the
ordinal groups for the overall concept. For the AIMS scale average, the minimum score
that could be achieved was 1, and the maximum average score that was achievable was 7.
The calibrated AIMS and MIBI score ranges for the low, medium, and high scores are
shown on Table 5.
Scoring AIMS
For the AIMS average, the minimum score that an athlete could achieve was 1,
and the maximum average score achievable was 7. I determined that a low score was 1 –
3; a medium score was 3 – 5, and a high score on the AIMS Scale was 5 – 7.

I obtained the AIMS score for each participant by computing the mean of the
seven questions that comprised the AIMS scale. Table 6 illustrates the participants’
average scores and their corresponding grouping, while Table 8 shows the number of
participants in low, medium, and high groups. Table 7 shows that exactly half of the
participants (n = 6) were in the high scores group, while the remaining half were in the
low and medium groups (n = 6)

I combined participants with low and medium AIMS scores (low group) and
compared them with participants with high AIMS scores (high group) to define each of
their group characteristics. When considering race and ethnicity, the groups with low and
high scores were somewhat consistent in that the majority of the participants were
African American (low 83%; high 67%) and self-identified as Black American (low 67%;
high 67%). The two groups differed in terms of age and education. The participants in the
low group were older (67% were aged from 26-34 years), while those in the high group

66

were younger (67% were aged from 18-25 years). Participants in the high group were
also more educated, as 50% reported as being college graduates (n = 3), while those in
the low group were somewhat less educated, with 83% reporting that they attended some
college (n = 5).

Table 11 shows the MIBI scores of the participants in the low AIMS group and
their corresponding MIBI groupings, and Table 12 shows the MIBI scores of the
participants in the high AIMS group and their corresponding MIBI groupings. I divided
the participants according to their AIMS score groupings of low and high groups; I then
compared the two group’s MIBI scores. The comparison is shown in Table 13. As seen in
Table 13, 50% of the participants (n = 3) in the low AIMS group had medium MIBI
scores, and the remaining 50% had high MIBI scores (n = 3). None of the participants
had low MIBI scores. For the high AIMS group, 83% had medium scores (n = 5) while
only one participant had a high MIBI score (n = 1). This suggests that participants who
strongly associated with their athletic identities tended to have a moderate perception of
racial self-definition. Table 14 below shows the participants’ AIMS grouping based on
the MIBI scores. As stated, none of the participants had low MIBI scores; 33% of the
participants (n=4) had high MIBI scores, while 67% of the participants (n=8) had

69

medium MIBI scores. Interestingly, the participants with high MIBI scores had varied
AIMS scores. The participant with the highest MIBI score had the lowest AIMS score.
One participant with a high MIBI score also had a high AIMS score, while the remaining
two participants with high MIBI scores had medium AIMS scores. Among the eight
participants with medium MIBI scores, 63% (n=5) had high AIMS scores. The
participant with the lowest MIBI score also had the highest AIMS score among all the
participants.

I collected the participants’ perceptions on the sub-components of MIBI; Table 14
shows the summary of their responses. As shown above, the participants did not have
race as a center to their identity (M = 4.31); had a high private regard of the Black race
(M = 5.75); had low public regard of being Black (M = 3.28); scored high in assimilation
(M = 5.07); agreed to being part of the human race (M = 5.41); agreed to being an
oppressed minority (M = 4.57); and had a low nationalist score (M = 2.95).

71

Scoring the MIBI Scales
I took the average score for each of the sub-items for the Multidimensional
Inventory of Black Identity (MIBI). The Centrality Scale measures one’s self-definition
with regard to race with scores ranging from 8 to 56, with low = 8 to 24; medium = 25 to
40; and high = 41 to 56. Private regard describes how the African Americans feel about
themselves and how other individuals feel about them. The scoring ranges from 6 to 42,
with low = 6 to 18; medium = 19 to 30; and high = 31 to 42. Public regard is defined as
how African Americans are viewed by the broader society, with the scoring range from 6
to 42, with low = 6 to 18; medium = 19 to 30; and high = 31 to 42. Assimilation
philosophy refers to an individual’s attempt to enter into the mainstream. The scoring
ranges from 9 to 63, with low = 9 to 27; medium = 28 to 45; and high = 46 to 63.
Humanist philosophy is the belief that we all belong to the human race. The scoring
ranges from 9 to 63, with low = 9 to 27; medium = 28 to 45; and high = 46 to 63.
Oppressed minority philosophy sees similarities in the plight of racism faced by African
Americans with those of other minority populations. The scoring ranges from 9 to 63,
with low = 9 to 27; medium = 28 to 45; and high = 46 to 63. The Nationalist philosophy
is centered on being African American and connecting with all Black organizations and
social environment. The scoring ranges from 9 to 63, with low = 9 to 27; medium = 28 to
45; and high = 46 to 63.

I compared the African American male athletes’ sense of athletic identities
(measured through their AIMS scores) with their health information-seeking behavior. To
compare the participants with low and high AIMS scores while considering their
information-seeking behavior, I tabulated the participants’ responses (Table 16). I found
that for both groups, the majority of the participants (low n = 5; high n = 3) sought health
information from the Internet, but the low group reported a higher reliance on the Internet
(low 45%; high 38%). The groups differed in their health-seeking behavior for the other
sources of information, in that the low AIMS group varied slightly less than those in the
high AIMS group. While athletes in the low group indicated use of five sources, those in
the high group indicated the use of six sources. The high group was slightly more likely
to make use of trainers and parents and family members. The low group was more likely
to make use of friends and physicians. Given the small sample of the study’s population,
however, one must use caution in drawing conclusions from the data.

Part II. Qualitative Data and Analysis: Constant Comparative Analysis Results
I will present the findings from the constant comparative analysis of the semistructured in-depth interviews in the following eight subsections: African American
identity, athletic identity, environment not cultural, preferred source of health
information, reason for information-seeking method, reasons for health informationseeking, benefits of health information-seeking, and barriers to health informationseeking. Each section begins with a summative table of themes and sub-themes. I will
then present the results according to core concepts, under which I will discuss themes and
sub-themes. I will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme to the least
recurring theme, using direct quotes from the response of the participants to support the
findings.
Qualitative Data on African American Identity
Table 17 below summarizes the themes and sub-themes for African American
Identity. The section continues by describing each theme using the study data.

Perception on going to the doctor

I asked the participants what it meant to them to be an African American. The
themes identified under this finding were (a) often experienced being stereotyped, (b)
part of identity, (c) lifestyle, and (d) not going to the doctor. The fourth theme is most
directly related to the study focus on health information-seeking.
The immediate response from most of the participants was that being African
American was simply part of their identity. However, as the participants elaborated their
responses, the highest recurring theme was the experience of being stereotyped. The
participants frequently expressed that as an individual, they did not mind their race, but
society tended to have a prejudice against their race. Nonetheless, the participants shared
that their lifestyle, more than the people’s racial prejudice, affected how they were
treated. Below is a discussion of the generated themes.
Often experience stereotype. The participants shared that they often experienced
being stereotyped from strangers. Although the participants believed that being African
American was part of who they were and did not initially mention the experienced of
being stereotype as part of their initial response, they shared that people could not help
but see them a “certain way,” and that they were “prejudged,” as quoted from Marcellus,
a high school graduate, age 18-25. Marcellus stated:
I personally see that with any race. If you see a White person, you might

75

judge them. Being African American means you just got to be proud of
any accomplishments or any struggles that were overcome in the past or
even in the present that people in hardship have to go through. Not saying
being African American is a hardship but there are certain hardships that
come with it.
Marcellus also added that he did not think anything of people’s race until he
experienced name-calling when he was growing up:
At times when I was growing up, I didn’t know I was Black until I was 10
years old when I got called the first N-bomb. I think after then; it was very
important. As I got older it seems that we are all just people. It started
mattering less and less. It still matters to me a lot, especially depending
who I am talking to and what the subject is but…
Jamie, age 26-34, who takes some college courses, said that being African
American typically means nothing to him until someone else reacts to his race. He
shared:
Earlier, just when I came here, the little officer came up…When I went
outside to get the flyers, he came to get some coffee. I see him stop and
watch me for a sec to see what I was doing before I came back. I didn’t
think about it until I saw him paying attention to me. Oh, alright. It doesn’t
really matter to me until—until it matters to someone else.
Marlon, age 26-34, who has attained less than a high school diploma, shared his
experience of being stereotyped while doing his job:
But the thing about it is, I feel that since, because I go like far away on

76

delivery, you know, so I probably go like way out to [Iron County], where
there are more White people. Do you know what I mean? So when I come
in the place, they look at me. Do you know what I mean? And I always
get a, you know what I mean, like a funny look sometimes. You know,
once in a while, they'll . . . or somebody [will call me]. . .nigger. Do you
know what I mean, you know, so . . . Yeah, here in [a metropolitan area of
south central Wisconsin]. Do you know what I mean? I get a lot of side
eyes . . . where I be all over the place. I deliver. I drive every day. I'm out
here every day driving. I see it, like do you know what I mean?
Nonetheless, Clark, a college-educated athlete, age 18-25, stated that the
stereotype was simply a preconceived notion, and was eradicated once people got to
know him. Clark stated:
Actually, I have—I mean— yeah, of course, I had issues with White
people before, with Caucasian, anything like that, other races before. But I
never really, once I open my mouth and start talking, I think they
understand that like I'm not, I'm educated, and it's not, it hasn't really been
a big issue for me or anything like that. I have friends of all kinds. I
normally, I've never really had an issue about my race.
Part of identity. Despite the experience of prejudice, the participants’ immediate
response to what it meant to them to be African American was linked with their identity.
The participants recognized that being African American was part of their heritage and
part of their identity as an individual. Marvin, age 26-34, who has taken some college
courses, shared:

77

Oh, just like part of my identity. It's . . . you've got to have a very strong.
Things are a lot better, but there's still a lot of things that need to improve.
Dillion, age 18-25 and a college graduate, expressed that he thought of himself as
an individual being a part of a race, rather than allowing his race to dictate who he was as
an individual. Dillion looked forward to conversing on the subject and took time to
express his idea in greater detail:
Good question. It means, to me[that] I see myself as an individual before I
see myself as part of a race. People can feel free to view me as part of a
race but I contribute to part of my race from the individual side, is a
greater account than just another Black person.
When asked whether other peoples’ perception of his race affected him, Dillion added:
I mean it could, I chose not to let myself view as race. I like to view it as
something I could have done better, something that I could have done to
put me in front of different candidates rather it be for a job or whether it be
for boxing or whatever. I try to put it on myself instead of blaming it on
my race.
Tracy, a college graduate, age 26-44, similarly downplayed the importance of race
to his understanding of himself, stating, “I would say it's not very significant to me,
anyway. It doesn't really define who I am.” Raised by his White mother and White
stepfather, Tracy explained:
Just the way I was raised, through family and my upbringing, it was never
really something that was drilled into my head that should be part of who
you are or develop who you are and change your mentality.

78

On the other hand, Jamie said that his race was part of his identity; however, he
was indifferent about being African American. Jamie stated:
A little bit, somewhat, it’s a part of who you are. Not everyone is aware of
their own race. To me the significant of it, personally, is not high. I’m not
mad that I’m Black or anything like that. I’m not incredibly enthusiastic. I
don’t think about it, often.
The statement of Jamie was contrary to the statements of Marlon and Morris.
Although Jamie, Marlon, and Morris all shared that being African American was part of
who they were, Marlon and Morris felt strongly about the impact of their race on their
lives. Marlon shared that:
I feel like it's everything. I just feel like, you know, I just, I been blessed. I
feel great. Do you know what I mean? I wake up, you know, I'm just
proud.
Meanwhile, Morris a high school graduate, age 18-25, shared that:
What does it mean to be African American? Well, for me to be African
American, it means I can like overcome anything. I don't have no limits. I
feel proud of being an African American. I feel strong. I have, there's lots
of history about African Americans, and that just like pushed me like even
more.
Lifestyle. The participants shared similar experiences in their lifestyle that were
identified with being African American. I identified two sub-themes under lifestyle: (a)
behavior and (b) perception on going to the doctor. Being African American, the
participants’ behavior were often tied to diminishing the stereotype. Dillion explained:

79

I view every interaction as with people outside of my race as a time to
reinforce or destroy negative stereotypes. Whenever I make a decision that
it’s going to affect me or even if I’m doing it to do it. I just make sure it’s
the forefront of my thoughts.
Marcellus, a high school graduate aged 18-25, added that he was initially conscious of
how Black people supposedly behaved. The participant reported trying the “right way” to
be Black; however, the participant learned that his behavior was influenced by media due
to allowing society to define him:
It used to be very significant but now I don’t find it as significant. I know
a lot more than I think the average person knows—even the average Black
person knows—about history. I do research all of the time about the past.
Before then trying to learn styles of African Americans in Green Bay,
there isn’t a whole lot of Blacks up there. First, I was trying to learn how
to be Black, that was like the big question, what is Black. There was a lot
of TV watching, there wasn’t Internet around, so just seeing how my
friends were who came from Chicago and Milwaukee. At the time it was
real significant but now it’s not. It only defines me if I allow it to. For
anything, it’s other people intention if they want to define me.
Furthermore, and directly related to health information behaviors discussed later in the
chapter, the participants shared that a belief of not going to the doctor for treatment
existed in the Black community. The participants, however, articulated different
perceptions on this belief. Marlon said that he didn’t “go to the doctor very much.”
Morris rationalized that:

80

Like say for, like maybe for like a cold or something. But if it's like severe
symptoms that I'm having that I can't like bear, I will go to the doctor or
go to anybody with some health information on how to get it cured for
whatever symptoms that I have.
Jordon, age 26-34, who takes some college courses, said that “self-pride” prevented him
from going to the doctor. Jordon explained:
Yes and no. Some will find a mistrust and maybe a loss from someone that
was under care of a physician or a medical team or even may even have
slightly fault in a situation. You know, and I've seen that with any and
everybody, I mean, in general. So far as pain, nobody really want to admit
they hurt and weak and not able to sit up here and deal with whatever it is.
And a lot of times, that's just self-pride.
Jay, aged 18-25, similarly stated:
I feel that it is a man thing, I don’t think it a Black thing. I would rather
not go to the doctor.
High school graduate, Dennis, age 18-25, shared that he grew up with the belief
that going to the doctor was unnecessary. He explained that his current reason for
avoiding the doctor, however, was financial. Dennis stated:
Yeah, my grandma like that. My grandma won't see the doctor for nothing.
To be honest, I feel like you got to pay a lot of money to go to the doctor.
You got to pay lots and lots of money. If you ain't got no insurance, I
mean, like health insurance, it's . . .
To summarize the qualitative findings on African American identity, the

81

participants believed that race was a part of who they were, not their defining quality.
Although some participants valued their heritage more than the others, the participants
similarly believed that their individual behavior, more than their race, had more impact in
their lives. Stereotyping from society may have seemed unavoidable for the participants;
however, they shared that who they were as people transcended who they were as a race.
Finally, the participants shared the typical lifestyle that they had experienced as African
Americans. The participants’ behavior was often linked with eliminating the initial
prejudice of strangers. Specifically related to health information behavior, the participants
also shared the belief that going to the doctor for consultation and treatment was
unnecessary for minor pains and injuries; however, their perceptions were more fueled by
varying reasons from machismo to finance than by racial perceptions. In the next section,
I will summarize the qualitative data related to athletic identity.
Qualitative Data on Athletic Identity
Table 18 below summarizes the themes and sub-themes within the qualitative data
for athletic identity. I will continue by presenting data related to themes and sub-themes. I
will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme to the least recurring
theme, using direct quotes from the response of the participants to support the findings.

The participants were asked what it meant to them to be an athlete. The
participants gave varying answers, which were divided into four emerging themes: (a)
gives purpose, (b) being healthy, (c) achieving goals, and (d) other meanings. One of the
participants, Marvin, who scored a medium athletic identity, said that he did not consider
himself an athlete. For Marvin, going to the gym was for the purposes of training and
working out.
Gives purpose. For some of the participants, being an athlete gave them a
purpose. Some participants shared that being an athlete was what they were raised to do,
while others said that being an athlete gave them “something to do” with their lives.
Dean, who scored a medium athletic identity, said that:
It means everything. It gives you a sense of purpose, you know, for like
you're doing something in life, not just sitting around doing nothing. That's
why I do it.
Clark, a college educated athlete with a high athletic identity score, shared that:
What it means to be an athlete to me, it means, actually, everything to me.
I've always been an athlete. In high school, I played college football, and
now I'm a full-time fighter for about seven, eight years now. So it's
been…an athlete is everything to me. I don't know anything else besides
being an athlete. I've been to college. I graduated with a degree in
business, and I still have not yet found work. So being an athlete is the
only thing that I know, and it's the only thing that I'm, that I can be really
successful at.
Being healthy. For some participants, being an athlete equated to being healthy.

83

Conforming to workout schedules and healthy eating habits were among the practices
cited by the participants as entwined with being an athlete. Morris, who scored a high
athletic identity, shared that:
An athlete is just somebody who is just physically and mentally healthy, I
think. Yeah, that's what it means to be an athlete, yeah.
Dean, who scored a medium athletic identity, believed that being an athlete meant
keeping away bad habits. Dean shared:
Well, I fell into it [drugs], but I climbed back out of it, just being in this
gym every day. Because when I was doing drugs, trying to come to the
gym, my body wasn't . . . really working. So once I gave it up, once
anybody give it up, and they come to the gym and feel the difference, they
going to never, they probably going to never do it again.
Marlon, who scored a medium athletic identity, added that being healthy was associated
with being an athlete because of the capabilities of the physical body. The participant
implied that having a healthy body meant being a better athlete. Marlon stated:
Hard work, a lot of work. I mean, you know, me sleeping, eating right, and
you've got to respect it. You know, you've got to respect your body,
because if you don't, it will shut down on you.
Achieving goals. Goals were considered as milestones for all of the participants.
The participants regarded that achieving goals was meaningful in being an athlete, as
achieving goals helped in competitions, and in being the best they could be. Tracy, who
scored a high athletic identity, stated that:
Trying to compete and be the best you can, I guess, in a sense, in its

84

simplest form.
Dennis, who scored a medium athletic identity, stated that “To be an athlete is to achieve
a lot of goals, and don’t stop for nothing.”
Jamie, who scored a medium athletic identity, said that the goals did not
necessarily have to be on a professional athlete level. Jamie believed that goals were set
to be a better athlete the next day more than the person was today. He expressed the idea
in greater detail:
Be active. Not just every now and then but being active all of the time
with some type of purpose. It doesn’t have to mean you have to play in the
NBA or anything. If you run every day and you got a goal. Okay I’m
going to set this goal for myself and you are working towards something;
that’s an athlete to me.
Other meanings. Jay, who scored a medium athletic identity, and Jordon, who
scored a low athletic identity, both explained that being an athlete was something they
enjoyed. Jay believed that if he did not enjoy being an athlete then he would not have
been an athlete at all. Jay said:
I am an athlete because I enjoy it. I’ve been in a lot of sports since I was
young…You gotta like. If you don’t like it, it is going to be hard to stick
with it, you are going to quit really fast. That’s why you got to like it.
Jordon, who scored a low athletic identity, added that being an athlete meant he
was being able to be himself. He stated that:
Oh, you have different meanings. It's not necessarily just physical as well,
but a true athlete, like any professional or anything like that, is being true

85

to what it is that you're doing.
Marcellus, who scored a high athletic identity, perceived that being an athlete was
equivalent to developing skills. The developed skills were not just physical, but also
mental. Marcellus quoted:
Just working hard as often as you can, almost every day. Boxing requires a
lot of discipline and a lot of physical work. It is not all physical - it is all a
part of what you do with your mind. There is NO physical without YOUR
mental. I think more importantly than just being able to run fast or just
being able to hit harder, you got to be strong minded. So it is real
important for me to keep my mind sharp and focus.
Finally, Dillion, who scored a medium athletic identity, believed that being an
athlete meant being in a team. Dillon implied that the team was not necessarily as sports
team, but a group of people that impacted his life. He further elaborated on his idea of
what it meant to be part of a team, stating:
[It] means to be dedicate, means to be a part of a team. Put people before
yourself, means a lot of sacrifice, that some people wouldn’t normally
necessary put in their lives, wouldn’t necessary have in their lives.
The participants with medium and high scores gave different perspectives on what
defines being an athlete than the low scoring Marvin, for whom going to the gym was
just for working out. For the higher scoring participants, being an athlete was believed to
provide direction in one’s life by giving purpose. Being an athlete was also associated
with being healthy, in making healthy choices to care for the body to be able to perform
athletic activities. Achieving goals was also entwined with being an athlete. The goals

86

provided a sense of accomplishment for the athlete. Some of the participant gave other
meanings on being an athlete, like something they enjoyed doing, avoiding bad habits,
developing skills, and being on a team.
Qualitative Data on Environment, not Cultural
Table 19 summarizes the themes and sub-themes within the qualitative data
related to environmental influences. I continue the section by presenting data related to
themes and sub-themes. I will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme
to the least recurring theme, using direct quotes from the responses of the participants to
support the findings.
Table 19
Environmental, not Cultural
Themes
Eating habits
Immediate surroundings

As part of the discussion on what it meant for the participants to be African
American, a pattern of “the impact of the environment” emerged in the participants’
response. The participants recognized themselves as individuals in a society, with race
being just a part of their individuality, but they also talked about how environmental
factors provided meaning to their identity. Participants were asked how their athletic
identity influenced their healthy or unhealthy behaviors. For the Purpose Driven Gym
African American male athletes, their athletic identity was important, but was only one
influence on healthy or unhealthy behaviors, and that influence varied among
participants. For the African American male athletes in this study, their racial identity led
them to traditional soul foods and convenience food eating habits. Soul food may often

87

be equated with fried and fatty food options. Further, convenience food is often less
healthy. Eating healthy is an expensive choice, but it was an option for all the
participants. Two themes identified under this finding were (a) eating habits and (b)
immediate surroundings.
Eating habits. From my cultural experience, African Americans are inclined to
prepare and consume fried food; however, the participants reiterated that consumption of
healthy and unhealthy food was their choice. Marcellus claimed that fried food,
especially the ones available in fast food, were cheaper and more readily available than
healthy options. Marcellus said that he was ignorant of the healthy options in the past
because of the kind of food that was convenient for him. The participant continued to
share that the consumption of fried food, especially fried chicken, may have been rooted
in the history of Black people in America. Marcellus, who scored a high athletic identity,
shared the following:
I think, for me personally, since I start learning about the body and health.
Now I don’t let as far as the stereotypes and the things that are real, I don’t
let those things affect me as much anymore. If you grow up Black mostly,
you probably, the average African Americans probably has just a little less
what they would like to have. So, a lot times, especially when you grow
up poor, it’s so much easier to go to McDonald’s to spend a couple of
bucks. It’s so much easier to buy candy, often. I used to eat candy and fast
food all day every day. I didn’t know how to save money, I didn’t have a
lot of money to go and buy groceries as it was. I had $50 to buy some
groceries or I could have $50 for 5 days. A lot of stuff like, fried chicken

88

goes back to slavery, there was a time when people didn’t have money and
the cheapest thing to get and grow was watermelon and chicken. It was
easy, very easy for those things. I think through time it was handed down
the ideas of what was healthy. There was a time when I thought pizza was
healthy. I had my bread, my vegetables, and whatever. So, it’s just
knowledge. You got to know. When you don’t know, you can’t do
anything to change it.
Jamie, who scored a medium athletic identity, shared a similar sentiment about
convenience. Jamie stated:
We were raised a certain. I love to eat. Ribs, macaroni and cheese, corn
bread, I love all of that. Of course, me being a fighter/boxer. If I could
have all of the money access to be able to do what I want, I would eat
mostly fruits and organic stuff, you know. Every now and then I am in a
rush and I eat something I don’t need to be eating. Even sometimes like
cereal. When I am in a rush, I get a bowl of cereal, it’s not necessary bad
for you but it’s not the most nutritious. I could have had a better choice but
it was convenient at that time. You got 5 minutes and you don’t want to
NOT eat something. I love to eat, when it comes down to it working out, I
know if I healthy I can fight.
Marvin also reiterated the importance of knowing what to eat to be able to eat in a
healthful manner. The participant shared:
I think I know what to eat. I mean, I've gotten a lot better. But I'll still look
online. Just, for me, I'm just trying to figure out how much to eat, and, you

89

know, and make sure I just stay focused on health. But I know what to eat.
Morris and Marlon considered being an athlete as the main contributor to their eating
habits. The participants said that they controlled the portions of what they ate based on
their workout routine. Morris, who scored a high athletic identity, said:
Yeah, see, that's why you've got to, see, and that's why you've got to
discipline yourself. You've also got to discipline. You can't just go to; I
have the choice to eat whatever I want. But, you know, since me being an
athlete, you can't overdo it. And then if you do, you just, it's just hard work
to get your weight back down. So that's, it's really up to you if you want to
take that route.
Immediate surroundings. The home and the local community were considered
meaningful by the participants in supporting healthy behaviors. The participants shared
their experiences while growing up in their households and how the events from their
past contributed to their current health-related behavior. Dean, who scored a medium
athletic identity, shared that:
Well, in the community, it's a lot more negative stuff that's pulling you to
make your health more negative. So, it's harder to stay healthy, because
there's so much like drugs and all that you can . . . because I don't do
drugs. But it's easy to fall into that.
Clark said that growing up in a home that was supportive towards his athletic
activities helped him develop healthy behavior. Clark, who scored a high athletic identity,
said that:
Me growing up at home, I wasn't always the greatest kid. But me growing

90

up at home, the healthy behaviors that I picked up is that I need to be an
athlete, that I, like certain things like that. I need to be an athlete. I need to
be healthy. I need to be at my best always, because I don't want to go back
to where I was before. I want to always keep pushing forward and get
myself out of those bad situations and have an unhealthy lifestyle. So
that's the reason why I trained so hard to do everything 110%, because I
don't want to live an unhealthy lifestyle.
Table 19 summarizes the themes that emerged under the concept of
environmental influences. The participants said that culture had an influence on their
healthy behaviors, but the participants felt that their upbringing had more impact on their
behavior than culture. Further, the participants believed that their personal choices
defined their eating habits despite the cultural practices of African Americans. The
participants’ household or immediate surrounding also defined their healthy choices
despite what the community dictated.
Qualitative Data on Preferred Sources of Health Information
Table 20 summarizes the themes and sub-themes within the qualitative data for
preferred sources of health information. I will continue by presenting data related to
themes and sub-themes. I will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme
to the least recurring theme, using direct quotes from the responses of the participants to
support the findings.

91

Table 20
Preferred Sources of Health Information
Themes

Coach/athletic trainer
Depending on the situation
I initially identified the themes in this category as “sources of information.”
However, upon repeated immersion in the data, I noted that the participants had certain
preferences during health information-seeking, which will be discussed in this section. I
did not identify any uniformity in the source of information. Instead, the situation
dictated which source of information the participants preferred. I identified four themes
under the category: (a) physician, (b) Internet, (c) parent, and (d) coach/athletic trainer. I
added the fifth theme, depending on the situation, after constant comparison of several
data.
Physician. Due to finances and need for convenience, physicians were not the
participants’ first response to the question on their usual source of health information.
However, several of the participants regarded physicians as the most ideal and most
reliable source of information, and stated that they would prefer receiving information
from physicians, if possible. The participants generally sought information by themselves
at first, but chose to go to a physician when needed. Jamie, who scored a medium athletic
identity, said that:
Every now and then, but like I said, if it’s something that serious I go to a
different site, find a mobile version. But if it is serious, I can call a doctor

92

or get on a computer at home. The more serious it is the more serious steps
you take.
Dillion, who also scored a medium athletic identity, shared:
There is a tool to research whatever you want. I guess I would do an inperson doctor appointment/visit but that’s only if I really need something.
Internet. Using the Internet, particularly the Google search engine, was the
most widely used method for health information-seeking among the participants. Dean,
Dillion, Jamie, Marcellus, and Morris reported using Google for health-related questions.
Using the Internet to search for health-related information was generally the first option
in information-seeking. Using the Internet was thought to be convenient, especially with
the accessibility afforded by smartphones. Twelve of the respondents used smartphones.
Use of the Internet was also generally coupled with another source of information.
Marcellus, who scored a high athletic identity, stated:
Ultimately, I’d first probably check online and then being in the gym a lot,
I know a lot of people who are a lot smarter with the body than I am,
coaches and stuff. Usually when I look things up, I Google it and then I
ask my friends if it sounds right to them to get their opinion.
Tracy also preferred to initially search the Internet for health-related information,
but he spoke about how he chooses his sources, and does not settle for the initial results
found in Google. Marvin talked about how he searches for medical journals available
online. Marvin, who scored a medium athletic identity, said:
For me, like I go online a lot. I don’t go to the doctor as much as I should
do, and that's probably the right way to do it. I've been getting better each

93

year. I try to go to like medical journals and do that, look at it that way.
Sometimes the words they use are kind of big, so sometimes I have to pull
out the dictionary to understand it, [but…].
Parent. Some of the participants go to their parents for health-related
information, mainly because their parents had a medical background. The mothers of
Clark, Dillion, and Dennis were in the healthcare field; therefore, those participants
typically asked their mothers for health-related information. Clark, who scored a high
athletic identity, expanded on the ways that he relied on his mother’s background to serve
his healthcare needs:
Yeah, my mother has a background in healthcare, so she's been in
healthcare probably for almost 20 years now, so I've never had an issue
with finding healthcare. So, she's my backup, or I'll just go into the
hospital. I never had a problem with going in and getting checked up to
see what's going on.
Coach/athletic trainer. As they go to the gym on a regular basis, the participants
also regarded the coach/athletic trainer as a reliable source of health information. The
coach/athletic trainer was someone that the participants interacted with, and was easily
accessible to the participants should they have health-related concerns. Clark shared:
My preferred ways, if I have a health question about my health or like an
injury . . . I go to my coach, usually, Abigail. Like let's say, yesterday, I
had got hurt while I was in the gym, and immediately, she knew what to
do, because she has a background in health. So, I've been going to her for
the, about my health questions for the last two years.

94

Depending on the situation. I added this fifth theme after constant comparative
analysis of the interview data. The participants answered the question “Where do you go
to look for health information?” in different ways. Some participants answered the
question based on conveniently and quickly getting information. Some participants
answered the question based on the reliability of the source and the information.
I analyzed the qualitative data in terms of the educational level of the participants.
Comparing results by education level did not reveal many differences. College-educated
participants preferred ways of seeking health information that ranged from utilizing
trusted sources and services to searching multiple online sources. One participant with a
college education, Clark, reported that he never experienced barriers or challenges in
locating health information because he preferred receiving health information from health
services individuals he trusted. Dillion and Tracy, both college-educated participants,
preferred searching quickly on the Internet and browsing multiple websites to look for
consistency in answers to their health information questions.
Athletes with a high school education who were all between the ages 18-25,
including Marcellus, Dean, Dennis, and Morris, preferred using their cell phone and/or
iPad or talking directly with someone. Participants Jamie, Jay, Marvin, and Jordon, all
with some college education, discussed their comfort in using the Internet for searching
all types of information, and they preferred to search via their smartphones because of the
convenience and ease of use. The interviews also revealed that participants of various
ages and education levels preferred seeking health information from individuals such as
health professionals, friends, family members, and using the Internet (Google) to browse
websites.

95

In summary, I concluded that the identified themes were not just sources of
information, but preferred sources of information. The participants sought a specific
method for a specific reason, which will be discussed in the next section.
Qualitative Data on Reasons for Preferred Information-Seeking Method
Table 21 summarizes the themes and sub-themes within the qualitative data for
reason for information-seeking method. I will continue by presenting data related to
themes and sub-themes. I will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme
to the least recurring theme, using direct quotes from the responses of the participants to
support the findings.
Table 21
Reasons for Preferred Information-Seeking Method
Themes
Convenient

Reliable
In this section, I will present the findings on the reasons for the participants’
preferred information-seeking method. The findings will justify the patterns that emerged
from the previous theme of preferred sources of health information. The theme of
information-seeking method preference provides more meaning to the health
information-seeking behavior of the participants. I identified four themes under
information-seeking method preference: (a) convenient, (b) unhelpful sources, (c) easily
understood, and (d) reliable.
Convenient. The participants often opted to utilize a certain source of health
information because it was convenient. Convenience, according to the responses of the

96

participants, referred not only to easy access, but also to reliable and cheap sources. Jay
generally used his phone to search the Internet for health information because “it’s
easier,” but whenever possible, he preferred to proceed to an Urgent Care clinic. The
participant explained that he preferred urgent care clinics over seeing doctors due to the
cost. Jay, who scored a medium athletic identity, cited cost as his reason for relying on
urgent care clinics:
Co-pay! I would like to save money if I can, so if I can call and they don’t
think it’s serious, I would rather just save the money.
Jamie said that he preferred using the Internet to search for health information; however,
the tool he used varied depending on accessibility. Jamie, who scored a medium athletic
identity, stated:
[Google]. No, I think it’s just the convenient, if I go get a book, I would
actually have to go get in my car go to the library, look around, A-Z, look
it up and then go get the book. Then I’ve spend 2 hours when I could have
looked on my phone.
Jamie continued to explain:
Depends where I am. If I have time, usually your computer will get you
more than your phone will. If I am actually at home and I have that time to
do it, I will get on my computer. Most of the time I am on the move, so the
phone is a good thing to have.
Unhelpful sources. The participants sometimes preferred one informationseeking method over another because the other method was unhelpful. For instance,
Marlon considered himself “too old for the Internet” despite its accessibility to him via

97

his phone or iPad. Marlon also considered using the Internet unhelpful, and found it
easier to ask his friends for health information. Dennis shared that he also preferred
“talking with somebody directly.” Dennis also used the Internet, but preferred
information-seeking methods with direct interaction due to the perception that using the
Internet was often unhelpful. Clark, received pamphlets with health information when
going to a doctor’s clinic; however, he did not find the pamphlets helpful. Clark, who
scored a high athletic identity, said that:
Okay. Not really, but when I go to the physician, they usually give, they
give you a health pamphlet, but they also give you like a breakdown on
the health pamphlet like a piece of paper or a packet telling you what to do
and what to take. So I've never got around to reading the health packet. I
just toss it or something like that, not really read it, because they give you,
like, a breakdown of it.
Easily understood. Some of the participants preferred certain sources of health
information due to clearer understanding. The participants described how they generally
opted for coach or athletic trainers, parents, and friends due to the ability to interact with
the source of information. The participants could ask the source for further questions in
terms that were suitable to their understanding. Dean was one of the participants who
preferred going to his athletic trainer from the gym for health information. Dean usually
searched Google for health information; however, the wording from the sources usually
made understanding the content difficult. Consequently, after searching Google, Dean
often went to his athletic trainer for further explanation. Clark similarly said that:
Actually, I like to get it verbally, so she [athletic trainer] tells me what to

98

do, and she can show me like right there. I don't like to, I don't
like…Yeah, I don't like a piece of paper, no. She will tell me what to do
right then and there. Like, I like it verbally so I can know what to do so I
won't do anything wrong. Because really, if you're doing something
wrong, you're probably not helping the situation. You're probably making
it worse than what it is, so . . .
Clark reasoned that:
She [athletic trainer] answers them completely, and she doesn't only
answer them, she tells me what to do to help prevent it happening again,
and she tells me what to do to keep, yeah, to keep it going, keep it healthy,
you know.
Reliable. The participants also preferred sources of health information that are
reliable. The participants were aware that reading sources found from Google may not be
reliable. The unreliability of Internet sources was the reason the participants generally
looked for a more reliable source after checking Google. Some participants did not opt to
use the Internet at all. Clark said that he does not use the Internet sources; however, he
also does not go to the first professional available. Clark said that:
I prefer the health services that I use, because it's people I trust. It's just
like trust issues. I don't want to go somewhere, and they tell me the wrong
thing or anything like that, they tell me something that's not right, that has
nothing to do with my health, you know.
In summary, the participants chose to utilize a specific information-seeking
method due to a certain reason. Some participants preferred a certain method due to

99

convenience, while other participants considered the reliability and/or how easy the
source was to understand. Other participants did not have a specific preferred method;
however, their option was guided by the avoidance of a certain method that they
perceived as unhelpful.
Qualitative Data on Reasons for Health Information-Seeking
Table 22 summarizes the themes and sub-themes within the qualitative data for
reasons for health information-seeking. I will continue by presenting data related to
themes and sub-themes. I will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme
to the least recurring theme, using direct quotes from the responses of the participants to
support the findings.
Table 22
Reasons for Health Information-Seeking
Themes
Check symptoms
Seek remedies
Seek answers

I identified three themes under the reason for information-seeking: (a) checking
symptoms, (b) seeking remedies, and (c) seeking answers. The reason for informationseeking affected the information-seeking behavior of the participants and triggered the
participant to resort to a particular method of information-seeking.
Check symptoms. The common reason for information-seeking among the
participants was to check their symptoms. The participants usually search for information
if they were “hurt” or “something was wrong” with them, in the words of Dillion and Jay,
who both scored a medium athletic identity. Jay said that his reason for information-

100

seeking was to check what his body felt:
I just want to know how bad I am. My body is weak, I feel like crap. If it
is bad I need to go be seen or should I just rest it off.
Tracy, who scored a high athletic identity, also searched for information when he did not
feel well:
I guess it gave me an outline of symptoms that are similar to the pain that I
was experiencing.
Seek remedies. The participants searched for health information to check
remedies. Often, the participants searched for self-remedies. However, the participants
also checked if they could administer the remedy by themselves or if they would need the
assistance of a professional. Dillion, who scored a medium athletic identity, said that:
If I am sick and I have a cold, just some remedies to help me get
better…get over it.
The participant added that he learned to treat a minor injury by searching for information
in the Internet. Dillion continued:
WebMD…I don’t know I had a sprain or something. I just learned how to
add compression to it and it is supposed to limit the blood flow.
Seek answers. Dennis said that he searched for information to know something
he did not know. The participant said that seeking answers helped him develop selfsufficiency in terms of dealing with health. Dennis, who scored a medium athletic
identity, said that:
Like the reason why I strive for more, and I want to see better is because I
know my momma, the person I go to, and my daddy, ain't going to be

101

there forever. So you got to learn how yourself. You got to learn it for
yourself, I mean…Don't expect the people that teach you stuff or teach
you something, because they ain't going to let you wait forever.
Dennis continued to say that:
No, I educate myself, because in the future, I know my kid is somebody
going to have it, so it would be . . . and my momma explained it to me like
you're going to have health issues, because, you know, her dad did, your
granddad did.
Dean sought information when he “might be just curious.” Jamie, who scored a medium
athletic identity, similarly said that:
Probably something was bothering me or someone I knew that needed
some help. A question came up and I wanted to answer for it.
In summary, information-seeking behavior was generally influenced by the kind
of information sought. Typically, the need to understand symptoms, get an idea of
possible remedies, and obtain satisfactory answers were the reasons the participants were
triggered to search for health information.
Qualitative Data on Benefits of Health Information-Seeking
Table 23 summarizes the themes and sub-themes within the qualitative data for
benefits of health information-seeking. I will continue by presenting data related to
themes and sub-themes. I will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme
to the least recurring theme, using direct quotes from the responses of the participants to
support the findings.

102

Table 23
Benefits of Health Information-Seeking
Themes
Learn information
Retain information

I generated two themes under the benefits of information-seeking. The
participants generally (a) learned information when searching; however, not all
participants were able to (b) retain information during information-seeking. The
participants considered learning and retaining information as benefits of informationseeking, as learning promoted knowledge of healthy options and retaining enhanced
healthy behavior.
Learn information. Information-seeking was considered beneficial to learning
new information. Awareness was often associated with healthier decisions and options.
Clark narrated how learning about a muscle in the body helped him train. Clark stated
that:
What I usually learn is let's say I might learn something new about my
body, like a muscle that I didn't have, because Abigail is really, really
good about breaking down and telling you about your muscles and like
certain muscles that work and how they work. So I might learn about a
new muscle that I had, that I wasn't using before, and now, all of a sudden,
that I'm using, and I know how to work it out to make it stronger.
Similarly, Marcellus, who scored a high athletic identity, expressed a similar rise in
awareness:
Yea, yea. I wouldn’t say it improved my condition, it helped me a little bit

103

because pretty much all I learned that one side of your body as far as
muscles go is hurting is due to the other side over compensating, so it
taught me to not stretch so much on one side. I went to the doctor and they
told me that as well.
Tracy shared that learning information helped him make healthy decisions. Tracy, who
scored a high athletic identity, said that:
I learned ways, well, ways it could be diagnosed against symptoms, ways
of rehabilitation, methods for strengthening and preventative maintenance
or preventative measures.
Retain information. Not all the information that the participants learned were
retained. Information-seeking was considered beneficial to retaining information when
the information “stood out.” Jamie, who scored a medium athletic identity, said that:
Yea, I learned something, I can’t really remember something that really
stood out. I kind of know because I’ve experienced those types of things. I
suppose that it can’t let depression get too, what’s the word, aggravated.
Don’t let it proceed too far that it can cause huge health risk. You can get
sick and have heart problems and other things like that.
Clark said that information-seeking from the past helped him retain information that was
useful in similar experiences of pain and aches. Clark explained:
What's going on in my personal life, just really how to stay physically
prepared, like my body. Like, you know, every time you have all these
nicks and knots and sores, like that information I need right now is just the
basic information on how to treat myself, on how to recover and stuff like

104

that, so nothing too serious.
On the other hand, Marlon stated that information-seeking helped him retain information
useful for his diet. Marlon, who scored a medium athletic identity, said that:
He probably told me to stay away from whole, like whole foods, you
know. And I believe so, like, because I was trying to lose weight. And so I
say I can't even really remember, but I can remember that he told me to
stay away from bread, you know, stuff like that, so, yeah.
Barriers to Health Information-Seeking
Table 24 summarizes the themes and sub-themes within the qualitative data for
barrier to health information-seeking. I will continue by presenting data related to themes
and sub-themes. I will present the findings from the most highly recurring theme to the
least recurring theme, using direct quotes from the responses of the participants to
support the findings.
Table 24
Barriers in Health Information-Seeking
Themes
Using the Internet
Misleading information
Finance
Problem with the doctors

The experience of information-seeking was not always easy for the participants.
Certain sources of information were considered unhelpful or inaccessible due to some
barriers. I identified four themes as barriers in information-seeking: (a) using the Internet,
(b) misleading information, (c) finance, and (d) problem with doctors.
Using the Internet. While the participants regarded using the Internet as the most

105

widely preferred and the most convenient source of information, some participants
expressed that using the Internet is a barrier in obtaining health information. Participants
reported using the Google search engine when using the Internet; however, some
participants experienced barriers in using Google. Dean, who scored a medium athletic
identity, had trouble using the proper term when using Google as a search engine. Jamie
had another experience with using the Internet:
Me, myself, yes, sometimes, you search for something and you really
can’t find exactly what you want.
Jordon expressed similar concerns with Jamie. Jordon, who scored a low athletic identity,
said that:
Well, I prefer talking, actually. If I do look online, sometimes certain
questions that you may have may go deeper, where someone that knows
that profession, or the situation may have to. It's no different than my
profession. You know, I can talk about so much over the phone, or you
can read so much, but then at some point, you have to come in and
actually see what is going on.
Misleading information. Health information-seeking, especially without the aid
of a health professional, tends to result in encountering various content sources, and the
gathered information may have conflicting content, or even incorrect information.
Marvin, who scored a medium athletic identity, expressed the need for vigilance to avoid
misleading information:
Just, you just got to find something that suits your needs, and so you got to
kind of shuffle through all that to find what works because there's a lot of

106

misinformation out there.
Marcellus, who scored a high athletic identity, stated that misleading information was
often encountered while searching the Internet. He said that:
Naw, Google is so easy, you can click on the first thing you don’t really
save or keep the specific website. I think that’s way a lot people get
confused too, because there are so many different sources, so it’s hard to
tell which ones are right.
Meanwhile, Jordon experienced obtaining misleading information through asking
for information from friends. Jordon, who scored a low athletic identity, shared that:
The only time when it's a challenge is because sometime, with like friends
and associates and that, you can get flooded with too much information or
even some information that was misleading.
Finance. Money was perceived as a barrier by the participants. The participants
were aware that the most helpful health information may come from doctors; however,
the participants also considered going to the doctors expensive. Marcellus, who scored a
high athletic identity, stated that:
I wouldn’t say that there was anything that stopped me from finding health
information. The biggest thing that stopped me from getting any
information is not knowing that I don’t the insurance or not necessarily
having the money to pay to go see someone that knows what they are
talking about for sure.
Marlon, who scored a medium athletic identity, stated:
I just, I mean, insurance, you know, like I had insurance, so I would go to

107

the doctor every now and then. But otherwise that, you know, I . . . dollar bill
going up to my mom to make sure we got our checkups all that every year.
Problems with doctors. Despite regarding doctors as reliable, some of the
participants considered the doctors as barriers in health information-seeking. As a former
college athlete and now a professional boxer, Clark has always had someone to provide
timely health information. If it wasn’t the trainer at the gym, he could rely on his mother
a healthcare worker, or make an appointment to see a healthcare provider. Clark had
trouble with the schedule of doctor’s appointments. Clark, who scored a high athletic
identity, said that:
I never really had any strong, any like, I guess I didn't have, I've always
had somebody to tell me about my health. I guess working on somebody
else's schedule, that's probably the worst thing I can go with, working on
somebody's schedule. Because if I'm not paying them for the health
referral, they, I can't tell them when and where, like be here or be there.
You know, I've got to wait on their time. So that's probably the only issue
I ever had with a health issue.
Jamie expressed that he felt like some of the doctors spoke to him with arrogance. Jamie,
who scored a medium athletic identity, said that:
Me, myself, with doctors, I’ve had a lot of problems because in their
minds they went to school for this so they are smarter than you. Instead of
them listening, they keep telling you this is what’s going on. It’s hard to
ask a question. When it comes to a doctor, you got to find the right person.
Because if you are talking to someone who is arrogant about being right.

108

Marcellus shared that going to the doctor was a barrier if the information sought was
“embarrassing.” Marcellus, who scored a high athletic identity, discussed:
Maybe because like it's, some questions can be embarrassing. Like if I
think there's a digestion issue or whatever, I know they have to, okay,
we're going to have to do a sample.
All 12 athletes shared what they did to overcome challenges to getting the health
and health services information they needed, including asking family, friends, and
coworkers. In summary, the barriers participants described ranged from the potential
unreliability of information received while using the Internet and the possibility of
obtaining misleading information, to the expenses of professional health services, to
problems in dealing with the doctors. The findings reveal that certain barriers may be
encountered with each source of information, and that learning to weigh the options for
information-seeking was a way to minimize the barriers.

I compared the qualitative themes with the AIMS and MIBI scores. In terms of
athletic identity, the participants with high AIMS scores mostly scored medium MIBI
scores, except for Marcellus, who had a high MIBI score. Nonetheless, all of the
participants with high MIBI scores, regardless of AIMS scores, expressed that being an
athlete involved staying in optimal mental and physical health and engaging in
competitive sports, mostly throughout high school and college. The participants with low
AIMS scores had medium to high MIBI scores, and had varied perceptions on being an
athlete. Both MIBI groups with low AIMS scores perceived that being an athlete meant
achieving goals. Marvin, who had a low AIMS score but a high MIBI score, did not think
of himself as an athlete. In terms of being Black or African American identity, the
findings revealed not much difference between the responses of the participants with
low/high AIMS scores and low/high MIBI scores. The responses varied from being Black
as part of their identity, as a source of stereotype, or indifference about being Black.
Similarly, I did not find much difference between the low/high AIMS group and
low/high MIBI group in terms of the influence of the environment on eating habits. One
sub-theme that emerged from the data was the importance of healthy eating to the
athletes. Four participants mentioned healthy eating. I analyzed the data by high and low
AIMS scores and did not see a difference in concerns about healthy eating. Two low
AIMS athletes raised concerns about food, and two high AIMS athletes raised concerns
about food. For example, Jamie (low AIMS) explained how an African American
lifestyle might encourage eating of unhealthy (fried) foods. Marvin (low AIMS)
explained that knowing which foods were healthy was a challenge, suggesting that
findings easy information about the topic was challenging. In the high AIMS group,

114

Marlon made the most direct connection between healthy eating and information
behaviors, describing nutrition as a reason for and a benefit of his health informationseeking. Marcellus explained how he used to believe pizza was healthy. His lack of
knowledge of what healthy eating entailed lead his thinking that pizza was healthy since
it included bread, vegetables, and tomato sauce. Healthy eating has changed his
perception of pizza. Healthy eating was also linked to the sub-theme of affordability,
which I will address later. I analyzed the healthy eating sub-theme data in terms of high
and medium MIBI scores. Of the participants who mentioned food, two were medium
MIBI and two were high MIBI.
Blue (Injuries)
Staying healthy as an athlete, avoiding injuries, or recovering from injuries
emerged as an important sub-theme from the information-seeking behavior of five of the
participants. I analyzed the data by high and low AIMS scores and did not see a big
difference in the sub-theme of injuries. Two low AIMS participants and three high AIMS
participants mentioned athletic concerns in relation to their health information-seeking
behavior. For example, Jay (low AIMS) and Dillion (high AIMS) mentioned injuries as a
motivator of his health information-seeking and knowledge about the extent of injuries as
a benefit of health information-seeking. Dean (low AIMS) and Clark (high AIMS)
pointed to their gym coach as a preferred source for health information-seeking.
I then analyzed the athlete/injury sub-theme data were in terms of high and
medium MIBI scores. I did find a suggestive difference between the two groups in terms
of the sub-theme of injuries. Of the participants who mentioned injuries, four were
medium MIBI and only one was high MIBI. Age may be a factor in the suggestive

115

differences between the two groups. The participants with high AIMS scores and medium
to high MIBI scores generally initially preferred using Google search to seek health
information, followed by talking with the gym coach or a physician. The participants
with low AIMS scores and medium to high MIBI scores had varied preferred health
information-seeking methods. All of the participants selected their preferred informationseeking method due to immediate availability and accuracy of information. The majority
of the participants sought health information due to injury or experience of symptoms of
illness. Marvin, with low AIMS and high MIBI, sought health information to see physical
improvements—while Marlon, with high AIMS and medium MIBI, sought health
information to learn about nutrition and healthy eating habits.
Red (Affordability)
One sub-theme that emerged from the data was the typical lifestyle experienced
by African Americans and their perceptions on going to the doctor. Dennis, who scored
medium in AIMS, raised his concern of avoidance of seeing a doctor because of financial
restraints and Marcellus, who scored high in AIMS, spoke about his lack of health
insurance and inability to afford treatment. The participants mentioned that past habits
were difficult to break and often led to unhealthy options. The availability and
affordability of healthy food also affected the participants’ ability to eat healthy. The
immediate surroundings sub-theme data were then analyzed in terms of high and medium
MIBI scores. Of the participants who mentioned lifestyle, two were high MIBI.
Yellow (Family life/Neighborhood)
One sub-theme that emerged from the data was the immediate surroundings of the
athletes. Two participants mentioned either their home and the local community were

116

meaningful in supporting their healthy behaviors. Dean, who scored medium in AIMS,
raised concerns of how his past contributed to his current health-related behavior.
Specifically, he spoke about the challenge of staying healthy when negative influences
such as drugs were running rampant. Clark, who scored high in AIMS, spoke highly of
having a supportive home life and how that has developed his healthy behaviors. I
analyzed the immediate surroundings sub-theme data in terms of high and medium MIBI
scores. Of the participants who mentioned family life/neighborhood, two were medium
MIBI.
Summary
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to explore how athletic and racial
identities and demographic characteristics of African American male athletes influenced
their health information-seeking behaviors. In order to describe and explain the ways that
African American male athletes seek information, I used descriptive statistics to define
and compare the participants background characteristics and racial self-definition based
on their athletic identity. The findings showed that the respondents were similar in terms
of their racial identity scores, but had more variance in their athletic identity. The results
indicated that while the sample was comprised of mostly young people, participants with
low athletic identity were relatively older (26-34) than the participants with high athletic
identity (18-25). Participants with high athletic identity tended to be more educated
(college graduate), while those in the low group were less educated, with the majority of
responses stating that they attended some college.
A comparison of the participants’ athletic identity with their racial self-definition
revealed that that participants who strongly associated with their athletic identities tended

117

to have a moderate perception of racial self-definition. However, the analysis was
inconclusive with participants with low athletic identity. I analyzed the participants’
health information-seeking behavior and found that for both groups, the majority of the
participants sought health information from the Internet. Conversely, the groups differed
in their health-seeking behavior for the other sources of information as the sources of
information for the Lows AIMS group varied much more considerably than those in the
High AIMS group.
I used the AIMS scores and the background characteristics to compare differences
in the quantitatively captured health information-seeking behaviors of the athletes for the
high athletic identity versus the medium and low athletic identity. The findings showed
no quantitative associations between athletic identity and racial identity in the preferred
health information-seeking behaviors among the African American male athletes who
participated in this study.
In the second part of the chapter, I described the qualitative analysis of the semistructured interviews. I presented the findings in the following eight subsections, each of
which included sub-themes with example quotes from the participants. In general, I found
through the interviews that the Black male athlete participants in this study believed race
was a part of who they were but not their defining quality. Study participants at all ages
and education levels preferred seeking health information from individuals such as health
professionals, friends, family members, and browsing websites on the Internet using
Google. Although all the athletes shared the belief that going to the doctors for
consultation and treatment was unnecessary for minor pains and ailments, their reasons
varied from adopting a machismo identity to lack of finance to having difficulty working

118

according to someone else’s schedule. Environment and culture had an influence on their
healthy behaviors, but the participants felt their upbringing had more impact in their
behavior than culture. Athletes between the ages of 18-25 typically preferred using their
cell phone and/or iPad when seeking health information for symptoms, remedies, or just
looking for answers for health information. While it was revealed that the Internet was
the primary source of information, the African American male athletes encountered
barriers while seeking health information. These barriers ranged from obtaining
misleading information while searching the Internet, to the financial expenses of
professional health services, to problems in dealing with healthcare providers.
In the third part of the chapter, I compared the qualitative themes from racial
identity, athletic identity, and surroundings to the sub-themes related to information
behavior. I presented the findings were presented in several subsections. Each section
compared the qualitative themes with the AIMS and MIBI scores from the participants.
In Chapter 5, I will provide a discussion of the findings, explore my reflection of the
study, future implications, and suggestions for future scholarly research for LIS.

119

CHAPTER FIVE: DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the health information needs
and behaviors of young African American male athletes aged from 18-34 who were not
affiliated with a school or a university sponsored athletic program, and to explore how
their background characteristics, racial identities, and athletic identities influenced those
needs and behaviors. Specifically, I examined the experiences and perceptions of African
American male athletes with regard to the types of health information and information
sources sought, and explored how race provided meaning to the participants’
information-seeking behavior.
I collected data from 12 in-depth, semi-structured participant interviews with data
from paper surveys completed by African American male athletes’ members of Purpose
Driven Gym. I drew the research question and data analysis phases from theories and
measurement instruments rooted in information studies, personality research, and sport
psychology. No athletes over the age of 35 participated. This may be the result of two
reasons. The gym is a staple in this predominately White community, and it has received
accolades for its retro-styled gym atmosphere. This atmosphere attracts “hipsters”
(generally ages 17-25) interested in either learning or enhancing their boxing skills,
preparing for strongmen competitions, or simply maintaining their athletic performance.
Secondly, another boxing gym recently opened, and several of the seasoned Purpose
Driven Gym’s African American male members joined the newer boxing gym. I
speculate that the newer gym attracted the African American Purpose Driven Gym male
members because of convenience, newer exercising equipment, and possibly the
introductory lower gym rate.

120

In this study, addressed the primary research question, which was, “How do the
athletic and racial identities, along with the background characteristics of African
American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym, influence their health informationseeking behaviors?”
According to researchers, African American males are notorious for delaying
their health information-seeking and preventive care for a variety of reasons, including
the mistrust of doctors, economic concerns, lack of education, and lack of culturally
appropriate health information resources (Hammond et al., 2010; Rooks et al., 2012;
Williams et al., 2008). African American male college students and athletes at Division I
colleges and universities also exhibit poor health risk behaviors with the use of tobacco,
obesity, and a focus on athletics instead of academics (Ajibade, 2010; Hawkins, 2010). In
this study, I found some qualitative relationships between athletic identity and health
information-seeking, but no relationships between racial identity and health informationseeking. Nonetheless, the findings provide insight into how and why African American
athletes seek health information.
According to Beamon (2008), becoming an athlete is often viewed as a pathway
for African American males to escape the social ills within lower income communities
that are laden with crime, incarceration, high mortality and unemployment rates, and
racial segregation. Thus, I proposed this mixed-method study explore the informationseeking behaviors of African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. Utilizing
participants within this setting, I explored how racial and athletic identities provide
insight into the complexity of why and how African American male athletes seek health
information.

121

In Chapter 1, I provided the background to the study, rationale for this study, an
explanation of the three theoretical perspectives that guided this dissertation, and the
research questions. The purpose of this study was to examine the health informationseeking behaviors of African American males who are non-students. One goal of this
study was to determine how the racial identity of African American males who were
members of the Purpose Driven Gym influence their health information-seeking
behaviors. This research drew attention to race and ethnicity, gender, low educational
attainment, and socioeconomic status as factors affecting athletes’ health informationseeking behaviors (Hellison, 2009; Mechanic, 2005; Syme, 2008). In Chapter 2, I
presented the literature review and provided insights into the current body of knowledge
on athletic identity and racial self-definition in a healthcare information-seeking context
of African American male athletes. In Chapter 3, I discussed the data collection and
analysis methodologies. Chapter 4 detailed the quantitative and qualitative findings in
tables, figures and narrative format. This chapter included a discussion of the key
findings of this study as they relate to theoretical perspectives and previous research and
a reflection on the study. Unlike previous studies (Beamon, 2008; Hawkins, 2010) that
documented the negative connotations and experiences of Division I colleges and
universities African American athletes, I incorporated athletes who were not affiliated
with a school and/or university. I also examined how athletic and racial identities
influenced the participants’ health information-seeking behaviors, an idea that has not
been explored considerably in previous studies.
In this final chapter, I will contextualize the major findings of this study with
existing research on African American athletes, the racial identity of African American

122

athletes, and information-seeking. First, the major findings of this study related to athletic
identity are summarized and compared with results from prior studies on African
American athletes. Second, the major findings of this study related to racial identity are
summarized and compared with results from prior studies on African American racial
identity, especially the identities of athletes. Third, the major findings of this study
related to information-seeking are summarized and compared with results from prior
relevant studies on information-seeking. Next, a self-reflection of the study an attempt to
understand the study participants and framework through the lens of a health sciences
librarian. Finally, the practical and future implications for library practitioners who are
seeking athletes who are not affiliate with a school or university-sponsored athletic
program for outreach and training on both print and online medical resources are
discussed.
Discussion of Findings on Athletic Identify
Athletic Identity
Based on the findings of this study, one’s perception of his athletic identity
appears to impact his health information-seeking behavior. In this section, I will provide
a discussion of what makes athletics a part of the participants’ identity, along with a
discussion of lifestyle, and the participants’ perception of the purpose of athletics. The
participants believed that being an athlete was a part of their identity, and they exerted
effort to excel in whatever sport they played. The patterns in the data were training and
diet, and those patterns identified the identity and the lifestyle of the athletes.
Furthermore, the findings revealed that athletics provided the participants with purpose,
motivating them to work hard in sports, and in other facets of their lives, such as college.

123

I believe that the athletes’ drive to excel in sports and in life prompted them to seek
health information. Learning about proper diet, exercise, and prevention and treatment of
injuries may allow the athletes to play sports better.
Part of identity. I quantitatively measured the participants’ athletic identity with
the AIMS score, and qualitatively in face-to-face interviews, where I asked participants
what it means to be an athlete. While the athletes were divided into those with low and
high athletic identities, their membership in Purpose Driven Gym suggested that being an
athlete was integral to their achievements. Regardless of background (demographic)
characteristics or AIMS score, in the interviews, participants referred to themselves as an
athlete and spoke about the hard work and training they endured to become a successful
athlete.
According to Brewer et al. (1993), individuals make a social statement about
themselves by choosing to engage in a particular sport or physical activity. Athletic
identity can also be explained as a cognitive structure and social role that explores the
positive and negative factors associated with an athlete’s athletic role. My findings align
and show that being an athlete was a central identity in the lives of the study participants
as well as those with whom they socialized daily. For African American male athletes at
Purpose Driven Gym, being an athlete was all-encompassing. Regardless of background
characteristics or AIMS score, participants revealed that being an athlete meant having
healthy habits like eating healthy, getting enough sleep, working hard physically, and
being a part of a team.
Lifestyle. Qualitatively, all the participants stated that they participated in some
form of competitive athletics at some part of their lives. The participants expressed the

124

following consistent themes throughout the face-to-face interviews. Being an athlete
meant setting goals and working hard to achieving them, and being an athlete meant hard
work, physical work, discipline, healthy eating, enough sleep, setting goals, enjoyment,
sacrifice, dedication, sense of purpose, and being part of team.
Gives purpose. I found some demographic differences among the participants
when observing the influence of education on their athletic identities. Participants with
low AIMS scores tended to have some college education and be aged from 26-34, while
participants with high AIMS scores tended to be aged from 18-25 and be college
graduates. This association between high AIMS and higher educational levels adds a new
dimension to work focusing on collegiate athletes. For example, Person and LeNoir
(1997) and Robinson and Mack (2004) found that being an athlete was associated with
low graduation rates and leaving college without degrees. This may be due to
compounding factors such as coming to college ill-prepared for higher education and
being obligated to their athletic obligations and schedule which often interfere with
academic work. Most researchers on African American male athletes have focused on
athletes at Division I colleges and universities, whereas I specifically targeted participants
who were not associated with any educational institution. Further, much of the literature
on college and university athletes has focused on examining collegiate athletes’ identity
in football and basketball through the lens of academic performance (O’Brien, 2012) and
coping at predominately White and historically Black colleges and institutions (Payne &
Suddler, 2014; Rassmussen, 2009).
For example, Beamon (2008) spoke to 20 Division I former collegiate athletes to
examine whether Division I universities are exploiting their athletic ability or

125

emphasizing their academic talents. Beamon’s (2008) ethnographic study results showed
that universities emphasized their athletic role over academics. In this literature, less is
known about the racial and athletic identities in African American athletes (Bimper &
Harrison, 2011; Harrison et al., 2002). Bimper and Harrison (2011) examined the
relationship between an athlete’s personal and academic development. The results of the
study discuss how high revenue generating intercollegiate sports such as basketball and
football have insulated high profiled players to their racial identity. This means that the
players who participate in high revenue generating intercollegiate sports identify with
their athletic role first and their racial identity second. Many of the above-named research
utilized intercollegiate African American athletes as research participants; however my
study is different. My study examined how athletic and racial identities and demographic
characteristics of African American male athletes intersect when they are not affiliated
with a school or university.
Discussion of Findings on Racial Identify
Racial Identity
I quantitatively measured racial identity through the Multidimensional Inventory
of Black Identity (MIBI) score and qualitatively measured it in the face-to-face
interviews by asking participants what it means to be African American and how
significant race was in defining who they are. This section first discusses several racial
themes emerging from the MIBI scores. It also discusses differences in racial identity in
light of athletic identity and attempts to increase understanding of how racial identity and
athletic identity are related.

126

Race. Race was the only constant factor in this study. The 12 athletes in this study
self-identified as either African American, African, or multiracial heritage. Qualitatively,
regardless of age and athletic identity scores, African American male athletes felt that
although one’s race was important, it did not define them nor did it influence their health
information-seeking decisions. Their thoughts about race (what it means to be African
American) ranged from “it does not matter” and “it is not a factor,” to “although it is
important and is a part of who you are, it is not a factor.”
Public regard. Overall, the athletes had low scores on the public regard scale in
MIBI regardless of AIMS score. This result was confirmed by the interviews where
athletes spoke passionately about not allowing the (negative) behaviors of other Blacks
define them as individuals or race. The lack of a high score on the public regard scale
further illustrates that athletes in this study, reject their race as being seen as violent or
negative by the broader society. In the interviews, athletes spoke about watching videos
which portrayed Blacks negatively (i.e., street fighting). Several participants forcefully
stated that those individuals whose bad behavior was reflected in the videos did not
define them. Although much of the dominant society views Blacks as negative, the
results of this study revealed that athletes are resilient and they did not allow those
instances to define their identity. This is significant because the interviews confirmed that
African American male athletes in this study rejected the prevailing societal notions of
the being the careless, brash, and unruly street fighters highlighted in television images
and videos.
Assimilation. The findings revealed that athletes with a high MIBI scores
advocated assimilating into the mainstream dominate culture regardless of their AIMS

127

score and background characteristics. During the face-to-face interviews, each athlete
spoke about the importance of learning from all types of people. I believe that being
surrounded by a relatively homogenous community and being a part of a gym that is
predominantly White has shaped their race centrality philosophies and encouraged the
athletes to advocate assimilating into the dominant culture. I believe that athletes in this
study advocated assimilation to become less offensive and threatening to mainstream
dominant culture. This belief was confirmed in the interviews. The athletes believed that
race was a part of who they were and was not their defining quality. To eliminate
stereotyping from society, participants felt that they had to show the dominant
mainstream culture who they were as a person in order to avoid or overcome negative
stereotypes about their race.
Humanist. This study revealed that, overall, all the athletes firmly believed that
they all belonged to the human race (humanist orientation). The athletes would rather not
be defined by their race, but spoke in the interviews about how others always want to
define them by their race and not as individuals. More importantly, I believe that the
participants wanted to be seen as human just like the individuals of the mainstream
dominant culture.
Oppressed minority. This study also revealed that, overall, the athletes identified
with the perspective that Blacks were an oppressed minority group and faced daily
injustices similar to that of other underrepresented groups. Qualitatively, athletes spoke
about spending lots of time at the gym because they felt accepted and comfortable there.
Specifically, in the interview, one athlete spoke about his natural hair (dreadlocks) being
viewed negatively outside of the gym. Inside the gym, he was being treated fairly, but

128

outside the gym, he strongly felt that his race and hairstyle played a significant role in the
injustices he faced daily. I believe that Purpose Driven Gym is a homogenous gym
community with a small percentage of African American members, which allows gym
members to interact with one another to bond and create lasting friendships and a sense
of comfort among the population groups at the gym.
In comparing racial identity and AIMS scores, qualitatively, the findings
suggested that for those who scored high on the AIMS, race was not central to their
athletic identity. This is consistent with the quantitative results that indicated that
participants with high AIMS scores tended to have a moderate Black identity (MIBI
scores). This means that for high AIMS scorers, race was semi-important but did not
define the participant. In interviews, high AIMS-scoring athletes stated they would rather
not be defined by race and spoke about others always wanting to define them by their
race and not as individuals. On the other hand, the results for the six individuals who had
low AIMS (low and medium) scores was inconclusive, since exactly half indicated that
race was an essential element of their athletic identity while the other half did not. This
may be explained by the participants’ perception of their African American identity as a
part of who they were. Low (low to medium) AIMS scorers may feel that race is not
essential to their athletic identity because it is a part of their overall identity; however,
when someone of another race or ethnicity views them, they prioritize their
characterization as an African American male before being labeled as an athlete.
Consistently, the participants perceived race as an important to, but not the defining
feature of, their identity; therefore, race did not appear to impact the athletes’ health
information-seeking behavior. Despite the MIBI scores, the majority of the participants

129

did not focus on race while discussing health information-seeking. The majority of the
participants perceived that race did not affect their athletics; however, the participants
also felt that being Black put them in the oppressed minority. While stereotype and
prejudice may affect what the participants felt, it did not impact the participants’ health
information-seeking behavior. The findings may be due to the participants’ perception of
athletic identity, in which pursuing sports was their motivation for information-seeking.
Racial centrality. Another key finding in this study is that participants’ MIBI
scores sometimes contrasted with how they described their racial identity in face-to-face
interviews. Athletes with a high AIMS score acknowledged in the interviews that race
was a part of who they were. Although race was not recorded as central to their identity
when participants filled out the paper surveys (low MIBI), they had contradictory
responses about the centrality of race during the face-to-face interviews, and athletes
spoke in great detail about the impact of race in their lives. I surmised that a contradiction
between the survey and interviews can be explained because having a frank discussion of
what is means to be Black often (during the interactive interviews) evoked emotion,
consciously or unconsciously, which led to more frank and sincere discussions about the
impact of race in ways not revealed in the closed-ended, written survey measures. In the
interviews, participants with a high AIMS score often reflected on how they viewed
themselves by race, and more importantly, how others felt about their race. Similarly, the
six individuals sharing a low to medium AIMS score also compared how they internally
felt about their Blackness and how others viewed them.

130

Discussion of Findings on Health Information-Seeking Behaviors
Health Information-Seeking Behaviors
This section continues by discussing the data on health information-seeking
behaviors. I asked the athletes in this study about their preferred ways of seeking
everyday health information, what triggers the need, and what specific resources they use
to find an answer to their health needs.
Regardless of the athletes’ background characteristics and athletic identity score,
participants reported that they were physically healthy, with little to no ailments. Athletes
who discussed being physically fit with little to no ailments felt that being an athlete their
entire lives prepared them to take care of their bodies. If an injury occurred, they used
their trainers and/or health professionals as their first resource. The participants also had
established networks to turn to for advice for health information; depending on the health
need, they used their friends, Internet, or another trusted source to find answers.
Griffith et al. (2012) addressed the role and usage of different health information
sources using focus groups in the lives of 154 African American men ages 35 and older.
Griffith et al. showed that the participants preferred four sources of information for their
everyday health information needs: media, medical professionals, personal social
network, and community resources. My research was different from that of Griffith et al.
in that my participants were between the ages 18-25, and the data for this study were
collected in 2015 when mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets had become
more widespread. Results from this study show a higher preference for cell phone, iPad
or interpersonal communications (Marcellus, Dean, Dennis, and Morris). This finding is
consistent with the assertion by Mays (2004) that the Internet has revolutionized the

131

distribution of, and access to, consumer health information. The interviews documented
that athletes who fell in the 18-25 age, regardless of their athletic identity, preferred using
an electronic device to go online to find answers to their health questions. Participants
discussed their comfort in using the Internet for searching all types of information, and
they preferred to search via their smartphones because of the convenience and ease of
use. This contrasts with earlier work like Morey’s (2007) survey of older African
Americans that showed that the Internet was not a source of consumer health information
for participants. The interviews also revealed that participants of various ages and
education levels preferred seeking health information from individuals such as health
professionals, friends or family members.
Thompson et al. (2009) found what deterred African American men from seeking
health-related information were economic concerns such as being uninsured or
underinsured, poverty, lack of education and/or employment, community norms, a
negative view of their masculinity, and lastly, lack of culturally appropriate health
information sources. These study results showed similar findings. For example, Dennis
mentioned his avoidance of seeing a doctor because of financial restraints and Marcellus
spoke about his lack of health insurance and inability to afford treatment. The participants
mentioned that past habits were difficult to break and often led to unhealthy options. The
availability and affordability of healthy food also affected the participants’ ability to eat
healthy.
Chatman’s (1991; 1996; 1999; 2000) theories helped me to conceptualize
everyday health information behaviors of African American male athletes. Specifically,

132

the findings of this study align with Chatman’s research that investigated the information
behaviors of underserved populations at a micro level.
Reasons for seeking health information. Regardless of their AIMS or MIBI
score, the need for African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym to seek health
information was triggered by multiple reasons including: a recent injury or (chronic)
illness and a curiosity and interest in finding information about observed symptoms. They
obtained health information which ranged from their symptoms and injuries, methods of
treatment, and explanations about muscular and body functioning. Topics they explored
included depression, injury, illness, allergies, abstinence from smoking, nutrition/eating
habits, weight loss, anxiety issues, back pains/aches, asthma, leg pains, and infections.
Although there is a dearth of literature exploring the health information behaviors of
athletes, Ajibade (2010) researched African American male college students’ health risk
behaviors. Ajibade addressed Black male college students’ participation in activities that
increase their risky health behaviors. My research study showed that African American
athletes are seeking health information that will prevent health risk behaviors such as
abstinence from smoking and increase healthy habits such as healthy eating.
When athletes were asked how they used the health information they found,
athletes reported using it to implement weight loss strategies, treat and recuperate from
injuries, and correctly administer medication. When asked what health information was
needed right now in their personal lives, their answers varied greatly. Athletes discussed
wanting to be able to afford a better doctor than the one covered by their insurance,
recover faster from injuries, know more about the benefits of vitamins, stay healthy, lose
weight, and learn how to quit smoking. The research of Rooks et al. (2012) did not access

133

their research participants’ reasons for seeking and using health information; instead, the
researchers investigated the relationship between race and ethnicity and health
information use. Sollenberger et al. (2003) addressed the need for finding reliable health
information online.
Preferred sources of information. During the face-to-face interviews, the most
common source given by athletes was Google, which was closely followed by seeking
out the gym’s trainer for their knowledge and expertise. The participants also stated that
they preferred seeking everyday health information from a health professional, friend, or
family member. Participants shared that they did not like health information packets.
Accordingly, they never got around to reading the information and would have preferred
talking directly with somebody. The findings suggested that all the athletes have access to
health information through contact with the trainers and coaches at Purpose Driven Gym,
family members who work in healthcare, fellow athletes, and online searches. Morey
(2007) supported the claim that older African Americans tend to seek and rely on a health
service professional for health information, whereas younger African Americans seek
health information online. Morey reported that a high number (60) of her research
participants sought health information from a health service professional, 22 of her
participants sought health information from a website, and 14 of her participants sought
health information from a family member. Unlike Griffith et al. (2012), Morey (2007)
reported the role of masculinity in deterring health information-seeking. The findings of
the current study concur. Participants in this study shared with me why they were not
going to the doctor. In general, athletes felt that going to the doctor was a low priority for
men; if a man felt healthy, he must be healthy (with no need to visit a doctor).

134

Barriers to seeking health information. Variables such as race, ethnicity, and
culture have been documented in literature as variables associated with disparate health
outcomes (Mechanic, 2005; Syme, 2008). According to Griffith et al. (2012) and
Thompson et al. (2009), African American men are deterred from seeking health
information by economic concerns such as being uninsured or underinsured, poverty, and
lack of education and/or employment, as well as community norms, a negative view of
their masculinity, and lack of culturally appropriate health information resources.
Masculinity played a role in health information-seeking behavior of the African
American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. The main factor preventing African
American male athletes from not going to the doctor is based on their machoism and not
their ethnicity. Also in this study, African American male athletes at Purpose Driven
Gym primarily reported economic barriers related to the cost of health services. In the
interviews, participants repeatedly mentioned challenges relating to poverty.
Socioeconomic status was a recurring factor in a majority of participants’ responses.
Perry et al. (1992) emphasized that patients seeking health information often have
no library or research skills, have difficulty interpreting conflicting information, and lack
the skills to evaluate quality of information. One of the barriers consistently discussed
among this study athletes regardless of their AIMS scores, MIBI scores, and background
characteristics was difficulty in determining the accuracy of information. From the
qualitative data, high athletic identity athletes admitted coming across unfamiliar
terminology, being flooded with too much information, or receiving some information
that was misleading. Most frequently, they reported frustration in not finding exactly
what they wanted.

135

Differences in health information-seeking behaviors. The study was designed
to explore how differences in athletic identity (AIMS) and racial identity (MIBI) might
influence health information-seeking behavior. No strong quantitative or differences were
found in the health information-seeking behavior of high/low AIMS or high/low MIBI.
This study did not have a big enough sample size for clear qualitative and
quantitative patterns to appear. I interviewed 12 participants; this sample size may have
not been sufficient enough to be applicable to all types of mixed-methods studies, like a
larger scaled mixed-methods study. If I had a sample size of 100 participants, I may have
seen more patterns in athletic identity and racial identity and its influences on their health
information-seeking behaviors.
Differences in athletic identity. Regardless of the athletes’ background
characteristics and athletic identity score, participants reported that they were physically
healthy, with little to no ailments. Athletes who discussed being physically fit with little
to no ailments felt that being an athlete their entire lives prepared them to take care of
their bodies. If an injury occurred, they used their trainers and/or health professionals are
their first resource. It can be inferred from the interviews that those participants who are
highly trained athletes at the peak of fitness have the skills and knowledge of what to do
when an injury occurs or a health question arises. The participants have established
strong networks to turn to for advice for health information, and depending on the health
need they will utilize their friends, Internet, or another trusted source to find an answer.
According to the findings, there were no differences in various educational levels
among the athletes in the health information-seeking behavior of the athletes based upon
their AIMS scores. Qualitatively, the high and medium athletic identity college educated

136

athletes preferred to use trusted people to answer their health needs. The high and
medium athletic identity scorers and the athlete with a high school diploma preferred
going directly to friends to get their health questions addressed.
Athletic identity were influencers of the health information-seeking behaviors of
African American athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. Athletes with a high athletic identity
were more likely to not have searched for health information. Qualitatively, athletes
found it difficult to find health services (especially free health services), to determine the
quality of health information they received, and to understand the health information,
especially if they found it too technical. Cognitively, to fill their knowledge gap, African
American athletes often kept searching and kept asking questions until they were satisfied
with the answer. As mentioned before, gym trainers and friends and family with a
background in healthcare were often the trustworthy sources used to fill a knowledge gap.
While looking online for health information, one athlete looked for relevancy to obtain
the information he was seeking. The athletes who relied on the trainers’ expertise as their
sole source of information did so in order to interpret physical health symptoms and
provide diagnoses. The participants in this study shared with me why athletes were not
going to the doctor. In general, athletes felt that going to the doctor is a low priority for
men, and if a man felt healthy, he must be healthy.
According to the qualitative findings, athletes admitted coming across unfamiliar
terminology and being flooded with too much information or receiving some information
that was misleading. But most often they reported not finding exactly what they wanted.
Barriers African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym encountered in the
process of searching for health information included determining the accuracy of

137

information, cost of health services, and the need to see a physician. When asked about
overcoming barriers to getting health and health services information, athletes reported
discussing this with their athletic trainer and/or friends at the gym, consulting with
friends, consulting with a family member in the healthcare field, and, if necessary,
contacting their healthcare provider directly. Participants shared that even when they
found the right physician to receive health information, they did not like health
information packets. Accordingly, they never got around to reading the information and
would have preferred talking directly with somebody.
Differences in racial identity. Table 25 is a visual illustration of the qualitative
and quantitative themes across participants with high and low AIMS and MIBI scores
that emerged as key factors in this study. Regardless of age, the African American male
athletes felt that although one’s race was important, it did not define them. Their thoughts
about race ranged from “it does not matter,” “it is not a factor,” to “although is important
and is a part of who you are, it is not a factor.” Differences in various educational levels
among the athletes in this study existed, with 25% of the participants with a college
degree compared to 33% with a high school diploma illustrates ones’ health informationseeking behaviors. According to the survey data, education level was also associated with
the barriers lack of relevance found in many health sources for the athlete’s needs. This is
due to many factors. Determining the accuracy of information is one of the barriers
consistently discussed among the athletes of various ages and stages of educational
attainment. The athletes admitted finding unfamiliar terminology, being flooded with too
much information, and even receiving some information that was misleading, but most
often they reported not finding exactly what they wanted. Participants shared with me

138

that even when they found the right physician to receive health information, they do not
prefer health pamphlets. Admittedly, they never got around to reading the information
and would have preferred talking directly with somebody. According to findings of this
study, athletes preferred not to venture outside of their social circle of information until it
became critical; even when it became critical, talking to a librarian was not an option for
athletes. Librarians and libraries were not included in the social contextual factors for
African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. One athlete explained that it
was an inconvenience to go to the library for 2 hours to look for a book when information
could be found using his phone. The lack of use of a library as a source was a core theme
with all of the athletes. During all of the interviews, it became apparent that none of the
athletes were aware of the availability of the library/librarians as a free valuable resource
in the community. Having a Wisconsin library card could guarantee the participants
access to resources such as BadgerLink to search for quality health information.
Libraries as a source of information. “If knowledge is power, librarians hold
the key to empowering millions of individuals with low health literacy skills by
collecting, developing, and making accessible health information materials in userfriendly formats” (Ochillo & Auflict, 2005, p. 60). Despite the promise that libraries
should be an empowering source of health information, the African American male
athletes in this study did not utilize libraries or librarians. Not using a library as a source
was a core theme with all of the athletes. This finding confirms the need for librarians to
do more to become the athlete’s bridge to finding and accessing materials that are userfriendly. Morey (2007) examined and determined that health service professionals were
the preferred source of health information whereas librarians were not sought after as a

139

source. My results overall confirmed what Morey determined, as librarians were not an
information source for the athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. Moreover, in this study, there
was evidence that the use of libraries were generally shunned by participants. This
finding comports with work by Lieberman and Harris (2007) that showed that young
African American women rely on their communities and networks rather than libraries.
Agada (1999) argued that traditional information services such as libraries do not meet
the needs of his study participants, Harambee residents. Spink and Cole (2001) showed
that low-income African American families tend to use family physician and family
members for health questions, whereas the middle-class families tend to use the media.
Contribution to Theory
Drawing on the study data, I made a list of recommendations to the Lay
Information Mediary Behavior model to be more inclusive to the information-seeking of
African American male athletes.
Recommendations for the Lay Information Mediary Behavior Model
Abrahamson and Fisher’s (2007) LIMB model, the theoretical foundation which
the methodology is built upon, can be more inclusive by representing African American
male athletes’ background characteristics, athletic and racial identities, and their health
information behaviors that is generalizable across all athlete’s needs. The LIMB model is
a variety of cognitive, physical, social, and affective motivations that influence lay
mediary behaviors represent barriers to information-seeking. Inclusion of a representation
of the relationship between the phenomena—background characteristics, athletic identity
measurement scale (AIMS), and the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity Scale
(MIBI)—and information-seeking behaviors may provide an authentic insight into the

140

information behaviors. The LIMB model could include an arrow from the background
characteristics to AIMS represents the participants’ age, education, and connections to
the importance and centrality athletics has in a person’s life. The Multidimensional
Inventory of Black Identity represents an athlete’s racial self-definition with comparison
of the participants’ athletic identity. The AIMS and MIBI scores—whether they are low,
medium, or high—represent any differences in the health information-seeking behaviors
of the athletes. This more inclusive model will help in the understanding of how athletic
and racial identities and demographic characteristics of African American male athletes
not affiliated with school or university by providing a lens into their health informationseeking behaviors.
According to Abrahamson and Fisher (2007), the LIMB model contextual factors
may also affect the participants’ cognitive, affective, physical, and social state at the time
of information-seeking. According to the LIMB model, characteristics related to
motivations may include intentional problem solving or incidental information-seeking
(which is seeking information for curiosity’s sake). The effects are represented as the
outcomes in the model. The positive outcomes include problem solving, decision making,
and task completion. Negative outcomes may occur if one is given too much or too little
information. The system includes a variety of formal information sources such as books,
databases, and different types of media.
In this study, there were several key results regarding contextual factors
(cognitive, affective, physical, and social) that influence the athletes’ health informationseeking behaviors through the face-to-face interviews.

141

Cognitive Factors
Abrahamson and Fisher’s (2007) cognitive factors include thoughts, grey matter,
and the desire to learn or to fill a knowledge gap. Qualitatively, the athletes find it
difficult to find health services (especially free health services), to determine the quality
of health information, and to comprehend the health information if it is perceived as too
technical and difficult to understand. Cognitively, to fill their knowledge gap, the athletes
turned to trusted allies in their social network of friends and family members.
Physical Factors
The physical factors include physical state, health, and physical-geographic status
(Abrahamson & Fisher, 2007). All of the athletes in this study reported to be physically
healthy, with little to no ailments. When health questions arose, it happened when injury
occurred at the gym; in these cases, the athletes often turned to the trainers or coaches at
the gym for answers.
Social Factors
The social factors of Abrahamson and Fisher (2007) relate to the social capital
and social networks of participants. Findings from this study suggested that athletes
preferred not to venture outside of their social circle of information until it became
critical. Librarians and libraries are not included in the social contextual factors for
African American male athletes at Purpose Driven Gym. Evidence from the interviews
and surveys indicated that athletes preferred not to venture outside of their social circle of
information until it became critical and even when it became critical, talking to a librarian
was not an option for athletes. One athlete explained it was an inconvenience to go to the
library for 2 hours to look for a book, when information could be found using his phone.

142

The lack of using a library as a source was a core theme with all of the athletes. During
all of the interviews it became quite apparent that none of the athletes were aware of the
library/librarians as a free valuable resource in the community and the power of a library
card. Having a Wisconsin library card can guarantee access to resources such as
BadgerLink to search for quality health information.
Affective Factors
According to Abrahamson and Fisher (2007), affective factors relate to emotions.
Affective factors, as a concept, does not appear to be key to understanding the
information needs and behaviors of African American athletes at Purpose Driven Gym.
Implications for Future Research
The results of this dissertation have implications for future research. Several of
the study conclusions are tentative due to the small sample size. This study did not seek
to be generalizable; rather, I sought to identify authentic examples of situations and
challenges that young African American male athletes not affiliated with a school or
university experience while seeking health information. Furthermore, Mason (2010)
suggested that the qualitative aspect of the study does not focus on generalization but on
the understanding of the meaning of the phenomenon. The qualitative aspect also tends to
have a smaller sample size. Mason recommended the sample size of at least 10
participants to reach data saturation. This study utilized in-depth, semi-structured
interviews from 12 participants; however the results appeared that data saturation may
not have been reached. The inconsistency of the patterns among the data may be due to
the small sample size. Mason suggested that qualitative studies may have a sample size of
10 to 95 participants, depending on the scope and nature of the study and the expertise of

143

the participants regarding the phenomenon. Despite the small sample size, the study data
and findings draw attention to the need to design research measurement tools that will
better access the health information-seeking behaviors African American athletes within
the context of what it means to be African American.
I employed the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (Sellers et al., 1998)
and found it to be a useful measure, but it required too much time and employed
terminology unfamiliar to participants. In this study, paper surveys were the most
efficient way to gather survey data. I chose to administer the MIBI as a paper copy given
the uncertainty of the athletes’ Internet access and abilities. Administering the MIBI as a
paper copy removed the issue of finding a location with wireless access for athletes to
complete the survey electronically. I discovered that completing the MIBI was a timeconsuming task, filled with terminology that most of my participants had challenges in
interpreting. After realizing the difficulties participants faced with the terms, I
subsequently developed a glossary of terms to ensure linguistic accessibility for each
participant. For future work, I suggest rewording the MIBI survey instrument to better
facilitate the participants’ understanding. Secondly, at the start of the interview, I
thoroughly explained the research along with an emphasis on the importance of my
research topic to each participant. I believe that taking time to explain the agenda of the
study encouraged each participant to fully complete each survey, including the MIBI.
I also utilized the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS) that measures the
level of importance athletics has in a person's life (Brewer et al., 1993). Sample items
include “Other people see me mainly as an athlete” and “I need to participate in sport to
feel good about myself.” I distributed the AIMS as a paper survey in this study in order to

144

quantify the significance that athletics has in the lives of the African American male
athletes. Unlike the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity paper survey, AIMS
contained fewer questions with less complicated terminology and participants were able
to complete the survey within minutes.
For future research, one could conduct a study that quantitatively analyzes the
Searching for Yourself survey and correlate the survey with in-depth health informationseeking behaviors interviews of African American male athletes. Methods used in
accessing the health information-seeking behaviors can include a writing journal by
documenting every experience of when and why a health information-seeking behavior
occurs. Other methods can include observing athletes as they search for health
information while having them talk aloud their thought process to explain their searching
behaviors.
Instead of interviewing athletes directly, future researchers can target trainers at
popular gyms to speak to them about their information conduit role and experiences as a
source for health information for their African American male clients—specifically, their
experiences searching for and disseminating health information. Researchers could use
focus groups as a methodology, with gym trainers asking about their role as a health
information conduit for their African American male clients.
Future scholars may wish to investigate the information-seeking behavior of
African American women athletes in comparison to male athletes not affiliated with a
school or university to determine if they experience similar challenges and barriers to
health information. Further methods for investigating underrepresented athletes might
include using a grounded theory approach to study their information-seeking behaviors.

145

Potential approaches may include qualitative data collection through reflective notetaking, which may provide a deeper and richer understanding of the information-seeking
behavior of underrepresented men and women athletes. It is my hope that the findings of
this research will be used as the basis for future research into the exploration of African
American athletes’ health information-seeking behavior and how this relates to their
athletic identity.
Future researchers might consider several other important research questions that
emerged from this study. For example, the following research questions can contribute to
further scholarship in investigating the health information needs and behaviors of African
American men in the LIS literature:
1. How can community approaches (including communities of athletes) address the
health disparities of African American male athletes?
2. In a post-racial society, what is the effect of racial identity on the health
information-seeking behaviors of African American male athletes?
3. What, if any, are accessible health resources for African American male athletes?
4. What is the intersection of race, health, and education levels for male athletes?
5. What are the similarities and differences in the health information-seeking
behaviors between African American men and women who are, and are not,
affiliated with a school/university-sponsored athletic program?
6. Do socioeconomic differences among African American male athletes contribute
to differential health information-seeking behaviors?
Future research studies about this topic would benefit from interviews with
African American male athletes by employing a combination of methodologies,

146

interviewing, focus groups, and administering a survey. Focus group interviewing is the
most appropriate research method to gain fresh, rich insights into the information-seeking
needs and behaviors athletes and any perceived barriers in their accessing health
information. Future researchers could seek to understand the concepts and theories held
by African American male athletes by providing a platform for them to share their
experiences and identify their health information-seeking patterns and behaviors.
Recommendations for Information Studies and Librarians
Based on the findings of this study, librarians are not included in the inner circle
of trust for athletes. However, when it pertains to an injury athletic trainers can fulfill the
role as a health information providers for their clientele. The athletes indicated that they
were not aware that librarians could serve as a source of health information and did not
see libraries as convenient given smartphone access to the general Internet. Based upon
the findings of this study, I offer the following practical strategies for practitioners to
make information more accessible and libraries more attractive for African American
athletes who are not affiliated with a school and/or university — an interesting and
desirable target population.
1. Partner with local athletic trainers and offer to present hands-on health
information workshops as professional development.
2. Create a resource of mobile health apps for those without access to personal
computers and laptops.
3. Submit a short article on medical websites for athletic trainers in their state,
regional, and/or national newsletters, journals, or blogs

147

4. Promote awareness to athletes who lack access to technology, and who are not
affiliated with a school or a university sponsored athletic program. Work with
policymakers and community college leaders to connect with athletes by offering
access to a computer lab.
5. Create useful links on their websites to attract athletes who are not affiliated with
a school or university-sponsored athletic program.
6. Develop an in person and online classes on how to enroll in services such as the
Affordable Healthcare Act as well as an explanation of the services.
7. Work at the community level and get to know local athletes.
8. Link to culturally diverse health materials on the library’s website.
9. Connect with the local community’s gatekeepers and establish a working
relationship. These relationships will blossom so that the librarian will be able to
act not as an outsider but as a member within the community’s small world.

Librarians have an ideal opportunity to target athletes who are not affiliated with a
school or university-sponsored athletic program for outreach and training on both print
and online medical resources. To provide effective library services to athletes, librarians
can examine their resources and services by designing and implementing programs to
reach individuals who are smartphone users and are not familiar with the vast resources
libraries offer. Librarians have an ideal opportunity to address the presence of disparate
health outcomes such as low socioeconomic status of the athletes of color and the lack of
health insurance and access to health information and/or resources. Future research is

148

needed using a grounded theory approach to determine how those variables (and other
factors) influence the information-seeking behaviors of African American athletes.
Conclusion
Reflections
I used a mixed-methods approach to not only qualitatively conceptualize athletes’
interviews but to quantitatively determine the demographic, athletic, and racial identities
that shape the participants’ health information-seeking behaviors and related
informational and health services challenges. This mixed-methods approach allowed me
to qualitatively explore: (a) the types of health information that athletes sought; (b) their
sources of information; and (c) the challenges they encountered in this endeavor, and
quantitatively supplement my findings from the participant interviews with three survey
tools. This chapter detailed my reflections of my own assumption about my research
approach and identity as well as my experiences as a librarian of color in a field dominate
by non-people of color. It also delved into my identity as an African American woman
conducting this study with all male participants, the challenges I faced, and my
interpretation of the research.
As I reflect upon my experiences as an African American woman working in the
field of librarianship that is predominantly White, as a researcher, I bring to the table my
knowledge of how it feels like to be the minority in the classroom as well as the
workforce. For example, in my very first class in library school at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), I was the only student of color in the room. I felt a lot of
academic pressure being the only person of color in the class. Every time a race issue was
discussed, all heads would turn my way for either clarification or just to hear my reaction,

149

as if I spoke for all the Black people in the world. Throughout the first semester of my
library school experience, I felt isolated and unsupported. Although there were only a few
minority students in the program, this did not dissuade me from quitting. I knew that if I
completed the degree and excel in the field, I could open doors for other minorities.
During those first crucial weeks, I was always searching for not only someone who
looked like me, but who also shared my cultural characteristics. My very first position as
a practitioner was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW-Madison) Health
Sciences Library as an outreach coordinator. On my very first site visit to a public health
nurse in a rural area in Wisconsin, I was treated with hostility by the nurse that I was
educating.
With that leadership foundation and using my unique experiences as a woman of
color in librarianship, I felt well-equipped to qualitatively and quantitatively capture data
regarding the voices of African American male athletes. During the interviews, I was
struck by the awareness that most of the athletes I interviewed had never been asked
about their health information needs and behaviors and their identities. When asked direct
questions, the athletes often provided vague answers. To get to a more well thought-out
answer, I often had to unpack the interview and survey questions for each athlete. I often
allowed them time to think aloud to recall how they searched for health information and
what they found to get a more robust answer. Extracting what it means to be an athlete
and to be African American meant giving them time to ponder what those things meant to
them. In this section, I will reflect upon what I have learned at the completion of the
study, my experiences while conducting this mixed-methods, and what I learned in doing
this study.

150

Through my reflection of the interviews, participants’ demographics played a role
in the experiences of each of the athletes. A majority of the athletes who fell into the 1825 age range had a high athletic identity, whereas the older athletes identified as a low
athletic identity. Athletes who identified with a high athletic identity tended to have more
education versus low identity athletes who were less educated, with most responses
stating that they attended some college. I came to the realization that participants with a
high athletic identity contradicted my own low athletic identity.
Utilizing the three survey tools, I was able to ask the participants to reflect on
their everyday health information behaviors but also the meaning of not only being
African American (racial identity) but also being an athlete. In addition, I asked
participants to make meaning of the significance of their racial identity and how it defines
oneself along with how it influences their healthy or unhealthy behaviors. These types of
questions required thoughtful reflection, which took long moments of silence for the
athletes to think of answers. During these moments, I believe that these interview
questions became an introspective process for each participant. The findings from the
participant interviews enriched my study and was conducive in learning about myself as a
researcher and as a former athlete (marathon runner). Now that this study is completed,
this research has left me contemplating the results and what I learned about myself using
the Lay Information Mediary Behavior conceptual framework (Abrahamson & Fisher,
2007).
I learned that for the majority of the participants, being an athlete was allencompassing. It meant having healthy habits like eating healthy, getting enough sleep,
working hard physically, and being a part of a team. As a former marathon runner, my

151

experiences were like that of the research participants. On the other hand, participants
would rather not be defined by their race but others always wanted to define them by race
and not as individuals. My personal experience conflicted with theirs in this regard. I
define myself by my racial identity as an African American woman, especially in
librarianship. Librarianship is a profession made up of predominantly White females
(AAHSL, 2003); in order to mitigate and encourage people of color to enter medical
librarianship, I was one of the librarians featured on the Medical Library Association’s
2006 Recruitment DVD, “Join the Healthcare Team: Become a Medical Librarian.” A
necessary and effective tool is needed to recruit future generations of librarians of color.
Reviewing the transcripts of each interview, race was the only constant factor in
this study. As I listened to interviews and went through the transcripts, qualitatively and
quantitatively, the data showed athletes in this study believed race was a part of who they
were but not their defining quality. Through reflection of the 12 interviews, stories of
what it means to be African American and how significant race in defining an athlete
were quite enlightening. Most of the athletes were not aware of their own race and often
did not think about it. Some of the athletes know that they are often prejudged by the
color of their skin; the challenges they face are often the challenges I face daily.
Creating and reviewing my memos helped me look at my data as a whole and to
understand the meaning of the experiences of the athletes, whether the data was implied
or hidden. My memos provided me an opportunity to give thought to why I took a certain
approach or what I saw in the data. In reviewing my memos, I discussed my internal
struggle of not defining health-related information because I wanted participants to freely
interpret it as they discussed their own experiences with searching for health information.

152

Analyzing and reviewing the participants’ answers has made me realize the importance of
understanding the patterns of information behaviors of African American athletes.
Race and ethnicity served as my motivation for my research project. My
experiences with race and many more served as a background when I conducted
interviews, collected data, and selected a mixed-method approach. This method
confirmed my own assumption about my research approach and identity. While
conducting face-to-face interviews, eliciting thoughtful substantive responses about race
proved to be challenging at times. This was the first experience of being interviewed
asking about their athletic, racial identities, and their health information-seeking
behaviors. In becoming an accomplished qualitative researcher, I often had to follow up
with participants’ answers in the interviews by asking participants to give me an example.
My most challenging interview was with Tracy. Tracy found it extremely challenging to
answer what it meant to him to be African American. After long pauses, Tracy admitted
that his family upbringing did not cultivate his racial heritage, daily. This interview was
challenging because in my household, our racial identity was always discussed and the
focal point of our daily conversation. It is my hope that my interaction with participants
will carry into their everyday interactions with others.
Librarians can play a significant role in the small world of African American male
athletes by filling an information gap. Most of the athletes admitted not utilizing libraries
to find answers to their health-related questions. This study is relevant for not only
promoting the study instruments for studying information behaviors of a marginalized
population, but for understanding the health information needs and behaviors of young
African American athletes not affiliated with a school and/or university and what

153

experiences or problems they might face.

individuals' score on the item. Next, average the scores for each of the items within a
particular subscale. DO NOT CREATE A SUM SCORE FOR THE ENTIRE SCALE.
Because the MIBI is based on multidimensional conceptualization of racial identity, a
composite score from the entire scale is inappropriate.
