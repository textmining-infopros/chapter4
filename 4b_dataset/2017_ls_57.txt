ABSTRACT
The environment in which higher education institutions are situated has been
impacted by a number of disruptive forces since the early 1990s, including
acceleration in the capability of information technology (Beagle, 2006; Bennett,
2003; Foster, 2014), changing attitudes about learning pedagogy (Barr & Tagg,
1995), and calls for accountability from government and the public (Appleton,
Stevenson, & Boden, 2011; Forrest & Bostick, 2013). Innovative leaders in
academic librarianship have been empowered by their institutions to lead efforts
to create transformative library learning spaces that can effectively leverage the
opportunities presented through these disruptions to aid the institution in meeting
its goals, now and in the future.
The theoretical framework for this study was grounded in planned (Lewin, 1951)
and emergent change (Bess & Dee, 2012; Burnes, 2004, Leslie, 1996) theories,
which are both needed to foster sustainable and transformative outcomes
(Mossop, 2013). The following research question guided this study:
How do organizational leaders experience engagement with stakeholders during
the creation of library learning spaces, from visioning through planning,
implementation and evaluation?
This basic, interpretive, qualitative study employed individual, semi-structured
interviews with (N=11) library leaders who possessed primary responsibility for
leading others to facilitate creation of library learning spaces at their institution.
Projects serving as subjects for the study were completed between 2011 and
2016. Leader subjects were identified through intentional and emergent
sampling. Themes were inductively identified through open and axial coding
methods (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Artifacts related to the library space projects
were analyzed to corroborate findings. Elite interviews with (N=2) professionals
from varied backgrounds who have expert knowledge on library learning space
design were implemented to integrate additional perspectives into findings.
Five principal findings were identified that framed the process of leadership
engagement through a library space project: 1) Input: Leadership Characteristics
& Project Ignition; 2) Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, & Needs; 3)
Building on Relational Capital; 4) Persistence through Planned Change; and 5)
Maintaining Sustainable Spaces. This study may contribute a greater
understanding of leadership requirements for library space design projects, as
well as identify activities associated with project success.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since the early 1990s, innovative leaders in librarianship in higher education have
initiated the creation of learning spaces that represent the pivot of a library’s primary
role from housing physical collections towards fostering environments for self-directed
learning and knowledge creation (Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003, 2007, 2015; Head,
2016; Heitsch & Holley, 2011; Somerville, 2015b; Wilson, 2012). Contributing factors
that catalyzed the emphasis on a learning-centered space design include the everincreasing capacity of information technology (Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003; Foster,
2014), the shift in attitudes for how learning should be facilitated at higher education
institutions (Barr & Tagg, 1995), and greater demands for higher education to clearly
demonstrate their value to students, their families, and the public (Appleton, Stevenson,
& Boden, 2011; Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Thomas, Horne, Jacobson & Anson, 2015;
Walker & Smith, 2013). As students began to have access to a bounty of information
online without an intermediary, librarians brought together campus stakeholders and
external experts to leverage the changing environment and heightened expectations to
create high-tech, high-touch environments.
The Information Commons (IC) was the first design response to the changing
environment, integrating library and information technology resources, personnel, and
services (Beagle, 2006, 2012; Forrest & Halbert, 2009). The foundation of the IC was
intentional connections between library and information technology departments to
provide students with cross-trained staff, technology support, and access to relevant
software to support learning (Beagle, 2012; Head, 2016). Early in the first decade of the
2000s, Learning Commons (LC) emerged as the next phase of library space design.

2

LCs placed greater emphasis on alignment with institutional goals and collaboration with
non-library service partners, requiring that the service profile in the space no longer be
library-centric (Beagle, 2006, 2012; Head, 2016; Somerville & Harlan, 2008). Institutions
create LCs to promote far-reaching and transformational change on their campuses
(Beagle, 2006, 2012). The most current library design phase is Library Learning
Spaces, the third iteration of the commons concept, for which the priority is to connect
“students to technology, information, and co-curricular learning- learning that
deliberately compliments the formal classroom activities, programs, and experiences
that contribute to student learning” (Head, 2016, p. 9).
While commons terminology is dominant in literature, definitions and language from
scholars and practitioners vary (Lippincott, 2010). Other new library space initiatives
include maker spaces, knowledge commons, communication commons, and research
commons (Browndorf, 2014; Thomas et al., 2015; Wilson, 2012). Layout, services, and
activities in the spaces are prioritized based on the mission and needs of the greater
higher education institution (Bennett, 2015; Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Head, 2016). For
any of these projects, library leaders necessarily “create libraries that, themselves,
learn. One key concept is library as place must be self-organizing…sufficiently flexible
to meet changing space needs” (Freeman, 2005, p. 4).
Problem Statement
Academic libraries initiating design of library learning spaces find themselves
considering how they “can provide facilities that both foster learning and meet the
changing needs of students and faculty” (Head, 2016, p. 4). Activities leaders engage in
towards fulfilling this aim include “strategic collaborations, professional retoolings,

3

planning processes, research allocation, service modeling, [development of] information
strategies, building designs [and] staff development” (Somerville & Harlan, 2008, p. 5).
How these plans are carried out at each library is unique to its respective institution.
Collaborators, resources, layout, and goals ought to be guided by an institution’s greater
mission and academic programs (Heitsch & Holley, 2011; Thomas et al., 2015). They
harness potential to be a tool that bolsters one of the ultimate goals in institutions of
higher education, that is, promoting persistence and graduation of its students through
support of student learning, as well as providing a welcoming space that serves as
students’ ‘third place’ after home and work (Walker & Smith, 2013). Sociologists
describe ‘third place’ as a location that hosts “regular voluntary, anticipated gatherings
of individuals” (Oldenburg, 1989, p. 16). Other institutional goals that can be leveraged
through innovative library space design include fostering job-related skills to enhance
student employability (Schopfield, Roche, & Hubert, 2015) and supporting faculty
teaching and research productivity (Boosinger et al., 2016; Kreitz, 2015; Oakleaf, 2010).
Collaborators in the planning and development of library learning spaces include
architects; library consultants; faculty; other administrative leaders, including provosts
and presidents; alumni; development officers; trustees of the institution; and service
partners that may include information technology, academic support services, career
development, and faculty development specialists (Andrews & Wright, 2015; Bruns,
Brantly, & Duffin, 2015; Dryden & Goldstein, 2013; Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Head, 2016;
Howard & Somerville, 2014; Kreitz, 2015; Malenfant, 2011; Somerville, 2015b).
Much of the literature on the topic of creating or reconfiguring library space is
focused on intra-institutional design process descriptions (Bailin, Bouchey, Nelson, &

4

Sherriff, 2014; Barratt & White, 2010; Dryden & Goldstein, 2013; Schmidt & Kaufman,
2007), student user studies, or service assessments (Chan & Wong, 2012; Somerville &
Collins, 2008; Thomas et al., 2015). Head’s (2016) research study, Planning and
Designing Learning Spaces through Project Information Literacy, sought to tend to a
gap of “relevant and up-to-date studies that identify useful solutions and best practices
from a group of projects” (p. 5). She and her team interviewed 49 stakeholders
representing 22 library learning space projects. Works that seek to identify change
management and collaboration with stakeholders through library space planning
projects include Howard and Somerville’s (2014) description of engaging partners
through active design activities led by architects, and Kreitz’s (2015) dissertation on
library change management experiences of library directors and other institutional
leaders through library transformations at four liberal arts colleges. Despite the
emergence of recent literature on change management in academic libraries, there is a
paucity of published research studies on understanding how leaders experience the
change, with the focus on relationships with institutional and external stakeholders.
A goal of effective library space design projects is for the initial and iterative product
to represent and provide transformative change. Library learning spaces can enhance
an institution’s capacity to transform students by providing physical resources and
services to promote knowledge creation in predominantly informal learning
environments (Head, 2016). The framework to guide this process- that is, to create a
space that transforms the community it serves, in the present and in the context of an
uncertain future – must be transformative. Mossop (2013) offered a definition of
transformational change as a culmination of a planned strategy of change, combining

5

cultural, incremental, and organizational change. Attention to the needs of users as
environmental factors evolve is necessary for successful change (Association of
Research Libraries, 2010; Ball & Pereira-Pujol, 2015; Forrest & Bostick, 2013). As the
mission of 21st century academic library outcomes should not library-focused, leaders
need to engage others responsible for fulfilling its goals, as well as those that can help
leverage success in creating space for learning (Beagle, 2012; Bennett, 2015;
Boosinger et al, 2016; Simmons-Wilburn, Donovan, & Bender, 2008; Somerville,
2015b). Leadership engagement with stakeholders can relate to the effectiveness of
change on campus in the short and long term (Eby, Adams, Russell, & Gaby, 2000;
Katsaros, Tsirikas, & Bani, 2014).
Tasks organizational leaders encounter as they facilitate change through creation or
re-working of library learning spaces may include restructuring of reporting lines,
redesign of job responsibilities, managing redistribution of resources among library and
non-library groups, and facilitating a new mission of service (Beagle, 2010). Creating
common ground with campus constituents, including faculty and alumni, about what a
21st century academic library should look like and provide for users, may be challenging
for library leaders (Malenfant, 2011). Engagement with donors and architects is
common, especially if the space design plan is part of a comprehensive building
renovation, or creation of a completely new facility (Bennett, 2003; Thomas et al., 2015;
Walker & Smith, 2013). The purpose of this study is to gain deeper understanding of an
organizational leader’s role and experience through the creation of innovative library
learning space. Outcomes may contribute a new perspective to the existing literature on
change management in academic libraries. Themes identified across data through

6

analysis can enhance leaders’ capacity to exploit all potential considerations and
challenges as they prepare new library space design plans, or similar organizational
change, on their own campuses. They may also enable presidents and provosts to
identify leadership qualities and experiences to look for when identifying an ideal person
to facilitate a library learning space design project.
Research Question
This study sought to contribute to the growing body of change literature in academic
librarianship. This research explored constructed experience of leaders during recent
library space planning initiatives through the following research question:
How do organizational leaders experience engagement with stakeholders during the
creation of library learning spaces, from visioning through planning, implementation and
evaluation?

Background of Study
History and context of library space paradigms
The emphasis on academic library learning space design was a response to the
emergence of the library as space movement, starting in the 1980s, when some
libraries began to transition towards a more user-centric and learning centered model of
public services (Bennett, 2007; Heitsch & Holley, 2011). Information became “plentiful,
even overabundant, but its increasingly electronic nature [allowed] libraries to reappropriate space that had been previously occupied by shelving and use it for more
user-centric purposes“ (Bennett, 2007, p. 188). Another catalyst was a paradigm shift in
higher education, as described in a seminal article by Barr and Tagg (1995), which
charged a change in mission at institutions from providing instruction to producing
learning. The mission of higher education should be to produce learning with each

7

individual student “by whatever means work best” (p. 13). Barr and Tagg (1995)
described the Learning Paradigm as aspirational, envisioning the institution itself as a
learner; over time, “it continuously learns how to produce more learning with each
graduating class, each entering student” (p. 13). Educators operationalized this
philosophical change by placing greater emphasis on active learning, diversifying
projects for coursework that focused more frequently on real world issues, and
promoting more social learning through group work (Bennett, 2007; Somerville &
Collins, 2008; Thomas el al., 2015).
The moniker “commons” is often integrated into the names of the new spaces; the
term is borrowed from historical use of naming lands and resources that were shared
and maintained by many people (Bollier, 2004; Browndorf, 2014). The first iteration of
new library learning spaces was the Information Commons (IC), a “cluster of network
access points and associated [information technology] tools situated in the context of
physical, digital, human, and social resources organized in support of learning” (Beagle,
2006, p. xviii). The first known ICs were the Information Commons at the University of
Southern California and the Information Arcade at the University of Iowa, both opening
in the early 1990s. They featured computers and other hardware, as well as support
desks serviced by both the library and information technology units, broadening staff
ability to address questions and concerns brought by their users. Furniture
arrangements in early ICs were static, akin to classrooms, though many later were
arranged to encourage student information sharing and collaboration (Lippincott, 2010).
While an IC offers a continuum of service, it is still ultimately library-centric and its focus
is on technology and learning support (Beagle, 2012; Head, 2016; Solberg, 2011). The

8

Learning Commons (LC) concept is an evolution of the IC, representing a space more
centered on self-directed learning and the creation of knowledge; it “goes beyond the
traditional environment that fosters the transmission of information from staff to patron”
(Bailey & Tierney, 2008, p. 2).
Many characteristics of an LC are widely agreed upon: LC development should align
with the mission and vision of the institution (Bailey & Tierney, 2008; Dryden &
Goldstein, 2012; Lippincott, 2010); enhanced relationships inform LC planning and
services (Head, 2016); LCs should encourage learning as a social, collaborative
process (Beagle, 2012; Thomas et al., 2015); and they should offer conveniences to
students including 24/7 service and on-site cafes (Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007). The
mission of the LC is far-reaching across campus, and more likely to integrate resources
that usually operate outside of library walls, such as faculty development centers and
tutoring services (Beagle, 2012; Lee & Schottenfeld, 2014).
Head (2016) identified Library Learning Spaces as the most current space design
phase. Characteristics of learning spaces include versatility to meet the needs of
various activities that may occur, and deliberate in complementing “holistic learning that
may occur both inside and outside of the classroom” (p. 9). The tenets of the model
suggest that libraries need to understand how students learn, and then create
appropriate environments anywhere a student may choose to work (Montgomery,
2014). Impact of these spaces on formal and informal learning becomes more
prominent as “pedagogical practices in higher education start to move away from the
traditional, leader-centered approach to a more flexible, student-centered approach”
(Turner et al., 2013, p. 231). While scholars have identified components of unique

9

models, characteristics in practice may overlap and use other names (Lippincott, 2010;
Somerville & Harlan, 2008).
The value of academic libraries
Ongoing conversations about library impact reflect how “advancements in
technology, the increased cost of higher education, an aging library workforce, and a
serious economic downturn have all converged to challenge how libraries engage in
their academic support work” (Franklin, 2009, p. 496). Like all campus units, libraries
must prove return on investment (ROI) through impact on facilities, staff performance,
collection, as well as faculty and student success. The mission of transformative, 21 st
century libraries is to fulfill the overarching goals of the institution, even those that are
traditionally beyond library scope (Simmons-Wilburn, Donovan, & Bender, 2008).
Library learning spaces represent best practices as defined by library scholars if they
align with their aspirant institutional mission (Thomas et al., 2015). Avenues to achieve
this outcome include leveraging the role of librarians in supporting enrollment,
facilitating student engagement, learning, creativity, and innovation, as well as serving
as a gateway for faculty collaboration and providing support of their teaching, learning,
and research efforts (Bieraugel & Neill, 2017; Oakleaf, 2010). A library can support
students’ persistence at the institution; studies focused on this topic include Murray,
Ireland, and Hackathorn’s (2016) examination of “library use or nonuse data of
individuals and correlating that data with their specific freshman status” (p. 634). They
concluded that at their institution,” freshman [and sophomore] library use in the spring
semester positively predicted retention in the subsequent fall semester” (p. 638). The
University of Tennessee used revitalized library space as a tool to improve low retention

10

rates through student engagement. In a recent survey, results “showed that over 70% of
students indicated that the [library’s] commons made them feel more involved at the
university” (Walker & Smith, 2013, p. 2). The focus of the University of Iowa’s LC
transition was to increase the quality of learning spaces not just at the physical library,
but across campus, and to link student engagement with the LC to student success and
retention (Thomas et al., 2015).
Libraries provide informal learning spaces for students; unlike the classroom, they “do
not have a prescribed course or class dictating the learning” (Montgomery, 2014, p. 70).
While the goal of a first-generation IC design would be to find space and capacity to
house computers and software, often manifesting as transmission style classrooms,
“enhanced access had made it possible to implement a learning paradigm that
emphasizes active learning, formative assessment, social engagement, mobility, and
multiple paths through content” (Brown & Long, 2006, p. 9.2). Library planners are
performing more research to enhance understanding of educational pedagogy and the
needs of their students specifically in informing designs (Dryden & Goldstein, 2013;
Thomas et al., 2015).
Perception of the role of the academic library from faculty has shifted in recent years.
The Ithaka Faculty Survey, which measures faculty perception and engagement with
libraries, between 2009 and 2012 identified a pivot in faculty view of the library role
away from buyer and archive towards a supportive gateway for collaboration, teaching,
learning, and research (Schonfeld & Houseright, 2009; Schonfeld, Wulfson, &
Houseright, 2012). A current multi-library assessment project, LibValue, is modeling
ROI measurement strategies to demonstrate the financial value of libraries to their

11

institution by capturing library capacity to help faculty secure grant and other research
funds (Kingma & McClure, 2015).
Library leaders have been called to do more to document their value to student
learning and institutional goals more systematically (Oakleaf, 2010), and at many
academic libraries planning and evaluation of new library learning spaces has
contributed to their response. Academic libraries are an ideal vehicle for providing value
as leaders see departments collaborating to support the institutional mission (Ferer,
2012), and they are employing a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods to
ascertain effectiveness (Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007; Somerville & Collins, 2008; Thomas
et al., 2015; Walker & Smith, 2013).
Library space design as planned and emergent change
The goal of effective library space design projects is for the initial and iterative
product to represent and provide transformational change. Library learning space
provides capacity to transform students through providing physical resources and
services to promote knowledge creation in predominantly informal learning
environments. The framework to guide this process- that is, to create a space that
transforms – must be transformative. The initial creation and sustainability of an
academic library represent principles of planned and emergent change (Mossop, 2013).
Planned change represents thoughtful efforts to enhance organizational processes
through innovation based on scientific knowledge (Bartunek & Woodman, 2015).
Foundations of decision making may be grounded in institutional research,
accreditation, self-studies, or program reviews. Modern scholars describe change as
social construction, ignited by dissatisfaction or frustration, and facilitated by new

12

standards of judgment or evaluation, and a systemic and conversational process
(Schein, 1996; Mantere, Schildt, & Sillince, 2012). Emergent change refers to the
ongoing adjustments people make in “their everyday work practices in response to local
conditions” (Bess & Dee, 2012, p. 808). The framework recognizes the potential for
innovation in all levels of the organization, and that change is more likely to emerge
among faculty and staff who are engaging with students every day (Leslie, 1996).
Institutions planning a library learning space initiative perform a variety of activities to
inform action. Leaders at the University of Iowa completed research on educational
pedagogy to inform the initial iteration of their LC in 2013 (Thomas et al., 2015). The
University of Connecticut sought to develop LCs for each of their regional campuses
that accomplished supporting their respective missions while making efficient use of
available resources and physical space. They developed a survey in an effort to
understand the student learning culture at each institution (Dryden & Goldstein, 2013).
Foster (2014) advocated for wider participation through library space initiatives,
calling for integration of participatory design methods, referring to a “way of sharing
information and authority in the design of technology, spaces, services, and resources
in all kinds of work places” (p. 3). She described a variety of ways stakeholders were
included through planning at the University of Maryland library system, including
engaging architecture students for assistance, and bringing in an anthropologist to
facilitate user usage. An inclusive planning team included architects, institutional
leaders, faculty, library personnel, and students that reached out farther into the
community to gather “information about work practices and purposes from a large
number of faculty members, staff, and students spread across various divisions and

13

departments” (p. 4). Participatory design was also used at Auburn University, where
multiple methods were used to identify faculty perceptions of work activities that support
student success in the classroom, and understand how students used specific spaces in
the library (Boosinger et al., 2016).
Howard and Somerville (2014) described co-design and participatory action research
design initiatives at Auraria Library at the University of Colorado, Denver through two
design charrettes focused on re-imagining library spaces and landscape architecture
plans for library courtyard spaces. Charettes are condensed co-design workshops
designed to identify creative solutions to specific design problems (Howard &
Somerville, 2014). In an academic library context, they are facilitated by design experts
but include librarians, stakeholders, and other interested parties.
Emergent change is central to the sustainability of an effective 21 st century academic
library, as proponents assert that it cannot be built and left untended (Beagle, 2006,
2012; Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Sinclair, 2007). Planners must understand the extent to
which a recently renovated space meets the needs of users (Dryden & Goldstein, 2012;
Lippincott, 2010; Seal, 2014; Thomas et al., 2015). The dynamic interweaving of
services and tools requires summative and formative evaluation towards constant
rethinking of services and space (Church, 2005). The most successful projects that
have existed for ten years or more reflect “customization...which must continue to
adapt...appropriate to particular campus circumstances in order to meet changing
circumstances and harness technological advances” (Somerville & Collins, 2008, p.
815). Students will use facilities, resources, and staff expertise differently as learning
pedagogies change and technological capabilities increase, evolving the expectations of

14

learning resources. Methods for identifying ongoing areas for reconsideration include
collecting information about student usage through formal assessments, staff
observation, and solicitation of feedback from faculty (Beagle, 2012; Dryden &
Goldstein, 2012; Lippincott, 2010; Thomas et al., 2015). Other challenges in keeping
libraries current include strategic planning updates and budgetary challenges.
Some institutions pursue an emergent change model from the beginning for their
library space projects to create capacity for an organic process inspired by previous
steps (Bailin, Bouchey, Nelson, & Sherriff, 2014; Bailey, 2010). The Library +
COMMONS at Providence College intentionally implemented a tiered plan described as
“gradual, informal, incremental, an almost stealth approach” (Bailey, 2010, p. 3). The
commons was constructed piece-by-piece over several years, integrating services from
non-library partners informally rather than creating contractual, formal alliances. Library
organizations also created tools to help institutions consider future, uncertain
circumstances when facilitating new library space designs. The Association of Research
Libraries (2010) created a scenario planning toolbox presenting cultural uncertainties
that may unfold over a 20-year period to assist librarians and partners workshop
through potential realities to promote thoughtful, long-term planning.
Leadership interaction with campus stakeholders during a transformation
Studies bringing focus to leadership behaviors, activities, and traits through library
space planning is limited but becoming more prominent in recent years (Head, 2016;
Howard & Somerville, 2014; Kreitz, 2015; Malenfant, 2011; Somerville, 2015a, 2015b;
Wilson, 2012). Kreitz’s (2015) dissertation represents an effort to identify leadership
experiences from library directors and other senior leaders through library

15

transformations at liberal arts colleges. Somerville (2015a) described essential
relationships with senior administrators, board members, donors and a Government
Relations team required to secure funding for renovations as the University Librarian for
Auraria Library at the University of Colorado, Denver.
Facilitation of a shared vision is necessary for developing and implementing a
successful a change project (Kezar, 2001; Kreitz, 2015). Transformational leadership is
“a process that changes and transforms people is concerned with emotions,
values…standards, and long-term goals” (Northouse, 2013, p. 185). Literature on
transformational library leadership is limited, descriptive planning reports identify
transformational behaviors and actions initiated by library leaders to plan, implement,
and sustain change projects (Andrews & Wright, 2015; Kreitz, 2015; Thomas et al.,
2015; Walker & Smith, 2013). Researchers described the importance of a leader in
understanding how library goals can align with institutional mission, and then be able to
articulate how the library can be accountable to that mission (Forrest & Bostick, 2013;
Henrich, 2013; Howard & Somerville, 2014; Kreitz, 2015; Thomas et al., 2015; Umbach
& Wawrzynski, 2005; Walker & Smith, 2013). Leaders need to foster and maintain
cross-campus relationships with campus partners before, during, and after the
completed construction of the space project in order to solicit trust and buy-in, identify
additional financial sources, create collaborative partnerships with non-library units who
will be providing services, and fulfill institutional goals (Andrews & Wright, 2015; Bruns,
Brantley, & Duffin, 2015; Chan & Wong, 2013; Head, 2016; Malenfant, 2011;
Somerville, 2015b). Leaders need to cultivate a culture of change so transformed space
can be sustainable and thus adjusted as needed (Head, 2016; Montgomery, 2015;

16

Neal, 2014). Kreitz (2015) also identified resilience, emotional intelligence, contextual
intelligence, and political acumen as required by leaders to facilitate successful change
in academic libraries.
Definition of Terms
Information Commons (IC)

A commons taxonomy that integrates some or all
Library and Information Technology services.
Some institutions and scholars use this term
interchangeably with Learning Commons
(Lippincott, 2010).

Learning Commons (LC)

Library-hosted space that integrates resources
and/or staff with one or more non-library partners
for the purpose of fostering productive learning
environments to higher education institutional
stakeholders (Beagle, 2006, 2012; Somerville &
Collins, 2008).

Library Learning Spaces

A third generation Commons, represents the
current wave of library space design fostered to
emphasize holistic learning and be versatile to
serve diverse activities that may occur there.
Library learning spaces may have “active
learning classrooms, immersive media labs, or
digital training classrooms with the latest
software” (Head, 2016, p. 9). The term may also
be used as an overarching term identifying
spaces that support or facilitate learning in
academic libraries that include ICs, LCs, etc.

Integrated services

Programs, activities, and/or resources offered
through collaboration of two or more departments
(Beagle, 2012; Bennett, 2003).

Information technology

Department that provides support, equipment,
and training to campus stakeholders related to
any technology needs; or, can be used to
generally refer to technology or digital resources

17

that support or facilitate learning (Beagle, 2012;
Lippincott, 2010).
Transformational change

The product of a “planned strategy of change,
combining cultural, incremental, and
organizational change” (Mossop, 2013, p. 7).

Planned change

Thoughtful efforts to enhance organizational
processes through innovation based on scientific
knowledge, frequently identified by Lewin’s
(1951) framework of unfreezing, changing, and
freezing organizations.

Emergent change

Organizational change informed by ongoing
adjustments people make in “their everyday work
practices in response to local conditions” (Bess &
Dee, 2012, p. 800).

Memorandum of understanding
(MOU)

Document used between offices to outline the
length of a partnership agreement, or
compatibility issues such as service philosophy
or signage (Dewey, 2008a; Head, 2016).

Participatory design

A planning strategy that equitably includes
designers and users (Foster, 2013, 2014;
Somerville, 2015b; Somerville & Collins, 2008).

Methodology
Research design
As understanding how participating leader subjects constructed meaning and
experienced a library learning space design process was desired, a qualitative design
was used in this study (Merriam, 2002). A basic interpretive design was employed in
order to identify common and unique themes across the leaders' stories, relationships,
perspectives, feelings, and worldviews within the phenomenon experienced (Merriam &
Tisdell, 2016). While phenomenology "as a school of philosophical thought underpins all

18

qualitative research" (Merriam, 2002, p. 7), a phenomenological dimension was sought
to emphasize feelings and incidents that illustrated the participants' experience through
the phenomenon. This dimension was integrated through prompts developed partially
based on Moustakas' (1994) instrumentation recommendations, asking the participant
to elaborate on their perceptions or feelings associated with the events they described.
Participants were organizational leaders who provided direct leadership to a library
space planning project on their campus; they were senior academic library leaders from
four-year private and public colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.
Space projects featured in the study were initially completed between 2011 and 2016,
and were either renovations of existing physical space, or creation of a completely new
library building. Leader subjects interviewed were employed in their position before, or
during the early planning stage of the space project identified for the study. Data were
collected using semi-structured interviews with participants who were asked to provide a
detailed description of the event experienced.
Additional, independent data sources were identified to corroborate findings from the
initial, individual interviews. Other data collected for this study included documents and
media connected or related to the library learning spaces that were the subjects of the
interviews. An analysis of associated documents can enrich understanding of the
context in which the phenomenon experienced and facilitated by the leader took place
(Bowen, 2009). Elite interviews with individuals with expert knowledge on the topic of
library space design were also included as a data source, employed after initial data
analysis of the other two sources was completed.

19

Sampling
Solicitation of participants was purposeful, identified through correspondence with
library scholar-practitioners who have expert knowledge of recent domestic and
international library learning space projects in order to identify “information rich key
informants” (Patton, 2015, p. 298). Additional criteria for participation in the study
included an intense interest in understanding the nature and meaning of the change
they experienced, and willingness to participate in an initial lengthy interview with the
possibility of a follow-up conversation (Moustakas, 1994). Identified leaders were
contacted by e-mail individually. Embedded in this message was an explanation of the
study, information indicating the individual who identified them as qualified with potential
interest for engaging in the research, a video providing rationale for selection of the
topic, and an invitation to participate in the study (Appendix A). Once prospective
participants indicated interest, they were asked to engage in a preliminary ten-minute
phone conversation (or e-mail conversation if required by the participant) to clarify the
purpose of the study, ensure the leader subject was eligible to participate based on
sampling guidelines (Moustakas, 1994), and to schedule the one-hour interview. As
interviews were completed, emergent sampling was used to identify additional qualified
participants. Interviews were conducted until saturation was achieved. Eleven (N=11)
leader subjects were interviewed, representing ten library space design projects. The
elite interview participants were also selected purposefully, based on experiences
identified through a review of related literature. Prospective elite subjects were solicited
via individual e-mail communication. An invitation to participate included information

20

about the study and the reason the prospective elite participant would add a unique
perspective to the research (Appendix B)
Instrumentation
Participants were provided preliminary information about the study through the initial
e-mail and follow-up phone conversation in order to enhance their capacity “to
immerse…in incidents that stood out in the experience” (Moustakas, 1994, p. 108). A
final e-mail message was sent prior to the interview that included the consent form
(Appendix C), central research question, short demographic questionnaire (Appendix
D), and information about accessing the video interview. On the day of the interview,
once participants consented to participate, they were again provided with detailed
instructions about the interview process to ensure they understood expectations. A
guide was developed and included a central question as well as a series of probes that
were available if needed (Appendix E). The probes encouraged participants to describe
events in greater detail when necessary, or to ask to elaborate on their perceptions or
feelings of the events identified. The “importance of [self-reporting] was emphasized so
that the research participant felt his or her contributions were valued as how knowledge
on the topic and as illumination of meanings inherent in the question” (Moustakas, 1994,
p. 110). Interview questions and probes were pilot tested with librarians who were not
included in the study in order to refine the instrument, frame questions, assess the
degree of observer bias, and adapt research procedures (Creswell, 2013). The elite
participants also consented to participate by signing an informed consent form, and then
an interview time was scheduled. An elite interview guide was developed based on

21

themes that emerged through the individual interviews and document analysis
(Appendix F).
Data collection
As the sample included academic libraries across the United States and Canada,
online video conferencing software was used to allow completion of interviews remotely.
Participants in New England were offered the possibility to schedule an in-person
meeting on their campus. One interview was completed in person. Participants engaged
in the interviews in a private space, usually in their office or home. Consent was
obtained through review and signature of a consent form, administered online, which
was approved by the researcher’s institutional human subjects review board. Each
participant also completed a short questionnaire, identifying characteristics about their
school’s size and Carnegie Classification, as well as information about the participant’s
longevity in the leadership role at the academic library that is the subject of the study, in
order to provide context for the analysis based on leader or higher education
institutional characteristics. Before the interview began, the participant learned the
purpose of the study, approximate time needed to complete the interview, and stated
understanding for the plans for using the outcome from the interview by hearing an
abbreviated copy of the study proposal (Creswell, 2013). As only a short conversation
was shared with each participant prior to the interview, each began with a social
conversation, aimed at cultivating a trusting atmosphere (Creswell, 2013). Each
participant was encouraged to take a few moments to place themselves within the
experience before starting to describe it fully (Moustakas, 1994).

22

A research guide was developed in advance to promote a “comprehensive account
of the person’s experience of the phenomenon" (Moustakas, 1994, p. 114). An
anchoring initial question launched the conversation that was consistent through each
interview. Prompts were prepared ahead of time to capture data necessary to
understand the phenomenon being explored (Merriam, 2002). Prompts were informed
by a review of the literature that identified potential areas of exploration, as well as
Moustakas' (1994) recommendations, integrated to provide a phenomenological
dimension of understanding to the narrative of the organizational leader's experience
through the library space design process (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). As leaders were
provided flexibility to identify what was most important to them as they experienced the
phenomenon, prompts were used, adapted, or not used at all based on the data
provided through the interview, and new follow-up questions were created and
integrated as required. Participants understood that they were able to end the interview
at any time.
Artifacts related to the space project that were the subjects of the study were
solicited for analysis (Appendix G). Initial documents and media were identified from the
Internet, and leader subjects were asked to provide additional documentation, with an
emphasis on information produced by or directed to internal audiences. Artifacts
identified included press releases, student and local news articles; library
communication with stakeholders via blogs, social media, library and institutional
strategic plans, and internal planning documents.

23

Data analysis
Once each interview was conducted and recorded, recordings were transcribed to
provide a foundation for analysis of the data. Transcripts and recordings were reviewed
in order to reflect on the overall meaning of each interview as well as the ideas and tone
by which they were expressed (Creswell, 1994). Initial observations were recorded on
each cover sheet and through the margins of the text. Next, the data were coded, that is
the "process of organizing the data by bracketing [text]" (Creswell, 1994, p. 198) and
writing words or phrases representing text in the margins. An open coding process
began in an effort to be expansive and open to information that may have been useful
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Recurring themes in the data were identified through
comparative analysis, and grouped into categories. Axial and analytical coding informed
this process. Categories were inductively created from units across data, then tested
and confirmed using alternately inductive and deductive analysis (Merriam & Tisdell,
2016).
For the analysis of artifacts, documents and other media were annotated through an
initial review, and “pertinent information…[was separated] from that which was not
pertinent” (Bowen, 2009, p. 32). Codes developed through the interviews were applied
through a second, more careful review of the data. Codes were assigned based on
content and the target audience of the artifacts. Codes and themes from the initial
interviews were also applied to data analysis for the elite interviews.
Trustworthiness
Information about professional background and general motivation for engaging in
this research was shared with participants during initial and subsequent

24

correspondence (Patton, 2015). Triangulation strategies were identified to strengthen
reliability of findings and interpretation (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Three independent data
sources were sought and included. Peer debriefing was employed with a non-participant
librarian to review codes and preliminary findings, as well as a draft of the conceptual
map (Appendix H). Member checking was used, as initial results identified after analysis
were shared back with participants to be reviewed for accuracy (Merriam & Tisdell,
2016). A reflexive journal was started immediately after data collection in order to reflect
on decisions made through the process, as well as to begin a real-time account of
reflections, decisions, questions encountered through data analysis and interpretation
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). A pilot of the primary interview question and available
prompts were tested for bias and revised. Rich, thick description was used to present
findings, and discrepant data to the common themes identified are also presented
(Creswell, 2013).

Limitations
The researcher identified the following as possible limitations of the study:
1.

By design, library design projects at each institution reflect varying
institutional priorities that cannot be controlled for in the study (Beagle, 2006;
Bennett, 2003).

2.

Librarians may or may not have had experience with engaging with
stakeholders prior to the library transformation that is a subject of the study.

3.

Most participants were not familiar with the researcher, and there is no way
to determine if each individual was completely forthcoming. While prolonged
exposure to prospective participants was not possible, efforts to build rapport
were constructed.

4.

The sample was broadened to include both private and public four-year
institutions of any size. Convenient possibilities for involvement, including

25

meeting at the participant’s institution and offering an online conferencing
option, were included to enhance opportunities for participation.
5.

Prior knowledge and attitudes of a researcher can influence perception and
identification of meaning units. There was no “objective… units, as they are
constituted as a result of the…sensitivity that the researcher brings to the
task” (Giorgi, 2009, p. 130). Perfect replication of the study is unlikely.
Delimitations

This research explored the experiences of organizational leaders who oversee
academic libraries that engaged in a recent library space design project. The following
issues are beyond the scope of this study:
1.

The perspectives of other librarians, as well as personnel in non-library
subgroups that may be involved in the library transition were not included in
this study.

2.

The specificity of the sample prohibits generalizing results to all academic
librarians who experience leadership of a library space design project;
however, a thick description of the sites was included, so that leaders
applying these results can appropriately consider institutional characteristics.
Resulting actions

The role of the academic library at an institution of higher education in the 21st
century includes providing space, services, and tools to facilitate learning, creating
conditions to support student success and persistence. When done well, decisions are
facilitated by a leader but made in collaboration with stakeholders including students,
faculty, other senior leaders, donors, and architects. Literature from the last few years
has brought greater focus to change leadership and engagement with stakeholders
through library space design projects (Head, 2016; Howard & Somerville, 2014; Kreitz,
2015; Malenfant, 2011; Somerville, 2015b; Wilson, 2012). This research study sought to
contribute through bringing greater focus on the constructed experience of leaders

26

through planning, design, implementation, and evaluation of a successful library space
design project as defined by peers in librarianship.
This qualitative, basic interpretive study identified themes representing how
organizational leaders experienced dynamic academic library learning space design
projects at their institutions. Limited research exists using qualitative methods that
focused on leadership experience at multiple institutions. This study may contribute to
the literature a greater understanding of leadership requirements for library space
design projects, as well as identify actions associated with project success (Katsaros,
Tsirikas, & Bani, 2014). These results may also inform leaders of how they may
effectively consider the needs of stakeholders through the change, or inspire hiring
processes for library directors, deans, or other leaders to orchestrate a library learning
space project. Recommendations for future research were also identified.

27

II. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
Introduction
Over the last 25 years, innovative higher education organizational leaders have lead
a pivot on the perspective of academic library space from one as a container of physical
resources to a dynamic multimedia environment that facilitates creation of learning
(Andrews & Wright, 2015; Bennett, 2003; Lippincott, 2010; Turner, Welch, & Reynolds,
2013). The 1990s brought the convergence of the information technology revolution
(Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003; Foster, 2014), the constructivist learning paradigm (Barr
& Tagg, 1995), and the rise of a customer-service mindset and growing calls for
accountability in the higher education landscape (Appleton, Stevenson, & Boden, 2011;
Forrest & Bostick, 2013). Administrators and commentators at that time began to
question the role of library as physical space in the face of declining usage statistics, as
more users were turning to internet search engines to access information (Carlson,
2003). Leaders sought to implement changes grounded in understanding the needs and
habits of millennials, also coined Generation Y and the Net Generation (Lippincott,
2010; Somerville & Harlan, 2006).
New academic library space design frameworks emerged, manifesting a mission of
bringing together high-tech and high-touch pedagogies that provide value to student
learning and faculty teaching (Breivik & Gee, 2006). The factors that contributed to this
philosophy shift continue to evolve, and so “the 21st century academic library must
continually re-create itself as a place that fosters curiosity, engagement, and lifelong
learning” (Forrest & Bostick, 2013, p. 140). Leaders must continuously tend to the

28

services and resources of their institution’s academic library (Beagle, 2006, 2012;
Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Sinclair, 2007). As the library is often seen as the academic
center of campus, success in this endeavor relies upon initial and ongoing partnerships
with other senior leaders and stakeholders (Head, 2016; Howard & Somerville, 2014;
Kreitz, 2015; Malenfant, 2011). However, much of the literature related to library space
design consists of accounts on “space planning, design, and implementation as it
applies to a single project and meeting a specific user group’s needs” (Head, 2016, p.
5). More recent literature features leadership strategies used to describe mechanisms
for facilitating collaborative space planning with partners and stakeholders at individual
institutions (Howard & Somerville, 2014; Wilson, 2012). Research out of Project
Information Literacy also highlighted approaches, challenges, and best practices of
academic library space planning via collaborations as perceived by librarians, library
consultants, and architects interviewed representing 22 individual projects (Head,
2016). While more attention is being paid to identifying necessary behaviors, traits, and
activities for planning a sustainable 21st century academic library, missing from the
literature is qualitative research seeking an understanding of the experience leaders
have while engaging with partners through successful library space design projects, as
defined by their peers. This study seeks to address that gap.
The role and value of academic libraries at colleges and universities
The academic library “as place holds a unique position on campus. No other building
can so symbolically and physically represent the academic heart of an institution”
(Somerville & Collins, 2008, p. 806). Libraries are considered informal learning spaces
because unlike the classroom, they “do not have a prescribed course or class dictating

29

the learning” (Montgomery, 2014, p. 70). They can be cultivated as a ‘third place’ for
students. Sociologist Ray Oldenburg (1989) described third place as a “great variety of
places that host the regular, voluntary, informal and happily anticipated gatherings of
individuals beyond the realm of home and work” (p. 16). Librarians possess capacity to
support institutional enrollment goals, facilitate student engagement and learning, and
serve as a gateway for faculty collaboration and support of their teaching, learning, and
research efforts (Oakleaf, 2010). Bieraugel and Neill (2017) asserted that academic
libraries can aspire to foster spaces that encourage creative and innovative thinking,
defining creativity as the ability to identify new and valuable artifacts, and innovation as
the “application of creativity within an organization for practical purposes” (p. 35).
The mission of 21th century libraries is to fulfill the overarching goals of the institution,
even those that are traditionally beyond the library’s scope (Simmons-Wilburn,
Donovan, & Bender, 2008). Learning space can leverage institution’s ability to “[attract
and retain] the best and brightest students who have choices” (Dewey, 2008a, p. 86). A
library can also support students’ persistence at the institution. Studies focused on the
impact of academic libraries on student persistence include Murray, Ireland, and
Hackathorn’s (2016) examination of “library use or nonuse data of individuals and
correlating that data with their specific freshman status” (p. 634). They concluded that at
their institution, “freshman [and sophomore] library use in the spring semester positively
predicted retention in the subsequent fall semester” (p. 638). Soria, Fransen, and
Nackerud (2014) sought to understand how accessing library services impacted
retention of first time, first year students at their public research university through
examining library use while controlling for demographic and pre-college academic

30

characteristics, as well as students’ academic college of admittance. Their results
suggested that “first year students who used the academic library at least once in their
academic courses had higher GPAs and retention, on average, than their peers who did
not use the libraries” (p. 89). The University of Tennessee used a revitalized library
space as a tool to improve low retention rates through student engagement. In a recent
survey, results “showed that over 70% of students indicated that the [library’s] commons
made them feel more involved at the university” (Walker & Smith, 2013, p. 2). The focus
of the University of Iowa’s Learning Commons design was increasing the quality of
learning spaces not just at the physical library, but across campus, and to link student
engagement with the LC to student success and retention (Thomas et al., 2015).
Connecting library services to student persistence and success, including data
identifying past successes and projection for future success can support a “case for
significant campus investment” (Dewey, 2008a, p. 46). Some evidence suggests that
undergraduate students’ interaction with the library are positively related to “select
educationally purposeful activities, such as using…information technology and
interacting with faculty members” (Kuh & Gonyea, 2003, p. 270). Frequent, informal
contact by students with faculty and other campus administrators and staff contribute to
intellectual and personal development, believed to lead to college success (Umbach &
Wawneynski, 2005).
Perception of the role of the academic library from faculty has shifted in recent years.
The Ithaka Faculty Survey, which measures faculty perception of libraries, between
2009 and 2012 identified a pivot in faculty view of the library role away from buyer and
archive towards a supportive gateway for collaboration, teaching, learning, and research

31

(Schonfeld & Houseright, 2009; Schonfeld, Wulfson, & Houseright, 2012). A current
multi-library assessment project, LibValue, is modeling return on investment (ROI)
strategies to identify the financial value of libraries to their institution by capturing library
capacity to assist faculty secure grant and other research funds (Kingma & McClure,
2015). Librarians have the capacity to provide faculty with advice on topics including
open access and scholarly communication more generally, as well as data management
(Delaney & Bates, 2015).
While according to Oakleaf (2010), librarianship possesses room for growth in
measuring value, academic libraries harness potential to positively impact student
enrollment, student retention and graduation rates, student academic achievement,
student experience, faculty research productivity, faculty grants, and institutional
reputation and prestige. Library leaders have been called to do more to document their
value to student learning and institutional goals (Oakleaf, 2010), and at many academic
libraries the planning and evaluation of adaptable, sustainable space has been a
significant aspect of the response. Academic libraries are an ideal vehicle for providing
value as leaders see departments collaborating to support the institutional mission
(Ferer, 2012), and they employ a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods to
ascertain effectiveness (Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007; Somerville & Collins, 2008; Thomas
et al., 2015; Walker & Smith, 2013). Head (2016) asserted that in this “shifting and
complex landscape, the role of academic libraries is not fully known” (p. 2).
The history of academic library space design
Libraries, as a “component of cultural space, are ubiquitous to almost every society
during almost every time period” (Leckie & Boschman, 2007, p. 3). Sack (1997)

identified the library as a ‘primary place,’ grouped in with those spaces that “share an
interest in the truth. This makes them different from other kind of places, such as
advertising agencies, which create meanings for purpose of influence and control rather
than edification of truth” (p. 69). Bennett (2009) identified three eras of space design as
reader-centered, book-centered, and learning-centered. Origins of libraries as readercentered space in the West were originated in the monastic scriptorium and library,
where defining features included “space set apart for secluded prayer and reflection”
(Bennett, 2009, p. 181). Written materials were a precious commodity, as libraries,
including those at universities, relied on bequests from private collectors or auctions to
bring in books or other artifacts. Through the Enlightenment, books were often collected
to be shown, “monstrosities, with gold lettering and ornate binding” (Clark, 2006). Space
reflected the needs of the reader such as a “reading lectern or carrel…placed
perpendicular to a window for the sake of light” (Bennett, 2009, p. 182). Similar values
inspired early American academic libraries; while structural elements reflected a milieu
of architectural styles, they were designed to “sustain scholarship. It had everything a
man of letters…needed for his work: offices, classrooms, seminar rooms, and books”
(Keiger, 2008, p. 36).
Throughout the 20th century, the growing capacity of technology to produce books,
journals, and other print-based materials, as well as the breadth of knowledge growth in
all areas, commercially re-shaped use of space in academic libraries. Capital projects
focused on expansions to house growing collections (Bennett, 2003). Collection size
became a “kind of measuring stick for an institution’s own ranking among competitors
within the region” (Branin, Groen, & Thorin, 2000, p. 24). Funding of academic libraries

33

until the 1980s was haphazard, which was considered appropriate as campus planning
efforts were generally incremental at that time (Allen & Dickie, 2007). For example, at
the University of Illinois’ Altgeld Hall, the original library was expanded in 1939, 1968,
and 1982 to increase capacity; finally, a separate high-capacity shelving facility was
opened at the far side of campus in 2004 and expanded in 2008 (Bennett, 2009).
In a survey of 240 library directors, 57 percent indicated that between 1992 and
2001, the “most frequent motivator [for renovations] was the need to accommodate
collection growth” (Bennett, 2003, p. 7). However, follow-up interviews with participants
from that survey revealed the unlikelihood that shelving would drive future renovations
as a result of “burgeoning online resources” (Bennett, 2003, p.12). Since 2002, few
institutions have invested in infrastructure housing collections, “except for compact and
high-density shelving installed as a way to free prime-central campus space that might
be used for learning” (Bennett, 2015, p. 216).
Disruptors contributing to learner-centered library space design
The information technology revolution
The early 1990s set the tone for the return to a user-centered library model, fostered
by an abundance of information, rather than the scarcity that influenced the earliest
library designs. Bennett (2007, 2015) described this era as a return to the user holding
the position of importance over books. Libraries struggled to house their growing
collection of monographs and print journals. Information became “plentiful, even
overabundant, but its increasingly electronic nature allows libraries to re-appropriate
space that had been previously occupied by shelving and use it for more user-centric
purposes” (Bennett, 2007, p. 188).

34

A significant disruptor to the work of librarians, beginning in the early 1990s, was the
proliferation of information that became accessible to everyone through technology.
Bennett (2015) identified the 1993 release of Mosaic, the first widely adopted internet
browser, as an important moment influencing the library transformation movement. It
“dethroned librarians as search intermediaries while it empowered readers to mast the
firehouse flood of material released onto the web in the 1990s” (Bennett, 2015, p. 216).
Online journal repositories, such as JSTOR, also emerged in the mid-1990s.
Through the early 2000s, the “learning environment was heavily influenced by
technology and specifically by the proliferation of wireless networking” (Walker & Smith,
2013, p. 1). As information became networked, the expectations of each subsequent
class of entering students “that information technology would be a central feature of
their education [increases]” (Bennett, 2003, p. 4). Students have embraced the social
and intellectual role of technology in their life, which is impacting how they seek and
process information, as well as pursue opportunities for collaboration (Dewey, 2008b).
Digital technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, which has allowed products to
become more diverse, mobile, and affordable. The students of the 2010s are now
connecting through social media in real time, use “personal devices simultaneously for
learning and personal interest” (Lee & Schottenfeld, 2014, p. 1), and are more likely to
multitask in their working environment. They own and heavily use multiple devices,
including laptops and smartphones (Blaylock & Carlton, 2013). Emerging developments
that may factor in future library adaptations include availability of open access materials,
and increased access to cloud computing and storage (Harris, 2012).

35

Emergence of the constructivist learning paradigm
Another catalyst for learner-centered space design was a paradigm shift in higher
education, as described in a seminal article by Barr and Tagg (1995), which issued a
charge to institutions to reframe their approach to teaching away from instruction,
towards producing learning. The goal of higher education should be to produce learning
opportunities for each individual student “by whatever means work best” (Barr & Tagg,
1995, p. 13). Barr and Tagg described their Learning Paradigm as aspirational,
identifying the institution itself a learner, as over time “it continuously learns how to
produce more learning with each graduating class, each entering student” (p. 13).
Educators enacted this philosophical change through emphasizing active learning,
integrating projects that brought greater focus to real world issues, and promoting social
learning through group work (Bennett, 2009; Somerville & Collins, 2008; Thomas el al.,
2015). Other ideas supporting this paradigm include that learning is contextual and
should recognize student understanding, and learning is social and enhanced by
discussion between students, and between faculty and students (Brown & Long, 2006).
Learning can also be enhanced when students have opportunities to hold different
roles, including “listener, critic, mentor, and presenter” (Brown & Long, 2006, p. 1).
The nature and definition of knowledge has also changed. Traditional knowledge had
been thought of in the context of tangible objects, but now can be identified by networks
and infrastructures (O’Brien & Richardson, 2015). New “knowledge structures [blur] the
distinction between knowledge creators and knowledge consumers” (p. 194).
Knowledge creation has become increasingly interdisciplinary, characterized by more

36

partnerships but also diversity in communication, including blogs, wikis, and online
communities (Blakey, Wolski, & Richardson, 2013).
The convergence of technology and learning disruption birthed the millennial
generation of students, also coined the Net Generation, Generation Y, and the Digital
Generation (Lippincott, 2010; Somerville & Harlan, 2006), who had new habits that
needed to be accommodated. In the late 1990s, students were migrating towards
almost universal ownership of personal devices that allowed them individual access to
information anywhere they are (Caruso & Kvavik, 2005). Oblinger and Oblinger (2005)
identified learning preferences of the Net Generation as including the desire to work in
teams, structure, and use of technology to create their own learning. They prefer visual
and active learning methods. In recent years, student demands of their campus evolved
to match their access to multiple mobile devices, including access to wireless internet
access, support for their personal devices, teaching staff to improve their digital literacy,
and access to institutional devices (Beethum & White, 2013).
Accountability in Higher Education
Salingo (2013) called the period from 1999-2009 the “Lost Decade” in higher
education, when a “boom in high school graduates gave colleges the opportunity to
prepare for what’s coming next: fewer government dollars and a more diverse pipeline
of students lacking academic skills but needing lots of financial aid” (p. xvii). Instead, he
asserted that colleges unwisely spent money chasing the highest ranking students, and
spending money on vanity projects that treated students more like consumers than
students. They “were not exposed to a rigorous academic experience that would have
prepared them for the working world, but instead were treated like customers to be

37

pleased and directed” (p. xvi). Everything changed after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers on September 2008, which signaled the start of the Great Recession. An
intersection of economic changes with a declining birth rate forced institutions to
compete for fewer students, often resulting in deeper tuition discounting (Hossler &
Kalsbeek, 2013)
While state legislatures’ support for public education declined, public resistance to
increased tuition sticker price increased. Pressure for higher education to be
accountable to the public through retention and graduate rates, employment success,
average starting salaries, and debt load increased; one manifestation of this pressure
was the creation of the College Scorecard by the U.S. Department of Education, which
compiled that information to be shared to the public (U.S. Department of Education,
2015). Prospective and current students, as well as their families, are increasingly
demanding, and the needs of increasingly diverse student demographics are changing
(Stoffle, Renaud, & Veldof, 1996, 2015). Students from a variety of backgrounds are
attending college: non-traditional students who are returning to school after years in the
workforce, part-time students who also work full-time, as well as the traditional 18-25year-old members of the Millennial generation (Heitsch & Holley, 2011). Families expect
colleges and universities to leverage their students’ career prospects and earning
potential after graduation (Schopfield, Roche, & Hubert, 2015). The economic and
political climate for higher education is volatile, as “funding stagnation and cuts are not
simply the results of temporary downshifts of the economy, but represent a shift in
priorities and a public disillusionment bordering on hostility for what is seen as
unnecessary and self-serving academic privilege” (p. 318).

38

Academic libraries face increased accountability to host institutions and the public to
show impact (Cox & Pinfield, 2015). They are asked to do more with less while
demonstrating their value (ACRL Research Planning & Review Committee, 2012).
Academic libraries were markedly “heavy investments in physical facilities that cannot
measurably demonstrate their contribution to the enterprise” (Seaman, 2005, p. 307).
However, libraries have begun to identify value, and strategies to measure in present
context. In a world
where knowledge and its application is seen as the key to global competitiveness, the
developed and developing nations have renewed their focus on knowledge innovation as a
driver of national prosperity. The impact of a university’s research is a significant element of
a university’s contribution (O’Brien & Richardson, 2015).

Some institutions are utilizing activity-based budgeting activities, “a method of budgeting
in which activities that mean costs in every functional area are accounted for, analyzed,
and then linked to the mission and strategic goals of the institution” (Wilson, 2012, p.
81). Wilson (2012) also identified standard evaluation and organizational institution-wide
initiatives that informed library strategic planning at the University of Washington. To
ensure its continued sustainability and impact at the greater institution, libraries must
respond appropriately to campus accountability measures.
A call to action for librarianship
In the 75th anniversary of the College and Research Libraries’ Journal, Stoffle,
Renaud, and Veldof (1996, 2015) re-published an 18-year old article to re-issue the call
for academic libraries to adapt to change, and to situate themselves to be nimble and
responsive as conditions evolve. They asserted the need for libraries to anticipate
learners’ needs, and that what is required is a “transformation, not a refining of
organizational structure, work, and internal relationships, including those between and

39

among all levels of library staff. A basic rethinking of the mission, values, and
assumptions under which library personnel work is necessary” (p. 317).
In Bennett’s (2003) seminal research report Libraries Designed for Learning, he
stated that library space design should incorporate a deeper understanding of the
“independent, active learning behavior of students and the teaching strategies of the
faculty meant to support these behaviors” (p. 39). He argued that library planning in the
1990s was not appropriately informed by updated research about what is known about
student learning and teaching, “precisely the arenas in which academic library space
could have its singularly most important outcome in regards to the fundamental mission
of colleges and universities” (p. 37). In Lippincott’s (2010) article, Information Commons:
Meeting Millennials’ Needs, she cautioned librarians from making generalizations and
assumptions about what the Net Generation seeks from learning environments,
encouraging libraries to “conduct some type of needs assessment of its student
population” (p. 29). She advanced the importance of the needs of all students, including
the needs of adult learners and students with disabilities into the design of new library
spaces.
Oakleaf (2010) prepared The Value of Academic Libraries: A Comprehensive
Research and Review Report for the Association of College and Research Libraries to
provide a tool for librarianship to consider how to define their values through goal
setting, defining outcomes, and evaluating them as is appropriate for local contexts.
Librarians are encouraged to link academic library outcomes to institutional outcomes,
including “student enrollment, student retention and graduation rates, student success,
student achievement, student learning, student engagement, faculty research

40

productivity, faculty teaching, service, and overarching institutional quality” (p. 12).
Librarians can also integrate sources into high-impact educational practices, as defined
by Kuh (2008), including First Year Seminars, common intellectual experiences,
experiential learning, and more. Other suggestions include emphasis on measuring
impact on faculty teaching and research, and library contributions to institutional
prestige.
Ongoing conversations regarding library space design represent how “advancements
in technology, the increased cost of higher education, an aging library workforce, and a
serious economic downturn have all conveyed to challenge how libraries engage in their
academic support work” (Franklin, 2009, p. 496). Like all campus units, libraries must
prove value to their institution and demonstrate that investments made are represented
in buildings, staff performance, collection, as well as faculty and student success. The
emergence of a constructivist learning paradigm contributed to a change in perspective
on the function of informal learning space (Brown & Long, 2006).
The library needed to become an instrument for institutions to attract more students
in the face of decreased state funding, higher costs, and fiercer competition for
students. Emphasis on customer service and student satisfaction was a catalyst for
greater attention paid to students, especially undergraduate students (Chu, 2014). As
institutions continue to rely more heavily on student tuition dollars, “undergraduates as a
student body suddenly got unprecedented control and influence in campus construction
and planning” (Seaman, 2005, p. 308). Freeman (2005) asserted that the “library…must
be viewed with a new perspective and understanding if it is to fulfill its potential in

41

adding value to the advancement of the institution’s academic mission and in moving
with that institution in the future” (np).
Recent history of learning space design in academic libraries, 1991-present
The moniker “commons” is often integrated into the names of new library spaces; the
term is borrowed from historical use of naming lands and resources that were shared
and maintained by many people (Bollier, 2004; Browndorf, 2014). Commons can be
identified as defined space that integrates non-library services and technology-rich
access points (Caniano, 2010). Beagle (2012) described the commons as an emergent
phenomenon; when resources are combined within a re-conceptualized service
framework and projected onto a reconfigured library floor plan, the result can mesh with
creative pedagogy to become something greater than these constituent parts. Bennett
(2003) identified the commons philosophy as drawing upon “the long heritage of
common rooms in higher education, where all members of the academic community can
meet informally around shared meals” (p. 37).
Information Commons
The Information Commons (IC) were the first library space designs to reflect a
learning-centered paradigm of library service (Heitsch & Holley, 2011). ICs are
resource-rich spaces, bringing together tools, services, and staff expertise that had
previously been delivered separately by library reference and campus computer labs
(Beagle, 2006, 2012; Bennett, 2003). The two founding ICs, the Information Arcade at
the University of Iowa, and the Leavey Library at the University of Southern California,
which opened in the early 1990s, were guided by similar rationale: reconsideration of
service delivery, facilitation of information retrieval while addressing “deeper and

42

broader facilitation of learning” (Beagle, 2006, p. 19), and enhancing the identity of the
library as a collaborative change agent at the institution. They feature computers and
other hardware, as well as support desks serviced by both the library and information
technology units, broadening staff ability to address questions and concerns brought by
their users. Furniture arrangements in early ICs were static, akin to classrooms, though
many later were arranged to encourage student information sharing and collaboration
(Lippincott, 2010). While an IC offers a continuum of service, it is still ultimately librarycentric and its focus is on technology and learning support (Beagle, 2012; Solberg,
2011).
An IC needs to be prepared to keep up with new technology and identify
opportunities to “exploit the academic potential of student-owned devices” (Beagle,
2006, p. 9). Beagle (2006) used an American Council on Education (ACE) typology of
change initiatives to identify a continuum of the stages of evolution from IC to Learning
Commons (LC), the second-generation commons: adjustment, isolated change, farreaching change, and transformation. The scale starts out at spaces that facilitate
academic support and knowledge discovery, evolving to those that foster knowledge
creation. The impact of the change shifts to campus-wide (Bailey & Tierney, 2008;
Beagle, 2006).
Learning Commons
Bennett (2003) offered an early call for the development of LCs, at a time when he
was unable to identify a library that delivered the ideals LCs espoused to full
expression. He did not find that library space planning in the previous decade that
represented an understanding of student learning, and asserted that library design

43

should incorporate a deeper understanding of the independent, active learning
behaviors of students and the strategies of faculty activity implemented to support those
behaviors. Bennett (2003) identified a critical difference in learning goals between ICs
and LCs. While IC frameworks only enhance knowledge seeking behaviors, LCs are
developed with knowledge creation goals in mind. Bennett asserted that LC creation
and maintenance must be driven by its learners, and be capable of adapting to
changing learning needs. Somerville and Harlan (2006) described the LC as a product
of “appreciation for the potential synergy of student success partnerships” (p. 2). While
ICs generally emerge from Information Technology services but remain library-focused,
the mission of the LC is more pervasive to the rest of campus, and more likely to
integrate sources that usually operate outside of library walls, such as faculty
development centers, writing centers, information technology, English as a Second
Language (ESL) instruction, and other academic support services (Bailey, 2006;
Beagle, 2012; Head, 2016; Lee & Schottenfeld, 2014). The integrated services offered
in this environment are meant to promote “independent, self-sufficient contemplation,
research, productivity, and creativity” (Bailey, 2006, p. 6).
Many characteristics of an LC are widely agreed upon: LC development should align
with the mission and vision of the institution (Bailey & Tierney, 2008; Dryden &
Goldstein, 2012; Lippincott, 2010); LCs should encourage learning as a social,
collaborative process (Beagle, 2012; Thomas et al., 2015); and they should offer
conveniences to students including 24/7 service and on-site cafes (Schmidt & Kaufman,
2007). Planners should review initiatives across campus that could offer “some potential
and relationship to LC services and resources” (Beagle, 2006, p. 84).

44

A strength of the LC is the variety of “teaching and learning relationships that a
single space can support…the outcomes…have evolved to include both information
consumption and knowledge creation” (Head, 2016, p. 8). The core activity of a
“learning commons would not be the manipulation and mastery of information…but the
collaborative learning by which students turn information into knowledge and sometimes
into wisdom” (Beagle, 2006, p. 38). Space can be situated for social learning be
managed by students themselves, as their needs change frequently (Bennett, 2003).
Such library space has value not simply because it accommodates the use of
information, but more particularly embeds its use into collaborative learning activities
“that define the mission of colleges and universities to which information use is always
secondary” (Bennett, 2003, p. 39).
Institutional leaders manipulate commons taxonomies to suit the needs of their
individual institution. D. Russell Bailey, University Librarian at Providence College,
bypassed an initial, large library renovation plan in favor an emergent strategy, with
planning and implementation evolving “in an ongoing, improvisational, and more
informal fashion” (Bailey, 2010, p. 4). His team adapted principles into something new
he described as “organic, hybrid, and infused:
Organic – based on local library and institutional culture, needs, change
readiness; emerging in increments as opportunities emerge, at a pace, at costs,
and to degrees apropos institutional resources;
Hybrid – seamless blend of services/resources, of new/high tech <->
traditional/high-touch
Infused – the blend of services/resources is pushed out explicitly or implicitly into
and distributed among, all aspects of the physical and virtual library” (p. 4).

45

While understanding of models was applied to a process a scaffold, leaders developed
and implemented space upgrades in a tiered format throughout their existing library
spaces, maintaining a tension of high-tech and high-touch services.
Library Learning Spaces
The current wave of library space design is focused on creating library learning
spaces, identified as the third-generation commons (Head, 2016; Somerville & Harlan,
2008). The tenets of the model suggest that libraries need to understand how students
learn, and then create appropriate environments anywhere a student may choose to
work (Montgomery, 2014). Impact of these spaces on formal and informal learning
becomes more prominent as “pedagogical practices in higher education start to move
away from the traditional, leader-centered approach to a more flexible, student-centered
approach” (Turner et al., 2013, p. 231). That the environments are versatile is essential,
possessing the ability to be reconfigured to facilitate faculty research and support
teaching, as they “have access to library expertise as they co-create curriculum,
including pedagogy and assignments” (Head, 2016, p. 9). The goal is to support the
learning, teaching, and research that comprise the core mission of 21 st century higher
education as it evolves.
Learning spaces can be facilitated beyond traditional library walls to include “dining
halls, residence halls, reading rooms, scientific libraries, and university bookstores” (p.
3). Beyond the library, any space holds the capacity to be an effective environment for
informal learning. Their purpose is not solely to be “mere containers for a few, approved
activities; instead, they provide environments for people” (Brown & Long, 2006, np).
Hunley and Schaller’s (2009) multi-year project studied relationships between learning

46

spaces, academic programs, and learning. They determined space can restrain or
encourage learning behaviors, and that students will use any appropriately design
space for learning activities.
Characteristics and services in 21st century academic libraries
Innovative academic library learning designs can be described using frameworks
and definitions provided by innovators and early adopters, but in practice take many
names and boast overlapping tools, services, and partnerships. (Lippincott, 2010;
Somerville & Harlan, 2008), and are prioritized based on mission and requirements of
the greater institution. Maker spaces are a new trend in academic libraries, and may
continue to enhance learning-creation opportunities that repurposed spaces can offer
(Turner et al., 2013). Frequent services integrated in a 20th century academic library
include spaces for students to work on presentations, faculty preparation rooms, and
special event spaces. Other trends include flexible learning spaces; storage space to
accommodate extra chairs, computers, and other supplies; flexible, modular furniture
that can accommodate formal and informal learning environments; sufficient electrical
and telecommunication resources to support personal devices and general internet use;
sound controls to mitigate potential distractions to learning; enhanced access to
learning space during extended hours; and intentional lighting (Andrews & Wright, 2015;
Barratt & White, 2010; Chan & Wong, 2013; Head, 2016). Many libraries are now
creating space that permits 24-hour access (Cunningham & Walton, 2010, Thomas et
al., 2015).
Libraries are now providing mobile devices available for check-out, including ereaders, iPads, cameras, laptops, and GPS devices (Ball & Pereira-Pujol, 2015; Dryden

47

& Goldstein, 2012). Informal learning spaces are most prevalent, but some new spaces
may house general, but flexible classrooms (Andrews & Wright, 2015; Barratt & White,
2010). In their environmental scan of several libraries that underwent recent library
transformations, Andrews and Wright (2015) observed “traditional bookfilled quiet
space…faculty and graduate student commons…multimedia labs; and maker spaces”
(p. 468). The space can be adaptable, and “interspersed with each other and other
services and activities” (Thomas et al., 2013, p. 3). Spatial layouts encourage emphasis
of “social engagement…[on] scholarly pursuits” (p. 3). Libraries are shifting academic
support functions into open spaces in an effort to reduce stigma of accessing these
services (Bailin et al., 2014). Computing areas are almost universal, and libraries are
also acknowledging students as “producers of dynamic digital content” (Barratt & White,
2010, p. 137), tutoring services, event spaces, and areas that can support academic
department events.
Focus of space design efforts at some institutions have continued to shift to “a
deeper engagement with the research process in addition to writing skills, technology
skills, or other academic support” (Gibson & Mandernach, 2013, p. 492). Research
commons or service models may provide “library space as interdisciplinary conversation
point” (p. 496), data visualization labs, areas for showcasing research, or visibility labs.
Lippincott (2006) urged academic planners to design space that fosters teamwork,
supports multitasking, creativity, and communication towards creating an environment
that is both academic and social. Libraries are also re-evaluating their role in identifying
and addressing critical research needs of the faculty (ACRL, 2012; Bruns, Brantley, &

48

Duffin, 2015), including knowledge of copyright issues, authors’ rights, scholarly
communication tools, and data management.
The realization that the disruptors that catalyzed the learner-focused library
paradigm would continue to evolve has brought planners to consider space planning
that “could adapt to users’ learning needs 10 or even 20 years into the future” (Head,
2016, p. 2). These spaces may support collaboration, individual study, point-of-need
sessions, or occasional faculty-led sessions. In Project Information Literacy’s Planning
and Designing Academic Learning Spaces report, the majority of architects and
librarians interviewed emphasized creating flexible, user-defined spaces, “manifested in
movable and customizable, and often casual furnishings and non-permanent
whiteboard partitions” (Head, 2016, p. 2). Almost two-thirds of the space projects in the
study possessed ‘one-stop-shopping’ areas for student learning and teaching success
that included campus partners.
Towards the goal of aligning their services with institutional mission, librarians
innovate towards meeting needs of students, faculty, and affiliates of specific academic
departments. Dewland and Elliott (2015) advocated for librarians to develop a skill set
that allows them to have a greater role in the university commercialization process, that
is a “strategy to promote economic development opportunities…[including] technology
transfer offices, incubator packs, and joint ventures between the university, investors,
and corporate entities” (p. 41). To meet the needs of business students and faculty,
some libraries are piloting ‘economic gardening’ projects, an approach to local
economic development that involves academic business librarian and public librarians

49

to provide research and reference support to entrepreneurs (Leavitt, Hamilton-Pennell,
& Fails, 2010).
Transformational organizational change in the academic library
Mossop (2013) suggested that the idea of transformational change
may well be envisioned from the outside, and will guide and form the central pillar of a
change programme, it is just as often only truly recognized in hindsight, at a moment in time
when the current state can be clearly compared to a former state –and be recognized as
being profoundly different (p. 4).

He offered a definition of transformational change as the culmination of a planned
strategy of change, combining cultural, incremental, and organizational change:
…incremental: a planned series of mutually supportive changes derived from and in
support of an overarching strategic impetus…
Organizational: strategically designed changes often involving modifications to staffing
structures, and intended to deliver substantial changes in service or to create capacity for
new services to be introduced alongside existing ones…
Cultural: undertaken in order to reinvent or reinvigorate the underlying organizational
ethos, to instill a beneficial capacity to accept the need for and actively support a fresh
strategic direction (p.7).

Librarianship offers commentary and literature, mostly grounded in descriptions of
library space design projects at individual institutions, about the operationalization of
planned and emergent change processes (Barratt & White, 2010; Chan & Wong, 2012;
Cunningham & Walton, 2016; Howard & Somerville, 2014; Thomas et al., 2015; Wilson,
2012). The next section will discuss how planned and emergent change strategies
manifest at academic libraries. While they can be viewed as competing approaches
(Bess & Dee, 2012), in a study of organizational change in a profit-making sector,
Burnes (2004) found that both strategies can be applied to innovate for change.

50

Planned change
Planned organizational change represents intentional efforts to improve process
through innovation grounded in scientific knowledge and understanding (Bartunek &
Woodman, 2015). It begins with a “decision by [a] system to deliberately improve its
functioning” (Levy, 1986, p. 6). Psychologist Kurt Lewin (1951) was among the first to
develop a framework to understand the process of change, which involves three steps:
unfreezing, changing, and refreezing. In Schein’s (1996) commentary on Lewin’s
change theory, he communicates the “belief that all forms of learning and change start
with some form of dissatisfaction or frustration generated by data that disconfirms our
expectations or hopes” (p. 60). This catalyzes the unfreezing process, as individuals
seek “competence and self-efficacy, but each person’s equilibrium must be disturbed
(but not destroyed) so that the person is compelled to seek change” (Bess & Dee, 2012,
p. 805).
For academic libraries, change is driven by ongoing disruptive environmental factors
including new learning paradigms, increased capacity and availability of information
technology, and increased accountability in higher education. Once the idea of change
is accepted, organization members can learn something new through a cognitive
restructuring, or reframing (Schein, 1996). Once reframing begins, “new mental
categories are tested with new behavior which leads to a period of trial and error and
either reinforces the new categories or starts a new confirmation and search” (p. 63).
From this point, planned change reflects thoughtful efforts to enhance organizational
processes through innovation based on scientific knowledge (Bartunek & Woodman,
2015). Foundations of decision making may be grounded in institutional research,

51

accreditation, self-studies, or program reviews. Modern scholars describe planned
change as social construction, ignited by dissatisfaction or frustration, and facilitated by
new standards of judgment or evaluation, as well as a systemic and conversational
process (Schein, 1996; Mantere, Schildt, & Sillince, 2012). McCalman and Potter (2015)
emphasized that Lewin did not believe planned change to be a straightforward, rational
process. They asserted that “he was also not suggesting that the change process could
involve humans…suspending their state in time for redesign; in contrast he was
employing his model as a thinking device, to help change managers conceptualize
critical stages of the change management process” (p. 27).
Institutions planning a library learning space project perform a variety of activities to
inform action. Planning “is essential to take full advantage of opportunities, and to
provide the framework to evaluate them before, during, and after” (Forrest & Bostick,
2013, p. 149). Leaders at the University of Iowa completed research on educational
pedagogy to inform the initial iteration of their LC in 2013 (Thomas et al., 2015). The
University of Connecticut sought to develop LC models for each of their regional
campuses that both supported their respective missions and made efficient use of
resources and physical space available. They developed a survey in an effort to
understand the learning culture at each institution (Dryden & Goldstein, 2013).
Beagle (2006) suggested surveys as an instrument for discovering current use and
needs of physical and human resources. Focus groups could also be implemented to
learn more about use of human and social resources. Staff at the DuBois Library
Learning Commons at the University of Massachusetts – Amherst used both when
researching needs of students, and discovered high levels of student satisfaction with a

52

specialized Reference and Research Assistance Desk. Students valued “learning the
research process during the reference interaction…the data show that users value the
teaching aspect of the [reference] interaction the most. ‘Learning the steps’ allows them
to become more independent researchers” (Fitzpatrick, Moore, and Lang, 2008, p. 237).
Based on feedback, the library decided to maintain a separate service desk to address
IT concerns.
Somerville and Collins (2008) presented methodologies for interactive, collaborative
research design with the goal of giving commons users a central role at every stage of
the planning process. Participatory design equitably involves designers and users.
Contextual design is a method “that approaches product design out of understanding of
how customers work” (Somerville & Collins, 2008, p. 808). Iterative design leads to the
rapid “prototyping of solutions which can, in turn, be evaluated, modified, and finally,
implemented in a relatively short time while incorporating user feedback throughout” (p.
809). The San Jose University Library commons development process utilized two
cooperative design projects; one with students to identify outcomes that support
students’ co-curricular learning, and the other with faculty to transform library instruction
classrooms into learning spaces.
Foster (2014) defined participatory design as a vehicle for “shared information and
authority in the design, technology, spaces, services, and resources in all kinds of
workplaces” (p. 3). A technology design team, work place experts, and anthropologists
have a role in supporting evidence based decisions by leaders through the design
process. Foster (2014) identified these contributions:
The role of workplace efforts is to provide as much relevant information as
possible about their work, the ways that current practices are effective or

53

ineffective, how workers overcome obstacles they encounter, and so on. The
role of technology experts is to address needs, solve problems, and respond
to whatever requirements emerge from the information provided by the
workplace experts. An anthropologist or other social scientist plays a
necessary role in enabling workplace experts to provide rich, understandable
information to technology experts (p. 4).
Foster (2013) described a participatory design method to understand how students
were using the Carlson Science and Engineering Library at University of Rochester. The
staff used reply cards, distributed across the library on designated days, to solicit
feedback from students on how they were learning in the space. They also engaged 20
students in a workshop to empower them to draw their ideal configuration of a library
space within the library. Some of those students were interviewed to get deeper
feedback, reflect on individual experiences in the library, and share attitudes about
various aspects of the space. At Olin Library at Rollins College, staff used ethnographic
surveys of space, focus groups, and surveys about learning behaviors in an effort to
capture impact of space on student learning (Montgomery, 2014). They discovered
users “utilized the space for social learning prior to the renovation…and the space
continued to support that learning behavior after the renovation” (p. 73). They also
responded well to the availability of refreshments, and flexible space that allowed for
quiet study as well as social learning.
Library organizations help bolster the efforts of member librarians to “transform [their]
organizations to create differential value for future users (individuals, institutions, and
beyond), given the external dynamics redefining the research environment over the next
20 years” (Association of Research Libraries, 2010). The Association of Research
Libraries facilitated a scenario planning project that designed descriptions of four
potential futures, each presenting a variety of critical uncertainties that may unfold over

54

a 20-year period, “as well as synergies and interactions between uncertainties”
(Association of Research Libraries, 2010, p. 8). The materials provide templates to
assist librarians and partners workshop through scenarios to promote thoughtful, longterm planning. A similar infrastructure was implemented in the UK as a collaboration
between the British Library and other information and library organizations (JISC, 2010).
Emergent change
The charge of the 21st century academic library is to “continually recreate itself as a
place that fosters creativity, engagement, collaboration, and lifelong learning” (Forrest &
Bostick, 2013). Students will use facilities, resources, and staff expertise differently as
learning pedagogies change and technological capabilities increase, evolving the
expectations of learning resources. Emergent change refers to the ongoing adjustments
people make in “their everyday work practices in response to local conditions” (Bess &
Dee, 2012, p. 808). The framework recognizes the potential for innovation in all levels of
the organization, and that change is more likely to emerge by faculty and staff who are
engaging with students every day (Leslie, 1996). Neal (2014) charged that we “have
moved from an area of equilibrium to a new normal, an era of constant disequilibrium.
Our ways of working, ways of creating value, and ways of innovating must be reframed”
(p. 613).
Planners should understand the extent to which a recently revitalized space meets
the needs of users (Lippincott, 2010). They engage in summative and formative
evaluation to inform improvements, integrating a combination of informal, formal,
qualitative, and quantitative assessment strategies (Barratt & White, 2010; Steiner &
Holley, 2009). Qualitative evaluation strategies can include focus groups, library

55

advising groups, and observation (Beagle, 2012; Dryden & Goldstein, 2012; Forrest &
Bostick, 2013; Thomas et al., 2015). Cunningham and Walton (2016) described use of
brief informal interviews at ILS locations across campus that inquired about the nature
of the students’ learning at the time of the interview, frequency of use, reasons for using
the space, how the student believes space could be improved, technology used at the
visit, and comments on other ILSs. Assessments are designed to solicit feedback from
students, ensuring that development and maintenance is student centered (Mountifield,
2005). Library space planners need to push beyond user preferences, and instead
assess towards greater understanding of how transformed environments impact student
learning outcomes (Somerville & Harlan, 2006). Data from surveys and other learner
studies determine if student characteristics and preferences correspond with preimplementation predictions. Other quantitative methods include tracking of traffic within
library spaces, and utilization of space for formal and informal programs (Barratt &
White, 2010). A commitment to “systematic and ongoing data collection, compilation,
analysis, and reporting about data and user satisfaction can be the basis for developing
a “culture of assessment” in an academic library. Continuous improvement requires
continuously updated, regularly reported information” (Forrest & Bostick, 2013, p. 149).
Dynamic interweaving of services requires a “constant rethinking of tools and ideas,
methods, and space as planners seek to evolve and assist in the process of turning
information to knowledge into the final product” (Church, 2005, p. 81). Successful early
design projects that stood the test of ten years or more reflect “customization…which
must continue to adapt…appropriate to particular campus circumstances in order to
meet changing [needs] and harness technological advances” (Somerville & Collins,

56

2008, p. 815). Head’s (2016) Project Information Literacy report found that many
libraries fail to identify formal evaluation metrics to measure the success of new spaces;
standard “assessments of library usage, such as gate counts, usage studies about
library resources were employed…barriers to conducting assessments were logistics,
time, energy, or available expertise” (p. 3).
Some institutions pursue an emergent change model from the beginning for their
library transformation, to create capacity for an organic process inspired by previous
steps (Bailey, 2010; Bailin et al., 2014). The Library + COMMONS at Providence
College intentionally implemented a tiered plan described as “gradual, informal,
incremental, an almost stealth approach” (Bailey, 2010, p. 3). The commons was
constructed piece-by-piece over several years, integrating services from non-library
partners informally rather than creating formal partnerships governed by memorandums
of understanding (MOUs). Rick Luce, Director of Libraries at Emory University, refers to
his library revitalization perspective as ‘opportunistic renovation’ strategy, describing
work done in increments to provide opportunities for ‘as you go’ evaluation (Forrest &
Bostick, 2013).
After California Polytechnic State University opened its IC in 2003, faculty supervised
research projects were used to explore how students were learning, and determine if
the new space met those needs. Research questions included: “how do students use
technology and share information; and how do students produce content and make
knowledge” (Somerville & Collins, 2008, p. 810)? Some outcomes of the research were
inconsistent with the design concept, and so results inspired the creation of virtual
collaboration rooms, a senior project marketplace, a multi-media café, and a knowledge

57

repository (Somerville & Collins, 2008). Writing center experts, study skills specialists,
and software training professionals were brought into the circle of service in order to
support and foster social information exchange and knowledge production practices for
student learning groups (Somerville & Brar, 2010). To facilitate an ongoing feedback
and improvement cycle, a campus-wide committee, The Task Group on the Future of
the Library was formed. This group was also charged with the more immediate task of
transforming the IC into an LC. New services inspired by this work included a
presentation space for guest speakers, a 24-hour study room, and media production
studios. Establishing sustainable working relationships enhanced ongoing
communication, promoting sensitive responsiveness (Somerville & Collins, 2008).
Foster (2013) described using ethnographic methods to understand how users,
including their staff members, do library-related work within the recently renovated
Gleason Library at University of Rochester. Informal assessments included flipcharts
stationed in the space, asking “what do you like best about the Gleason Library”, and
“What else do you want in the Gleason Library” (p. 107). Library staff also conducted
observations to ascertain the number of people using the space, as well as
“impressionistic descriptions of noise and activity levels, temperature, odors, and other
sensory information” (p. 108). When the staff decided to redesign part of the space, they
conducted a brief design workshop with randomly selected students to inform the
configuration. A similar participatory design process was used to design designated
space for graduate students.
After implementation of their new space, the Mann Library staff at Cornell University
engaged in an ongoing evaluation process. The Collaboration Center was able to

58

assess the space and redesign to “reflect the changes in library function…as well as
developments in teaching and learning methods, curriculum, and the study preferences
of [the] continuously changing student base” (Andrews & Wright, 2015, p. 468).
Students from the Design and Environmental Analysis department at Cornell assisted
with collecting feedback starting before the 2007 opening of the collaboration center,
and continued through the 2014 center refresh. Other assessment methods employed
from 2008 to 2014 included space observations, surveys, interviews, usability tests and
surveys, environmental scan and visits to other libraries, photo diaries, ideal space
design exercises, and focus groups (Andrews & Wright, 2015). Challenges they
encountered included inconsistent data collection, and data documentation and
curation. Strategies used to enhance assessment included creation of a datamanagement plan, a repository on research strategies with training guides, identifying
analysis and visualization programs, including Tableau (Andrews & Wright, 2015).
Moving “assessment from basic questions and space satisfaction to a deeper overall
user-centered engagement is a key part of 21st century librarianship” (p. 474).
Engaging stakeholders through organizational change
As the expectations for a 21st century academic library must align with the greater
institutional mission, many partners are required (Beagle, 2016; Boosinger et al., 2016;
Head, 2016; Somerville, 2015b). Other institutional units are responsible for that
process, and so they participate in all stages of the library space project (Beagle,
2010). Beagle (2006) offered frameworks for IC planning groups grounded in the ACE
typology of change, including the inclusion of library team members through a campuswide task force for libraries seeking to promote far-reaching or transformational change

59

(Beagle, 2006, p. 60). Bennett (2008) asserted that “if we work with academic units and
offices across campus to design the commons primarily with the intention that learning
will happen there, we are much more likely to see that magical moment when students,
building on work begun in the classroom, take responsibility for control over their own
learning” (p. 184). Architects hired by the institution may be brought in early to
collaborate with senior administrators, library staff, and other partners towards creating
a vision of physical space that aligns with the overarching goals of the institution
(Barratt & White, 2010).
Including partners in a library planning process can be “hard to manage, but they can
also be an immense source of strength in keeping projects focused on learning
priorities, rather than just fixing problems with the building” (Bennett, 2015, p. 227).
Head (2016) shared findings from the 2016 PIL study, citing that some librarians
identified a process for selecting partners that possessed similar goals for enhancing
teaching, learning, and research, as the added service would strengthen areas where
the library was already strong. Successful partnerships can be fostered through
connections by which each partner brings value and competence into the relationship or
project; share a common purpose; aim for mutual benefit; and together develop
processes that promote “learning, innovation, coordination, trust, open communication,
participation, adaptability, joint planning, and problem solving” (O’Brien & Richardson,
2015, p. 197). If librarians “are to deliver value and impact in an environment of
disruptive innovation, they must seek out strategic, adaptive partnerships. But in order
to do so, libraries must first understand the core capabilities that they bring to any
partnership, those that transcend technological innovation and which add value”

60

(O’Brien & Richardson, 2015, p. 200). As the authority on knowledge generation and
transmission at the university, the library should “leverage its position to lead through
vision and strategic initiative” (p. 202).
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) can help collaborators articulate a shared
vision (Lippincott, 2006). Factors that can enhance project and collaboration success
include “acknowledgement of cultural differences, expectations, and approaches”
(Dewey, 2008a, p. 50). An MOU can be used between offices to outline the length of the
agreement, or address compatibility issues such as furnishings, signage, service
philosophy, or referral guidelines (Dewey, 2008a; Head, 2016). Aligning outcomes of
planned efforts to the overall campus mission can provide a foundation from which to
develop integrated services (Wilson, 2012). Partnerships across campus enhance the
library’s goal of supporting institutional mission to provide integrated services towards
bolstering student success and retention.
Findings from the 2016 PIL report identified communication as a critical tool for
establishing buy-in from library units and the campus community, “ranging from
individual meetings with library units to hosting campus-wide events” (Head, 2016, p. 3).
The researchers found that the most successful library projects had stakeholders –
namely, librarians and architects – “who were deeply invested in the same process of
collaborative design” (Head, 2016, p. 20). Architects and librarians were able to identify
the strengths the other brought to the table, which allowed the groups to work together
and put users first to articulate a shared vision. Some projects also bring in outside
consultants to add expertise grounded in knowledge from previous projects, focus to
efforts, and participating projects. Consultants are equipped to “translate the language

61

that each profession used, explaining meanings so that designs took shape and
projects could move forward” (Head, 2016, p. 21).
Partnerships and collaboration should be grounded in the idea that shared thinking,
expertise, and ideas can converge to create a new way of thinking to solve a problem
(Giesecke, 2012). This work has been identified as critical for future success in all
libraries. Essential qualities for collaborative work include “trust, vision, goodwill, and a
belief in the value of cooperation” (Sarjeant-Jenkins & Walker, 2014). At some
institutions library space design projects consider almost equal engagement and
resources from non-library partners. At the University of Idaho, both the Dean of
Students, representing academic support, and the Dean of the Library, contributed
“human and fiscal resources to secure the success of the project” (Henrich, 2013, p.
230).
At San Jose University, commons planners sought pervasive, transformational
change, and so all potential partners, beneficiaries and stakeholders were included in
the planning process from the very beginning: instructional design consultants,
academic technology leaders, student government representatives, facilities managers,
peer mentors, faculty representatives, and librarians. A research-in-practice workplace
culture was advanced through regular forums which involved all interested university
community members. Conversations and discussion outcomes were circulated via webbased blogs, wiki forums, and other campus communication channels (Somerville &
Collins, 2008).
Florida International University’s (FIU) IC Task Force was library-wide, but also
brought in their writing center, media services, and IT department to discuss

62

coordinating student services in their library spaces (Ball & Pereira-Pujil, 2015).
Students enrolled in the institutions’ design graduate program were recruited to work in
teams to develop design proposals, informed by campus stakeholder feedback.
While Seattle University did not involve all LC partners as early as necessary in their
planning process, faculty governance, student development staff, information
technology, and library staff were all included in early visionary sessions (Solberg,
2011). In its close working ties with faculty and the greater campus community, Salve
Regina University LC planners discovered an opportunity to position itself to support the
institutions’ participation in the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching
and the Association of American College and University’s Integrative Learning Project,
which revolved around an integrative e-portfolio “that follows the student from first year
experience to the senior core capstone course” (Beagle, 2012, p. 532).
At Providence College, Bailey (2010) used the title Library+COMMONS to alleviate
apprehension from the library staff, alluding to blending tradition with progress and
innovation. Efforts to engage library and campus partners included reading common
literature, and cross-campus meetings to introduce the commons concept and solicit
buy-in from administrators, faculty, and students. The library acquired funds to provide
Commons training “which became train-the-trainer and resulted in broader impact and
greater cross-functionality” (Bailey, 2010, p. 10). Providence College intentionally did
not engage in formal relationships with non-library partners when developing their
learning space, in favor of informal, “serendipitous” collaborations with departments
including Informational Technology, The Center for Teaching Excellence, Media
Services, the Office of Academic Services, and Writing Center.

63

Committed senior leadership and the investment of institutional monetary and
personnel resources is essential in the development and maintenance of a high
performing library space (Somerville, 2015b; Wolfe, Naylor, & Drueke, 2010). At
California Polytechnic State University, the “founding vision…for [the] commons set by
senior administrators was intended to revitalize members’ teaching practices”
(Somerville & Brar, 2010, p. 182). They delegated operational planning to a task force
and advising committee, but ultimately stayed intimately involved and supportive
throughout the process. The role of support through funding cannot be understated.
Commons do not save money (Beatty, 2008). Strategic “leadership is key. Working with
the academic administrators to gain understanding, approval, and ongoing budgetary
support is crucial” (Beatty, 2008, p. 13). Some library space projects partially or
completely rely on fundraising dollars. Collaboration with development team members
becomes necessary to reach potential donors. At the University of Colorado, Denver,
fundraising efforts, as well as corporate giving initiatives, included institutional donorhosted dinner parties and other special events (Somerville, 2015a).
Schmidt and Kaufman (2007) described supportive senior leadership and strong
advocacy via its two co-directors at University of Guelph. The program guiding the
space does not receive a shared LC budget, but does receive the necessary funding to
support salaries for leadership positions, infrastructure, programming, staff
development, and more (Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007). On the other end of the
continuum, the Seattle University Learning Commons was created by the Provost
without involving all LC partners. While it was a bureaucratic relationship, the Provost
did not follow up its mandates with substantial support; he failed to fund leadership

64

positions, staff training, or provide resources that would support integrated LC
initiatives. As a result, commons partners were concerned for “the long term
sustainability of the collaborative operating structure” (Solberg, 2011, p. 256).
Bennett’s (2003) library planning research identified senior campus administrators,
such as presidents and chief academic officers, as critical to library planning success,
even if they “rarely asserted other roles” (Bennett, 2003, p. 32) when probed through his
interviews. The “library directors interviewed…who had all completed projects, spoke of
having invaluable support from institutional officers, but very few described those
officers as taking any ownership beyond that of a broadly defined financial responsibility
for the project” (Bennett, 2003, p. 32). Bennett (2003) described the faculty role in
committee planning process, as emerged through his interviews with library directors
and other leaders as “vetoing bad ideas and of approving, but not generating, good
ones…faculty…commonly assert more of a judge’s role than an owner’s role in library
planning” (pp. 33-34). Interviews revealed that students displayed the least ownershiplike behavior through the planning process; even cases where students were activists
towards advocacy for improvements of library service, they approached the process
more as consumers than learners. Evidence “of both the study survey and the
interviews [indicated] that students identify themselves as consumers and are
treated…as consumers by others involved in the planning process” (p. 34). The library is
taking a leadership role in “partnering with researchers to ensure the outputs of their
research, including publications or research data, are accessible and appropriately
managed and curated” (O’Brien & Richardson, 2015, p. 202).

65

As learning pedagogy changes, expectations for librarians can shift from a service
orientation to that of a learning partnership (Meulemans & Carr, 2013). Delaney and
Bates (2013) challenged librarians to “act in a more entrepreneurial style and seek out
ways to add value to their roles and show the impact of their work” (p. 32). They are
being called to be less library centered and more responsive to users (Matthews, Yun, &
Pickle, 2012). New models of librarianship are emerging, including embedded
librarianship, which is the act of an identified librarian focusing on the needs of one or
more groups, “developing a deep understanding of their work, and providing information
services that are highlight customized and targeted to their greatest needs…[the model
shift] from transactional to high trust, close collaboration, and shared responsibilities of
outcomes” (Brower, 2011, p. 3). Library staff at the University of Connecticut were
actively engaged in their reorganization process, both through engagement with the
charged planning team, and participation in staff-wide discussions and retreats
(Franklin, 2009). Fitchett et al (2011) asserted that library staff should be integrated into
planned change from the beginning. They often “identify nuanced issues, as they often
see things that librarians and those in library administration do not” (Chase, 2015, p.
150).
Participatory action research (PAR) is a strategy employed by librarians to enhance
active participation with campus stakeholders in collaboration with design partners. PAR
was defined by Argyris and Schon (1989) as research that “involves practitioners as
both subjects and co-researchers” (p. 2), emphasizing the idea that assumptions about
how individuals behave in a certain environment or circumstance is more valid when the
same individuals participate in the testing of those assumptions. A mindful, informed

66

partnership between librarians, architects, and other campus partners ensures
alignment of library design and services with fulfilling the greater institutional vision, as
“library facilities are most successful when they are conceived as an integral part of the
institutions as a whole” (Somerville & Brown-Sica, 2011).
Howard and Somerville (2014) described co-design and participatory action research
design initiatives at the Auraria Library at the University of Colorado, Denver through
two design charrettes focused on re-imagining library spaces and landscape
architecture plans for library courtyard spaces. Charettes are condensed co-design
workshops designed to identify creative solutions to specific design problems (Howard
& Somerville, 2014). In an academic library context, they are facilitated by design
experts but include librarians, stakeholders, and other interested parties. They
incorporate ‘low-fi’ materials toward drawing and modeling concepts conceived by the
group. They may follow a three-stage sequence of information sharing through a mindexpanding exercise, idea generation for planning through a building-expanding activity,
and prototyping and iterating conceptual models in teams (Howard & Somerville, 2014).
Facilitated by two different design teams, the researchers identify the more successful
collaboration as grounded in greater pre- and post-engagement between design experts
and campus partners, as greater engagement was encouraged from higher-ranking
campus stakeholders and broader integration into the campus community. The final
plans created aligned more closely with the priorities identified and agreed upon by the
campus team. The University of Washington also used charrettes in preparation for
designing its research commons (Wilson, 2012).

67

A 2006 Ithaka S&R Report (Boosinger et al, 2016) highlighted a participatory design
process at Auburn University. Sponsored and led by the library dean and associate
dean respectively, the membership of the team was composed of librarians,
membership of the greater campus community, and members of the Ithaka group in a
consulting role. Planning was grounded using ‘work-study practice’ through 12 faculty
research interviews to gain an “understanding of the work activities they believe are
required for student success in their classes” (p. 4). Multiple methods were used to
solicit and understand how students used specific spaces in the library. Outcomes of
the study informed conversations between architects, designers, and the library
leadership group for development and implementation of the final plans.
Conditions that foster success in library transformations
Library literature has offered descriptions of actions taken that planners attribute to
project success. Support of college administrators was important to success of library
modifications (Bailin et al., 2014). Regular contact between personnel in each
department supported efforts to “reconfigure space, staff the desk, train staff and
student workers in both spaces, design new work flows, create new signage and market
the new integrated service point” (Bailin et al., 2014, p. 3). Barratt and White (2010)
identified staff meetings, clear delineations of responsibility related to reporting lines,
student supervision, management of facilities, and administrative events, as supporting
success of collaborations in the Learning Center at the University of Georgia. While
some may consider transformed library services to be a “necessary response to a
changing environment, a high performance [library] requires the luxury of a committed
university administration and community; a budget big enough to build, renovate, or

68

reorganize existing reference space; and the ability to bring together units or groups
with disparate knowledge and culture” (Wolfe, Naylor, & Drueke, 2010, p. 110).
Clear, consistent communication and a transparent process are necessary in
facilitating effective partnerships. McMullen (2007) discussed the importance of new
communities of service finding a renewed focus, such as customer service, that can
help drive progress in implementing new library spaces. Inviting all affected staff from
the very beginning to participate in the creation of the commons positively impacted
buy-in, staff morale, and the organic development of a shared identity. When Hamilton
College initiated its IC project, they involved all staff from the library and information
technology through committee work and retreats in order to solicit buy-in and merge the
two cultures. An organizational consultant was brought on to assist with that process. Email and informal conversations were used to maintain consistent communication and
fill in gaps from committee minutes. As the teams agreed on new processes or policies,
they would be added to a growing print manual. The departments created a Protocol of
Conflict for the purpose of empowering staff to resolve concerns on their own as they
surfaced. Most importantly, written expectations were created so that each staff, the
staff as a whole, and the IC steering committee knew what to expect from each other
(McMullen, 2007).
Over ten years ago, the commons staff at Bucknell University developed cooperative
relationships amongst organizationally merged service functions. A staff-driven
reorganization plan and subsequent shared mission and values statements were born
from workshops, activities, retreats, and meetings. A shared commitment to serving the
student and greater institution was at the core of their efforts. In regards to job

69

descriptions and staff development, descriptions changed wherever necessary and
“people [were] encouraged to work in other areas depending on their skills and
interests” (McMullen, 2007, p. 20). The department instituted a job shadow program for
staff members interested in learning about other roles on the team.
The concept and implementation of the commons was not universally welcomed by
librarians and staff at University of Guelph (Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007). Librarians were
concerned that new services and activities would conflict with the role of the library, as
well as sacrifice needed space for non-library purposes. They did not want the LC to
supplant the library’s identity. The library and student affairs centers moving in used
professional and social activities, which helped to develop a mutual appreciation for the
“respective expertise of each group” (p. 253).
A Bennett (2007) study of 56 four-year institutions that possess collaborative
learning environments sought to identify indicators of success, focusing on changes in
administrative structure, increased spending, and cross-training. Cross-training was the
“most common indicator of success, with 82% of institutions surveyed reporting that
they provided cross-training opportunities” (Bennett, 2007, p. 167). A basic level of
cross-training allows all library staff to provide initial assistance, research a helpful
response, or refer to a local expert. McMullen (2007) also found that “nourishing the
staff in the commons environment through cross-training and opportunities for staff
development was a clear indicator for success“ (p. 20). If staff are not properly trained in
other library functions, user frustration may build, which will in turn demoralize
employees who are “working hard and doing the best they can with the information they
have” (Heitsch & Holley, 2011, p. 73). Training must keep pace with technology

70

changes and systems upgrades. Bailey and Tierney (2008) emphasized that training
“must be targeted and tied to likely patron needs, [be] effective and readily available to
staff, and in some way assessable in order to determine competency (p. 16).
Development must be ongoing, updated, and adaptive. As staffing a 21st century
academic library is not always affordable, training should also be adapted to meet the
needs of student employees (Steiner & Holley, 2009).
During Colorado State University’s IC transition process, “staff training and
technology competencies [were] retooled to support a tiered service model where
librarians and technical assistants work at a single service desk” (Beagle, 2012, p. 523).
The reference and IC desks were in different locations in the library, but both were
staffed by librarians, paraprofessionals, and students. One of the significant changes in
the CSU IC after the transition was the addition of productivity software, as it “was
agreed that library research and productivity software are essential components of the
scholarly process” (Steiner & Holley, 2009, p. 317). The library increased the number of
workstations from 120 to 200. Library leadership coordinated training tutorials to all staff
in order to prepare them to address any software and general technology questions that
could arise in the IC. A team composed of those most confident in these areas was
identified to provide ongoing support to the rest of the staff (Steiner & Holley, 2009). As
CSU continued to assess its changes, the IC recalibrated its pattern of service (Beagle,
2012, p. 523) to meet the needs of its students, as well as to adapt to changing
technology. The staff continued to be trained as necessary.

Challenges in facilitating library transformations
Library planners can encounter challenges through each stage of a transformation.
Financial considerations may be substantial at each stage. Access to capital funding
can be evasive; a tension the “pressure on institutions to reduce the capital investment
cycle time in order to remain responsive to rapid changes in technology, pedagogy,
scholarship, and user expectations” (Forrest & Bostick, 2013, p. 141). Library
operational costs are increasing faster than those of other units in the institution, and
access to funding is not increasing in kind (Stoffle, Leeder, & Sykes-Casavant, 2008;
Stoffle, Renaud, & Veldof, 1996, 2015). Decisions about library renovation or new
construction are generally made in the context of campus-wide capital planning, and
may have access to limited capital funding, or state resources if the institution is public
(Bennett, 2003).
Operational budget fluctuations can impact planners’ ability to make nimble
adjustments to meet learning needs, even as other expenses rise, such as journal costs
(Stoffle, Renaud, & Veldof, 1996, 2015). Even when funds become available, troubles
do not evaporate. Outside sources of funding for revitalized library spaces may include
grants, many which have rigorous timelines for planning and implementation attached
(Beatty, 2006, p. 71). Planners at the University of Calgary had one year to spend $2.2
million in grant funding to build its information commons.
Head’s (2016) PIL Library Learning Spaces study found that “a lack of control over
high-level decision making” (p. 3) was challenging for librarians, as in cases studied,
some senior leaders made early decisions without the impact of librarians, including the
selection of non-library service partners. Obstacles that led to delays in project

72

completion included stakeholder turnover, change in stakeholder priorities, and
financing issues. Communication barriers between on-campus planning teams and
architects may emerge, attributed to the differing values and professional training that
each group brings into the process, as well as negotiating tension between aesthetics
and functionality of the space.
While the library shares common goals with non-library partners, including facilitating
student success, collaboration offers challenges. Leaders facilitating new or
transformed library spaces that become host to multiple service partners face
integration of staff teams with different cultures and priorities, organizational ambiguity,
training, space, funding, and demand (Steiner & Holley, 2009). At the University of
Idaho library, “shared values did not translate to a shared service philosophy between
public service librarians” (Henrich, 2013, p. 232) and their new partners, specifically
around communication and use of a shared help desk. Risks for territorial feelings or
political maneuvering can be mitigated by keeping student and faculty needs as the
focus (Beatty, 2006). Open sharing of cultures and testing of assumptions can set up
collaborators for better understand of the different perspectives and priorities that are
brought to the table.
Solberg (2011) wrote of issues that plagued Seattle University’s project from the
beginning. LC partners were selected unilaterally by the institution’s provost, and not
until after the concept plan was created. These units were not familiar with the LC
concept. The pace of the project did not allow for a “leisurely exploration of concepts of
student learning and thinking holistically about how student learning might be enhanced
by new collaborative projects” (Solberg, 2011, p. 246).

73

Some stakeholders may struggle to see beyond the present to conceive the capacity
for a transformed 21st century academic library. In her dissertation on faculty
perceptions on the future of higher education and academic libraries, Malenfant (2011)
shared findings that some faculty participants perceived that many of their colleagues
are “still pretty entrenched in how they learned, rather than how they should provide
learning for future generations of students” (p. 111).
Leadership interaction with campus stakeholders during a space project
Strong leadership and the facilitation of a shared vision have been identified as
critical for implementing and succeeding in a change project (Kezar, 2001; Kreitz,
2015). Transformational leadership as “a process that changes and transforms people
is concerned with emotions, values…standards, and long-term goals” (Northouse, 2013,
p. 185). Literature on transformational library leadership is limited, but many descriptive
planning reports identify transformational behaviors and actions initiated by library
leaders to plan, implement, and sustain change projects (Kreitz, 2015). Researchers
describe the importance of a leader in understanding how library goals can align with
institutional mission, and then be able to articulate how the library can be accountable to
that mission (Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Henrich, 2013; Howard & Somerville, 2014;
Kreitz, 2015; Thomas et al., 2015; Umbach & Wawrzynski, 2005; Walker & Smith,
2013). Wilson (2012) described the University of Washington’s library strategic plan,
Building Sustainable Futures, as directly connected to the recently adopted campuswide Two Years Two Decades initiative. The approached allowed library leadership to
“better identify, prioritize, and communicate the Libraries’ contribution to the institution”

74

(p. 82). Defined outcomes and multi-method evaluation plans identify a path for
measuring success.
Leaders foster and maintain cross-campus relationships with campus partners
before, during, and after the transformation in order to solicit trust and buy-in, identify
additional financial sources, create collaborative partnerships with non-library units who
will be providing services, and fulfilling institutional goals (Andrews & Wright, 2015;
Bruns, Brantley, & Duffin, 2015; Chan & Wong, 2013; Head, 2016; Malenfant, 2011;
Somerville, 2015b). Leaders are cultivating a culture of change so transformed space
can be sustainable and therefore adjusted as needed (Head, 2016; Montgomery, 2015;
Neal, 2014). Library planners are also performing more research to enhance
understanding of educational pedagogy and the needs of their students specifically in
informing designs (Dryden & Goldstein, 2013; Thomas et al., 2015).
The requirements of library leaders for guiding other stakeholders through a change
is provided as background in the literature (Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007). Malenfant’s
(2011) dissertation research focused on understanding perceptions of the future of
higher education and libraries, and created focus groups to help faculty and librarians
share ideas and respective perceptions of future academic library capabilities using
scenarios. Faculty were selected for the research in order to help inform and integrate
this important stakeholder’s feedback into imagining the futures scenarios.
A challenging consideration for a leader in the development and ongoing
maintenance of a library, especially if there are integrated services with non-library
partners, is the tension between differentiation and integration, which is “separating
people or organizations into specialized roles where expertise can be exercised, but

75

then finding ways to connect them both organizationally and attitudinally” (Bess & Dee,
2012, p. 101). Staff members from different departments bring with them diverse
educational and professional training, and organizational culture (Bennett, 2007). In
order for coordinated services to become “synergistic and symbiotic, different cultures
must go through a period of transition and assimilation” (McMullen, 2007, p. 18).
At public institutions, productive relationships with senior campus leaders to ensure
alignment with greater institutional priorities could enhance the possibility for accessing
legislative appropriations (Somerville, 2015a). The University Library at the Auraria
Library at University of Colorado, Denver attributed success in securing a multi-year,
$26.8 million appropriation to support redesign and renovation projects to consistent,
customized messaging distributed to all parties who may interact with state leaders
including the President, Chief Financial Officer, members of the Board of Regents, and
the institution’s Government Relations team (Somerville, 2015a).
Kreitz’s (2015) recent dissertation represents an effort to identify leadership
experiences from library directors and other senior leaders through library
transformations at liberal arts colleges. She “examined a purposeful sample of four case
studies selected to reflect different ways in which college libraries are changing, how
institutional change and libraries interrelate, and the strategies library leaders use to
create change” (p. 62). In each of the four cases studied, library directors had been
hired specifically to lead change. One director described her strategy as ‘taking the slow
road’ through intentionally building trust and credibility of herself and the library staff to
the rest of campus, and learning more about campus; a period of “quiet capacity
building” (p. 148).

76

Another director took time to gather and study institutional documents describing the
college’s mission, vision, and strategic plans; she also interviewed key members of
senior leadership to identify any important additional goals that may not have been
included in the document. A third director needed to take time before initiating change to
build “staff’s skills, raise expectations, and change habits derived from campus
culture…[changes needed] to re-animate a team comprised of librarians and information
technologists to effectively support innovative faculty teaching methods” (Kreitz, 2015,
p. 133). The third director worked very collaboratively with senior leadership, including
the president and the provost, to identify strategies for aligning the work of the library
with the institution’s vision. For example, she worked with the provost to create “a small
scholarship technology center with librarians, IT staff, and a post-doctoral position
specializing in digital technology” (p. 136). Each ultimately aligned goals with the
college’s mission. Leaders focused on onboarding personnel and engaging the staff
with team building and engagement activities to develop the strongest staff possible to
bring the team forward. Additional themes were managing team morale, and fostering
positive relationships across campus from crisis. Kreitz identified contextual intelligence,
emotional intelligence, political acumen, and resilience as leader qualities necessary to
facilitate successful change.
Conclusion
It is necessary to understand characteristics and behaviors of library organizational
leaders who facilitate successful, sustainable change on their campuses. The
environmental disruptors necessitating change across higher education – including but
not limited to enhanced technology capacity and availability, changing learning and

77

teaching pedagogies, and increased accountability from the government and the public
– are not going away. All that is known is that we are to expect the unknown (Head,
2016; Wilson, 2012). Effective leadership can influence greater campus success and
innovation.
Forrest and Bostick (2013) integrated Pine and Gilmore’s (1999) The Experience
Economy when considering how library users interact with facilities today. They
described the evolution from the goods-based economy, to the service economy, then
supplanted by the experience economy, “where the target commodity is your
experience as a customer” (p. 141). When the perspective of library use is viewed as an
experience, the library begins to pay attention to all the factors that contribute to the
total user experience. A successful library learning space is measured “not by what it
has or what it does, by how it is used or the activities it supports, but what happens as a
result of those activities and encounters, the impacts or outcomes of what goes on at
the library” (p. 141). The next chapter will present methodology for this qualitative study
that seeks to identify the constructed experience of those organizational leaders that
collaborate with partners and stakeholders to facilitate successful learning space
projects.

III. METHODOLOGY
Introduction
Over the last 25 years, innovative higher education institutional leaders have initiated
the creation of library learning spaces in academic libraries on their campuses, pivoting
a library’s primary role from holding collections, towards cultivating an environment for
knowledge creation and self-directed learning (Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003, 2007,
2015; Head, 2016; Heitsch & Holley, 2011; Somerville, 2015b; Wilson, 2012). Learningcentered space design was catalyzed by the acceleration of the information technology
revolution (Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003), the emergence of the constructivist learning
paradigm (Barr & Tagg, 1995), and an increase in attention paid to customer service
and accountability in higher education (Appleton, Stevenson, & Boden, 2011; Forrest &
Bostick, 2013; Thomas et al., 2015; Walker & Smith, 2013). While the volume of
information was bountiful and access to these resources made easier without an
intermediary, librarians and partners leveraged changing conditions and expectations to
create high-tech and high-touch environments. Leaders sought to foster interactive and
interdependent facilities while maintaining space for quiet study and scholarly research
(Beagle, 2012; Lippincott, 2010; Thomas et al, 2015).
In the early 1990s, the Information Commons (IC) taxonomy was the first design
response to the changing environment, integrating library and information technology
resources, personnel, and services (Beagle, 2006, 2012; Forrest & Halbert, 2009). The
next phases of space designs began in the first decade of the 2000s included the
Learning Commons (LC) and Library Learning Spaces, which placed greater emphasis
on non-library service collaborations and far-reaching change that aligns with

79

institutional goals, and allows libraries to expand programmatic services and
opportunities that enhance student success (Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003; Head, 2016).
The revitalization of academic library learning spaces to meet the evolving needs of 21st
century students and faculty offers many challenges, especially if plans surpass
pedagogy and service changes to also include renovations, expansion, or the
construction of a new library. Commons terminology is dominant in literature, but
definitions vary, as does the language used to identify spaces (Lippincott, 2010).
How activities involved in creating or refreshing spaces are implemented is unique to
each institution, guided by goals for the space and its services. Through initial visioning
and planning, organizational leaders responsible for library projects may work with
executive leaders, faculty, students, facilities administrators, architects, and partners in
practice from outside of the library (Barratt & White, 2010; Chan & Wong, 2013; Head,
2016; Henrich, 2013; Kreitz, 2015; Malenfant, 2011; Somerville, 2015b; Walker & Smith,
2013). For implementation, each organizational subunit participating in the library
enters the space possessing a different culture, staffing structure, distinct role
responsibilities, unique physical space needs, budget concerns, hiring requirements,
and expectations for managing the demands of their constituencies (Steiner & Holley,
2009). In addition to managing external partners, within the library team a leader may
also need to negotiate changing job responsibilities and culture (Boyd, 2008).
The creation of innovative learning spaces in academic libraries represent the role of
planned and emergent change in higher education. How leaders engage with
stakeholders through a change can relate to its long-term effectiveness (Eby, Adams,
Russell, & Gaby, 2000; Katsaros, Tsirikas, & Bani, 2014). Literature on intra-institutional

80

design processes and student usability studies is abundant (Bailin, Bouchey, Nelson, &
Sherriff, 2014; Barratt & White, 2010; Chan & Wong, 2012; Dryden & Goldstein, 2013;
Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007; Somerville & Collins, 2008; Thomas et al., 2015). Fewer
studies bring focus beyond background information to how leaders engage others
through library space planning. Recent literature featured leadership strategies
employed at individual higher education institutions for facilitating collaborative learning
space design with architects, consultants, senior administrators, faculty, non-library
service partners, and other stakeholders (Howard & Somerville, 2014; Kreitz, 2013;
Wilson, 2012). Project Information Literacy recently released a report highlighting
results and recommendations from interviews with librarians, library consultants, and
architects representing 22 individual space planning projects, related to approaches,
challenges, and best practices in library facility planning (Head, 2016). While
librarianship is producing more literature highlighting necessary behaviors, traits, and
activities for leaders planning sustainable 21st century academic library spaces (Kreitz,
2015; Somerville, 2009, 2015), missing is qualitative research seeking common and
unique themes across experiences as leaders engage with stakeholders through
successful, transformational library space planning projects, as identified by their peers.
The purpose of this study was to explore a more meaningful understanding of
leaders’ experience facilitating library space projects at their institutions. Another goal
was to capture traits and behaviors that thread through these disparate individual
experiences. Outcomes may contribute a new perspective to organizational change
literature in the context of academic libraries and the greater higher education
landscape. Common and unique themes identified through data analysis can enhance

81

leaders’ potential to leverage considerations as they plan for their own design projects,
or similar change initiatives, at their own institutions. Executive leaders, such as
presidents and provosts, can also be equipped with information needed to identify
appropriate leaders to lead learning space planning projects on their campuses.
Research Question
This study sought to contribute to the growing body of change literature in academic
librarianship. This research explored constructed experience of leaders during recent
library space planning initiatives through the following research question:
How do organizational leaders experience engagement with stakeholders during the
creation of library learning spaces, from visioning through planning, implementation and
evaluation?
Methodology
As understanding of how leaders experience and facilitate change through a library
learning space design project was desired, a basic interpretive qualitative design was
used (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). The study sought to explore multiple perspectives of
organizational leaders who provided direct leadership to the academic library where the
space design project was taking place. This section will describe methods employed in
this study.
Research Design
A basic interpretive design was used in this research in order to identify common and
unique themes across organizational leaders’ stories, relationships, worldviews, and
feelings within the phenomenon experienced (Merriam et al., 2002; Merriam & Tisdell,
2016). A phenomenological dimension was emphasized to elicit feelings and incidents
that comprised the participants’ experience through the design process. Prompts

82

suggested in Moustakas’ (1994) instrumentation recommendations were integrated into
the interview protocol.
Participants in this study were organizational leaders who provided direct leadership
to the academic library hosting the space design project. Public and private colleges
and universities from the United States and abroad would have been considered for the
study, as recent library space projects are documented globally. Participating leaders
were from the United States and Canada. While several of the institutions included in
the study facilitated projects where planning and implementation was emergent over a
period of many years, spaces that were the focus of the research were completed
between 2011 and 2016. Leaders interviewed for the study were employed in their
position before or during early stages of the library space design project. Data were
collected through semi-structured interviews with participants who were asked to
provide a detailed description of the library space design experience from visioning and
planning stages through implementation and initial evaluation, including their personal
feelings and behaviors.
Additional, independent data sources were identified to corroborate findings from the
initial, individual interviews. Other data collected for this research included documents,
videos, and other artifacts related to the library learning spaces that were the subjects of
the interviews. Analysis of associated artifacts can enrich understanding of the context
in which the phenomenon experienced and facilitated by the leader subject took place
(Bowen, 2009). Elite interviews with experts on the topic of library space design were
also included as a data source, employed after initial data analysis of the other two
sources was completed.

83

Participants
Purposeful and emergent sampling methods were used for this study to promote
identifying “information rich key informants” (Patton, 2015, p. 298). A leader and
researcher in the library profession provided contact information to other library scholars
and leaders who had the capacity to identify recent exemplary library space design
projects and change leaders who could offer a unique perspective to the research.
These scholars often identified other researchers engaged in library space design work
who could provide feedback for the study and identify additional, potential leader
subjects. Patton (2015) emphasized that researchers may take advantage of
unforeseen opportunities after field work has begun to add to the sample.
Once potential participants were identified, they were contacted via personalized emails (Appendix A). Each message started with researcher background, an introduction
of the study, and information about the individual who referred them as someone who
could offer a valuable perspective. A video was also embedded that allowed potential
participants to see the primary researcher’s face, and to learn more about motivation for
selecting the study. They were offered a direct invitation to participate, provided details
about time commitments that would be required, and told of the nature of information
that would be sought through the interview. Finally, potential leader subjects were
invited to return contact by e-mail or telephone to indicate interest, and would then
participate in a 10-minute telephone call to clarify expectations and confirm the leader
“was an appropriate [participant for] the proposed investigation” (Moustakas, 1994, p.
106). This depended on whether the participant was willing to join in “an open-ended
investigation…willing to commit the necessary time and work that would be involved,

84

willing for the interview to be tape recorded and the data from it used in a doctoral
dissertation and publications” (p. 107), and that they would be the appropriate individual
to participate from their institution. At the end of the conversation, arrangements were
made to schedule the online video interview. As interviews were completed, participants
were asked to identify additional academic libraries and leaders that were qualified to be
solicited for participation in the study. During one interview, an additional leader from
the same institution was identified as a more appropriate contact for the identified
project. Data from both interviews were analyzed for the study; findings were clarified if
testimony from both leaders emphasized similar ideas.
Purposeful sampling was also employed to identify participants for elite interviews.
Potential elites were selected through a review of the literature, and solicited for
participation using individual e-mail messages (Appendix B). They were provided with
information about the research, and an invitation to participate based on the unique
perspective they could offer the study. Upon agreeing to participate, participants were
asked to sign an informed consent form and were given information about questions
that would be used to guide the semi-structured interview.
Instrumentation
A multi-stage communication process was implemented to enhance participants’
ability to fully address the central research question and prepare the participant to
“immerse him- or herself in incidents that stood out in the experience” (Moustakas,
1994, p. 108) prior to the interview. After the initial e-mail exchange and phone call, an
additional, individualized communication was sent prior to the scheduled interview that
contained: a summary of the phone conversation; the central research question; the

85

informed consent form, which could be read and signed electronically (Appendix C);
instructions for accessing the video conferencing program on the day of the interview;
and a short demographic questionnaire addressing characteristics of the leader and the
institution (Appendix D).
For the qualitative, unstructured interview, a guide was developed for reference that
included the central research question and probes to be used as needed (Appendix E).
The probes were developed partially based on Moustakas’ (1994) instrumentation
recommendations with the purpose of encouraging participants to provide more details
when necessary, or to ask to elaborate on their perceptions or feelings associated with
the events they described. Probes were also informed by organizational change and
library space design literature. Many probes were informed in the moment based on the
contribution of participants. They were also used to guide participants back to the
central research question if they were perceived to be straying off-topic.
Instrumentation for the elite semi-structured interviews was informed by data and
findings identified from initial data analysis of the (N=11) semi-structured interviews and
associated artifacts. The questions were provided to participants in advance (Appendix
F). Subjects were informed that the guide would provide a starting point and the
conversation could be re-directed based upon answers provided.
Pilot test
The interview question and probes were pilot tested with librarians not affiliated with
the study in order to refine the instrument, assess the degree of observer bias, and
adjust research procedures (Creswell, 2013). The pilot also provided practice for
conducting a semi-structured interview, and to ascertain appropriateness of the probes.

86

The conversation lasted approximately 30 minutes. Additional probes were incorporated
into the interview guide and were used as needed.
Data collection
Prior to the scheduled interview, participants were asked to read and sign an
informed consent form electronically, as well as to complete the brief questionnaire. As
the emerging sample represented libraries across the United States and abroad, an
online video conferencing software was identified to allow interviews to be implemented
remotely. Participants in the northeast United States were offered the opportunity to
schedule an on-campus meeting at their institution. One interview out of eleven was
conducted in person. Participants who engaged in the interviews online did so from a
private space, usually via their office or home computer. Each leader subject engaged
in the pre-interview communication plan to ensure they were prepared to offer a detailed
description of their experience through the library space design project, provide
informed consent, and understand the time commitment required for participation
(Moustakas, 1994). At the scheduled date and time, the participant logged onto the
video conferencing software using the link provided.
As the interview began, the leader subject was reminded of the purpose of the study
by hearing a brief summary of the research proposal (Creswell, 2013). As only a short
conversation was shared with each participant prior to the interview, each began with an
informal, social conversation to promote a relaxed, trusting atmosphere (Rubin & Rubin,
2012). Each participant was encouraged to pause to gather their thoughts and place
them within the experience before the central research question was read out loud
(Moustakas, 1994). The leader subject was reminded that they could conclude their

87

interview and participation at any time. Interviews were recorded using functionality
through the Zoom video conferencing program, with a hand-held USB device recording
additionally as a back-up. They were asked again to consent to being recorded before
the research question was read, and directed to the icon on the screen that indicated
the program was actively recording. The research guide developed prior to the interview
was kept close as a reference tool to be used as needed to promote as comprehensive
of an account of the participant’s experience of the phenomenon as possible. Since
leaders were provided flexibility to identify experiences most important to them as they
experienced the phenomenon, prompts were used, altered, or not used depending on
the nature of the individual conversation. The formal interview began with the reading of
the central interview question, to which the participant started their recollection of the
phenomenon experienced. Probes and follow-up conversations were used in direct
response to the account provided by the participant. They were allowed space in order
to provide long responses that encouraged them to explore a topic in depth (Rubin &
Rubin, 2012). They were asked to provide vivid anecdotes to fully illustrate their
leadership journey through the space design planning process.
After the conclusion of the interviews, documents and media connected to the
respective library space projects that were the subject of the study were identified for
analysis (Appendix G). Initial artifacts were discovered through the Internet, and leader
subjects were solicited after for additional information with a focus on documents
directed to internal audiences. Items collected for analysis included press releases,
library and institutional strategic plans, student and local news articles, magazine
features, and internal planning documents.

88

Two (N=2) elite interviews were conducted after data collected from the semistructured interviews and document review were initially analyzed. One participant was
a library researcher who has completed intrainstitutional research on library space
design projects, and the other was a consultant who has experience aiding institutions
in guiding stakeholders through space and service re-design. Both interviews were
completed remotely and recorded using Zoom conferencing software. While the
participants had received information about the study and interview guide via e-mail, the
interview was started with another brief introduction to the research before the
reiteration of the first question. Follow-up questions may have been added based on
participant responses. Both conversations reflected an interactive style, which is often
required when interviewing elites (Patton, 2015).
Data analysis
Once each interview was conducted and recorded, recordings were transcribed to
provide a foundation for data analysis. As transcriptions were completed by a service
(Rev), recorded interviews were reviewed alongside the transcripts in order to recall and
identify important non-verbal moments and pauses (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). The initial
review of the transcripts also informed initial jottings “on emerging reflections and
commentary on issues” (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana, 2014, p. 94). Transcripts were
reviewed again to identify units of data, small or large segments of text, that related to
the research questions. Lincoln and Guba (1985) asserted units must be heuristic,
revealing information relevant to the study, and also that “the smallest piece of
information can stand by itself” (p. 345). Codes were created inductively, and short
names were assigned based on language extracted from the data; a few code names

89

were identified based on knowledge of related literature (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana,
2014, p. 81). Recurring themes and regularities in the data were identified through
comparative analysis. Units were assigned to “categories…which bring these bits
together again…in a novel way” (Dey, 1993, p. 44). Both axial and analytical coding
strategies were used. Axial coding groups open codes, while analytical coding is the
product of reflection and interpretation (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Categories were
inductively created from units across data, then tested and confirmed using an
alternatively inductive and deductive analysis. Peer debriefing conversations occurred
after an initial set of categories were developed (Appendix H). The process allowed
discernment for identifying categories, which can be subdivided or “subsumed under
more abstract categories (p. 44) as needed. Categories were inductively created from
units across data, then tested and confirmed using inductive and deductive analysis
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Initial categories were adjusted based on peer debriefing
feedback and integration of organizational change frameworks. The final version of
themes identified a chronological element based on information shared through the
semi-structured interviews.
For the analysis of artifacts, documents and other media were annotated through an
initial review, and “pertinent information…[was separated] from that which was not
pertinent” (Bowen, 2009, p. 32). Codes developed through the interviews were applied
to artifacts through a second, more careful review of the data. Codes were assigned
based on content and the target audience of the artifacts. Codes and themes from the
initial interviews were also applied to data analysis for the elite interviews.

90

Trustworthiness
Information about professional background and general motivation for engaging in
the research was shared during initial and subsequent conversations with participants
(Patton, 2015). Triangulation strategies were employed in effort to “make it more likely
that credible findings and interpretations [were] produced” (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p.
301). Three independent sources for data analysis included the (N=11) semi-structured
interviews, documents and artifacts related to the respective learning space projects,
and (N=2) elite interviews. Peer debriefing was integrated into the data analysis process
through conversations with a non-participant librarian to review codes, initial themes
identified, and a proposed conceptual model (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) (Appendix H).
Member checking was used, as findings identified after analysis were shared back with
participants to be reviewed for accuracy (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). A reflexive journal
was started directly after the conclusion of data collection for the purpose of reflecting
on decisions made through the interviews, as a tool to reflect upon an appropriate
analysis strategy, and to serve as a real-time account of decisions and questions
encountered through data analysis and interpretation (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Rich,
thick description was used to present findings, and data discrepant to recurrent
categories were presented through data analysis (Creswell, 2013).
Limitations
The following were limitations of the study:
1.

By design, libraries and institutions possess unique qualities and mission
that cannot be controlled for in the study (Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003).

2.

Organizational leaders may or may not have had experience engaging with
stakeholders prior to the library space design project that is a subject of the
study.

91

3.

Most participants were not familiar with the researcher, and there is no way
to determine if each individual was completely forthcoming. While prolonged
exposure to participants was not possible, efforts to build rapport were
attempted.

4.

The sample was broadened to include both private and public four-year
higher education institutions of any size. Convenience factors for
engagement, including meeting at the participant’s institution and offering an
online conferencing option, were included to enhance opportunities for
participation.

5.

Prior knowledge and attitude may have influenced identification of themes.
There were no “objective…units, as they are constituted as a result of the
psychological sensitivity that the researcher brings to the task” (Giorgi, 2009,
p. 130). Perfect replication of the study is unlikely.
Delimitations

This research explored the experiences of organizational leaders who oversee
academic libraries that engaged in a recent library space design project. The following
issues are beyond the scope of this study:
1.

The perspectives of other librarians, as well as leaders and staff in nonlibrary subgroups that may be involved in the library transformation were not
included in this study.

2.

The specificity of the sample prohibited generalizing results to all academic
librarians who experience a library transformation; however, a thick
description of the sites was included, so that leaders applying these results
can appropriately consider characteristics of the institutions.
Summary

The role of the 21st century academic library is to provide spaces, expertise,
partnerships, and tools to facilitate student learning, as well as faculty teaching and
research, towards the goal of supporting their institution’s mission and success. The
library dean or director that provides effective leadership through a transformative

92

library space design project makes decisions in partnership through initial and emergent
planning with other senior leaders, information technology, architects, faculty,
development staff, academic support units, and more. While literature provides the
library profession with research related to identifying and meeting needs of student
learning preferences, traffic within library spaces, and description of initial and emergent
planning details, there is limited research-based findings of the role of leadership
engagement through library learning space design projects. Greater understanding of
leader experiences, traits, and behaviors is a gap that needs to be addressed.
The purpose of this basic, interpretive qualitative study was to identify recurring
themes representing how leaders experience academic library learning space projects
at their institutions. This study sought to contribute to the literature a greater
understanding of leadership through the design planning and implementation process,
as well as identifying actions associated with project success (Katsaros, Tsirikas, &
Bani, 2014). The next chapter, Chapter IV, will detail the product of the intuitive data
analysis process. This is followed by Chapter V, where conclusions and
recommendations are presented.

IV. FINDINGS
Introduction
The environment in which higher education institutions are situated has been
impacted by a number of disruptive forces since the early 1990s, including the
acceleration in the capability of information technology (Beagle, 2006; Bennett, 2003;
Foster, 2014), changing attitudes about learning pedagogy (Barr & Tagg, 1995), and
calls for accountability from government and the public (Appleton, Stevenson, & Boden,
2011; Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Thomas, Horne, Jacobson & Anson, 2015; Walker &
Smith, 2013). Innovative leaders in academic librarianship have been empowered by
their institutions to lead efforts to create transformational library learning spaces that
can effectively leverage the opportunities presented through these disruptions to aid the
institution in meeting its goals, now and in the future. The purpose of this basic,
interpretive qualitative study was to explore the experiences of senior library leaders
charged with primary responsibility for engaging with stakeholders to facilitate creation
of 21st century academic library spaces. The following research question was developed
to guide this study:
How do organizational leaders experience engagement with stakeholders during the
creation of library learning spaces, from visioning through planning, implementation and
evaluation?
The theoretical framework for the study was grounded in planned and emergent
change theories, both needed to foster outcomes that are sustainable and
transformational (Mossop, 2013). Moustakas’ (1994) instrumentation recommendations
and a review of the literature informed the interview guide for the study. Interviews were
conducted with (N=11) library leaders, who were asked to recount their experiences and

94

feelings through the visioning, planning, implementation, and evaluation of the spaces.
Artifacts associated with the library subjects were identified and analyzed to corroborate
findings from the interviews. Elite interviews were also employed to integrate the
perspective of (N=2) experts on library space design, to offer an alternate perspective to
the findings.
Overview of Principal Findings
This chapter presents the findings of this basic, interpretive study which explored
leadership experiences through the creation of transformational academic library
spaces. This study employed (N=11) semi-structured interviews as the primary data
source; document analysis and (N=2) elite interviews served to triangulate data and
findings from the interviews. Upon analyzing the data obtained, the following themes
emerged, also identified in Figure 1:


Input: Leadership Characteristics & Project Ignition: The leader subjects
entered their respective projects with a set of shared characteristics. Capability
and credibility to lead was identified by those in positions of authority at the
institution. Participants entered projects grounded by guiding principles for how
21st century academic libraries should facilitate learning and support institutional
mission. Leaders also reported possessing long standing relationships with
campus community stakeholders, or have the experience and capacity to build
them quickly. The catalyst initiating the library space project, or the connection of
the leader to the project, was either a charge from senior executive leaders upon
hire, or based on a leader subject’s diagnosis of a need for revitalized library
spaces to meet the needs of students and faculty.

95



Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, & Needs: The leader
subjects, and the progress of the project, were accountable to project drivers
through planning and implementation of the space design projects. In Figure 1,
this is represented by arrows directing to and from the planned change process
below. Driving the projects were reported as the institutional mission and goals,
those who provide higher authority and primary stewardship for identifying
campus priorities, and individuals or groups that influence project outcomes
through financial support.



Building on Relational Capital: The leader subjects reported continually
engaging stakeholders and partners through project planning and
implementation. The participant involved library personnel; engaged other
campus community groups, including non-library service partners; and integrated
external expertise, including architects and consultants. The nature and
importance of the relationships between leader subjects and these groups varied
among cases.



Persistence through Planned Change: Leader subjects initiated a series of
activities to provide informed, consistent communication and stewardship for the
shared vision of new library spaces. Whether planning required 12 months or 12
years, leaders creatively managed challenges as they emerged. Barriers
requiring thoughtful leadership response included changing financial
circumstances, stakeholder resistance to the new library vision, as well as
turnover in executive leadership. This is represented in Figure 1 as an ongoing
cycle, encompassing the stakeholder relationships.

96



Maintaining Sustainable Spaces: Leader subjects fostered development of a
sustainable academic library by creating spaces and systems they perceive will
be flexible and responsive to change. Some librarians leverage smaller building
projects in order to build confidence with the institution and propel efforts for
additional projects. As illustrated in Figure 1, upon initial completion of the
project, leader subjects employed strategies to evaluate use and relevance of
space and services, and respond as needed.

Summary of Participants and Institutions
All participants have worked in the library field for at least 20 years; the average
service to librarianship from leader subjects is 37.5 years. Eight women and three men
were interviewed. One individual identified her age as between 45-54, and all other
leaders were over the age of 55. At the time of the project, four leaders held the title of
Dean; three possessed a Vice Provost or Vice President title; two leaders had titles
equivalent to a Library Director / Associate Librarian (reporting to a Dean of Libraries);
and one leader possessed the title of Chief Librarian. In regards to institutional Carnegie
Classification, five institutions were Research 1: Highest Research Activity (or outside of
U.S. equivalent); two institutions were Research 2: Higher Research Activity; one
institution was in the Master’s Colleges and Universities: Larger Programs; and one
institution is Baccalaureate College: Arts & Sciences Focus. A comparable classification
for the tenth institution, located outside of the United States, could not be confirmed.
Seven institutions were public, and three were private. Seven library projects were
renovation and/or expansion of an existing building, and three represented brand new
library constructions.
The two elite subjects were not leaders or employed at individual libraries. One
participant conducts research within the library field. The other subject serves as a
consultant, assisting leaders with identifying library space and service needs at their
campuses.

98

Discussion: Leader Subject Interview Findings
Input: Leadership Characteristics & Project Ignition
Conditions set for the initiation of a library space project, or the introduction of a
librarian to project leadership, presented both shared and differing characteristics
across cases. The leader subjects entered the journey with experiences and qualities
that ultimately informed their work. Initial involvement on a project upon hire, or through
a diagnostic process initiated by the participant or a more senior leader.
Leadership traits and experiences. Participants shared attributes of trust,
credibility, and capability to build collaborative relationships that supported initial
leadership of the project. They entered the process with credibility, and trust from
executive administrators to lead. Sources of credibility included years of experience in
librarianship, specific experience with similar library design projects, or on-campus
reputation. The ability to cultivate trust within relationships with other partners was cited
as important.
Leaders described previous experience and knowledge about engaging in academic
library space design projects as enabling their credibility. One leader disclosed that he
was recruited to the position “with the idea that there would be a big library renovation in
the near future” citing recent experience with “library renovation and construction work”.
Another participant described her ability to leverage previous knowledge and
experience to propel the planning group forward:
I had done a lot of research. It was personal interest so I arrived with a lot of knowledge
about new learning spaces. I looked at the Educause Learning Institute. JISC in the UK. I've
been part of other building projects. I was very comfortable with what I was going to
propose.

99

The leaders also entered the project with either long-standing relationships with
stakeholders in place, or possessed the ability to initiate and foster necessary
connections. Four librarians who served at their institutions prior to the start of the
space project spoke about the importance of these standing partnerships:
We had a really long history of working with lots of different campus partners. In addition to
the traditional role where librarians are liaisons to an academic department like an English
department or a history department, we also have liaisons to a lot of academic support units.
[There are many] units that we've identified.

Having the trust of your partners and other stakeholders, including external experts, was
cited as important. One leader described his outlook on the development of credibility
over the course of a career:
You have to believe in yourself, but you also have credibility with the people who you have to
work with to realize the outcome. That kind of trust doesn't come easily. That kind of credit
doesn't come easily. That's something you build over a career. Then you just have moments
in which you, when you step into the fire, and you have a moment to exercise all the things
that have gotten you to that point. Sometimes, it feels like a fiery moment.

Another participant reflected on the “deep working relationships” and “complete trust”
among stakeholders that anchored space planning:
Very tight, solid, collaborative relationship. We had that. Moving into this transformation of the
building and the programs it was already a deep working relationship. A shared vision and
understanding of where we wanted to go, and needed to go, and complete trust in each other
that we could represent, kind of knew what each other was thinking.

One leader subject described how the value of understanding the role each stakeholder,
individually and as a member of a group with a specific vested interest, could contribute
to the progress of the project:
I mean, the whole thing is stakeholders and knowing who the stakeholders are and who
opinion makers are. You better have your relationships in place before you embark on
something like this because there's a lot of stirring and stress in a project like this.

100

Participants who assumed a project leadership role upon hire worked quickly to build
relationships within the library group and campus constituencies that would serve as a
foundation for future collaboration:
I do think relationships are really everything. Get the relationships right, that's where the
success lies. When I first came here…I said, "We're going to build a building but I'm going to
build relationships first." I still think that. Now I'm trying to enhance those relationships and
nurture those relationships.

Leader subjects entered the process with a principled vision, which guided their
approach to the library project and collaborative work with stakeholders. The foundation
of the vision was evidence-based, informed by personal research, student and faculty
feedback, and previous leadership experience. The librarians possessed understanding
of how a 21st century library could more ably facilitate student learning, support faculty
research and teaching, and offer collaborative opportunities with others to meet
institutional needs and directly contribute to fulfilling institutional goals:
I basically explained what I saw to them multiple times and then explained what I view [as]
the role of the academic research library on today's campus…which is that we provide a
space and services and collections to support student success, provide academic support,
and that we should be a place for all students.

One leader subject described principles supporting the charge that was given to
stakeholders participating in a planning sub-committee:
We [told] all of our partners, "Let's just imagine we're [removing everything from the current
space]. If you want those things to be part of the new vision of the library, here are a bunch of
principles that we've outlined." Services were meant to be designed where it didn't
necessarily need a lot of hand holding or interaction, that they could kind of figure things out,
because it was designed intuitively.

Another participant shared the goal that provided focus through development of the
institution’s new library construction, on a campus geared towards professional career
development: “Make a place for undergraduates. Be radically student centered. The
better advice, and the [fairer] advice, is be absolutely sure what you want to happen in

101

the space”. One leader subject reflected on the vision for the new space that he spared
broadly across his large library team, as he introduced them to a new mission of
service:
I think one of the challenges of leadership is to be able to create beyond the shared
conception of the people who, in the end, will be the ones to realize the outcome that are
really necessary to that outcome, both in terms of managing and supporting it, and the
people who will be the users…we had…principles in the vision [for] the building. One was
that it would be about knowledge creation… what we should be doing is designing the tools
with which students and faculty could create new knowledge, and that was giving them the
technologies, kind of spaces, the kind of individual freedoms that were necessary for them to
be creators…and to employ new means of analysis.

Leaders advanced their projects with a forward-thinking lens. Leader subjects
understood through research and knowledge gained from years in the profession that
“what [they projected] would be happening for 5,10, 15 years into the future…what
could we think about that would change the notion of what we offered in the building
and how it was offered”. One leader detailed her awareness of the importance of
financial investment, acknowledging that the full potential of a capital project needs to
be exploited as financial resources would not be as readily available in the future. The
participant also emphasized the necessity for the work done to be informed by
intentional evaluation:
The other thing that I wanted to mention is that in that planning process we wanted to make
sure that whatever we designed was future oriented, because we knew that we weren't
going to get money to come back and redo it. That it was student focused, because people
have a lot of ideas but they may not really relate to how students are learning and how they
want to. It had to be that, and it also had to be data driven and information driven so we did
a lot of research.

From the beginning, leader subjects endeavored to create space that was flexible and
could respond to ever-changing learning needs.
Project ignition. The initiation of the leader subjects’ involvement with the projects
varied across cases. The predominant experience was shared by six leaders; there was

102

at minimum a recognition or commitment by the institution that a library space project
would be necessary, and this was communicated to the librarian before or shortly after
hire.
Eight librarians representing seven institutions discussed the role of senior
institutional leadership as providing the charge to initiate campus conversations for
planning the library space project. While most of the leaders interviewed were
empowered to facilitate the process, initiative from the highest level inspired greater
engagement and acceptance of the project from the broader community. One leader
subject described the inclusion of a library renovation in the institutional strategic plan
as demonstrating campus commitment to the project: “We went through a strategic
planning effort during his Presidency. One of the projects that was highly rated to be
focused on in the capital arena was the library renovation”. Another participant reflected
on her first meeting with the university’s president, when he told her, “we’re going to get
you a new library”. A leader subject reflected on the positive impact of having the
planning committee appointed by the provost because “high visibility drew committee
members from across disciplines across campus…to have it be a provost level
committee meant there was a lot of attention, a lot of focus”.
In four cases, initial conversations about future library plans had already
commenced, and the new hires were brought on and assumed a principal role in
providing leadership to the project moving forward. One campus had “been working for
[more than a year], talking about what they hoped would be a new library” when the new
librarian arrived on campus. Another participant was promoted to her position after the
library dean “had brought in an architect…to run focus groups with faculty and students.

103

They [had already] created a document that outlined…goals for the project”. Other
institutions were waiting to act until the new chief librarian was in place:
University officials… had a significant portion of the funding available to them to build a new
library, and they had just hired a brand new university librarian to lead this process, and they
had just hired a new provost to work with this new university librarian to design the building.

Two library leaders had been serving in different roles within the library, then applied
and were offered a senior library leadership position. In both instances, the leaders
identified themselves as primary proponents for advocating for the re-evaluation of
space use within their libraries, and were empowered to take action through
commitment by the institution’s executive leaders:
I agreed that there was just no way in which we could just sit around for a year, or however
long it took [for new leadership to settle]. [The interim provost] said, so what do you want to
be doing? That was quite easy…

One of the participants reflected on her diagnosis on space use leading up to her
application for the promotional opportunity:
My boss left for another job, and her position came open… "Well I do have a pretty clear idea
of the kinds of things I think should happen." I did apply and I got the job…From having been
on campus for those…years before…it was pretty clear to me that nothing had happened in
that building for…years. There were so many things that [students] were doing as part of their
assignments and courses, part of the research that was expected of them, as a hallmark of
their…education, that the library just really couldn't deliver on.

A leader subject, newly hired, diagnosed the need for a building project upon arrival:
[No one mentioned] that there was space problem of any kind, during this whole exhaustive
interview process. So, I was essentially saying to people in my office, "Really? You forgot to
mention that you're out of space and we have to do a building project?"

Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, and Needs
Those responsible for providing overall leadership and stewardship for institutional
mission and priorities, as well as groups providing financial sponsorship for these
activities, determined if and when a project moved forward, and often determined as

104

well the shape the final project would take. Leader subjects were accountable to
institutional mission and needs through planning and project implementation.
Relationship with institutional executive leadership. The leader subject was
delegated responsibility for leading the project, but the whole process answered to the
authority of executive senior leadership of the institution including the President or
Chancellor, Provost, and often the Board of Trustees. Every leader subject discussed
their relationship with this group throughout the project process. Participants described
significant support for the project from the administration:
As far as the administration, a lot of support all the way up to the Chancellor for the role of
the library. Really good, positive, willing to put money, academic affairs willing to put money
towards renovating the spaces. Just needing the leadership and articulated plan for what
should the library's role be, what should the space be like, but really to support students of
all types.

Participants had varying experiences working with senior leaders as gatekeepers for
moving forward in the process. One leader in this study reported directly to the
President rather than a Provost; he described coming to the institution with the library
space charge in place, and having the opportunity to develop the library vision and
timeline alongside the small planning committee “but also with the President and with
the VP for Advancement”. Another leader, who also was hired to lead the new library
project, experienced more pushback in communicating her vision for space and service
to senior institutional leaders. She shared that they “couldn’t get their head around this
new vision. I think they finally got desperate and decided this was the best idea they
were going to come up with”. Another leader described the difficulty in selling the
provost on the necessity of the project when it was first introduced:
I believe I had a lot of credibility, in his book…so he was listening to what I said…but
essentially, his gut reaction always came from [scientific reason], and that made it difficult to,
to have him feel the passion that the rest of us felt.

105

Two leaders spoke of close partnerships with their provosts, connections partially
fostered by the virtue that they started their positions at the institution as about the
same time. One of those leaders reflected that “the provost was actually quite
knowledgeable about libraries in the 21st century, and he had some specific ideas
about libraries. He wasn't ignorant of some of the current issues”. Another participant
remembered that she and “the provost…were both new… and I think in a way that
helped because we weren’t burdened by pre-existing culture. He always said he liked
working with me…it was a very consultive process”.
The leader subjects needed to defer to the authority and charge of their superiors
through project planning and implementation. One participant articulated these actions
as “managing up…you can lead as vigorously, if you like, in a coherent direction, but
you always have to manage up. Everything that we wanted to do needed to be
consonant with the views of the new [leadership]”. At a time when revisions were
necessary, one leader subject had to bear in mind the preferences of the provost
regarding what services and features would remain in the space: “We knew what the
provost did not want cut. It was [none] of the learning commons space. The large open
student areas, he did not want [removed] ... Nothing we did would diminish the people
space.” Another leader spoke of revising plans to move particular services in order to
support the provost’s request to have more space available for student use:
The one major change was that the provost, I could never get him to understand this. I had
put in a special floor for [a service feature]…he said [it wasn’t appropriate for the new
space]…He didn’t buy the argument so that left the building.

Three of the librarians spoke of engagement with the institution’s Board of Trustees.
One leader described checking in with the board and its subcommittees in order to

106

obtain approval for each stage of the process. Decision points included permission to
select and hire an architect, as were donor access permissions:
That was what led to conversations with Board members as we started talking about the
size of the project and the money that needed to be raised for it… By this time we didn't
have to actually as some college librarians have to do. They have to convince the Board or
the college of the need for a new library. I didn't have to do that…. we went to the Board of
Trustees [subcommittee] first and we asked for their permission to select an architect….

Relationship with project financial sponsors. Senior executive leaders also
served as gatekeepers to the campus operational and capital budgets, access to state
funding, and access to donors. Leader subjects also responded to demands and
considerations of those who funded the space project. Costs may be partially covered
through institutional operational or capital expenditures, some had at least partial
funding from the state, and almost all projects required some fundraising from donors.
One space project was almost completely funded through an allocation from the
state legislature. The financial investment came with the stipulation that the project
would be completed within a prescribed amount of time. The leader subject described
that a “project like this would be something like...[4 years] and we had [2 years]”.
Decisions regarding space and services were also impacted by donors who gave
lead gifts to support new spaces. One leader subject shared that it was necessary to
manage expectations of donors and those connected to donors, as “when you’re
spending [this much money], there are a lot of parties that think they have a stake in
that, including the [lead] donor and the friends of the donor…The donors were great, but
they were players too”. One leader described making changes to a renovation scheme
in order to attract a potential major donor:
”Well, you need to add this, and we'd like to see more of this, and we don't like that at all but
we like this pretty well." We thought they were saying, "Well, you come back and we're

107
going to help you with this." We went off and did several months of work, kind of revising our
plans to accommodate what they wanted to see, we thought. When we went back they said,
"Well, that's very, very nice, but we'll think about it”.

While some solicitations were unsuccessful, others produced new opportunities. In one
instance, a service was added to the project based on a restricted gift from a donor.
Another leader subject described the financial commitment made by local industry
leaders who were “entrepreneurs, they weren’t intellectuals. They couldn’t be book
bought. They didn’t see that was the future”. Their desire to have the library focused on
learning skills that “they wanted to buy” supported a library vision grounded in
technology and innovation. One leader subject remembered the university showing a
major donor around the library’s aging building. It “was awful…exposed pipes, duct tape
on the carpets…[we] walked down the stairs and…[she] said, “we’re going to pay to get
this better”. As the project came closer to implementation, the leader emphasized the
need for the space to be “glitzy…as we wanted to make our donor happy”.
For another library, while fundraising was not necessary for the initial renovation, the
new spaces are being leveraged to attract donors to promote the ongoing development
and sustainability of the library:
Before [the space opened], we would only have been able to say to people, “We've got this
thing coming, and you'll have to wait until you can see it to know what it is, but we really
want you to be on board with it.” Now, we didn't have to do any of that, but we have [the
space] sitting, waiting for us, and we're gradually filling up that space with naming
opportunities.

Institutional mission and needs as project driver. All of the leader subjects
sought to align the goals of the new library learning spaces and services with those of
the institution. Many spoke to the overarching goal of enhancing student retention and
success. As one leader subject stated “analyze use data and make connections to
student success, GPA, student attitudes, all of those things as well. Now we have to

108

demonstrate how the changes in the library impact student success”. One leader
brought focus to informing her staff of the greater campus context through the process
to help them understand the role of the new spaces. She shared that
having the rest of the library kind of have a sense of what were some of the trends shaping
what we were doing…. How did we see things or issues or directions on campus going over
the next several years? How did we see that particular library fitting in?

Several leader subjects expressed excitement about the opportunity to leverage the
library to be “firmly placed…at the center of teaching and learning for the university”.
One leader expressed that
today, what we want is for a library to be an intrinsic element in the university's success.
That is a different view of libraries. That's one of the other central elements that I'll speak to,
because the library can ... If it ever could, it can no longer be great in of itself if it does not
serve the educational, and research, and community purposes that the university serves.
The two must be closely aligned.

Five of the leader subjects described the early process of identifying needs across
campus to drive the visioning and planning process. One participant described having
“conversations with other deans about what needs they were being asked for that they
couldn’t meet”. Another leader recounted the diagnostic process taken to identify that
centralized writing support was a feature that needed to be included in the new space:
There was a need identified, or we knew of a need of students. For example, writing support
was very distributed across campus. Libraries seem very broad-based. They kind of know
what's going on everywhere on campus, where individual offices tend to not know that. They
know what's going on in their unit.

An additional participant detailed his process to explore institutional needs, as well as
those of opinion leaders and resource collaborators from other functional areas. He
reached out to numerous academic leaders, a process that helped identify partners that
could also contribute financial resources to the project: “I had a great conversation with
[an academic administrator] about how we had space in the library, and if we wanted to

109

create a [specific] space there, we had the means to do it…he said, “this is great.”” A
librarian who was planning a for spaces at the time when the character of the greater
university was undergoing a transformation advised other leaders to
think about how the space in your library can be adapted to improve and speak to
the mission of the university by adroit use of that space for collaboration…we were able…to
come up with some areas where we could make some practical suggestions that would
benefit the university.

Building on Relational Capital
Building on relational capital refers to the capability of leader subjects to foster
capacity for building effective collaborative relationships and communication with
internal and external stakeholders at all stages of project planning and implementation.
Participants understood the unique role that each constituent group could contribute to
the process, and they possessed the capacity to be appropriately nuanced, sensitive,
political, and patient as the situation required. Sub-categories are leveraging library
personnel; involving campus community stakeholders; and integrating expertise of
external resources.
Leveraging library personnel. Initial planning for several space projects began with
discussion and collaboration within the library team. Three leaders identified one or
more project leaders to serve as a second set of eyes, ears, and hands. Participation
and buy-in was cultivated locally with substantial assistance from leaders of individual
functional areas who were empowered to make and lead change at their level. As space
planning moved forward, the philosophy and operationalization of library service was
addressed to meet the needs of 21st century students and faculty.
Nine of the leader subjects spoke in detail about how library faculty and staff were
involved in planning for the new space and service model. Four participants described

early activities that brought in all or many team members. One leader subject held
“retreats about…what is the space we have available to redesign…what would we do in
that space”? Another participant opted to start project planning by forming a “group of
subcommittees…created based on project principles”. One leader grounded “a strategic
planning session with the whole library staff” based on an article they all read that
described principles for developing 21st century academic learning space, and he
“keyed the discussion to those, and [they] worked through what the implication…would
be”.
Most librarians included members from the library staff on a core planning
committee, or aligned staff expertise with specific projects for the new space. One
librarian identified staff with “change genes” to sit on an early committee, and another
recollected including individuals from the information services team that “were sharp
and needed to be on it”. Another leader subject disclosed that while her staff was not
intimately involved with the planning of the physical infrastructure itself, they were
integral to “[lining] up the program ideas that were going to make the building operate
the way it needed to”.
Four of the leaders spoke specifically about the need to solidify the vision internally
with librarians and library staff prior to taking the message to other campus
stakeholders. One leader spoke extensively on the importance of securing buy-in for
leveraging project success. She stated:
I think you have to build buy-in with all different constituents, but making sure you start from
within. Because if you don't have the buy-in within, and the engagement of those folks, it's
going to fail. If they aren't on board with what their role is, they're not going to make it live and
support it.

111

Three other participants detailed the necessity of bringing their teams into the
conversation to ensure that they were moving the process forward with the same voice:
So, internally, you have to have everyone inside the library saying the same thing. You can
have outliers, everyone doesn't have to agree, but if you watch for the influential people and
make sure they're saying something similar to what you're saying, and, and then, really work
that, not just internally inside your organization, but across the campus dynamic, I think that
is what helps a decision happen.

Three subject leaders spoke of identifying at least one additional librarian to serve as
a project manager through the extended planning process. Responsibilities that were
delegated may have included serving as a “co-owner” with the leader subject, or
institutional representative for interacting with architects and contractors. They may
have also facilitated communication with the library staff, and identified and addressed
logistical needs with opening the building and implementing service partnerships. One
participant described the benefit at the time:
The way I envisioned it was really working with the library administration team and being
deeply involved in the project, but also, thinking it would be really helpful to have another
librarian who was also committed to the project and helping them have another set of eyes
and ears and hands for the project.

As the library space project neared its conclusion, the leader decided it would be
beneficial to “have a position like that continue, permanently”. Another participant
emphasized that the team needed someone to have responsibility for tending to the
needs of the library staff, as the leader would need to spend more time working with
stakeholders outside of the library. She described the project manager as
fantastic…this would've never worked out very well without her personality, her particular
personal skills…she would listen, she would go there and just listen and then she would tell
[the library staff] that it was going to be all right. And somehow, they believed her…she had
the responsibility for staff morale. I was, you know, only peripherally responsible for that
because I was doing other things…. It was essential to have somebody like that, who they
trusted and really liked. So, that, that personal attention through the most tumultuous
change, was really important, and you know, we were just really lucky that we had that
persona in our midst to help with all that.

112

Another leader subject identified more than one manager to assist whose respective
strengths aligned with communication and technological savvy required to move the
project forward, and were “the 100 percent time people” working alongside him.
Instead of designating a separate role to assist with the planning process, four of the
leader subjects empowered the library’s associate leaders to identify change in their
areas and motivate their teams to move the project forward. One leader described the
responsibility of her associate deans as being “in charge of bringing their teams
along…they literally brought the entire organization along with the planning as it
unfolded and we understood it better. Every single person in the library was oriented
and reoriented and reoriented”. Another leader described the role of the associate
deans as “having conversations, and then I do a lot of the outreach to the other campus
areas. Then I feed it back into the associate deans for them to continue the
conversations”. Upon opening, individuals in these roles were instrumental for
implementing how the space, new partnerships, and new services would be facilitated.
One leader stated that
you just have to rely on setting people a very clear charge. Here’s how we want it to
work. You need to work out the details of how to implement it, and then tell us how
much it’ll cost, then that gets carried back to leadership.

Six leaders detailed the impact the space project had on library service, both in the
short and long term. For two projects, the library buildings needed to be closed
completely during the renovation, with materials and services distributed across and off
the physical campus. Relationships with student life, facilities, and communications staff
were identified as essential for facilitating successful temporary library spaces while
buildings were being renovated, through making space available for service and
communicating changes as needed with stakeholders. Other leaders reflected on the

113

long-term vision of service that would align with the new space. One leader subject
described the service product as a “collaboration of the libraries [and other partners].
Truly a true collaboration. Not a cooperation, but collaboration, where you start seeing
your melding…and a really intellectual interchange between three different areas”. One
participant described in great detail the new values that would permeate space and
service, captured in that
they built into that new culture an understanding that when the new library was
going to be built, it was going to be start of the art. That everything was going to be ‘
centered on the student. It was going to be a place for students, not for libraries or
librarians.

Human resource concerns emerged that needed to be addressed, that were both
temporary through the renovation or new construction, or changed permanently based
on service changes within the library. One leader was asked upon arrival at the
institution to “restructure the library in a more effective, efficient manner” alongside the
physical infrastructure plans that would occur, as “academic affairs wanted it all, they
wanted to deal with the whole thing at once”. Another leader shared that parallel to
conversations of the building plan, several years were spent to redefine service. The
process held a
long list of questions that we walked through, and negotiated through, and fought
through…they began by, because we knew we were student centered, not just in terms of
what do we do, but they had to come up with a why. If they could not come up with a why
that was student centered, they had to rethink the process.

Two of the library subjects were closed during the building renovations, and job
descriptions changed to identify new roles and responsibilities during that time. One
librarian described this period:
[We had] temporary job descriptions and temporary job changes, uh, we had a lot of staff
change, turnover, I mean, people were generally okay with this, within the library, but, this
was a lot of change, all at once. So we had change management, and you know, sessions

114
on coping with change, and you know, support, basically support sessions for the library
staff.

The librarians and library staff were at the front lines of impact for space and service
change. Leader subjects acknowledged the patience that was required, especially
through uncertain times when decisions were still in progress, and then staff needed to
adapt to expectations and ways of understanding their roles within the new spaces. One
participant described the outcome of service change as “the whole boat lifting…and
when it did, everyone found a place. Everybody’s role is important, and everyone knows
it”. Another leader praised the patience and creativity of his staff during the transition:
We had to have some new staff, and some new roles and so forth. I got to give the staff just
unbelievable credit for their patience and their ingenuity in step by step learning the pieces
of the puzzle. The leader can provide the situation for success, and stimulate, and
encourage, and reward, but they cannot change the everyday experience of 200 people in
a very short period of time. When you one day were in the other building and now you're in
this, it's like, "How fast can you change?" None of us change that fast.

Facilitating campus community involvement. Leader subjects engaged with a
milieu of campus partners and stakeholders through the visioning, planning, and
implementation of the library space design project. Faculty, students, facilities staff,
information technology personnel, and non-library space partners were involved at all
stages. The nature of these relationships varied by virtue of their role, and perceived
stake in the project.
All of the participants described their perspective on faculty involvement. Six of the
leader subjects described soliciting faculty to be part of the core visioning and planning
groups. One participant discussed his philosophy regarding identifying effective faculty
partners; they had selected
key faculty members representing the various disciplinary areas of the college, and really
opinion [leaders] at the college…the only time you’re going to have a project like this, you

115
don’t just ask random faculty members or volunteers. You try to pick out who would be the
most useful, who’d be knowledgeable but also could move the project along.

Another librarian described selection of faculty “who expressed a lot of interest in the
library…and [those] whose departments had [adjacent] space”.
Outside of a core group, participants described conducting outreach to faculty who
had a specific stake in the project, or possessed expertise that could leverage success
for an individual element of the library space. Almost all of the spaces incorporated a
digital learning space or innovation lab, and so expert faculty were brought in “that were
advising…on that”. A librarian identified creation of a visualization lab as a “very specific
time we brought in scholars who had a unique set of knowledge who could guide us on
what was most important”. One leader described spending time at the institution’s
faculty senate, that “it was really helpful to be able to go…see a faculty member who is
part of an [academic] program…approach him and say, “have you heard the latest on
what we’re doing here”? Leaders engaged faculty more broadly as well, holding town
hall style forums, and inviting them into related projects, such as collection
management. “We managed the collection, and we reduced the size of the
collection…with full faculty involvement”.
The subjects universally engaged with students through library visioning and
planning. They identified that students were a unique group of stakeholders among the
rest, as undergraduates usually turn over completely every four years; as one
participant noted, “students who were there on the campus at the time we began are
going to be gone before the building is finished”. Another described the nature of their
participation:
It’s complicated because they are obviously short-termers. They’re really only here about
four years…for most of those students. Their attention is different. The idea of actually

116
hearing from students and some of the way we engage them was really critical, I think, to
why, how we design something that was meaningful to them.

As students are the library’s primary users, taking steps to understand them as
consumers helped shape the direction of the space. As one leader noted, “they’re not
super great at knowing exactly what they think about things, or having insight. They’re
really insightful about what their life is like right now, [with] pros and cons and
examples”.
Participants agreed and emphasized the importance of new spaces being completely
student-centered; leader subjects placed creative, focused attention to understanding
how students could leverage new space for learning using a variety of strategies. They
used quantitative instruments such as the LibQUAL+ instrument as a diagnostic tool,
and also employed anthropological strategies, using
sets of observations…[going] around and [documenting] what students were actually doing.
Where were they studying? What were they choosing? Were they in two groups? Were they
taking a big table and just sitting one person there? That was helpful. We also did surveys,
we had exit surveys. We had…snapshot surveys. We had an open survey to all the campus.
All of this was brought into our meetings.

Additional passive strategies, such as feedback boards, were also employed. Some
leader subjects mentioned having specific anthropological or assessment staff
facilitating these efforts. Three of the library subjects had student advisory groups
provide suggestions and feedback, and more had one or two student participants sit on
planning committees. One participant remembered that they “always made sure we had
students on the committee, though depending on whether they were studying abroad or
graduating, the students changed more often than the other individuals”. Leader
subjects also visited and engaged with student government groups, and hosted town
hall meetings. These conversations re-emphasized that the library “wasn’t just about

117

collections, and that [they] realized that by paying a lot of attention to our students”.
Students, as well as other stakeholders, were also invited to engage by having the
opportunity to try out furniture and provide feedback on other design choices. Social
media outlets including Facebook and Twitter were used to communicate updates to
students and other campus community members, as well as to solicit feedback. The
classroom was another place for students to contribute to the library space project; at
two campuses students had the opportunities to contribute through course projects.
Projects included an ethnography on student use in the library, and examination of
library sustainability projects. Students were also leveraged to help influence other
stakeholder groups, by representing the 21st century student that would benefit from a
21st century library. Most participants reported positive interactions with students
throughout the process, though one outlier described more challenging interactions
originating from an imbalance of distributed power through final project planning and
implementation.
Campus facilities staff, including chief facilities officers, campus architects, and
campus planners, were mentioned by all leader subjects as active members of planning
groups, starting at the initial visioning process. Aside from lending feedback and
engagement related to their expertise, several cited allyship with facilities leaders as
integral to the building project moving forward. One leader subject described the
campus architect as
brilliant’…[he] will bring every penny out of every dollar, [is] very, very set in his ideas.
Fortunately, he loved the vision so he became a strong ally. It was very important to get him
onboard with the project and its intention because some of it had never been tried before and
it was an expensive way to build...

118

Another librarian described facilities staff as “the most engaged of all of the partners at
that time, [and] it was because they were struggling with the building as is”. In this
instance, the chief facilities officer was the primary ally in rallying the senior leadership
to financially commit to the project. General commentary about the role of campus
facilities staff and planners were mostly neutral or positive, with two exceptions of
relationships that offered challenges to the leader through the process.
Half of the leader subjects identified Information Technology (IT) as having an
important leadership role through the change process. Their participation and buy-in
was needed, as the desired vision for the library included technological integration. In
three cases, IT possessed shared leadership in early visioning and planning groups:
I had to interact with the CIO as well about, okay what is the impact on the infrastructure on
the wireless and all that of changing this floor? Part of the process was, we had to upgrade
all the wireless in the building, which was bad before and now it's great. That was a key
relationship.

Nine of the librarians discussed the role of non-library service partners that
participated in the planning and implementation stages of the project, especially when
the project neared completion and before the facility re-opened. Groups included
teaching and learning centers, writing centers, and academic support services. One
leader reflected that
leading up to it, we had collaborators and stakeholders and decision-makers, but then once
there was a decision we had, um, far, like, 5 times as many people were involved, but they
were involved not to make a decision, but to implement the decision… there's an incredibly
collaborative loop there…between [these services]. So, for students, it's one integrated,
holistic support program, right there, for research assistance.”

Partners were invited for conversations throughout the process to identify the needs of
non-library services that would participate in the new space:
Those partnerships were being worked out in the pre-design phase and then when the
design began, we would bring them in for anything involved in the planning of the space

119
they were going to occupy. We would all try to reach consensus around what would work
best. Who needed what?

One of the librarians spoke of new classrooms that were operated in collaboration with
other offices. Agreements were established to coordinate training and assessment, and
logistics that would support faculty using the space. A few leaders noted the usefulness
of memorandums of understanding (MOUs) for establishing guidelines and boundaries
for collaborative work with partners.
One leader described her philosophy related to maintaining relationships with
implementation partners in the building:
We have empowered, in the truest sense, our partners. They are truly our equals. We give
them exemptions for everything in the building. They can schedule all the classrooms. No
one else can schedule. We say our philosophy around here is lean toward yes.

All of the library space projects involved collaboration with outside architects and
consultants. Six of the leader subjects described the selection of, and partnership with,
architects as integral, valuable moments and experiences. One participant described
her work with the architects as a “highlight of [her] career”. Another librarian discussed
her productive and collegial relationship with the architects and contractors,
remembering
they were so nice. It was so different than ... You deal with libraries all the time, and
librarians, to go out and talk to architects and builders it was fun. It was really fun…They
used their expertise, we used ours. I've read that sometimes there's a lot of conflict of wills
and clashing, but they listened so well. What do you want? This is what we want…Everybody
was excellent. We got super lucky.

The enthusiasm with which the leaders reflected on these relationships was among the
most palpable across the interviews. Leaders reflected on the importance of deciding on
an architect whose work would align with their vision of the new spaces:
I would also say that picking a really good architect was one of the very most important
things that we did because the architect could articulate what we already wanted but didn't

120
really know that we wanted… We also didn't spend a lot of time of asking people what they
thought should be done. What does this look like? We really trusted the architects to be bold
and bring in ideas from outside…this is also very important. They went with us to
conferences… We learned to speak the same vocabulary and to trust their judgement. I
mean, when I would speak I never got that well, you just don't know. It was always very,
very trusting.

One librarian described looking for a specific kind of connection with their partnering
architect:
We selected architects based on ... Essentially it came down to one question during the
architect interview… The only architect group that leaned forward in their chairs and began
to literally just riff with us…The one thing we can tell you for sure was what we wanted
students to do and how we wanted them to act. We didn't have any idea how to put a
building around that. The architects didn't assume that they did either but, oh man, they got
the concept. They got what we were looking for.

The leaders spoke of the ongoing partnership with architects and later, contractors,
through the process of attending conferences, cultivating a common language, and
navigating design decisions. Architects also provided assistance in facilitating
conversations with stakeholders to inform the process. The architects had a role in
working with the leaders to bring community voices actively into the vision. Three of the
participants shared that the architects facilitated design charrettes for librarians and
other campus stakeholders. One reflected on activities facilitated by their architect:
Well, I will also say that an important characteristic I think for people with successful
renovations is to be open, really open to new ideas and to really be future focused. The
architects actually invited us down to their firm…then we did all these design charrettes.
They're not librarians and we weren't architects, but we just shared about…”wouldn't it be
cool if”…or people have a certain idea.”

One leader described having a positive relationship with architects, but observed that
the partnership was not as integral as described by other leader subjects. She said that
in general, I think, we've had a pretty good relationship. I do hear at library conferences
when people talk about renovations to buildings, sometimes I'll hear what their architects are
presenting and think, "Why didn't our architect get that involved?" There are other times that
people will talk about the changes coming and I think, "Why was I the one doing that in our
project?”… I think I'm probably a pretty opinionated voice in the room. I think that that has

121
probably changed a little bit of maybe the dynamic between the architect and the client than
it might normally be.

Six leader subjects discussed integrating outside consultants to contribute an
additional expertise and perspective to the project. One participant noted that he
brought a consultant in early to lead workshops and conversations with the planning
committee and other stakeholders, as well as at the end, to “be sure that the renovation
of the new building was consistent with the best practices in academic libraries”. Two
leaders discussed bringing in consultants to facilitate activities with the library staff, “to
introduce new ideas to them that aligned with [the leader and provost’s] ideas”.
Consultants were also used to provide development and training to aid librarians and
library staff navigate space and service changes. Three leaders mentioned integrating
consultants from vendors to assist in facilitating conversations with stakeholders around
design and furniture.
Persistence through Planned Change
With the exception of one outlier library subject, space planning required at least five
years from initial visioning to initial completion. Some projects took upwards of 9 to 15
years to plan and complete. Leaders reported that consistent communication and action
was required to keep partners and stakeholders engaged and the project moving
forward. Leaders were proactive in actions and behaviors, but length of time and
disruptive environments required that participants respond to changing circumstances.
One participant stated:
This is a kind of process that while it had a certain flow, it wasn't like we suddenly had a
month in which nothing was happening. Decisions were made by the day. In the process,
[there were] many people that you interacted with. All of them were stakeholders in some
fashion.

122

Vigilant preparedness. For all of the projects, leaders facilitated a visioning and
planning cycle to prepare for the proposal that would be reviewed by gatekeepers, such
as presidents, Board of Trustees, donors, members of the legislature. In several cases,
the planning period overlapped with the recession, resulting in delays regarding a final
decision for moving ahead with the project, or financial commitments from the institution
and other possible funding sources. In such cases, leaders demonstrated dedication to
keeping planners and stakeholders engaged. One participant, who initiated program
planning shortly after hire, spoke of the recession’s impact on the project’s progress:
I started this project… and [shortly after], we had our economic crash across the country or
across the world or whatever. In the middle of trying to raise money for this project, we were
also kind of dealing with this massive economic collapse. At the time, the campus was
focused on considering layoffs. Several of the units had layoffs. There were hiring freezes,
of course. There were big budget reductions every year. Lots of other kinds of things
happening, people leaving and re-organizations. Just a lot of churn and stress and
uncertainty about what was going to be next.

One leader recalls his perspective on the prolonged visioning period; as there “was no
money, [there was] no scope to the project set by the [institution]. We were just
dreaming. In a sense it wasn't wasted effort because the most important features of a
renovation always rose to the top”.
The initial visioning and planning in the early stages when the future of the project
was uncertain contributed to a significant subtheme of the importance of vigilant
preparedness. Several leaders emphasized the alignment of readiness and opportunity:
I guess the moral of this part of the story is that you always have to be ready with something
like this. Just be ready to step in and say, "We've already done the hard work of bringing
together the coalition of people. These are some designs and we can do this."…being
flexible and being ready for those opportunities because they will come to who’s prepared.

The work needed to persist, as the leader subject was not sure when “the door [would
open]”. Another leader captured how she experienced this aspect of the phenomenon:

123
And nothing's happening. Then all of the sudden, everything happened. Everything
happens. All at once. So that's how it goes with a building project. You plan, you plan, you
plan, you plan, years go by, you plan, you plan, and all of the sudden something
happens...and you get to do it. So that's what happened.

One participant articulated the institutional context that contributed to this waiting period,
and the benefit of leveraging the opportunity to prepare for a call to action:
Anyhow, the provost, while constantly indicating he was pleased…for us to be thinking
about [a library space renovation…] also had all these other issues of. It was quite
frustrating because one really wanted to move forward more quickly, but you could see that
there was this much larger agenda that was being addressed, so you had to pick your
moments when you want to press forward, and you have to be ready when the moment
arrives, to really have everything in place for very rapid action… Having your plans gel and
coalesce, in advance of being asked to present them is, I think, the crucial part of getting
success in this area.

Leaders took a multitude of actions to enhance preparedness. Seven leaders explicitly
mentioned “doing your homework so that you have examples you can point to or
models that maybe exist, or don’t exist”. This was done through research to understand
what projects have been done at peer institutions, visiting libraries that have
endeavored upon similar projects, and attending conferences.
Themes associated with emergent change were embedded through the extended
planning process. At two of the library subjects, the space design projects that were
featured in the study were considered initial actions that would build momentum towards
addressing other spaces in the building. Two of the participants also pointed to smaller
scale plans that were implemented while planning for the more substantial project was
underway in order to build confidence in the later project:
The important thing about…the earlier renovation was that the campus community and the
Board of Trustees and the alumni could see that this building could really be turned around.
It really could be transformed.

124

Consistent, constant communication. Ongoing, consistent, nuanced
communication was required to keep all partners and stakeholders informed and
engaged through project planning and implementation. At the local level, librarians
employed numerous strategies to bring along other librarians and library staff members,
including all staff meetings and newsletters. One participant used town hall meetings
“regularly…[and] everybody in the library who [was] interested in coming [was] welcome
to come. There [were] updates on different topics”. Another leader subject used an
internal blog as a tool to facilitate ongoing communication with their library staff. More
broadly, leaders used many mediums to stay in touch with the campus community:
blogs, social media, articles or interviews in the school newspaper, town hall meetings,
electronic communication lists, and billboards. Several leaders discussed having
collaborated with the institution’s public relations department to coordinate marketing
efforts:
The marketing and communications people, were super important. Web-based
communications, mailing, news releases, we ran a whole internal, um, marketing campaign
during the time that we were moving the books, and moving all the people…We got help,
professional help, doing an internal marketing campaign with, with, um, tag lines, and logos,
you know, it was a really beautifully done.

A couple of leaders described consistent and constant communication with the
campus community. One leader subject identified the need to plan communication to
keep faculty and administrators continuously appraised of the library’s role on campus:
I presented to dean’s council, the [Faculty Senate]…that was thousands of conversations and
presentations, and then that’s going to have to go on…Because I didn't reach everybody,
they'll fall back to the old perspectives if they're not constantly replaced with fresh
experiences. At least with the students, there's some natural change over.

One participant described this form of communication as “leadership as repetition”:
Just keep saying it. And you say it, and say it, and say it, and pretty soon you hear all across
campus that other people are saying the same thing. So, your ideas repeated, and repeated,

125
and repeated end up being other people's ideas and pretty soon you have like a, a storm of,
of coinciding voices, all saying the same thing. And that's really, I mean, it's, it's funny to
describe leadership as repetition, but actually, there's something to it…where, you know, you
make your case and you make it well, and other people begin to own that case.

Several leaders described storytelling as a device to capture the imagination of
stakeholders in communicating a vision of the mission of 21st century academic
libraries. Two leaders shared the process of crafting stories to engage potential donors,
many of whom were older alumni of the institution. They described vignettes and
metaphors that would make the story relatable:
I begin to think about how am I going to explain to 100 alums who go back…how am I going
to explain what a library does now, which nobody mostly explains, but what happens now
that there's the internet? What is a library and what is this library going to do?... I met with
corporations. I met with banks. When we got donations I would go and kind of pep up the
story to accept the check from a donor…I'd get to tell the story about what we were trying to
do again…

Another leader describes collaborating with partners to develop a vivid, creative vision
report that could be circulated to internal and external audiences:
That's the beauty of writing and working with others outside the library. We were often way
too close to our services to really give them the lyrical, poetic [story] that they need. I'm such
a huge fan because it's often our users who can speak more eloquently about us than we
can about ourselves.”

Mitigating Financial Obstacles. Librarians were required to react as circumstances
changed. Six leaders described financial barriers as an obstacle through the planning
and implementation process, in the wake of the recession and resulting budget cuts;
and later, facing rising construction costs as the economy rebounded. Leaders were
pressed to make challenging decisions on behalf of their team, and then to manage
expectations for the community moving forward.
Four leaders described reducing the scale of the project as they adjusted to funding
that was available:

126
We were pretty intentional about everything we did. We had to do it where, of course,
everyone always wants more money. We had to make a lot of choices about things that we
really wanted to do that we had to give up on and come up with a different plan.

All of these participants described the process required to get the project under budget.
Most needed to eliminate some physical components of the project; one leader was
able to make up the difference through fundraising to enable inclusion of a unique
building feature. One librarian detailed a value engineering process,
…which means you go and you look at every single aspect of the project. What kind of wires
do you use for electricity, what kind of pipes do you use, every single thing and cut where
ever we could. We cut and cut, and got it down to a manageable size.

Another leader described negotiating demands of his senior leadership team and the
voices of the community through the effort to drive down the cost of the project. The
leader collaborated with other partners to preserve funds that would ensure integral
elements of the project would survive to final implementation and opening of the space.
“Then the Provost left, and that was interesting”. Six of the leaders discussed
challenges and opportunities presented that were the product of turnover of executive
leaders. In the presence of a “long project…you get a lot of turnover in senior positions
and that can be very, very challenging”. Whether the impact was positive or negative for
the perceived progress or outcome of the space, a re-education process was inevitable.
In some cases, the departure or installation of a key leader had a direct, positive impact
on a leader or project. In one instance, departure of a leader created an opportunity for
a participant to step up to principal leadership for a project. In another situation, a new
president provided a “real focus to the [institution] and a vision that prioritized the
completion of the library project”.

127

In other circumstances, turnover brought confusion, or differing perspective on
stewardship of the project. One leader captured the difficulty that emerged when those
with greater authority change directions:
You'd think something was decided and that's the path you were going along and then
someone else comes in and they have the authority to change that. I often felt you were
having to re-explain how something was done and why it was done and then it would
change.

Another leader described the challenge of assessing the level of authority she
possessed while the search for the person who would be her supervisor commenced:
“Before they decided who would step into [that] role, I was taking that role. That put me
in a position of making decisions without any authority, and trying to figure out what I
could decide, decisions I could make”.
“It was not all peaches and cream, truly”. Leader subjects were required to have
challenging conversations with partners and stakeholders through the process. As one
participant reflected, “it was not all peaches and cream, truly”. A common obstacle
representative of this sub-finding was the journey of bringing people around to embrace
a vision of the library that differed from the mission members of the community may
have been accustomed. The opportunity for critical engagement emerged both within
the library team, as well as through interactions with donors and faculty.
Four leaders spoke about the challenge of soliciting buy-in and understanding of the
possibility that the library space and service should be transformational, and not merely
an improvement on what had been done in the past:
[Staff feedback] presented a challenge, because they assumed a building very much like the
one they were working in, and so [what] they asked for, to a large degree, replicated the
existing organization of service, which identifies another aspect of the challenge. People are
going to come in to the process in many ways wanting an improved version of what they
already have, instead of a transformed version, and those are two very different things.

128

One leader discussed the challenge of introducing a new mode of service to her team
that would align with the mission of a 21st century academic library. A culture change
was the product of years of negotiation, development, support, and compromise.
Another leader spoke about the time required to “[have] people across the library, as
well as across campus, really start to get a sense of what the library was about”.
A few leaders mentioned the challenge of negotiating which library partners would
participate in the new space. One leader subject discussed having difficult
conversations with offices that wished to participate, but whose services did not align
with the overall vision of the building. She cited having responsibility for these decisions
with strong support from the provost. One leader shared that decisions about other
services that were brought in were often made at a higher level. Some services “that
were brought in…were, you know, as always there’s a space grab. Well, we need a
home for such and such so we’ll build that into the new building”. Another leader
described challenging conversations with library staff that were housed in the building
but would need to be re-located, a logistical consideration made more complicated in
that many impacted were not part of her reporting structure. She thought “that in a lot of
ways, you know, you did get the sense that you were the evil administrator coming in to
do this thing that people didn't like and felt was so uninformed”.
A topic that emerged universally across the interviews was the consideration of
physical collections. While several leaders reflected on the important role of special
collections to enhance the reputation of their library, more generally stacks would have
a diminished role in the new space. A couple of leaders spoke about having had the
ability to anticipate this change far in advance, and brought in faculty for collection

129

management conversations ahead of the renovation or new construction. Four of the
leaders described challenging conversations with librarians and faculty about the role of
books and other physical materials in the library. Those who were opposed to the
diminished role of books were said to have had an emotional response:
All libraries want to buy things, but nobody wants to get rid of them. There was a lot of
pushback from staff. A lot of pushback from faculty, in particular departments...That was the
hardest.... You can tell people as much as you can. You can send out billions of emails and
there's always the person that doesn't read their email and is stunned when something's
happening. Dealing with that was difficult.

Another leader described helping other stakeholders imagine a new library vision, while
encountering resistance:
Then I went to various departments on campus to discuss the idea of millions of books
moving off the campus, I certainly received a few stones and arrows from that process,
because, for some people, they could not imagine that. Once again, that was diminishing
the library that they envisioned. Introducing to all of those stakeholders a new and different
library, even though they understood those changes were taking place.

Political savvy and compromise were required to identify a resolution that would move a
project forward:
[The provost] is a person who truly understands politics…[he] created a book committee of
[faculty from] across all the disciplines… I was meeting with the faculty [for months]. I was
very directly involved…and that resolved it, it stopped the controversy, and it was done
through stakeholders.

Maintaining Sustainable Spaces
While the amount of time required to plan, and then build, the new library learning
spaces varied across cases, all new spaces were eventually completed and opened
once again for the benefit of the campus community. The leaders expressed pride and
excitement about the outcome:
I guess I would just say this was literally a very joyous occasion, extremely stressful. In the
end, a really awesome experience. It has been a long time coming. My thank you message
to everyone at the end of the day, I think, actually had about 80 people mentioned. I didn't
mention everyone by name. I just mentioned groups. It took us a lot.

130

Participants also shared the pride that they perceived was felt by other stakeholders,
including students, faculty, donors, and legislators. At one institution, a librarian
remembers a student exclaim, “is this really for us”? Another leader subject overheard
legislators sharing credit in their excitement of the final outcome: “They all came and
just…oh yeah, this is what we envisioned and this is great. Again, everybody was taking
credit for it. That was an important thing to say thank you and to really let them
celebrate their success”.
As initial fanfare subsided, leader subjects spoke of the need to collect evidence to
understand if what they intended to create was realized through the renovation or new
construction. This related to whether the design of the building aligned with how the
leader and stakeholders anticipated the space would work. One librarian described the
mindset she and her staff tried to assume as “egoless…[as] I think everyone has this
idea that there's going to be a lot of surprises. The only thing that will be really
surprising is if we don't try to get to the root of what it is and fix it”. One leader reflected
on the adjustment period required for the staff to acclimate to the capabilities of the new
space, and the adaptations that were made as needed:
There were some other things, and basically some structural problems that had to be
addressed. When a new building is finished, and this is not unusual, it's never really finished
on the day you move in. You have staff expecting everything to be perfect and to be, in large
part, as they envisioned. It takes some time to adjust.

Some leaders expressed surprise they felt, but not dismay, as they reflected on their
initial reactions to students using the space in unexpected ways:
I think one of the great things you've got to remember is that you can't be too stuck on a
particular vision of how students are going to use the library. They are going to use it. They
are efficient learners. They are spending long hours there and they're going to do what
makes them feel comfortable. [The architects] imagined that students, we have these
beautiful…chairs and…benches where you could plug in. They imagined students clustering

131
and waiting for class …Well, students immediately saw those comfortable chairs. They
pulled them over, put their legs up on the bench, plugged in and they weren't moving.

All leaders emphasized that ongoing assessment would be a priority towards
understanding how students and faculty were using new spaces and services, inciting a
cycle of evaluation and response.
You're watching it visibly and so the students tell us that energy goes up. We done a postoccupancy study…and it shows that what we intended to do is what we've done. The
students perceive what we did…. Give them this big playpen and see what they do with it.
Then they will tell you, as they go, what else they need.

Some leaders also spoke to implementing research to understand how library space
and service can leverage student persistence and success:
…we're looking to analyze use data and make connections to student success, GPA,
student attitudes, all of those things as well. Now we have to demonstrate how the changes
in the library impact student success.

Attention turned to firming up agreements and communication with building partners.
Some leaders described using regular meetings with partners and electronic message
boards to communicate with and bring together “all the people that didn’t report to
[them] who are in the building”. Some librarians spoke of developing memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) to establish guidelines for shared space and service. MOUs
were “really valuable, especially if you’ve got a working template”.
For spaces that offered more formal learning spaces such as classrooms or
presentation practice rooms, leaders mentioned inviting faculty to bring in students, and
learning how to use the spaces. One leader discussed evaluation procedures employed
to determine effectiveness of the training used to assist faculty in using the space:
Well, we continue to do assessment. We’ve done a lot of work. We have [active learning]
classrooms…they’ve been wildly successful by usage…We’ve done a lot of assessment
from the instructors’ viewpoint of the use of the rooms and from the student learning
outcomes as well…those studies were done in conjunction with [partners]…That once again
is a collaborative approach to the evaluation.

132

Two participants spoke of the completion of their respective projects as not the end
of capitol renovation, as institutional needs and evaluation of current projects will help
identify the scope and focus of future projects. In completing “smaller projects, [they
were] able to learn from what worked and didn’t work, and gotten information for the
student about things they want more of, what’s missing, what do they need to inform the
next project”.
One leader captured the essence of what it means to create a sustainable academic
library, one that can be resilient and flexible to the circumstances yet to be identified:
The library [will] continue to change…as fast as it had changed in the 20 years before. It [will]
change even faster in the next 20 years, and we [will] not know what that change [will] be, so
we should be designing and constructing a library that [fosters] continual change.

Supplementary Findings
Career transitions. An unexpected finding was the timing of the study in relation to
the leader subjects’ career transitions. A participant had been retired for a year; two
participants had recently retired, and three leaders would either be retiring or leaving
their positions within a few months of data collection. Some participants expressed their
appreciation at the opportunity to reflect on an accomplishment that was a capstone to
their career; perhaps, this may have inspired greater transparency in their participation.
Environmental sustainability. In addition to prioritizing space that is sustainable to
the evolving needs of the campus and its students and faculty, an unsolicited outcome
of the study is the goal of creating physical infrastructure that is environmentally
sustainable. Seven out of ten library subjects have either earned, or were in the process
of pursuing LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Certification.

133

Discussion: Document Analysis Findings
The purpose of document analysis was to corroborate findings identified from data
collected through the (N=11) individual interviews. An initial scan of information
available on the Internet was employed to identify artifacts related to the library space
projects, including campus communications such as press releases, campus and local
press features, social media communication, as well as photographs and video from
opening day events. Some institutions made additional artifacts available online
including library annual reports, project planning documents, as well as strategic plans
for library and the greater institution. Participants were contacted to solicit additional
documentation that could confirm findings; seven of the leaders replied. Additional
materials retrieved during this process included annual reports and strategic plans, data
collected from the library after the initial opening of the space, as well as conference
presentations and papers for which the respective library space was the subject. The
following themes were supported through the document analysis:
Input: Project Ignition and Leadership Characteristics
Limited documentation was available that corroborated descriptions of project ignition
and leadership characteristics. Through solicitation of artifacts, one leader subject
provided the very first e-mail sent that was identified as the original charge from a library
dean initiating the visioning stage for their space project. Another library subject had an
online wiki where information, including a timeline detailing each of the projects
including earliest conversations that diagnosed the need for a space, was posted. This
online repository also included guiding principles that framed project development.

134

Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, & Needs
A significant contribution of the document analysis was illustrating the role of the
institutional mission and strategic plans in serving as guiding principles through library
learning space planning and implementation. Artifacts included institutional strategic
plans and master planning documents, as well as library strategic plans and annual
reports created to demonstrate alignment to institutional goals. Eight of the library
subjects had campus-produced videos on their websites; almost all featured at least
one executive leader expressing how the work done will improve campus reputation or
enhance the prominence of research and learning activities at the institution.
Three of the videos also featured the projects’ lead donors. Institutions were adept at
identifying opportunities to recognize the contributions of benefactors. Press releases
from campus communications departments highlighted the act of the donation, the
background of the donors and the context of their gift, as well as their wishes for the
outcomes of the building. Identified through the Internet survey was a high quality
publication issued from one library subject that highlighted recent developments at the
library, information about contributions from donors, and also included a solicitation for a
contribution.
Developing on Relational Capital
Documents were identified from three institutions that provided additional support to
leader subjects’ descriptions on the specifics of how campus community members were
involved with project planning conversations. From one campus, documents reviewed
included the charge to the planning sub-committees, project mission, research reports,
as well as minutes and feedback from student focus groups and suggestion boards.

135

Three leader subjects provided copies of feasibility studies that provided information
about campus community members that were involved in those conversations; at one
institution, the information produced was co-created in collaboration with architects who
facilitated workshops with campus groups. One participant also included the e-mail
message from a dean to campus partners that represented the initial charge for the
project.
Student and local media outlets highlighted discussions from town hall meetings that
solicited feedback from students, stories shared about unique contributions and
suggestions made by faculty and students for the project; for example, a unique visual
addition that was the product of faculty collaboration was highlighted in a student blog.
Student work related to library co-creation projects were found through institutional
repositories.
Persistence through Planned Change
Venues for information sharing were identified online. Two blogs were found that
provided members of the community with updates about building renovations. Three
social media accounts – one Facebook, two Twitter – illustrated ongoing communication
about progress of the renovation, service opportunities, and provided opportunities to
solicit feedback from the community. Two library subjects displayed stop motion videos
to share a glimpse into progress made at the construction sites. Another had a
homepage designated for updates related to the renovation that included press
releases, photographs of the renovation, photographs of the artifacts used for marketing
the renovation, information about the project timeline, updates about modified service

136

locations, and detailed information about other channels the library would use to provide
updates to the community.
Information about collection management issues were identified. Internal information
related to work with faculty to complete this initiative were identified from two
institutions, and outside media features described conversations on this topic connected
to two institutions (three institutions total) highlighted. Feasibility reports produced by
the institutions also highlighted collections management and reduction efforts that would
accompany the renovation, with some containing plans for phasing the process.
Maintaining Sustainable Spaces
Document analysis had the most impact on supporting statements related to
evaluation and emergent change that occurred after the buildings open; due to interview
time constraints, life after library opening was not discussed in detail across all cases. In
addition, as most projects opened one year or more prior to the interview, supporting
documents including library strategic plans corroborated the work the library would do to
be flexible to change and contribute to institutional mission.
Six up-to-date library strategic plans were identified; all seek to align with broader
campus goals. Priorities universal across all cases include:









Developing librarians and library staff;
Fostering and maintaining collaborative relationships on campus and beyond;
Aligning outcomes with institutional strategic plans and goals;
Continuing assessment to support evidence-based decision making to meet
users’ needs;
Exploring assessment to understand and enhance connection of library use to
student learning and retention outcomes;
Innovating to enhance faculty research tools and services
Evaluation and improvement of learning spaces
Cultivating cultural competency of library staff

137

Discussion: Elite Interview Findings
Elite interviews were conducted for the purpose of corroborating findings from the
original (N=11) semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Subjects were
identified from the literature, and solicited individually via e-mail. The (N=2) elite
interview subjects were not leaders within individual libraries; they contribute to
librarianship through consulting and research respectively. They have had exposure to
many projects, and worked with or conversed with leaders who have completed new or
refreshed library learning spaces at their institutions.
Input: Leadership Characteristics and Project Ignition
Both elite subjects provided ideas with examples about effective traits and behaviors
of leaders entering a space project. The consultant subject discussed the important
balance of a forward-looking vision aligned with the tenacity to follow through. She
described the
combination of being able to really project your imagination into the future and figure out
how things could be so that they would work really well…[and have] the willingness to be the
person who just takes the heat, takes the responsibility, makes other people move.

The researcher subject also described vision as a common theme among initiatives
considered successful. Having a vision and translating it into a “statement…really
defined the project and drove it. [They] could always go back to it”. She elaborated
further, describing this
really was almost like a mission statement, although it was really a vision statement of
where they wanted to take that particular library, what it would be, that could always be their
calling card when they were boundary spanners and dealt with different stakeholders on
campus. To me, that seemed to be an ingredient for success.

The consultant subject described the necessity for the leader to completely “let go of
what they have right now”. This “letting go” included the possibility of taking risks to

138

imagine that an element of the library they may personally care about deeply may be
lost through the necessary transformation. She advised that
in order for leaders to be really good at this, you have to be able to imagine something
totally different from what you have right now. For an awful lot of people, that is not just
difficult, but close to impossible. They just cannot let go of what is long enough, even in their
minds, to imagine something different. The really great leaders can.

The researcher subject also mentioned humility, trust, and creativity as leadership traits
that contributed to learning space project success. Humility was described as not
hesitating to seek the expertise from others as needed. She also identified a pattern of
librarians quick to share credit with others, that “they’re very magnanimous in never
taking full credit for anything”.
This elite subject also emphasized the significance of having established
relationships with stakeholders before endeavoring upon a space project; many of the
librarians she spoke with wished that they had become “boundary spanners” sooner.
That way, when the library project was introduced, trust and credibility would already be
in place:
You’re really establishing that equal footing with these different stakeholders on campus
around issues well beyond the library. So that when you bring up the library, you’re part of
that group and command that kind of respect that the rest of the stakeholders have…you
can’t just show up and say, “I need something now”.

Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, & Needs
The consultant elite emphasized strongly that leaders must be guided by their
institution’s unique requirements; while librarians should do their research, they should
not be “lemmings”. She found blind replication “regrettable…[it] has led to a lot of really
crappy library space, because somebody builds such-and-such, and then everybody
wants one, and it’s no good…nobody ever stops to wonder how the space is being
used, whether it is really meeting needs”.

139

The researcher elite subject also emphasized the connection of library planning to
institutional needs, and the thoughtful work that needs to happen to align space and
services with the institution’s teaching and learning mission. Institutions “really don’t
have the same needs…as for teaching and learning, and the diversity of students and
student needs…it is a moving target”. The leaders also need to respond to executive
leaders and their “vague visions…the president that says “I just want this to be a center
of learning, the symbol of learning. Just show me that learning is going on here””.
The researcher elite subject discussed how donors are leveraged for space projects.
Involving donors in these initiatives is not just for the outcome of the donation, but it also
“[validates] the importance of the project”. Donors may restrict the gift, “[specifying]
something like a data visualization lab…they really wanted the eye candy”. Leaders
needed to work these requests into the structure if they were not part of the original
plan.
Building on Relational Capital
The researcher elite found that space planners do not collect data from users “as
much as you would think. Not at the beginning or really in process…yet user-defined or
user-designed comes up a lot”. She also identified the need for both faculty and
students to be considered end users. The consultant elite explained that while “it’s very
rare for faculty to initiate and take a leadership role”, there are stakeholders no more
important than faculty and students, as “scholars and would-be scholars” to be involved
in authentic collaboration as “owners” not “customers” of the library. She shared her
belief that in many projects, student and faculty participation and feedback is superficial,
“they have a focus group or they get input on what furniture to buy”. Suggestions she

140

made included “bringing [faculty and students] in, interview them, look at their work,
have them provide their specialist knowledge about their needs in various different
ways”. Those responsible for library design need to “know what people do, instead of
just assuming [they] know what people do”. The participant also described the
importance of identifying faculty expectations of students, and aligning learning spaces
with what is understood about work practices. Architects, as the design experts, can
respond with designs to meet those needs.
The researcher elite subject highlighted another important reason for why
collaborating with stakeholders is important for project success; aside from being
informed about user-needs, librarians generally do not come into this process with
project management expertise: “they’re really not trained to manage budgets of these
sizes: Nothing happens in a [Master’s in Library Science] program that would train you
for managing a $100 million project….they really don’t have the training…I think their
learning curve must be incredible”. Librarians who led successful efforts were effective
at bringing together partners who could bring expertise to meet gaps in the library
leaders’ experience:
I found people that led well said [they] worked with campus facility managers that do this
kind of stuff all the time. They knew how to source it. I might not have agreed with them, but
at least they had an idea of how to think about it, and how to think about how you spend
with a budget like this.

In addition to bringing in campus community stakeholders, librarians could hire
consultants to meet the need for that expertise.
Persistence through Planned Change
As the leader subjects in this study discussed the importance of vigilant
preparedness for the success of the project, the elite researcher subject felt in cases

141

she was aware of planning directives were not accompanied by the time leaders would
have wanted to produce an effective plan. She described the desired process as
“librarians do a lot of interviews. Architects do a lot of different meetings. They have
exercises for how to really just begin thinking about what they want. [Those I spoke
with] really felt like they got the short shrift”.
The consultant subject reflected on the approach of a leader she worked with that
strived for a “comprehensive plan so that even if she had to work with something piece
by piece, she would be working toward something that in the end would be very good”.
This strategy was similar to processes described by two leader subjects, who had, or
intended to, engage in a larger plan for which the current project was one piece. She
reflected on one leader who gathered stakeholders from “all kinds of different parts of
the institution” and kept them together, informed, and excited; “he [was] doing a million
things all the time, but he really knew what he wanted to do”. The researcher elite
captured the challenge of crafting a concise message or story that could translate to
diverse stakeholder groups:
Libraries are complex. They’re complex as hell. To be able to simplify it so somebody
understands what you’re doing, you’re really changing this whole entity from housing a
collection to be an open-ended learning hub. How do you explain that…to a provost, to a
president, to an architect, for that matter? To the public, if you’re doing an interview?

One surprise from an elite’s research was the length of time required for project
planning. She referred to management of space projects as “shifting sand” that required
“perseverance”; acknowledging that this is a feat when considering that as a leader
“they still need to run a library”. She described a communication best practice as town
hall meetings with various stakeholder groups to maintain communication over an
extended period of time. Leaders “have to over-communicate to keep everybody on

142

board”. She described the best leaders as “great communicators”, but consistency was
the most “interesting trait”: “How do you remain consistent on such a ground that’s
always moving underneath you as far as technology, as far as changes you identify”?
The researcher elite also touched on the “weeding” of collections that often accompany
space changes. Leaders needed to find compromise with the faculty if items from their
areas of study were removed; “they just wanted that collection there as a way to bolster
their particular discipline”.
Maintaining Sustainable Spaces
When asked about requirements for maintaining library spaces, one of the elite
subjects compared it to keeping up with an old home, describing it as “like living in a
fixer-upper, you’re always going to be redoing something in your house, it kind of had
that same feel to it”. She also spoke about needing to respond if the spaces are not
being used. The researcher elite subject reflected on a library whose students were not
using group teleconference rooms as anticipated; the technology evolved and students
could now access similar functionality on personal devices. Leaders “hedge their bets”
on the technology that will be relevant to students in the future. She also identified the
importance of recognizing where the project fell short; in some cases, work was not
done as expected or it did not meet the needs of students. Examples include insufficient
access to outlets, or IT infrastructure that did not meet the requirements of the project.
Summary
The data gathered from the (N=11) semi-structured interviews revealed five principal
themes, in relative sequence: Input: Leadership Characteristics & Project Ignition;
Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, & Needs; Building on Relational Capital,

143

Persistence through Planned Change; and Fostering Sustainable Spaces. Document
analyses and (N=2) elite interviews were conducted to confirm data retrieved from the
interviews, which supported the themes. Informed by themes identified in this study, the
next chapter, Chapter V, provides interpretation of the findings, as well as implications
for higher education leaders, and recommendations for future research.

144

V. SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Introduction
The acceleration in the capability of information technology (Beagle, 2006; Bennett,
2003; Foster, 2014), changing attitudes about learning pedagogy (Barr & Tagg, 1995;
Fink, 2013), and calls for accountability from government and the public (Appleton,
Stevenson, & Boden, 2011; Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Thomas et al., 2015; Walker &
Smith, 2013) are disruptive forces that have impacted the higher education environment
since the early 1990s. Innovative organizational leaders in academic librarianship have
been empowered by their institutions to lead efforts to create transformative library
learning spaces that can effectively leverage the opportunities emerging through these
disruptions to support the institution in meeting its current and future goals. The purpose
of this basic, interpretive qualitative study was to explore the constructed experiences of
senior library leaders charged with primary responsibility for engaging with stakeholders
to facilitate creation of academic library spaces. The following research question was
developed to guide this study:
How do organizational leaders experience engagement with stakeholders during the
creation of library learning spaces, from visioning through planning, implementation and
evaluation?
The theoretical framework for the study was grounded in planned and emergent
change theories, which are both needed to foster outcomes that are sustainable and
transformative (Mossop, 2013). Moustakas’ (1994) instrumentation recommendations
and a review of the literature informed the interview guide for data collection during
semi-structured interviews with (N=11) academic library leaders. During the interviews,
leader subjects were asked to recount their experiences through the visioning, planning,

145

implementation, and evaluation of the spaces. Analysis of related documents and
artifacts was used to corroborate data and findings produced by the initial interviews.
Elite, semi-structured interviews were employed with (N=2) additional leaders working in
the library field in other capacities, as a consultant and researcher respectively. These
conversations occurred after findings were identified from the initial (N=11) interviews
and data analysis; findings provided the basis for the four-question interview guide.
Additional perspectives that emerged from the (N=2) elite interviews were integrated
into findings.
Overview of Principal Findings
This chapter presents the findings of this basic, interpretive study which explored
leadership experiences through the creation of transformational academic library
spaces. This study employed (N=11) semi-structured interviews as the primary data
source; document analysis and (N=2) elite interviews served to triangulate data and
findings from the interviews. Upon analyzing the data obtained, the following themes
emerged:


Input: Leadership Characteristics & Project Ignition: The leader subjects
entered their respective projects with a set of shared characteristics. Capability
and credibility to lead was identified by those in positions of authority at the
institution. Participants entered projects grounded by guiding principles for how
21st century academic libraries should facilitate learning and support institutional
mission. Leaders also reported long standing relationships with campus
community stakeholders, or described experience and capacity to build them
quickly. The catalyst initiating the library space project, or the connection of the

146

leader to the project, was either a charge from senior executive leaders upon
hire, or based on a leader subject’s diagnosis of a need for revitalized library
spaces to meet the needs of students and faculty.


Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, & Needs: The leader
subjects, and the progress of the project, were accountable to project drivers
through planning and implementation of the space design projects. Driving the
projects were reported as the institutional mission and goals, those who provide
higher authority and primary stewardship for identifying campus priorities, and
individuals or groups that influence project outcomes through financial support.



Building on Relational Capital: The leader subjects reported continually
engaging stakeholders through project planning and implementation. The
participants involved library personnel; engaged other campus community
members, including non-library service partners; and integrated external
expertise, including architects and consultants. The nature and emphasis of the
relationships between leader subjects and these groups varied among cases.



Persistence through Planned Change Leader subjects initiated a series of
activities to provide informed, consistent communication and stewardship for the
shared vision of new library spaces. Whether planning required 12 months or 12
years, leaders creatively managed challenges as they emerged. Barriers
requiring thoughtful leadership response included changing financial
circumstances, stakeholder resistance to the new library vision, as well as
turnover in executive leadership.

147



Maintaining Sustainable Library Spaces: Leader subjects fostered
development of a sustainable academic library by creating spaces and systems
they perceived to be flexible and responsive to change. Some librarians
leveraged smaller building projects in order to build confidence with the institution
and propel efforts for additional projects. Upon initial completion of the project,
leader subjects employed strategies to evaluate use and relevance of space and
services, and responded as necessary.
Summary of Participants and Institutions

All participants have worked in the library field for at least 20 years; the average
service to librarianship from leader subjects is 37.5 years. Eight women and three men
were interviewed. One individual identified their age was between 45-54, and all other
leaders were over the age of 55. At the time of the project, four leaders held the title of
Dean; three possessed a Vice Provost or Vice President title; two leaders had titles
equivalent to a Library Director / Associate Librarian (reporting to a Dean of Libraries);
and one leader possessed the title of Chief Librarian. In regards to institutional Carnegie
Classification, five institutions were Research 1: Highest Research Activity (or outside of
U.S. equivalent); two institutions were Research 2: Higher Research Activity; one
institution is in the Master’s Colleges and Universities: Larger Programs; one institution
was a Baccalaureate College: Arts & Sciences Focus. A comparable classification for
the tenth institution, located outside of the United States, could not be confirmed. Seven
institutions were public, and three more were private. Seven library projects were
renovation and/or expansion of an existing building, and three represented brand new
library constructions.

148

Interpretation and Analysis of Principal Findings
Elements of planned change (Lewin, 1951) and emergent change (Bess & Dee,
2012; Burnes, 2004) were integrated with themes identified through initial data analysis
to provide a framework for principal findings. Findings represent the process
organizational leaders move through as they engage with stakeholders to facilitate
library space projects at their institutions.
Input: Leadership Characteristics & Project Ignition
Throughout the semi-structured interviews, leader subjects shared information about
their background and characteristics that they brought with them into the library learning
space projects. Trends participants described across cases included trust and
credibility, a forward-thinking principled vision, and experience or demonstrated ability to
build effective, collaborative relationships. Five leaders were hired externally with the
understanding that a library space project was forthcoming; an additional three leaders
were hired internally and had support and encouragement to assume leadership for
their respective projects. This hiring pattern is consistent with subjects in Kreitz’s (2015)
recent dissertation, where in each of the four cases, the leader was hired specifically to
lead change. One of the elite subjects interviewed also described this trend as
consistent with her findings. Study participants were positioned by experience and
philosophy to effectively facilitate planned change at their institution. One leader
subject’s proclamation that she would “build relationships, then build a building”, aligns
with the strategy of taking a slower road of “quiet capacity building” (Kreitz, 2015, p.
148) to foster trust before initiating formal planning. In reflecting on her conversations
with librarians charged with leading space design projects, an elite subject shared that

149

many of the participants in her research would have done more “boundary spanning”
work ahead of project planning if they were to have the opportunity to start again.
The principled visions that leader subjects brought into the process were grounded in
ideas considered best practices, echoing assertions from seminal library scholars
(Beagle, 2006, 2013; Bennett, 2003, 2015) and others who have written on Information
Commons, Learning Commons, and Library Learning Spaces (Bailey & Tierney, 2011;
Brown & Long, 2006; Head, 2016; Heitsch & Holley, 2011; Lippincott, 2010; McMullen,
2007; Schmidt & Kaufman, 2007; Somerville & Collins, 2008). Leaders and literature
described the importance of spaces being user-centered, a place that “fosters curiosity,
engagement, and life-long learning” (Forrest & Bostick, 2013, p. 40), and were guided
by the knowledge that success relied upon ongoing collaboration with senior executive
leaders and other stakeholders (Head, 2016; Howard & Somerville, 2015; Kreitz, 2015;
Malenfant, 2011). Both elite subjects spoke about the importance of vision,
corresponding with taking the responsibility “[to] take it on your own shoulders and
actually get it done” (elite subject). Leader subjects also recognized through visioning
and planning that the spaces they were creating were not just for the students and
faculty of today, but that they must also be flexible and responsive to needs as they
evolve for years in the future. In this same spirit, the Association of Research Libraries
(2010) compiled resources to aid institutions through scenario planning as they consider
potential but unknown circumstances that academic libraries would need to navigate in
the future.
In related seminal literature, Bennett (2015) asserted that not enough has been done
to align space with learning. However, leader subjects in this study described both

150

personal philosophy and activities that demonstrate value in these principles, including
assessment of learning within the space, and research and collaboration with faculty
and academic leaders. Through this process they elicited an understanding of how
space features and services could align with learning in formal settings, as well as other
academic department and greater institutional learning goals. Both elite subjects did
express that students are generally seen as the primary “end-users”, and that more
emphasis should be placed on the teaching and research needs of faculty. While faculty
were involved in some capacity in each case, explicit identification of faculty as an “enduser” was not consistent across the projects.
The ignition of a library space project, initiated by institutions’ senior executive
leaders or the library leader subjects’ themselves, represented the first step of planned
organizational change, a “decision by [a] system to deliberately improve its functioning”
(Levy, 1986, p. 6). Generally, factors informing that a repositioning of library space and
service was required included an acknowledgement of changing information technology,
learning, and accountability environment; an understanding of student satisfaction
based on LibQUAL+ assessments and other evaluation strategies; and recognition of
the recognition that the library might be repositioned to leverage institutional success.
That senior executives shared ownership and possessed authority for initiating projects
can aid in the unfreezing phase of planned change, as “to have it be a provost-level
committee meant there [could be] a lot of attention [and] a lot of focus” (leader subject).
Project Drivers: Institutional Authority, Mission, & Needs
Initial and ongoing individuals and factors driving planned change during space
project visioning and planning were described as senior executive leaders, other

151

financial sponsors, and the institution’s mission, goals, and needs. Recognition that
library space and services do not align with institutional needs helped catalyze the
unfreezing process campus-wide. Most leader subjects that participated expressed
senior executive leaders were partners in facilitating the unfreezing process with
stakeholders on campus. They were willing to provide overarching support, as they
recognized that change was needed. One participant reported to an administration that
recognized change was necessary, but the leader subject needed to engage in
persuasion through reframing, over an extended period of time, in order to test the
prospect of a particular approach and philosophy for a new library construction. One
leader needed to utilize multiple approaches to motivate unfreezing senior executive
leadership; the successful approach was based on physical infrastructure needs and
was initiated in collaboration with an ally. In this case, the individual was a facilities
leader representing the perspective that an older building needed to be addressed
through full refurbishment. Planned change is a systemic and conversational process
(Mantere, Schildt, & Silince, 2012; Schein, 1996).
Once unfreezing occurred, level of participation of senior executive leaders varied
across cases, but as the institutional authority their involvement directly impacted
change. Bennett (2003) stated that during research completed for his definitive essay
Libraries Designed for Learning, library leaders described having “invaluable support
from institutional officers, but very few described those officers as taking any ownership
beyond that of a broadly defined responsibility for the project” (p. 32). Somerville and
Brar (2008) described a strong investment from executive leaders at California
Polytechnic State University, where expectations were set that a new commons would

152

“revitalize…teaching practices” (p. 182) and that involvement stayed consistent through
the process. How leader subjects described involvement of executive leaders varied,
through more than half described very active senior leaders. Some provosts were
involved because they were excited and interested in the project, and one or two
participants described circumstances when they believed senior leaders were
overinvolved. As one leader subject noted, library leaders facilitating change must
manage up, as “everything that [they] wanted to do needed to be consonant with the
views of the…leadership”.
Decisions about refreshing library spaces or new library constructions were often
made in the context of institutional capital planning, and so access to funding must be
strategically negotiated (Bennett, 2003). Executive leaders were gatekeepers to donors
and other financial stakeholders also held an important role through planned change, as
the financial investment made created the parameters through which other plans were
designed. Contingencies tied to funding from the state legislature or donors included
time constraints, inclusion of particular services into the space projects, or through
supporting specific outcomes of the space project. Funding shortfalls “[can slow] library
design progress” (Head, 2016, p. 24).
Previous research regarding the role of 20th century academic libraries in supporting
institutional mission and goals coincided with the testimonies of interview participants
when reflecting about steps taken to identify project goals. Through an ACRL report,
Oakleaf (2010) asserted that academic libraries possess capacity to support enrollment
goals, facilitate student learning engagement and learning, and provide faculty with
needed teaching and research efforts. They can help meet the institution’s over-arching

153

goals, including those that may have previously been beyond library scope (Beagle,
2006; Simmons-Wilburn, Donovan, & Bender, 2008). Participating leader subjects
described the process of diagnosing institutional needs; some were informed by direct
conversations with academic administrators or faculty, were communicated to the
leader subject by a senior executive leader, or guidelines established through an
institution’s strategic plan or mission, corroborated by direct connections made in
respective libraries’ strategic plans. As Wilson (2012) described efforts to align
University of Washington libraries with campus-wide strategic initiatives, the desired
outcome would be to better allow library leaders to “identify, prioritize, and communicate
the libraries’ contribution to the institution” (p. 82). Both elite subjects emphasized the
necessity for leaders to have “done their homework,” while making decisions that do not
merely replicate other libraries but creates space that “meets [an institutional] need”.
Building on Relational Capital
As leaders involved stakeholders within the library and across campus, they
engaged in unfreezing and changing activities to introduce ideas supporting a 21 st
century academic library, and involve others in the creation and implementation of the
vision. Building relational capital refers to the credibility of the leader subjects to foster
effective communication and collaborative relationships across the institutions through
all stages of project planning. Involving “organizational members in the planning of the
change so that they will feel ownership of it and be committed to it” (Bess & Dee, 2012,
p. 807) can contribute to productive planned change activities. Elements of collaborative
design are integrated into action with all stakeholder groups, including external
resources such as consultants and architects. Participatory design is a strategy that

154

equitably involves designers and users, which can encompass faculty, students,
librarians and library staff, and other users (Foster, 2013, 2014; Somerville, 2015b;
Somerville & Collins, 2008).
Locally, library leader subjects provided a strong vision for how revitalized space and
service should serve the community. They employed a variety of strategies for
facilitating participation, including staff with “change genes” on planning committees,
matching expertise with specific projects, and engaging whole staffs in discussion and
planning retreats. The leader subjects provided primary leadership for stewardship of
the process, but recognized effective, lasting-change would be best accomplished
through empowering associate leaders to share responsibilities and to secure buy-in
locally to leverage successful collaboration at the campus level.
Somerville (2015) discussed organizational conditions that are considered when
integrating “informed learning and systems theory [to promote] changes in
organizational…behavior” (p. 59). A tension exists between acknowledging the library
as an individual entity that also should behave symbiotically with other institutional
personnel and functions:
“While fulfilling a function in relation to the larger whole, the part in itself is an autonomous
whole, which includes parts and properties that exhibit functional relationships to each other,
producing inter-connectedness and interdependencies between organizational parts and
their purposes. Workplace learning outcomes therefore necessarily include collective
alignment and shared understanding of the organization’s purposes and priorities, which
guide fiscal and human resource allocations, as well as day-to-day decision-making and
long-range direction setting” (Somerville, 2015b, p. 49).

Aspects of Somerville’s (2015b) Informed Systems approach captured efforts from
some leader subjects to introduce new ideas about space and service to library
personnel. As current ideas and practices are based upon a “worldview consisting of
existing interests, experiences, and values” (p. 57), leaders need make tacit ideas

155

explicit. Most leaders described steps taken to initiate a “transformation, not a refining of
organizational work, and internal relationships…a basic rethinking of the…assumptions
under which library personnel work is necessary” (Stoffle, Renaud, & Veldof, 1996,
2015). A few library leader subjects used retreats, focus groups, and other professional
development activities to introduce and foster a new shared vision for thinking differently
about capacities for learning spaces and their individual contribution; to think about
space that goes beyond “just an improvement [from what they are used to]”. Once
change is implemented, staff development and training have been identified as
contributing to project success (Bennett, 2007; McMullen, 2007). Training needs to keep
pace with developments in technology (Heitsch & Holley, 2011). Five leader subjects
spoke specifically to training opportunities provided to personnel to adapt and enhance
new models of service, and increase attention paid to customer service. Leaders are
responsible for tending to what needs to happen locally at the library to promote
effective change, while balancing, introducing, and integrating needs and requirements
that are introduced outside of the library.
The mission of the Learning Commons and Library Learning Spaces, phases of
space design that emerged in the first decade of the 2000s, are pervasive across
institutions (Head, 2016). The Learning Commons often incorporates services that
“complement the mission of academic libraries” (p. 8) including faculty development,
writing centers, and tutoring (Bailey, 2006; Beagle, 2012; Head, 2016; Lee &
Schottenfeld, 2014). Bennett (2003) encouraged the role of integrating campus
stakeholders as “an immense source of strength in keeping projects focused on learning
priorities” (p. 227). Processes should be developed together that promote “learning,

156

innovation, coordination, trust, open communication, participation, adaptability, joint
planning, and problem solving” (O’Brien & Richardson, 2015, p. 197). All of the library
subjects from the study incorporated services from at least one other office in the new
library spaces, and participants reported involving parties from these groups in planning,
especially as it related to specific space and service those groups would occupy. Library
Learning Spaces prioritize “learning that deliberately complements formal classroom
activities, programs, and experiences that contribute to student learning” (Head, 2016,
p. 9). Six leader subjects spoke specifically to conversations that occurred with faculty
and academic administrators that were focused in making direct connections between
the needs of their departments and students and how it connected to specific services
and tools that would be a part of refreshed spaces. A leader subject described efforts to
train and assess faculty who were acclimating to use of new active learning classrooms.
Two participants expressed challenges in collaborating with non-library partner
stakeholders; even when partners share common values, different cultures and
priorities, as well as organizational ambiguity, can be barriers (Henrich, 2013; Steiner &
Holley, 2011).
Two library subjects benefitted from formal collaborations with student courses to
help inform space planning, akin to contributions made from graduate students in the
design program at Florida International University to develop design proposals that were
informed by campus stakeholders (Ball & Pereira-Pujil, 2015). Student involvement in
these instances brought in research to inform space and service priorities.
While attention to student learning is paramount, customer service and student
satisfaction cannot be ignored (Chu, 2014).

157

External partners may assist in the facilitation of collaborative design, or expertise in
a particular aspect of the project may add credibility to leaders’ work with stakeholders.
For example, leader subjects used consultants to substantiate plans at the start and
finish of the project to increase validity of plans, provide opportunities for library staff, or
provide additional, credible voices to the conversation in efforts to bring along librarians,
library staff, and other stakeholders to the new vision of the library. Consultants are able
to understand and translate language from stakeholder groups and explain “meanings
so that designs took shape and projects could move forward” (Head, 2016, p. 21).
Architects worked collaboratively with many library leaders to facilitate discussion
workshops with faculty, students, and library personnel, as well as conduct design
charrettes. Involving parties from outside of the organization that possess credibility can
be a strategy of initiating change successfully (Bess & Dee, 2012).
Interactive, learner-centered, collaboration-centered, collaborative design is “both a
philosophy and a process in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users play a
role at each stage of the design process” (Somerville & Collins, 2008, p. 808). Design
visioning and implementation have democratic and participatory intentions that integrate
constituents who are users of designed spaces (Bannon & Ehn, 2013). One of the elite
subjects asserted faculty and students as “scholars and would be scholars…should be
the ones who [should] always be pushing this”, and that they should not be considered
customers, but owners of the space. Bennett (2003) also stated that library design
should represent a deeper understanding of the active learning behavior of students, as
well as expectations of and activities employed by faculty to encourage and support

158

those behaviors. He continued that creation and maintenance of learning spaces need
to be driven by learners.
While both faculty and students participated in the visioning and planning of library
learning space design, the extent of the centrality in their involvement varied across
cases. Student involvement of some kind was integrated at each institution at each
stage of the process. Despite their status as “short-term” stakeholders who are not
always “super great at knowing what they think about things” (leader subject), or who
are new to college and have yet to have experience to allow them to articulate their
needs (Blaylock, Briden, & LaFleur, 2013), leader subjects strove to keep their
requirements at the center of the project. The intentionality by which faculty were
involved were more varied; six leader subjects described vigorous involvement with
faculty that informed space and service that was a direct response to needs expressed
by academic departments and schools that would meet the needs of students in their
programs. Several leader subjects discussed faculty involvement on the central
planning committee in a broader representative role, and faculty were involved heavily
for consultation through collection management projects. Two leader subjects described
more direct engagement with faculty in the space after the project’s completion. Due to
time constraints through interviews, the complete extent of engagement with each group
may not be fully known.
Persistence through Planned Change
Melalman and Palmer (2015) emphasized that they did not believe Lewin (1951)
would claim planned change to be a straightforward, rational process. Leader subjects
recognized that persistent and consistent action was required in order to keep ideas

159

associated with the change present, and stakeholders engaged and motivated to help
move the project forward. As one participant stated, stakeholders “will fall back to the
old perspective if they’re not constantly refreshed with fresh experiences”. For the six
leader subjects that needed to keep stakeholders involved over years before the project
was approved for formal planning and implementation by senior executive leaders,
some participants described using collaboration as a vehicle to keep stakeholders
focused during challenging times. “Within our project, we sort of just kept moving on
with the idea that we were going to keep getting our idea together…” Participating
leader subjects described planned change experiences where time required to execute
change could not be anticipated and varied across cases, where creative, continued
vigilance was required to encourage stakeholders to stay committed and involved, and
that critical moments would arise that would test their leadership and political savvy.
Even in circumstances when participants enjoyed general support from senior
executive leaders to plan for a library space project, final commitment to continue formal
plans may be delayed because of a deficiency of financial resources, the emergence of
other campus priorities, and turnover in senior executive leadership. Head’s (2016)
study identified a shift in institutional priorities as a cause in moving a project forward.
Decisions about library space projects may be made in the context of a campus-wide
strategy (Bennett, 2003).
Most leaders encountered turnover, either partner or senior leadership, through
project planning and implementation. They experienced this as “interesting”
developments, as moving forward involved re-education of necessary stakeholders and

160

learning a new management style, as well as to endure project delays. Head’s (2016)
PIL study found that
by far, the biggest cause of project interruption in [the] sample was staff turnover. In some
cases, a change at the executive level impeded progress already made on a library learning
space project, or moved it further down the list of priorities. (p. 24)

Many leader subjects experienced such a leadership shake-up; their verdict as to
whether turnover benefitted their leadership or the progress of the project itself was
split.
All leader subjects needed to negotiate with members of the campus community,
including library personnel, faculty, and donors, about what the mission, services, and
resources a 21st century academic library should possess. One elite subject also
discussed the challenge of managing conversations around collections management, or
“weeding”, with stakeholders, especially faculty. Malenfant (2011) shared findings that
some faculty participants in her study believed many faculty colleagues were
entrenched in old ideas about how students used to learn, as well as the libraries that
supported them.
Several leader subjects needed to address financial barriers through all stages of the
project, as a shortage of financial resources caused disruptions requiring thoughtful,
informed decisions about the future of the project. Leaders then needed to
communicate and manage expectations of library personnel and other stakeholders
moving forward. Head (2016) explained that repercussions of funding shortfalls could
slow progress of space projects, to the extent that it could take “years to complete most
projects” (p. 24). Several leaders encountered this issue while projects were in
progress, forcing them to make challenging decisions to eliminate structural features, or
reduce the scope of the project more generally.

161

Maintaining Sustainable Spaces
The charge of the 21st century academic library is to “continually recreate itself as a
place that fosters creativity, engagement, collaboration, and lifelong learning” (Forrest &
Bostick, 2013, p. 140). Learning spaces cannot be built and left untended (Beagle,
2006, 2012; Forrest & Bostick, 2013; Sinclair, 2007). Through initial plans, leader
subjects reflected that a goal of transformative spaces is that students themselves
“would be managed by students themselves, as their needs change frequently”
(Bennett, 2003). As one participant advised, library space planners “can’t be too stuck
on a particular vision of how students are going to use the library…[they] spend long
hours there and they’re going to do what makes them feel comfortable”. Head (2016)
stated that the majority of architects and librarians interviewed for the study emphasized
creating flexible, user-spaced spaces, including valuable and customizable furnishings.
On the other hand, the possibility exists that aspects of the space may not be
completely functional upon the final reveal, and that evaluation, as well as anecdotal
observation and use, can inform adjustments. A few leader subjects and an elite subject
discussed initial steps taken to address building structural issues, including electrical
capacity and IT infrastructure.
Oakleaf (2010) proclaimed the role that academic libraries have in providing
evidence-based value to the institution; efforts of the participating leader subjects
represent the profession’s efforts in fulfilling that promise. Several leaders spoke to
previous or future work to “analyze use data and make connections to student success,
GPA, and student attitudes…[demonstrating] how the changes in the library impact
student success”. This priority aligned with current research emerging in librarianship

162

seeking to understand how accessing library services may relate to freshman and
sophomore retention to the following year (Murray, Ireland, & Hackathorn, 2016; Soria,
Fransen, & Nackerud, 2014). Attention to greater student success and demonstrating
value to the institution was indicated as a priority in the six library strategic plans that
were analyzed through document review.
Upon initial completion of the project, leader subjects emphasized the necessity for
ongoing evaluation to understand how students were using the space, and respond as
needed. Leaders acknowledged that space transformations “don’t start and stop, they
continue to go on and change”. A few participants shared they created positions that
would have significant focus towards “ongoing assessment, of continuous
improvement”. Emergent change is defined as the ongoing adjustments people make in
“their everyday work practices in response to local conditions” (Bess & Dee, 2012, p.
808). While leaders set the conditions for emergent change to happen, the strategy
integrates more emphasis on potential for de-centralized change in addition to other
change catalyzed by centralized evaluation. As one leader reflected on service
integration, “all those intricacies need people who are, on a day-to-day basis, familiar
with them, so you can’t do that at the leadership level. Here’s how we want it to work.
You need to work out the details of how to implement it, and then tell us how much it’ll
cost, and then that gets carried up to the leadership level”.
The aspiration to maintain sustainable space upon initial completion requires a
refreezing, suggesting that “unless organizational members are frozen into their new
attitudes, values, and work patterns, they will revert back to the old ones in the absence
of reinforcement” (Bess & Dee, 2012, p. 807). Actions leader subjects employed to

163

propel the mission of revitalized space and service included the creation of positions
responsible for ongoing assessment of the space, the creation of MOUs to clarify
responsibilities for offices providing integrated services, and communication
mechanisms that foster new traditions for sharing of responsibilities. Leaders also
entrenched new attitudes through integrating these ideas into future goals. Through
analysis of library subject strategic plans, all contained references to aligning efforts
with institutional goals, such as creating assessments to understand how library use
may relate to student success and retention, and evaluating space for continuous
improvement.
Summary
Library leader subjects that serve as leaders for the development and
implementation of library learning space projects shared key experiences and traits.
Most of the leaders had participated or led space design projects in previous roles, and
the rest had strong ideas as to what needs could be met through a space project,
grounded in research and knowledge of their institution. All described a principled vision
they brought into the process which contained elements corroborated in the literature
including being student-centered, forward-thinking, high-tech, and providing space and
service that supports institutional mission, goals, and needs. Library leader subjects
described possessing trust and credibility from executive leaders and other
stakeholders. They entered the project with functional relationships with stakeholders
already in place, or were hired possessing capacity to foster productive connections
quickly. Elite interviews confirm that vision and commitment to carry it through is
required for successful leadership through a change. ‘

164

In most cases, initiation of space projects was top-down, identified as a priority from
senior executive leaders. Three leaders, who had been employed at their institution
prior to assuming responsibility for the project, identify themselves as primary
proponents for a project that had initial support from senior leadership as well. Eight of
the leader subjects were hired with the understanding that a space project was
imminent, and three of those eight were hired in the early stages of space planning
already in progress. All of the projects had the support of senior executive leadership,
though timing and scope of that support would vary across cases based on institutional
priorities, and access to funding. The senior executive leaders, in addition to the
institution’s Board of Trustees, were gatekeepers to funding, be it institutional, access to
donors, or legislative appropriations. All of the leader subjects discussed the role of
institutional mission as driving their space planning, and about half described in detail
the process taken to consult with executive leaders, academic deans, and faculty to
ascertain needs that could be leveraged through library staff and service.
Participants needed to build on relational capital across stakeholder groups through
project visioning, planning, and implementation. Locally, leader subjects described the
work done to introduce ideas about capacity of a 21st century academic library for
facilitating learning and knowledge creation, and how services would need to be
transformed alongside space. Leader subjects delegated some leadership
responsibilities to a project manager or associate leaders, who helped bring the rest of
the library personnel around, and were also empowered to make change in their
respective areas. Participants recognized the short-term nature of students as
stakeholders, but they were considered central to the process. Leaders employed a

165

variety of strategies to understand what students wanted and needed, and how they
learned. Leaders formed student advisory boards, engaged student government groups,
held town hall meetings, and engaged in various studies to understand student learning
in library spaces. Faculty were integrated at different levels across cases, ranging from
membership on core planning committees and direct consultation for space
development, to having opportunities to provide feedback through town halls. Elite
interviews emphasized the necessity of faculty and students to be engaged as “owners
and not customers,” and that they should drive planning through at least equal
participation to library personnel. Other important stakeholders included facilities staff,
information technology personnel, and non-library service partners. Library leader
subjects described generally positive collaboration experiences with service providers,
with exceptions described in two cases; service agreements and MOUs defined terms
of collaboration. Architects and consultants were often brought in to provide a credible
outside perspective, or help organize collaborative design workshops.
The nature of planning a library learning space project was not short or straightforward; the planning stages of projects generally continued for several years before
construction began. Several leaders spoke of the importance of early planning to gather
stakeholders and develop a vision as “opportunities come to those who are prepared”
(leader subject). Constant, consistent communication strategies were employed to keep
stakeholders engaged over an extended period of time; a few library subjects described
their role as a storyteller to introduce the ideas of the new library to other stakeholder
groups. Participants encountered common challenges along the way. First, not all
stakeholders were easily sold to ideas associated with the new library, including a

166

reduced role of physical collections. Leaders described strategies for influencing those
parties, and applying sensitivity and diplomacy in their approach. Most projects also
encountered financial obstacles in the form of increased costs and insufficient funding,
which caused many leaders to make challenging decisions about the scope of their
project. Turnover of executive leaders was also disruptive, and would necessitate a reeducation process and possible project delays, though may also have provided positive
outcomes and renewed focus for the leader and project.
Activity and engagement would continue through construction, and then all
stakeholders could celebrate the opening of the new spaces. From that point, leaders
addressed unexpected issues, and endeavored to understand if the outcome was what
was expected, using a variety of evaluation measures. All leaders spoke to the
importance of assessment, and many explicitly addressed initiating systems to connect
library use to greater institutional goals. Three of the leader subjects described plans to
use positive outcomes from their projects to drive new developments elsewhere in the
library building.
Recommendations for Policy and Practice
Recommendations for practice


For executive leaders searching for a librarian to facilitate change, the following
characteristics and experiences were deemed necessary by leader subjects or
identified based on the findings: Experience or extensive knowledge of principles
guiding library space design; evidence of persistence and managing through
challenges and uncertain times; experience and confidence with evidence-based

167

decision-making; experience building and maintaining collaborative relationships
with campus and external stakeholders; and fundraising.


Many of the leader subjects struggled to identify funding for library learning space
projects. If one does not exist, library leaders should cultivate a library friends
group, or establish a connection with development officers, to identify prospects
that may serve as champions of a space project, as well as to create a
sustainable source of funding to maintain refreshed spaces.



Even if a project is not imminent, library leaders should exploit opportunities to
immerse themselves in the greater context of the institution, including mission,
strategic plans, accreditation reports, etc., as “opportunities come to those who
are prepared” (leader subject). Foster meaningful, collaborative relationships with
academic deans, faculty, student life personnel, and administration to understand
how the library can help meet their goals. Such actions can inform future action,
and provide evidence for competency to build relationships and influence
stakeholders when executive leaders endeavor to confirm future leadership of
the library.



Elite subjects spoke of the importance of viewing faculty as “owners” and “endusers” of the library. Library leaders should include faculty starting at the earliest
visioning stages, incorporated in planning groups as well as in research to
identify how library learning spaces can support research and teaching.
Participatory design principles emphasize that equal collaboration with “scholars
and would-be scholars” (elite subject) ensures the space continues to meet the
needs of faculty and students.

168



While successful library space design projects provide tempting examples for
replication, institutions pursuing new or refreshed library learning spaces on their
own campus should ground visioning and planning for their own spaces to reflect
campus mission, goals, and strategic plan. Intentional, authentic, collaborative
engagement with stakeholders can reinforce focus on mission and student
learning.

Recommendations for further research


This study focused on senior library leaders who provided primary stewardship
for facilitating a library space design project. Several leaders identified project
managers or associate leaders that provided supplementary leadership,
especially as it related to communicating messages, training and developing
staff, and managing staff morale. The role of mid-level managers through a
change project should be investigated; that is, how does one integrate a mandate
from the project leader, while providing appropriate challenge and support to their
staff?



Senior executive leaders possessed primary influence over the initiation and
prioritization of library learning space projects at leader subjects’ institutions. An
inter-institutional study should be conducted to explore perceptions of executive
leadership on the role of the academic library at their institution, their opinions on
how it can leverage institutional mission, and perceptions on their relationship
with library leadership.



Many of the leaders did not discuss in detail their background or previous
experiences that may have contributed to their readiness to provide leadership to

169

a library learning space design project. A study should be conducted that places
greater emphasis on the perceived experiences of project leaders prior to a
project that enhanced their readiness to assume leadership through a change.


Most of the leader subjects who participated in this study were facilitating change
at Research One Universities. Studies should be conducted that focus on library
space projects at smaller, regional institutions.
Conclusion

Higher education has a responsibility to support campus space and services that
address environmental disruptors, including increased capability of information
technology, changing attitudes about learning pedagogy, and calls for accountability
from the government and public. Innovative leaders in this study were empowered by
their institutions to lead the creation of library learning spaces that could leverage
opportunities and meet the challenges offered by this volatile environment. These
veteran, experienced library leaders shared their stories and reflections on what was for
many, the capstone experience of their career.
This study interpreted the constructed leadership experiences of leaders within
librarianship that facilitated significant library space projects on their campuses,
successful as defined by referring peers. Dimensions of their stories were corroborated
from associated artifacts, as well as reflections from experts who contributed a different
perspective to the role of leadership in leading successful design initiatives. While each
possessed unique strengths, administrators from other institutional areas may learn
from the principles and experiences of these leaders when considering how they can
create nimble, responsive, collaborative efforts within their own functional areas.

APPENDIX A: INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN INTERVIEW
Good afternoon (Potential Leader Subject Name),
Greetings! My name is Sara Quagliaroli, and I am a doctoral student in the
Educational Leadership Program at Johnson and Wales University in Providence,
Rhode Island. By day, I am an academic success administrator and coach at Merrimack
College in North Andover, Massachusetts. I am preparing for the data collection stage
of my dissertation research, which is a qualitative study which seeks to understand lived
experiences of organizational leaders who facilitated recent library transformations on
their campus. [Referrer name] referred me to you as someone who could provide a
unique perspective to my study. I would be honored to have the opportunity to learn
more about how your leadership and engagement with campus stakeholders
contributed to the successful opening of the [library space].
Through my review of the literature I have observed an abundance of research on
library transformation planning, implementation, and evaluation. Many of these studies
provide detailed information regarding consideration of student learning needs, as they
should be; the goal of any academic library is to promote the academic success of its
students. Through my work, I seek to bring more focus to the role of leaders as they
engaged all institutional stakeholders through the change process, from idea, through
planning, implementation, and initial evaluation. Stakeholders may include faculty,
students, library staff, non-library staff partners, and other senior institutional leaders. As
you have facilitated a recent transformation of your academic library, I would be excited
to learn about your own journey as a project leader.
Click here for a brief video describing a very short history of my interest in this topic.
I am interested in understanding the essence of how leaders engage others through
organizational change at libraries that are identified as models by their peers in the
library field. I am seeking to explore complete stories, guided by what individuals deem
to be most important; therefore, this study will be grounded by individual, unstructured
interviews with leaders who held primary responsibility for guiding a library
transformation on their campus. I am currently scheduling interviews for the month of
October. Generally, interviews would be online, using Skype or Google Hangout. I
would like to leave an option open to visit New England-based participants on your
campuses.
Please let me know if you would be interested in a 10-minute phone conversation to
discuss your possible participation in the study. You can reply to this e-mail, or call me
directly at [phone number]. Thank you for your consideration.

APPENDIX B: INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN ELITE INTERVIEW
Good afternoon, [Prospective Elite Name];
I hope this e-mail finds you well this morning on the West Coast! My name is Sara
Quagliaroli, and I am a doctoral candidate in the Educational Leadership Program at
Johnson & Wales University in Providence, RI. Professionally, I direct an academic
success program at Merrimack College for students identified through the admissions
process as needing additional assistance to enhance opportunities for success as they
make the ongoing transition from high school through college.
I am currently in the data analysis stage of my dissertation, which is an exploration on
the experiences of academic librarians on leadership and engagement with
stakeholders through learning space design projects completed 2011 and later.
[Information about why specific contact would be ideal participant]. In an effort to
triangulate my findings, I've also conducted document analyses of artifacts associated
with the projects, and am now pursuing an elite interview.
I am writing to inquire if you would have interest and availability to provide your expert
perspective to my study. The interview would be grounded in four questions; if you wish
to participate, I could send the prompt and we could communicate via e-mail, or we can
find a time to schedule a phone or video interview. Please let me know if I can answer
any clarifying questions. Thank you for your consideration!
Best wishes,
Sara

APPENDIX E: INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW PROTOCOL
Thank you so much for taking the time to participate in this study through the
unstructured interview scheduled for today.
I’ve been looking forward to this conversation since we last spoke on the phone.
Where are you right now? Is your office located in the renovated space?
As I shared in our previous conversation, this is a qualitative study that seeks to explore
the following research question:
How do organizational leaders experience engagement with stakeholders during the
creation of library learning spaces, from visioning through planning, implementation and
evaluation?
Please describe your in-depth memories of those events, identifying behaviors and
feelings as well. Feel free to use stories and examples. The intention behind this
research design allows the participant, considered a co-researcher, to identify what was
most important to you through your experience. I may include probes intermittently to
ask about how certain experiences affected you, what thoughts stood out for you that
you can remember from that time, changes that you associate with experiences, or to
explain something in greater detail, clarify something, etc.
Your name, and that of your institution, in addition to specific, identifying information that
would connect the data to your institution, will not be included in the study. I may follow
up after data analysis to confirm accuracy.
The interview should last about an hour – it is your right to conclude the interview, or
end your participation in the study at any time.
Please describe how you experienced engagement with stakeholders during your library
learning space project, from visioning through planning, implementation, and evaluation.

APPENDIX H: PEER DEBRIEFING
A peer debriefing conversation took place on Friday, February 17 th, 2017. The
participant was amid-level librarian who is not a participant of the study. The
conversation was grounded in a review of the codes developed during initial data
analysis proceedings; also shared and discussed were initial categories, and a draft of a
conceptual map. The researcher walked through a description of each code, and
explained rationale for category placement. A discussion occurred after the explanation
of each category. While some of the categories were clear to the peer (Input), she was
uncertain at the distinction being made between the role of senior executive leaders and
the contribution and involvement of other stakeholders. Clarification was achieved
through additional conversations, and the conceptual map was modified. Category
names were not clearly defined before entering debriefing; the peer offered suggestions
and they were discussed. The conversation lasted approximately one hour. Several
hours later, the peer provided the researcher with modified diagram suggestions, theme
names, and two articles she thought could inspire language for describing categories.
Peer debriefing conversations informed the final diagram, and one of her suggestions
(“Building on Relational Capital”) was integrated into the study as the name of a key
finding.
