ABSTRACT
The purpose of the research is to explore the cultural intelligence (CQ) of law firm librarians in
the United States. This dissertation is motivated by three research questions: (a) What is the
overall level of CQ of participating law firm librarians? (b) What variations among participating
law firm librarians, if any, exist among the four capabilities of CQ?; and (c) What viewpoints do
the librarians have about the value and importance of CQ within their law firms? This research
contributes to the limited amount of empirical literature on CQ. Officially defined in early
2000s, the CQ framework is what guides this study. The research extends the application of the
CQ framework by applying it to an area not formerly studied, law firm libraries.
A concurrent nested strategy model was used in order to gain a broader perspective of
CQ. The researcher conducted a mixed-methods study using a web-based survey process
incorporating the CQS, an instrument that measures CQ level, demographic and open-ended
items. The target population consisted of librarians within the United States who currently work
in private law firm libraries. Of the initial 170 individuals who responded to the request, 70
provided survey responses. The sample was based on self-selection from those that were
members of two professional associations.
Based on a triangulation of the findings, four conclusions were made: (a) law firm
librarians have a strong sense of value and importance of CQ to their law firms, (b) law firm
librarians have varying levels of CQ within each of the four CQ factors, (c) the librarian’s feel
valued and appreciated within their law firm, and (d) law firm librarians cope with cultural
challenges and have to adapt to unfamiliar environments. The findings support the research
questions and prompt thinking of how to incorporate CQ into training, maximize the benefits of
CQ with stakeholders that utilize the library services, and how law firms may use CQ to help

with industry changes. This research provides a glimpse into CQ and additional important issues
to law librarians within law firms in the United States including their value within a law firm.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE
Chapter 1. Introduction
A survey conducted in 2008 by McKinsey and Company found that effective
management of cultural diversity is correlated with financial success. Cultural intelligence
(CQ™) may also be a helpful indicator in selecting individuals for global positions as noted by
Ang and Van Dyne, (2008). Earley first defined the phrase cultural intelligence in 2002 and
published the first book the following year with Earley and Ang (2003), defining CQ as “a
person’s capability for successful adaptation to new cultural settings, that is, for unfamiliar
settings attributable to cultural context” (p. 9). They explained the reason for having a term or
label was due to the “need to understand why some people are more adept at adjusting to new
cultural surroundings than others” (p. 59).
CQ, sometimes referred to as cultural competency, cultural awareness, cultural literacy,
cross-cultural competence and various other labels is a newly defined concept that began to
surface in the literature in the early 2000s. According to Abbott (2008), Ang et al. (2007), and
Frink-Hamlett (2011), an individual with high CQ maintains a strategic advantage, and the
impact to an organization may lead to a successful operating business. “Cultural competency
adds value to our clients and ultimately to the firm because you need to be able to relate to the
client-you make them look good and operate in a manner that is consistent with their goals and
objectives,” states Paulette Brown, partner at Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge (as cited in
Frink-Hamlett, 2011, p. S6). Furthermore, Ang et al.’s (2007) findings illustrate strong support
for CQ and suggest “CQ has important implications for selecting, training, and developing a
culturally intelligent workforce” (p. 365).
Law firms operate in an environment characterized by global competition, a rapidly
changing environment, and sophistication. Law firms have a significant impact on the practice

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

of law globally as they have clients around the world. Over the last several years, firms began
analyzing their staffing skills, performance and costs. According to the 2013-14 survey titled
“Trends & Opportunities in Law Outsourcing,” 79% of firms surveyed faced the challenge of
reducing service costs (Sandpiper Partners, 2014). Firms had to reduce their workforce, increase
use of technology, and improve their processes in order to keep costs down. While firms have
always examined their staffing levels, it is only recently that they began examining the
composition of skills within their organization and every line item on their budget, including the
library, more closely. From C-level executives to partners to associates to support staff (law
librarians included), all expenses are examined as the business model of law firms is contracting.
Increasing client demands and higher costs placed more pressures on law firms to
examine performance in order to compete in today’s globalized world. Law firm libraries also
find it difficult to recoup online legal research costs because more clients refuse to pay due to
rising costs. Partners write off bills at the same time as resource costs continue to rise. In this
situation, legal research can create a drain on a firm’s profitability. Law firm librarians now face
an even larger problem. Their own departments, and even positions, are threatened. Unless law
firm librarians can show their value and impact through use of their CQ, they will become
extinct. Understanding their own cultural competency and applying it is of greatest importance
to law firm librarians at this crucial time within the legal industry.
The Problem
Our world is becoming more and more global with a growing number of law firms
opening offices internationally with staff and clients worldwide. As the legal sector shifts, law
firms and law librarians need to adjust their way of doing business to stay competitive. The
market for lawyers has gone global, and this has an impact on the service levels that law firm

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

librarians provide. Caputo and Rasmus (2011), report, according to the American Lawyer’s
Global 100 list, the “top 15 firms on the list have between 5% and 86% of lawyers working
outside their home country and have offices in 5 to 39 countries” (p. 46). Client demands have
grown and more international deals exist within law firms. Law firms are being challenged to
examine costs, determine the value of their staff (law librarians included), and determine what
model is best to increase profits.
Law firm librarians face a dilemma. The demand for law firm librarians is changing,
specifically with the skills now being required of them in order to remain competitive, maintain
their current positions, or even be promoted. In this new type of environment, law librarians
must be culturally competent in order to work effectively to meet their attorney’s needs. A law
librarian, for example, must also feel motivated to stimulate others in a new environment.
“Motivation must be aligned with our ways of thinking about a new culture and how we act in it”
(Earley, Ang, & Tan, 2006, p. 78).
Devin Fidler, research manager in the Technology Horizons program at the Institute for
the Future, discusses the work skills needed for information professionals in the decade ahead.
The Institute’s found “10 specific new skills that are likely to help workers achieve success in the
next decade” (Fidler, 2012, p. 10). Cross-Cultural competency was one of the work skills
identified and has future implications for traditional law librarians. Just as the landscape is
changing within the legal industry, law librarians will need to shift with the times. Law
librarians will need to adjust their traditional frame of mind to include adaptability of changing
environments and responsiveness to new cultural contexts.
With the effects of the economy in the United States, law firms have had to closely
reexamine their business models, firm performance, staffing skills and overall culture. The

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

4

examination of business models has an impact on the library department/knowledge center
because it may not be part of the future equation if its value is not known. According to the Law
Librarian Survey published by American Lawyer Media (ALM, 2014), 72% of participants
stated that they recovered fewer costs from client in the past year, and firms recover only 48% of
online charges. Recouping research costs is still an increasing challenge for law firm libraries,
which is yet another part of the problem. While law firms are the general target within this
study, the researcher specifically focused on librarians within law firms in the United States
since they support law firm stakeholders and play a critical role in influencing attorneys because
of the support they provide them.
Research on CQ in the law firm setting is scarce – research on CQ specific to law firm
libraries does not even exist. There has been some discussion on culture and diversity within the
field of librarianship as a whole (Greer, Stephens, & Coleman, 2001; Howland, 2001; Kreitz,
2008; Overall, 2009; Smith, 2008), but nothing specific to CQ of law firm librarians. Studies
have not focused on this issue, and there is a significant lack of knowledge about CQ in law firm
librarians.
Despite an increased interest in CQ, there are limited studies that examine CQ as a
component of selecting individuals for leadership positions (Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). However,
there have been many studies related to intercultural training and cross-cultural training, which
may relate to using CQ as a training tool (Earley, 1987; Harrison, 1992; Tung, 1981). Triandis
(2006) notes training techniques that enhance individual CQ are important. CQ plays an
important role in global leadership success as globalization and cross-cultural business continue
to grow (Alon & Higgins, 2005). Thomas and Inkson (2009) believe “leading any organization
or group with a culturally diverse workforce requires cultural intelligence” (p. 120).

Purpose of the Study
To help fill the gap in the existing literature on CQ of law firm librarians, the purpose of
this mixed-methods research was to explore CQ of law firm librarians to understand the
phenomena of cultural competency. A concurrent design was proposed to examine this
phenomenon in these professionals, to identify whether law firm librarians are culturally
intelligent and how they view their CQ as having an impact on their firm. This methodology was
selected as the researcher focused on collecting and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative
data in a single study to expand understanding from both (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). CQ is
herein generally defined as the capability of an individual to function effectively across new
cultural settings (Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). Law firm librarians working in private firms within
the United States were specifically targeted. CQ was measured using Ang and Van Dyne’s
(2008) Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) Self Report (Appendix A). The CQS is an instrument
designed to measure the four dimensions of CQ. Additional questions regarding participating
law firm librarian views on how CQ impacts the practice of their firm will be explored. Both
qualitative and quantitative data were gathered via a web-based survey.
Research Questions
The following research questions were examined within the study:
1. What is the overall level of cultural intelligence of participating law firm librarians?
2. What variations among participating law firm librarians, if any, exist among the four
capabilities of cultural intelligence?
3. What viewpoints do the law firm librarians have about the value and importance of
cultural intelligence within their law firms?

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

Assumptions and Delimitations
Assumptions of this study include that law firm librarians have a general understanding
of the construct of CQ and were able to respond honestly to the survey. It was assumed that law
firm librarians had access to the Internet and possessed the skills to enable them to complete a
web-based survey. To explore the practices of these firms, it was assumed that the law firm
librarians had an integral understanding of the attorneys and practices within the firm.
This researcher has an extensive background of 20 years of librarianship with 10 years in
public librarianship, 4 years in law firm libraries, 3 years with one of the largest legal vendors,
and 3 years as a consultant to law firms and corporations. Biases exist due to this experience in
the librarianship and legal fields. Additionally, the researcher is recognized as a Cultural
Intelligence Level 1 & 2 certified facilitator through the Cultural Intelligence Center. The
researcher also currently serves as the Private Law Libraries Special Interest Section (PLL-SIS)
membership committee chair and is a member of the PLL-SIS. To minimize these biases, the
researcher sought to remain neutral during the study and vigilant with a keen awareness of
practices throughout data gathering and analysis. The researcher sought to avoid personal biases
due to her expertise.
This study was limited to United States law firms and only involved participating law
firm librarians with a Master of Library Science degree and/or equivalent experience who are
members and subscribe to the Private Law Libraries Special Interest Section of the American
Association of Law Libraries (AALL) Community, the Special Library Association (SLA) Legal
Division listserv, or the Law-Lib listserv. According to the AALL website (2013), the PLL-SIS
consists of more than 1,300 members across the United States. It is unknown how many law
firm librarians are members of the SLA Legal Division or the Law-Lib listserv. The targeted

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

7

population consisted of private law librarians who, at the time of this research, worked in a law
firm in the United States. It was assumed that the information collected from law firm librarians
is relevant to other law firm librarians throughout the United States. However, the extent to
which the research is generalizable to other firms is limited to the characteristics of this sample.
Conceptual Foundation
This study sought to build on the underlying foundation of CQ and, to some extent, the
understanding of its importance for law firm librarians and law firms. While librarianship is a
very broad field, specifics about law firm skills and expectations of law firm librarians can help
support the importance of the construct of CQ as an imperative for being successful in today’s
global work environment. Those who assume leadership roles with their libraries can also be
instrumental in facilitating the development of CQ and training among those who will interact
with the diversity of people and organizations found in today’s legal industry.
Definition of Terms

Cultural intelligence.


Cultural intelligence (CQ): A person’s capability to function effectively in a new and
unfamiliar environment (Ang et al., 2007; Earley & Ang, 2003; Earley et al., 2006;
Earley & Mosakowski, 2004; Peterson, 2004).



Behavioral: One of the four factors of CQ. A person’s ability to adapt to verbal and
nonverbal behavior appropriate to different cultures (Earley & Ang, 2003).



Cognitive: One of the four factors of CQ. An individual’s cultural knowledge of norms
and practices in different cultural settings (Earley & Ang, 2003).



Metacognitive: One of the four factors of CQ. An individual’s cultural consciousness and
awareness during interactions with those from other cultural backgrounds (Earley & Ang,
2003).



Motivational: One of the four factors of CQ. An individual’s ability to direct energy and
confidence toward cultural differences (Earley & Ang, 2003).



Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS): Instrument that measures an individual’s cultural
intelligence level in each of the four cultural intelligence capabilities.

Significance of the Study
Understanding CQ within law firm librarians is more than just an international or global
perspective. A law firm librarian can be affected locally, within his/her own branch office
working with a diverse group of individuals on a specific departmental topic. Law firm
librarians often may support more than one geographic office, including international locations.
They have to work with differing cultures daily and be able to adapt to new settings, especially
facing turbulent times in the legal sector.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

One such example is that of a law firm librarian engaging with his/her clientele –
attorneys, IT staff, and an information vendor – to make sure they get the best deal of their
negotiated contract for their law firm. She and/or he may interview and interact with a diverse
group of attorneys from differing practice areas to determine their needs. S/he will have to work
with IT staff in order to ensure the online service is set up correctly and works properly. S/he
will also need to negotiate the contract and terms with the information vendor. In each of these
cases, and working collectively with their firm users, CQ will be utilized. The law librarian may
not be motivated to interact with IT and, therefore, not be able to adapt and adjust as needed for
implementation of the online resource or vice versa. Additionally, she and/or he may not be able
to lead his/her staff in this initiative if CQ is not applied.
Law librarians are information professionals who work in various legal settings and
provide a range of services based on the scope of library collections and size of staff. According
to the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL, 2014), private law firm librarians are
often required to perform many functions including reference, processing of library materials,
maintaining vendor contracts, and supervising personnel. While the traditional role of a law
librarian in a firm has been just that, there are new skills they need to gain and new functions
they need to learn as technology evolves and the information profession changes.
There has been more need for competitive intelligence and business intelligence support
for client-focused efforts and the library has now become integrated into this function. Firm
librarians also play a more important role in helping attorneys with existing resources, advanced
technologies, and often serve as knowledge managers to help find, locate, and manage both the
internal and external knowledge of the firm. Additionally, private law librarians often perform

research outside the scope of legal research including business, financial, market, business
development, medical and due diligence.
Law firm librarians find that needle in a haystack document which can make or break a
case, determine if a point of law is good law which can affect the attorney’s success in a case,
and even update materials in the collection that can effect an attorney’s ability to practice
effectively. With continuous pressures from upper management to reduce costs, law firm
librarians are challenged not only to prove their own worth, but also to prove the worth and value
of having a library, whether physical, electronic, or both.
The library, in and of itself, can be viewed as a small business. Individuals are not going
to understand the value of what one can provide and expertise unless a librarian is “tooting
his/her horn”. Unfortunately, law librarians have not been as good at marketing themselves, or
even the library, and history has shown the elimination of law firm librarian positions and even
dissolution of complete law firms. In order for law firm librarians to gain new positions and stay
competitive, they have to shift as well in the skills they gain and the execution of their expertise.
Joyce Janto, former president of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) says,
I think in firms especially, the lawyers forget that the librarians are just as well educated
as they are. They have no idea that we are able to go beyond the stereotypical “reference
question” and that the librarians are a good source for client development and client
retention. (University of Michigan, 2011, “The Value of Law Librarians,” para. 4)
It is important to understand what CQ means and the significance of it to law firm
librarians. Law firm librarians are in a unique position because of the audiences they serve –
unique, diverse, and span many different cultures. They support all stakeholders of the firm,
from attorneys to secretaries to partners to paralegals, in an effort to provide information from
many resources in the most cost efficient manner, maintain collections, negotiate vendor
contracts, manage the library and wear a multitude of other “hats.” Their support of internal

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

11

stakeholders benefits the clients the firm serves and has a direct impact on the success and profits
of the firm.
It has often been said that an organization is only as good as its people. That holds true in
law firms. A law firm could not operate without a solid support infrastructure that includes
accounting, marketing, librarians, paralegals, and IT. Today’s reality indicates that staffing
levels are down across the board in law firms, library included, with library services being the
most lightly staffed non-attorney area in firms (ALM Legal Intelligence, 2014). Law firm
libraries have always been viewed as overhead within a law firm’s budget and are often the first
to go. Functions that the library has traditionally been the go to for are now being done directly
by paralegals and attorneys (i.e., research) because the online legal research systems are much
more sophisticated and even Google friendly. Many firms have even eliminated their physical
libraries due to space costs or lack of use. Just as the law firm library has changed, the role of
the law firm librarian is evolving.
This research provides both theoretical and practical importance. First, on the theoretical
side, this research contributes to the limited amount of empirical literature available on CQ and
helps validate the concept. It extends the application of the model by applying it to an area not
formerly studied. On the practical side, this information may be helpful in selecting law firm
librarians, providing training, and in illustrating the value of a law firm librarian when CQ is
applied. John Lewis Jr., Senior Managing Litigation Counsel for Coca-Cola stated “cultural
drivers will impact how deals are structured and decisions are made” (Cole, 2008, p. 26). For
any law firm that represents them, Coca-Cola looks at their cultural apparatus. More and more
clients are doing just the same.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

12

Law firms may view data from this study as an important indicator for selecting law firm
librarians. Additionally, the data may lead to the development of training programs which may
include how to enhance leadership roles within the firm. Law firm librarians have not often been
viewed as equivalent to other director and administrative levels within the law firm. Law firms
may begin to incorporate CQ training components into evaluation of making law librarians
senior management. CQ can also help organizations successfully manage their cultural diversity
(Earley, Ang & Tan, 2006). Since firm librarians continually have to adapt in differing
situations, depending on whom they encounter within the law firm and work with across firm
locations, it makes sense to ensure they utilize their CQ and to evaluate how it affects firm
attorneys, secretaries and others they support. Firm staff can even work on their own CQ levels
to influence the productivity and success of the firm.
Often, the law library is the first to be cut because law librarians are not as embedded in
the culture and attorney practice or they have not shown their value to the firm. The law library
and law firm librarians are often viewed as overhead and not seen as an integral and valuable
part of the firm’s culture and model, even though they provide critical support functions that
affect profits. Law firm librarians do influence the stakeholders and can have an impact on the
success of a firm. The cost of ignorance or arrogance with law firm associates and partners not
using the librarian has true implications on time and money (University of Michigan, 2011).
With law firm librarians’ expertise (having received a master’s degree in Library and
Information Science), they are the experts in helping locate, find, organize, and analyze
information. They can save an attorney time, which, in a law firm, is money by retrieving what
she and/or he needs. It takes a trained librarian to help one navigate and obtain authoritative,
legitimate information. At minimum, the law firms C-levels and attorneys need to better

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

13

understand the role of the librarian and leverage the skills she and/or he can provide. The role of
the librarian can impact all within the firm, and that is one reason CQ is critical.
Summary
As the legal environment changes, so do our law firms’ libraries. Law firms evolve and
bring together increasingly diverse cultures within them, while, at the same time, law firm
libraries evolve with the nature of changes in the tools used and delivery of information services.
Law firm librarians are challenged with marketing the value of their services and expertise to the
organization. Additionally, they are constantly fighting to be viewed as a valuable asset to the
firm. They work with many diverse individuals and continually face challenging situations.
This study examined CQ of law librarians in law firms within the United States.

Chapter 2. Review of the Literature
This study examined the phenomena of CQ in law firm libraries. Before proceeding with
a discussion of the changes within the law firm and law library environments, it is necessary to
explore the concept of CQ. This section provides details of this concept, which closely builds on
Sternberg’s theory (Earley & Ang, 2003; Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2006). Sternberg and
Detterman (1986) focused on a framework revolving around the multiple loci of intelligence,
which include four ways to conceptualize individual intelligence: metacognitive, cognitive,
motivational, and behavioral.
Sternberg and Grigorenko (2006) researched the loci of intelligences and considered what
significance culture may have on intelligence. Their findings showed that intelligence must be
understood in its cultural context. “Someone could be successfully intelligent within a culture
but not across cultures. Someone could be relatively successful across cultures but not highly
successfully intelligent within any one of those cultures” (Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2006, p. 28).
Cultural Intelligence
Theories and measurements of CQ. There is much research related to elements of
cultural competence, but limited research specific to CQ. Adler (2008), Erez and Earley (1993),
Hofstede (1991), and Triandis (1994) all discuss elements of culture. In addition, cross-cultural
training has been examined by Black and Mendenall (1990) and Bhawuk and Brislin (2000). CQ
plays an important role in global leadership success as globalization and cross-cultural business
continue to grow (Alon & Higgins, 2005; Verghese & D’Netto, 2011). According to Livermore
(2010), 90% of senior executives from 68 countries see cross-cultural leadership as the main
management challenge of the 21st century. Thomas and Inkson (2009) believe “leading any
organization or group with a culturally diverse workforce requires CQ” (p. 120).

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

15

Earley and Ang (2003) first defined CQ due to the “need to understand why some people
are more adept at adjusting to new cultural surroundings than others” (p. 59). Thomas and
Inkson (2009) suggest that CQ involves being skilled in understanding a culture, learning more
about it from interactions, and gradually reshaping one’s thinking and behavior to be more aware
when interacting with people from other cultures. CQ offers insight into an individual’s ability
to manage multicultural situations and engage in cross-cultural negotiations (Imai, 2007; Imai &
Gelfand, 2010; Thomas & Inkson, 2003, 2009).
Defining CQ. The term cultural intelligence has often been referred to as intercultural
competence, global mindset, and global competencies in the past. Probably the most well-known
researcher on culture is Hofstede (Boonghee, Donthu, & Lenartowicz, 2011; Maleki & de Jong,
2014; Thien, Thurasamy, & Abd Razak, 2014). Hofstede (1980) studied the shared values of
individuals and the beliefs within communities. While he did not specifically study CQ, his
findings are important to its construct, specifically CQ cognition. Lindsey, Robins, and Terrell
(2003) recommended five guiding principles and five essential elements that cultural competence
is composed of as related to an individual’s treatment of those of differing and diverse
backgrounds:
1. Culture is always present and influences values and behaviors of others.
2. Organizations and individuals need to be aware that what works well for one may not
work well for another. The individual will need to change.
3. There are group and personal identities that need to be considered.
4. We need to be aware of the diversity within cultures.
5. Groups may have distinct cultural needs outside of the main culture (p. 6).

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

16

Additionally, the essential elements assist with strategy and planning when encountering
differing cultural situations (Lindsey et al., 1999, 2003). These focus on culturally competent
individuals:
1. Individuals need to evaluate their own culture and how it may influence others.
2. Culturally capable individuals appreciate diverse individuals.
3. Alternative dispute resolution skills are learned in order to work with differing issues.
4. Learning is an important aspect and culturally intelligent individuals want to enhance
their cultural skills and adapt as needed.
5. Individuals incorporate cultural understating into their daily lives to have improved
cultural interactions.
It was not until 2002 that the term was officially defined by Chris Earley. CQ builds
upon the frameworks of the intelligence quotient (IQ) and emotional intelligence (EQ). Earley
and Ang (2003) developed the CQ framework due to the “need to understand why some people
are more adept at adjusting to new cultural surroundings than others” (p. 59). They define CQ as
“a person’s capability to adapt effectively to new cultural contexts” (p. 59). This is the definition
this study will follow. Griffer and Perlis (2007) believe “the development of cultural intelligence
begins with a study of self and the awareness that everyone has a multiperspective identity” (p.
29). Herrmann, Call, Hernandez-Lloreda, Hare, and Tormasello, M. (2007) further extends this
concept to groups in that this concept can be applied to interactions within diverse groups.
Application of CQ. CQ has been applied and studied in areas other than law firm
libraries. Ang, Van Dyne, Koh, and Ng (2004) and Ang, Van Dyne, and Koh (2006) researched
the construct of CQ in international executives and foreign professionals looking at the
performance, adjustment and personality of individuals. Templer, Tay, and Chandrasekar (2006)

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

17

similarly studied motivational CQ and determined that it predicted adjustment of foreign
professionals.
Researchers for years have studied overseas assignments and expatriates to determine
what it means for overseas success using personality as a predictor (Caligiuri, 2000; Ones &
Viswesvaran, 1997; Spreitzer, McCall, & Mahoney, 1997). Ting-Toomey (1999) examined
elements that allow individuals to be effective in overseas assignments. Brislin (1981) and
Cushner and Brislin (1996) examined adjustment in foreign cultures and found that an effective
cross-cultural adjustment includes comfortable personal adjustment, interactions with others that
are culturally different, and completion of task-related goals. Shaffer and Miller (2008) consider
CQ as a key success factor for expatriates.
Ng and Earley (2006) focus on the two constructs of culture and intelligence: discussion
of the research in organizational psychology. Research demonstrated the impact of cultural
values on organizational behaviors (Earley & Gibson, 1998; Hofstede, 1980; Triandis, 1994).
Berry and Ward (2006) studied further constructs of cross-cultural psychology, of which the CQ
capability are a part. Much of this work also falls under the field of international business
(Gertsen, 1990; Hofstede, 2001).
Alon and Higgins (2005) investigate global leadership success through emotional,
analytical, and CQ. Suutari (2002), as cited in Alon and Higgins (2005), determined the
following five conclusions related to global leadership:
 Leaders need global competencies.
 Global leaders in the corporate world are in a shortage.
 Organizations are ignorant to what it takes to develop corporate leaders.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

18

 Managerial competencies and global leadership need to be better communicated and
understood (p. 502).
CQ has also been applied to multicultural teams and there is substantial literature on global
teams and groups (Flaherty, 2008; Rockstuhl & Ng, 2008; Shokef & Erez, 2008).
Another area of cultural application has been specific to the legal field. Stevens (2009)
examines CQ in justice systems, including why it is important and what it is. Peckman (2011)
applies the capability to attorneys and questioning whether they are culturally competent or not.
Caputo and Rasmus (2011) further examine why CQ matters when it comes to international
transactions and attorneys. Ward and Miller (2010) take it a step back to understanding the role
that law schools play in molding our culturally competent attorneys. In the case of the legal
community, Frink-Hamlett (2011) goes more in-depth to understand the importance of cultural
competence in delivery and teaching of legal services in law school.
Multifaceted dimensions of CQ. According to Earley and Ang (2003), in order to
display CQ, a person needs three main concepts working in agreement with one another:
cognitive, motivational, and behavioral (Figure 1). Each of these is malleable in that an
individual can enhance in time (Ang et al., 2007). While each of these facets is beneficial, they
must be combined with the other factors of CQ in order to enhance intercultural success (Van
Dyne, Ang, & Livermore, 2010). In a later model, Ang and Van Dyne (2008) add metacognitive
CQ as “an individual’s level of conscious cultural awareness during cross-cultural interactions”
(p. 5) to make CQ comprised of 4 factors. According to Brislin, Worthley, and Macnab (2006),
an individual may increase his/her level of CQ by practice, gaining more experience, and being
optimistic toward learning. According to Hilgard and Bower (1966), “learning is culturally
relative, and both the wider culture and the subculture to which the learner belongs affect his

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE
learning.” (pp. 562-564). This is emphasized in cognitive, motivation and personality theories
(Hilgard & Bower, 1966).

Similarly to the illustration in Figure 2, Livermore (2011) states the following:
These four factors are interrelated, whatever the form of intelligence. A person who
knows (cognition) how to relate interpersonally but has no desire to do so (motivation)
won’t function in a socially intelligent way. An individual who can analyze
(metacognition) a practical situation deeply but can’t actually solve it in real life
(behavior) doesn’t have much practical intelligence. …Cultural intelligence is a fourfactor capability that consists of these same four intelligence factors – motivation (CQ
drive), cognition (CQ knowledge), metacognition (CQ strategy), and behavior (CQ
action). (pp. 28-29)
Many authors present ideas, studies and research showing interest in the CQ model (Crawford,
2009; Crowne, 2006; Dean, 2007; Hyndman, 2007; Imai, 2007; James, 2007; Lugo , 2007;
Moody, 2007; Prado, 2006; Seminara, 2009; Van Driel, 2004; Williams, 2008).

Motivational. Individuals must know how to use knowledge of another’s culture and
acknowledge cultural differences. According to Earley and Ang (2003), an individual must also
feel motivated to engage others in a new setting. Values orientation approach, empathy and selfefficacy can be used as methods for motivation of CQ (Earley & Ang, 2003; Earley; Ang & Tan,
2006; Earley & Peterson, 2004). As Bandura (1986) states in Earley and Ang (2003), selfefficacy is “a judgment of one’s capability to accomplish a certain level of performance” (p.
391). This is introduced as an important element of CQ since “adaptation requires both
“intelligent” and “motivated” action” (Earley & Ang, 2003, p. 154). Templer et al. (2006)
further explore the relationship between motivational CQ and cross-cultural adjustment. They

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

21

found that employees who were more interested and motivated to experience diverse cultures
adjusted better to work on international assignments.
Within the CQ model through the Cultural Intelligence Center, this factor is considered
CQ drive and the first element that needs to be considered when facing a cultural situation. CQ
drive asks, “Do you have the drive and motivation to work through the challenges that come with
cross-cultural situations?” This is your interest, drive and motivation to adapt intercultural,
which includes deriving enjoyment from experience, gaining benefits from experience, and
having the confidence to be effective in culturally diverse situations (Livermore, 2010). It
sounds like common sense, but it is often the most overlooked factor (e.g., people who are
required to go through diversity training, but are not told why it is relevant).
There are three specific areas CQ drive focuses on: intrinsic, extrinsic, and self-efficacy.
Intrinsic is the extent to which one is interested in cultural experiences. Extrinsic is the tangible
benefits derived from multicultural interactions. Self-efficacy is the level of confidence
exhibited. Each of these sub-dimensions can be enhanced through facing biases, connecting with
existing interests, visualizing success, rewarding oneself, maintaining control and travel
(Livermore, 2011).
Cognitive. This capability relates to “general cognitive skills that are used to create new
specific conceptualizations of how to function and operate within a new culture” (Earley & Ang,
2003, p. 9). Cognitive can also refer to information-processing aspects of intelligence
concerning cultural adaptation of an individual (Earley, 2003) and the knowledge of norms,
beliefs and conventions. This concept is clearly addressed through culture assimilators and
knowledge training. This capability plays an important role in how individuals think and behave.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

22

Livermore (2011) suggests that “one of the best ways to deal with ambiguity in
multicultural situations is by learning more about cultural differences” (p. 69). CQ knowledge is
the element of the CQ model through the Cultural Intelligence Center that asks, “Do you have
cultural understanding needed to be more effective culturally?” This is the degree to which one
understands how culture influences how people think and behave and ones level of familiarity
with how cultures are similar and different (Livermore, 2010). Three specific areas are explored
within CQ knowledge: business, interpersonal, and socio-linguistics. Each of these revolves
around the extent to which one understands cultural systems, values, norms, beliefs, and different
languages (Livermore, 2011).
There are several ways to enhance ones CQ knowledge level, including improving global
awareness, studying cultures, learning about values, study language, and seeking diverse
perspectives. “One specific way to improve CQ knowledge is to learn the key characteristics of
ten global cultural clusters, which are large cultural groupings that share some core patterns of
thinking and behavior” (Livermore, 2013, p. 7). For example, each cultural cluster has specific
cultural dimensions to consider: individual-collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance,
cooperative-competitive, time orientation, context, and being-doing. Each of these is important
to understand, particularly when having culturally intelligence interactions.
Metacognition. Metacognition (CQ strategy as labeled by the Cultural Intelligence
Center) is that extent to which one is aware of what is occurring in a cross-cultural situation and
the ability to use the awareness to manage it successfully (Livermore 2010, 2011). CQ is viewed
as managing effectively in culturally diverse settings, which includes prior elements of
metacognition, cognition, motivation and behavior (Ang et al., 2007). A new definition included
concentration on the term “system”, which includes knowledge, skills, cultural metacognition,

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

23

and adaptation. This deals with intercultural interactions including adjustment and relationship
development (Thomas et al., 2008). The notion is a type of learning of new actions needed
within a new culture.
Ramalu, Chuah, and Rose (2011) found that CQ is a critical component when it comes to
assignment adjustment and work performance. Several models for training are suggested for
metacognition, including knowledge elicitation method called Cognitive Structure Analysis,
Cognitive-Behavior Modification (CBM) technique, and Recognition Model (Tan & Chua,
2003). Each of these are popular methods used within psychology. Earley and Peterson (2004)
identify methods of planning, monitoring, evaluating and knowledge based training for
metacognition of CQ.
Livermore (2011) states that, “the ability to apply your motivation and understanding to
real-life situations is one of the most important benefits of the cultural intelligence difference”
(p. 107). It is one thing to be motivated, but the next step is to take that motivation and apply
self-awareness to a cultural situation. “CQ strategy is a weak capability among many individuals
tested because many of us are forced to function at a frenetic pace with little space for deeper
thought and reflection” (p. 110). Metacognition is that “thinking about thinking” (p. 110) and an
element that one often does not have time to do in society. CQ strategy is utilized when one uses
cultural understanding to create a plan for a cultural situation.
Specifically, awareness, planning, and checking are three sub-dimensions that are
examined in the Cultural Intelligence Center model (Livermore, 2010, 2011). The starting point
is being aware of the cultural elements in the situation, which includes observing what is going
on between the parties. Next, individuals will consider how to engage in the situation. This is
where taking time to plan, examine, and think about the circumstance is critical. Last, one will

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

24

want to check oneself and monitor whether the resulting behavior is appropriate. There are
aspects to try to enhance this capability such as observation, journaling, managing expectations,
creating checklists, reframing, and testing for accuracy (Livermore, 2011).
Behavioral. The fourth facet of CQ is the behavior of an individual. An individual needs
to know how to respond in a different cultural setting. Molinsky (2013) calls this global
dexterity – “the capacity to adapt ones behavior when necessary in cultural environments that are
foreign to that individual and to accommodate new and different expectations that vary in each
cultural setting” (p. 9). Some are “skillful at recognizing behaviors that are influenced by
culture” (Brislin et al., 2006, p. 41). Within the Cultural Intelligence Center model, behavioral is
the CQ action piece of the equation (see Figure 2). “Our cultural intelligence is ultimately
judged based on how we behave” (Livermore, 2011, p. 141). This includes how one adapts
through utilizing verbal, nonverbal, and speech acts in approaching cultural situations.
Improvements to CQ action can take the form of developing one’s manners, leveraging CQ
knowledge of cultures, using differing vocabulary as needed, and joining a multicultural team.
“Of all the facets of cultural intelligence, behavioral CQ is perhaps the most difficult to
acquire” (Earley et al., 2006, p. 83). This is because many of the behaviors each of us exhibits is
expected based upon our past experiences and our background. Unless we are trained to behave
in different ways (similar to actors), we have not explored this capability fully. Even though we
exhibit universal human behaviors, often, these are viewed differently in appearance in specific
cultural situations (Earley et al., 2006). Differentiating universal human behaviors versus
culture-specific behaviors is an important first step to take and can start with foreign languages.
Molinsky (2013) is in agreement with this in that the key is not to merely learning (CQ

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

25

knowledge) about other cultures and differences, but “adapting behaviors in order to account for
– and overcome – the differences” (p. 174).
Hall (1993) experimented with differing forms of cross-cultural training and quickly
learned that individuals benefit from knowledge, but knowledge alone does not prepared one for
survival in situations. Earley and Peterson (2004) suggest training methods may include role
play, performing, visual arts, and behavior modification. Tan and Chua (2003) in Cultural
Intelligence: Individual interactions across cultures by Earley and Ang (2003), introduce a
competence-based training framework which emphasizes a culture-general approach to training
because behaviors may be different in different cultures. Behavioral modeling is based on social
learning theory. Harrison (1992) uses behavioral modeling, based on social learning theory, in
order to determine its effectiveness. “A person with high CQ is able to adapt behavior to be
appropriate to any given cultural context” (Earley & Peterson, 2004, p. 109).
Debate over CQ. Research recently demonstrated the importance of CQ; however, there
has been much confusion on the official definition of the term. Bailey (2004) discusses Earley
and Peterson’s 2004 article “The Elusive Cultural Chameleon,” questioning whether we need yet
another intelligence to add to the ever packed field already. Berry and Ward (2006) express that
this concept is not new, but, rather, a compilation of many years of research. They further state
that a “single concept such as CQ is unlikely to be culturally appropriate in all sociocultural
settings” (Berry & Ward, 2006, p. 64). Middleton (2014) believes that CQ is simply “the ability
to connect across cultures” (p. 12), but not diversity which is “dominated by the idea that it is
about minorities and majorities and how they interact” (p. 11).
Alon and Higgins (2005) express that much of the language of CQ overlaps with former
terms like cultural literacy. Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars (2006) question whether such a

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

26

capability is credible. Johnson, Lenartowicz, and Apud (2006) state that CQ focuses on learning
and not the actual application. Plum, Achen, Draeby and Jensen (2008) view CQ as, “the ability
to act appropriately in situations where cultural differences are important” (p. 19). They
explicitly detail the difference between their defined CI (use of CI to indicate it is different than a
quotient) versus CQ based on focus and content. In accordance with their definition,


cultural intelligence is based on an understanding of culture as a process;



the purpose of using this intelligence is to act appropriately in cultural encounters;



the goal is to generate a bridge between cultures;



the focus is on all kinds of cultural identities not just national;



individuals, groups and organizations can have this intelligence;



people’s views must be experienced not predicted;



a culturally intelligent person can turn off his cultural knowledge; and



CI is assessed while it is being developed not measured by a test. (Plum et. al, 2008, p.
19)
Earley and Peterson (2004) argue that the CQ approach is significant compared to prior

approaches because it is specific to individuals’ strengths and weaknesses, provides an integrated
approach to learning, and is a unifying psychological model. They state the weaknesses in
current approaches include assumptions that all individuals need the same training, current
approaches focus on cognitive awareness only, and current training programs assume a link
between values and behavior (Earley & Peterson, 2004). Kienzle and Husar (2007) express the
value of cultural awareness is that an organization can avoid offending individuals, improve
communication, and improve the quality of relationships. They believe that “cultural
intelligence is the answer to becoming culturally aware” (p. 85).

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

27

CQ, as defined by Early and Ang (2003), does differ from other cultural competence
approaches in five specific ways as Livermore (2011) points out:
1. CQ is an evidence-based meta-model for diversity and international work.
2. CQ is a form of intelligence.
3. CQ is more than just knowledge.
4. CQ emphasizes learned capabilities more than personality traits.
5. CQ is not culture-specific (pp. 32-33).
The first step to understanding CQ level is through use of a CQ assessment. The Cultural
Intelligence Center (2014) as well as CQ certified facilitators can offer the CQS to measure each
of the four capabilities.
Earley and Mosakowski (2004) stated that CQ builds upon the framework of emotional
intelligence (EI) in that CQ reflects a person’s capability to gather, interpret, and act upon these
radically different cues to function effectively across cultural settings or in a multicultural
situation. The term refers to new cultural settings and involves cultural strategic thinking (Earley
et al., 2006). Ang and Inkpen (2008) further extend their definition of CQ to suggest that it is
“another complementary form of intelligence that can explain variability in coping with diversity
and functioning in new cultural settings” (p. 341). Thomas et al. (2008) suggests social and
emotional intelligence share similar attributes, but are specific to the culture in which they are
developed. As presented in Figure 3, they define CQ as a “system of interactive knowledge and
skills, linked by cultural metacognition that allows people to adapt to, select, and shape the
cultural aspects of their environment” (Thomas et al., 2008, p. 127).

Ng and Earley (2006) believe that CQ can be seen as a culture-free construct that applies
across specific cultural circumstances. CQ can also involve suspending judgment, integrating
and understanding knowledge gained from a situation (Triandis, 2006). Triandis (1972) suggests
even prior that culture should include both subjective and objective components.
Thomas and Inkson (2003), Peterson (2004), and Bucher (2008) all refer to CQ in
comparable terms. Thomas and Inkson (2003) suggest that CQ is the following:
[B]eing skilled and flexible about understanding a culture, learning more about it from
your own going interactions with it, and gradually reshaping your thinking to be more
sympathetic to the culture and your behavior to be more skilled and appropriate when
interacting with others from the culture. (p. 14-15)
It requires knowledge of the culture, practicing mindfulness and developing behavioral
skills. Peterson (2004) defines CQ as “the ability to engage in a set of behaviors that uses skills
and qualities that are tuned appropriately to the culture-based values and attitudes of the people
with whom one interacts.” (p. 89). His model includes knowledge about cultures (facts and
cultural traits), awareness (of yourself and others), and specific skills (behaviors). Bucher (2008)

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

29

refers to CQ as “those key competencies that allow us to effectively interact with people from
diverse cultural backgrounds in all kinds of settings” (p. 7). The three competencies which make
up his CQ framework are constant awareness, cultural understanding and CQ skills.
Accepted measurement of CQ. There are few cultural competence measurement tools
available. Earley and Peterson (2004) identified the assessment methods available at that time as
paper-pencil inventories, role play, behavioral assessment, self-monitoring, cultural shock
inventory, and intercultural communication tests. Earley and Mosakowski (2004) present a selfscored tool that consists of cognitive, physical and emotional elements. Ang and Van Dyne
(2008) published a self-assessment tool to measure CQ. They called it the 20-item four factor
CQS that measures the four elements represented in their theory presented above. It has been
validated and cross-validated in Singapore and the United States and is the instrument
incorporated in this study. The Cultural Intelligence Center (2014) offers the only academically
validated instrument to measure CQ.
Law Firms
In the 1980s, law firms generated revenue by charging clients for legal services just as
they are today. In the mid-80’s, many firms charged what the market would allow (Callinan,
1995). By the late 80’s, high revenues, rapid growth, expensive real estate combined with newer
technologies to affect their profits. Alternative fee arrangements and varying billing alternatives
were developed. The market came under pressure and experienced its first seemingly difficult
challenge for law firms. Twenty years later, private law firms faced similar tribulations with
reduced budgets, staff layoffs, and firm economics that placed pressure on their traditional ways
of doing business. According to Citi Private Bank and Hildebrandt Consulting LLC (2013),
from 2004-2008, there were four hard lessons exhibited within law firms:

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

30

1. Firms must earn demand growth.
2. Excess capacity squeezes margins.
3. Low single-digit profit growth. Maybe Partners are used to the double-digit profit
increases of the past, which no longer exist (p. 4).
4. Volatility is a fact of life. This is no surprise with the increase seen in law firm
failures and dissolutions. Eight large law firms have fallen in the last five years.
Law firms now need to prepare for what the future may hold in terms of growth, profits per
partner, and demand. The report for 2014 by Citigroup for Hildebrandt shows much the same,
but with optimism. Law firms “have continued to battle excess capacity, offer weighty client
discounts, and see their profit margins under pressure” (p. 2). However, they predict “growth of
5% in 2014 driven by the careful headcount and improved efficiencies” (p. 8). The Canadian
Bar Association (2013) also discussed the findings of Hildebrandt related to what the traditional
law firm business model is being affected by, including the following:


client frustration with the rising cost of legal services;



client expectation for more efficient legal services;



decreased demand of legal services in specific practice areas;



changes in the financial services sector that impact relationships with law firms;



increased supply of lawyers available due to layoffs and changes in hiring efforts; and



changes to the regulatory environment which impacts law firm clients. (p. 65)

The recent “State of the Big Law Market” report released by American Lawyer Legal
Intelligence (2014) further identifies four key trends which align with the Hildebrandt findings.
These trends are that legal spending has not recovered from the recession, yet firms continue to
try to raise their hourly bill rates; profits are going to fewer partners; and the law firm market is

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

31

experiencing a larger gap where the top firms make more money and the rest remain behind.
This is no surprise given trends law firms have seen over the past several years. The recent
Altman Weil, Inc. (2014) Chief Legal Officer Survey confirms that big law is overstaffed, based
on the decline in legal work assigned by corporate clients to outside law firms, compared to
increased work to in-house attorneys and to third party legal services. Therefore, even law firms
see the impact of this.
Today, we face globalization and technological developments that have an exponential
impact on the way we do business. Since 2007, the legal sector has struggled due to turbulent
market conditions, and law firms began to closely examine their performance, staffing skills, and
costs to determine how to survive. The once quiet sector is now a sea of challenging times with
law firm mergers, many firms dissolving, the role of law librarians evolving, and the
environment of the business of law changing. Many law firms are not only opening branches in
international locations, but also dealing with international clientele. Some branches have to rely
on their headquarters office for library services because the branches do not have maintained
library support. As Callinan (1995) points out, this aspect requires librarians to have not only
access to the international resources, but also to be cognizant of time, distance and even currency
exchange rates. This alludes to why high cultural competency among law firm librarians is
necessary. Other important characteristics for law firm library staff to have included strong
service orientation, confidence, urgency, desire to learn, and flexibility (Callinan, 1995).
According to Baker (2009), the demise of high profile firms and loss of law firm librarian
positions, “may suggest that law firms everywhere are crumbling, but the firm world is actually
just shifting in response to new economic needs” (p. 15). Smith and Marrow (2008) note
leadership in law firms has rapidly changed and, now, strategic lawyer-leader leadership is

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

32

imperative if firms are to succeed. Law firm challenges in today’s global environment require
strategic skills like managing talent, making decisions and setting strategic direction, retaining
clients, developing growth and employees’ taking care of themselves while taking care of the
firm (Smith & Marrow, 2008). It is critical for law librarians to be culturally competent in order
to support their law firms’ goals in these challenging times.
Smith and Marrow (2008) found that managing partners from a recent law firm survey
believe that adaptability, building effective relationships, change leadership and decisiveness are
among the competencies required when leading a law firm. These competencies align with
Goleman’s (1998) research on emotional intelligence and his four components: self-awareness,
self-management, social awareness and relationship management. Guthridge and Komm (2008)
found further that effective management of cultural diversity in a global setting was highly
correlated with financial success as measured by profit per employee at multinational companies.
Cultural competence has recently received much attention in the legal sector, particularly
given the many transitions with law firms; however, according to Stevens (2009), “the legal
profession has been much slower to recognize the importance of cultural competency within the
profession” (para. 2). In 2011, Peckman reported that attorneys are not as culturally competent
when interacting with other cultures. According to Mottershead, as quoted in Peckman (2011),
“cultural competency is the means by which others measure our ability to navigate the challenges
and leverage the opportunities it brings. At its core, it is about developing business relationships
that last” (“Are You a Culturally Competent Lawyer?,” para. 5). This is “one of THE must-have
competencies for 21st century lawyers” (Mottershead, as cited in Peckman, 2011, “Are You a
Culturally Competent Lawyer?,” para. 4). Lawyers must be culturally aware, especially with the
diverse populations they serve (Ahmad, 2007; Caputo & Rasmus, 2011; Frink-Hamlett, 2011;

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

33

Hughes, 2006; Piomelli, 2006; Ward & Miller, 2010). Given that lawyers should have this
competency, as referenced in the literature, what about the ebb and flow within law firm libraries
and the cultural competencies that law librarian’s hold?
Discussion of Law Firm Libraries
Todd (2006) discusses law firm libraries in the 21st century examining the challenges that
libraries face and how to ensure they can stay relevant years to come. Todd explains that
libraries have always been in the service industry, but it is with mounds and mounds of
information that librarians have lost control. According to Todd (2006), “the customer does not
always understand quality service or what is required to provide quality service,” which is the
“root of law firm librarians’ vulnerability in the future” (p. 12). She recommends, in a law firm
environment, that librarians must know the law business and understand the quantified value of
library services and roles in order to justify to management. Additionally, Todd (2006) stresses
the importance of finding one’s voice within the profession and being relevant.
Eastland (2005) further discusses how library schools have an impact on private law firm
librarians – and not for the good. The quality of students coming out of library school is such
that they are not equipped to handle the challenges of the law firm environment today. Eastland
(2005) requests two things of library schools for firm librarians: (a) “know the legal market in
your community and create classes that make students attractive to the community,” and (b)
“teach the law” (p. 16). Both of these will make a significant difference in law firm librarians
working with attorneys and producing quality law librarians to handle the challenges as Todd
(2006) describes in understanding the business of law and value.
Law libraries are influenced by the changes occurring within the law firm environment.
Potter, in Gentilozzi (2013), states that “the make-up of the library is going to be dictated by the

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

34

culture of the firm” (p. News). Libraries are no longer the spacious, large print collections of the
past with huge staff departments (Andrea, 2014; Gentilozzi, 2013; Rieger, 2011). “The new
concept of the modern private law library is windowless, smaller, tucked away inside the firm, or
in the hallway, completely without walls” (Rieger, 2011, p. 27). Space has become increasingly
expensive and the cost of print and electronic resources has increased while law librarians still
need to balance and maintain the collections and, now, exceed the expectations of their users.
Some firm libraries have transitioned to completely electronic with no print resources.
Humphries (2013) explains her law firm library downsized to 100% online, going from 3,500
linear feet of shelving to 300 linear feet (p. 17). Her recommendations for transition to total
electronic library include


getting attorneys from each practice area involved to support the move to an
electronic library;



hire a librarian with technical services and automation skills;



create a list of titles to convert and titles to keep in print; and



purchase electronic readers if you are moving to electronic books. (Humphries, 2013,
p. 19)

Evolution of Law Firm Libraries
The evolution of law librarians and law libraries depends on several issues. Some of the
most critical are the nature of the law library and the creation of law and the legal profession.
The first law libraries in America date to the late 1600s and early 1700s. Even though law books
existed, there were fewer than 30 published in America by 1776 (Panella, 1991). The 18th
century shows the creation of private law libraries, and the 19th century shows the evolution of
bar association libraries. The mid-19th century shows the development of public law libraries

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

35

with the 1900s characterizing the private law firm library. Law school libraries grew over the
18th, 19th and 20th centuries with Harvard University being the first known law school
established in 1817 (Brock, 1974). Early law libraries were maintained, usually, by only one
person who did not have a degree. The first law firm libraries grew out of personal collections
owned by attorneys and justices. The first private law firm library dates back to 1899 when the
first law librarian was hired in New York.
The private law library is usually a department within a law firm practice or office, and
specific to the librarians that this study targets. Historically, law firms considered the law firm
library overhead and not a cost center. It was not until the early 1990’s, under some controversy,
that law firms began to consider billing practices for librarians, just as attorneys had been billing
for years. Panella (1991) identifies five reasons librarians believed at the time that billing
practices would be a good idea:
1. Lawyers hold library in high regard as they begin to accept librarian as valuable part
of the team (this is later disputed as we are seeing today).
2. Knowing the client/matter can assist librarians understand requests.
3. There is more satisfaction felt in knowing there is a number related to the law firm
librarians work.
4. This could now aid the librarian should he or she need to justify the value of the
library.
5. The billable time that is sent to clients can offset salaries if clients pay.
While some law firm libraries still bill, all eyes have been on the changes law firm libraries have
gone through in the 2000s. The law firm library was once viewed as a place to go and review

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

36

print resources. Now, a majority of law firm libraries lost their physical footprint and moved to a
hybrid print-electronic library or were physically outsourced.
The ideal of outsourcing has been commented on by many in the field (Ahearn et al.,
1997; Ebbinghouse, 2002; Estes, 2008; Roy & Basak, 2011). Outsourcing of private law firm
libraries has been around since the 1980s with the full outsourcing of Pillsbury to Library
Associates, and the dismissal of all library staff at Baker & McKenzie in 1995 (Ebbinghouse,
2002). Ebbinghouse (2002) found that firms chose to outsource specific library functions,
particularly with short-term projects or paraprofessional tasks. Although outsourcing is a recent
trend, according to the ALM Legal Intelligence Law Firm Staffing (2014) report, 15% of firms
responding state they returned a function in-house after outsourcing.
Why libraries [still] matter is the question Zittrain (2014) focuses on. He points out that, in
the 2000s, the Web became more prevalent and contains unorganized information on just about
anything. While search engines tried to index the Web, it has been an ongoing effort and often
remains inappropriately indexed. Libraries remain in high demand as a critical counterpart to the
Web (Zittrain, 2014) because of this information overload. Libraries help provide access to
information: authoritative, legitimate, and on point for attorneys and connect users to these
resources in new ways. With the Web, it is challenging because, as Zittrain (2014) points out,
“information may be easy to copy, but it’s also easy to poison and destroy” (para. 9). He coauthored a study that found that almost 3 of 4 links found in Harvard Law Review articles were
dead (Zittrain, 2014).
Pacifici (2014) further points out that librarians have the skill to curate the knowledge
because of their degreed experience in finding resources and due to their commitment to the
profession. Legal research shaped the law practice and is a durable basis for the value of the

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

37

librarian. Having skilled librarians on staff who can assist, train and teach law firm attorneys and
staff is very important, as research platforms have changed, access to resources has changed, and
even methods for searching have changed. Sutherland (2013) presents further ideas for how
libraries can take advantage of the law firm changes.
Women in law librarianship. With the advent of law libraries, women, though
predominant in the field, faced many obstacles not only within the profession, yet also within
society. They suffered advancement opportunities because of their “handicapped” image.
Librarians felt trapped because of the barriers to further pursue a law career. Those with law
degrees were tolerated, but those without the degree were ridiculed (Hoeppner, 1993). Prejudice
grew as time passed. Law schools were not granting women faculty status, and salaries for
women across the board were less.
Tracing the roots of librarianship back to the 1800s shows women’s limited involvement.
Society thought of women as being handicapped, as if they were unable to perform their job
because they would soon get married and have children. Librarianship was not a profession for
women; rather, it was a pastime. Women were given the lowest job and men always
predominated when asked who was in charge of the library. When Dewey created the first
library school with 19 women and 3 men in the first class in 1887, he knew women would be the
librarians of the future (Munthe, 1939 reprinted in Weibel, Heim, & Ellsworth, 1979). The
problem of salaries began, then, with studies showing a “$2,000 wage gap between females and
males” (Weibel, et al., 1979, p. 115). Statistics show that, in 1852, the first woman clerk was
hired and, by 1910, 78% of library workers in the United States were women (Sterns, 1972). It
truly was not until the 1900s when librarianship became a “woman’s profession.”

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

38

Women librarians have been trying to reshape their profession by entering areas of
specialty such as law. According to the American Bar Association, women made up only 8% of
the law school enrollment in 1970. By 1980, women comprised 34% of the enrollment and,
today, 50% of students are women (Robbins, 2002). Therefore, the role of women in the legal
field is increasing, which may have a direct impact on the law librarianship profession. Still, too
many law librarians are not paid enough. This is because of the number of women in the
profession and because the old stereotype of librarians still exists (Estes, 1992). For example, in
Academic Law Libraries in 1970, a study shows that the median salary for men was $13,750 and
$8,500 for women (Hoeppner, 1993). This status is the same for women in the entire profession.
The good news is that there are more women entering the legal field, but the bad news is
that a change needs to occur or we will be undervaluing librarianship even more. According to
Gasaway (1996), women have served as directors for almost 100 years. It seems that the
inclination for a librarian to have both a law degree and library degree has had a greater impact
than do other societal factors.
Law Firm Librarians Today and Beyond
Law firm librarians face having to reinvent themselves as the profession is evolving
based on client demands and firm needs. Lambert (2014) comments on the question, “What is
wrong with law firm libraries today?” posed by a well-respected knowledge management expert
in the field, DiDomenico. He states that “there tends to be a lack of direction in the library as to
where it fits in the overall strategy of the firm” (para. 3). Lambert goes on to say that “law firms
have not decided how to bring the law library into the modern day structure of a 21st Century
firm.”

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

39

Farlong (2013) suggests eight emerging roles for law firm librarians, as the traditional
role is shifting, highlighting the opportunity for law librarians to incorporate themselves into the
new business models: niche expert resource (embedded librarian), CLE designer, legal project
management coordinator, business intelligence director, legal knowledge liaison, application
programmer, AFA coordinator, and client knowledge engineer. Each of these is unique to the
changes occurring within law firms yet consists of functions that are not new to law firms.
Moyer (1993) suggested several new functions for law firm librarians including practice
management involvement, prospect visit research, prospective hire research, prospective client
examination, and competitive research. With librarians as the stewards of information, there is
an opportunity to transform the profession (Farlong, 2013).
Knowledge management and competitive intelligence are two of the key areas that
information professional agencies have seen more jobs for and are skills desired of law firm
librarians. The ALM Legal Intelligence Law Firm Staffing report (2014) shows libraries are
morphing into centers of competitive intelligence and knowledge management. Law firm
libraries are constantly evolving given both the nature of the law firm environment and that of
information.
Big data is a long-established buzzword in the market. Monte and Stein (2014) report
that law firms are not yet in the big data world, with only the legal vendors being that far along
within the industry. Rovner thinks of big data as “any collection of data that…enables its owner
to develop new insights or capabilities” and that law firms are not usually involved with these
large data sets (as cited in Monte & Stein, 2014, p. 18). Bowers, Elster, Lynch, and Rushing
(2014), suggest that law firm librarians have always been ahead of the curve with information
and that law librarians may just have a new role ahead of them when dealing with big data. In

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

40

this role, the library becomes a location where all departments maintain, manage, and organize
internal law firm data. In essence, this may be similar to the role of a knowledge manager.
Law firm library: Knowledge management. According Rusanow (2006), only 61% of
participants reported any kind of knowledge management strategy. More and more law firms are
becoming knowledge-centric, with so much firm intelligence and attorney communication that it
becomes critical to have a system in place to track content. The research found that information
management skills are recognized as being important in knowledge management environments,
but that the people who possess these skills do not necessarily come from the information
profession (Rikowski, 2000). Librarians will become obsolete if they do not understand
knowledge management and that is another reason why many firms have not adopted the notion
as more widespread. Firms have produced internal information for years, and now this
information can be viewed as value.
Groff and Jones (2003) defining knowledge management as “strategies, techniques, and
tools used by an organization to capture, retain, analyze, organize, improve, and share data,
information, and knowledge relating to the operation and administration of its business” (p. 2),
and Du Plessis and du Toit (2006) suggest it is the “ability to identify, capture, and leverage the
internal knowledge of individuals" at the firm and to combine this knowledge with knowledge
derived from others (p. 360). Each of the definitions points out that knowledge management
revolves around the idea of central management of a firms’ information.
Knowledge management has still been a challenging issue for law firms to adopt. Zeide
and Liebowitz (2012) discuss the barriers of cultural resistance as a reason for this challenge.
Diggle (2011) found the following barriers to increased knowledge efficiency with UK law
firms:

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

41



Decentralized knowledge functions prevent systematic implementation.



A misconception about what clients are actually paying for.



Cultural resistance to working with new technology or external providers.



The decision-making process for implementing new approaches is dominated by the costs
without a rational assessment of the benefits.



Senior stakeholders in law firms are often the least open to change.



Under-resourced implementation of knowledge initiatives (p. 3).
Milton (2014) reports from the April Knowledge Management Survey Report there are

five core skillsets are looked for in a knowledge management team: information technology,
library, organization/industry, facilitation, communication, and human resource skills.
Organization/industry skills and experience was ranked the highest priority with 4.7 of 7 (Milton,
2014). Industry skills are more favored by law firms where most knowledge management teams
include attorneys, librarians, and paralegals. According to Citi Private Bank & Hildebrandt
Consulting LLC (2014), “part of what enables firms to adopt non-traditional leverage models is
the increased focus on knowledge management” (p. 6). Zeide and Liebowitz (2012) state “that
law firm use of knowledge management can cut costs by up to 25%” (p. 34). Additionally, “the
collection, curation, dissemination, and application of knowledge” are seen by Farlong (2013,
para. 3) as the key to law firm efficiency and profits.
Saylor (2014) reports on the International Legal Technology Association’s fourth
knowledge management survey conducted every two years, showing that the percentage of law
firm participants with a knowledge management department increased by 4% between 2008 and
2014. As can be seen in Figure 4 from International Legal Technology Association (ILTA)
(2014), the majority of knowledge management efforts were led by attorneys (both practicing

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

42

and non-practicing) followed by librarians. In all, 46.7% of participants reported that the library
role is part of or reports into knowledge management (ILTA, 2014).

Beaumont (2010) provides his viewpoint on the implementation of a knowledge
management program within his firm. He expresses that buy-in and support from upper
management is necessary and that people need to be involved from the beginning. “One of the
major factors that is often cited as a barrier to successful knowledge management within law
firms is that of culture” (p. 230). Beaumont included taking steps by communicating and
involving staff at the beginning of the initiative. The path to knowledge management is

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

43

challenging, but, if a clear strategy is in place and communicated regularly, law librarians may be
able to make further headway on knowledge management initiatives.
Law firm library: Competitive intelligence. Abramovitz, Bailey and Gowan (2010)
state that, “as competition for client representation increases, the need for valuable competitive
business information and analysis in firms has drastically increased. Experienced law librarians
are ideally situated to manage and deliver the quality intelligence that is critical in this economy”
(“Law Firm Business Intelligence,” para. 2). Business intelligence and competitive intelligence
are not new to the legal field, but the role law librarians may play is crucial to law firm growth
and still somewhat unclear.
Peros (2006) shares the blurred lines between the business development department and
the law library –in sharing of both work and credit. In contrast, Kaczorowski (2008) discusses
the steps her firm, Neal, Gerber & Eisenberg LLP, took in creating and implementing a
successful competitive intelligence program. Of these, the most critical was to have a plan of
action in place between the library and marketing, which entailed setting a meeting with
marketing. Additionally, maintaining effective communication during the process from
beginning to end was important.
John Barker, VP of Strategy & Competitive Intelligence at Wolters Kluwer, questions
whether the role of the law librarian should expand into a more expert role in law firm business
development (2014). He believes that law librarians have valuable expertise in that they know
where to find the resources and answers that can support practice areas and specific business
goals. Both Cunningham (2013) and AALL (2014) recommend steps to partner closely with
business development, IT and marketing departments in law firms.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

44

AALL created a resource guide, The Library as a Business Development, Competitive
Intelligence and Client Relations Asset for Law Firms, which highlights the importance of the
library and a librarian’s role in working with marketing and business development efforts. They
suggest creating cross-functional teams, conducting research to support marketing and business
development plans, monitoring trends, and supporting the business of law in order to be
proactive with firm needs. AALL states that competitive intelligence “has become more
important as a planning and market knowledge tool within law firms around the globe during the
last 5 to 10 years” (p. 4). Johnson (2000) defines competitive intelligence (CI) as a “purposeful
and coordinated monitoring of your competitor(s), wherever and whoever they may be, within a
specific marketplace” (para. 2).
Schweyer (2008) discusses aspects of competitive intelligence and resources to use in law
firms. Law librarians are regularly asked to conduct CI research. As Schweyer explains, “what
makes CI different in law firms is the client focus” (p. 32). Some of the ways in which law firms
use CI are


examining the law firm’s expertise from other legal competitors and relating it to the
needs and goals of the client;



researching how much business is coming from a client;



benchmarking against competitors;



researching prospects; and



going beyond company research and understanding the industry and detailed analysis of
the company (Schweyer, 2008).

Competitive intelligence is unique because it goes beyond basic research. It is not a data dump
and entails synthesizing, analyzing, curating, and presenting content in a user-friendly manner

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

45

for making sound business decisions at the firm. Further, there are specific features and
resources for CI work including both free and paid resources. There is no one resource that will
answer all your CI questions and generally law librarians need to use multiple sources to obtain
all the details needed (Schweyer, 2008).
Librarian value. Many articles discuss the value that librarians provide does have an
impact on their value to the organizations. Cunningham (2013) identified “the library staff as the
assets of the law library to be leveraged” (para. 3). She states that the staff members should
“spread their value across the firm” as “experts in practice areas” and through “uniting with IT”
(2013, para. 3). “Law firms that take advantage of the competence of their library staff can
realize benefits in productivity that are measurable in dollars and cents” which will impact the
bottom line (“Benefits of Uniting the Library with IT,” para. 2). Terjesen (2014) recently
commented on the same thing just a year and a half later stating that “law firms that can deliver
value through competitive advantage are the law firms of the future – and leveraging library
services is integral to that value” (para. 1).
Bailey and Florio (2013) point out that:
Change has brought a number of leadership models to the firm environment, and keeping
track of our leadership structure and the strategic directions of our shifting industry is
often a real challenge…it is critically important that we gain visibility with leadership,
communicate our value, and become a more prominent and permanent part of the firm’s
strategic direction. (p. 39)
Law firm librarians are examining how they can make an impact and align their services with the
firm’s strategic goals. Stacey (2014) states that a balanced scorecard has been used by law firm
libraries “to demonstrate the value to their parent organizations, accomplish their goals with
limited resources, and enable managers to make informed decisions concerning resource
allocation and service development” (p. 8). Law firm librarians need to run their library like it is

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

46

a business (Bradley, Hirt, & Smith, 2011; Lambert, 2011; Terjesen, 2014). “Librarians…are
finding themselves in the position where they must build a solid and effective case on how their
library adds significant value to the organization or institution that pays the bills” (Gohlke, 1997,
p. 22).
Holt (2007) emphasized that all library staff should be communicating the value of the
library to users at all times and that what user’s value about library services is saving time and
money. This is particularly true in a law firm environment where attorneys are cost-conscious
about making their profits. They may not particularly care about the costs, but clients and the
firm partners do. It would be to a law firm librarian’s benefit to understand the business of law
and how his/her value affects the bottom line. Lamb (2010) wrote an article in the ABA Journal
about whether it pays to hire a law firm librarian. This article received much feedback
particularly from the law librarian community as to Lamb’s stance that a law firm only needs a
law librarian for online research. He claims his point was “to use librarians to illustrate a point
to everyone – the need to figure out how to add real value to the enterprise” (Lamb, 2011, para.
2). In response to Lamb’s article, Gediman (2011), summed up the business case for having a
librarian on staff at a law firm for three main reasons:
1. Having a librarian manage your vendor contracts, including negotiations, and
relationships can save the firm money. Librarians have unique relationships with
vendors – or partnerships – in that they get to know their vendors. At the same time,
librarians have knowledge about vendors, resources, and trends in the industry to
know about best pricing and obtaining extra incentives from vendors.
2. Librarians are an integral part of the business development at a law firm. Librarians
know what resources to use, how to research competition and present their findings.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

47

3. Librarians are custodians of the firm’s knowledge – culture, norms, stories, and
practices. They use this knowledge to support attorney needs through the
management and curation of information. (“Hiring a Law Librarian Pays,” para. 2)
Imai and Gelfand (2010) find that being able to negotiate effectively across differing cultures is
critical to relationships, including alliances, mergers, licensing agreements, and sales. Law
librarians are involved with each of these, and the literature since 2010 discusses very little about
the characteristics negotiators need in order to maximize optimal agreements. One such aspect is
CQ. As librarians are involved with negotiating contracts, budgets and staff needs, this skill can
be extremely useful.
Rosin (2006) further identifies key contributions that law firm librarians make to the law
firm, including that a firm librarian contributes through the following:


can assist with statistics and data for legal administration;



is a part of the managerial team and contributes ideas;



makes decisions which influence the firms actions;



is a specialist within the firm;



is heavily involved with marketing and business development initiatives;



influences the bottom line due to their knowledge and researching cost-effectively;



protects the firm’s investment in resources, both print and online;



understands what resources are available and where to obtain requested information;



is an information expert that assists attorneys, paralegals and staff with finding what
they need through the information overload;



is a curator of information; able to sift through the mounds of information available
and organize, analyze and deliver to meet the attorney’s needs;

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE


48

understand the importance of disaster planning, preservation, and security of firm
information; and



provides the support necessary for the firm to maximize the knowledge base. (p. 1,
19-23)

If a librarian can quantify the value of the library for management, this will be the key to
controlling the future of the law firm library (Todd, 2006). Ang and Inkpen (2008) stated “the
possession of CQ by a firm’s managers is a valuable resource, especially when the CQ resides in
its upper echelons or top management team” (p. 343). The value of the librarian and library is
important to understand in order to see why law firm librarians need to know their cultural
competence.
Cultural Intelligence in Librarianship
There has not been any empirical research related to the CQ of law firm librarians;
however, several reports discussed developing more culturally aware lawyers. Two examples are
the “MacCrate Report” from the American Bar Association in 1992 and “Educating Lawyers”
from the Carnegie Foundation in 2007. In 1974, Anita Scheller said, “Once fields become
established as men’s or women’s professions they are very hard to change” (Weibel et al., 1979,
p. 288). With librarianship still being predominantly female, it is even more important for law
firm librarians to understand their CQ.
Research on culture and diversity in general is large in the field of scholarship, but
limited literature exists specific to law librarianship. However, there have been several
discussions on culture and diversity within the field of librarianship as a whole (Greer et al.,
2001; Howland, 2001; Kreitz, 2008; Overall, 2009; Smith, 2008). Greer, Stephens, and Coleman
(2001) examine how gender roles affect the workplace and recommend organizations “establish

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

49

the organizational culture…institute effective and on-going training” (p. 137). This is of
particular importance as librarianship has been predominantly dominated by women since the
late 1800s (AALL, 2013). Howland (2001) expands on this and looks at specific workplace
challenges.
Overall (2009) has probably one of the closest articles related to CQ and information
professionals. She focuses on how to use cultural competence as a framework for the library
profession. Cultural competence means “abilities of empathy, respect, understanding, patience
and nonjudgmental attitudes” (p. 189). It is with this cultural competence that one may
“effectively reach those who would benefit the most from library services” (p. 200). Smith
(2008) is in agreement with that, and takes the argument a step further to consider making the
library itself diverse. Griffer and Perlis (2007) said to “develop cultural competence, one might
expect that individuals need inherent skills or predispositions to be sensitive to the needs and
worldview of others” (p. 28).
Additionally, Ramirez’s (2010) research presents a model for how CQ levels may affect
conflict resolution ability. In a state of continual change and challenges in the legal industry,
particularly with law firms, conflict exists. Ramirez determines “that a higher level of CQ
positively affects and predicts whether an individual will select an appropriate conflict resolution
strategy fitting for the cultural backgrounds of those involved in the conflict” (p. 43). Figure 5
shows characteristics associated with high and low CQ (Ang et al., 2007; Brislin et al., 2006).

If a librarian is able to understand cultural competency, she and/or he will be able to
achieve long-term institutional change. Librarians are almost forced to evolve with the changing
times and need to work toward understanding different cultures to embrace diversity (Gabriel,
2010). Budrina (2011) suggests that “culture and cultural difference have a greater influence on
business effectiveness than we think, and it is, therefore, important for companies to develop the
cultural intelligence (CQ) of their employees” (“Cultural Diversity in Business,” para. 1).
Budrina (2011) further states that, in order to bridge the gap on differences, there are several
items that organizations should consider, including leadership development, analysis and
evaluation, cultural management, and managing diversity.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

51

Cultural Intelligence Training
Researchers have also identified the need to develop global leaders throughout the
literature (Alon & Higgins, 2005; Brislin et al., 2006; Earley, 1987; Earley & Mosakowski,
2004). The legal profession, as in many industries, devotes time and resources to diversity
training initiatives while cultural competence goes beyond the kind of diversity that is usually
addressed because it involves much more than just diversity. Deal and Prince (2003) focus on
how to culturally adapt and educate individuals on different cultures. Their work is focused on
leadership development and assisting individuals in leadership roles to understand cultural
adaptability. CQ shows importance for developing leaders and can have a major impact on
organizations. Santana (2010) suggests five ways to boost cultural agility to be an effective
leader: switching your frame of reference, being curious, looking for commonalities, reflecting
and learning, and being a champion of the ideas of others. Earley, Ang and Tan (2006) further
recommend three ways to develop your ability to work more effectively in culturally diverse
workplaces:
1. Develop your cultural strategic thinking.
2. Build bridges of goodwill and understanding by enhancing your motivational CQ.
3. Broaden your behavior by enhancing your behavioral CQ (pp. 121-122).
There have been many studies related to intercultural training and cross-cultural training
in terms of using CQ as a training tool which would be helpful for law firm libraries. Tung
(1981) studied intercultural training for managers to help them succeed in a foreign culture and
recommended area studies, culture assimilator, language preparation, sensitivity training, and
field experiences. Earley (1987) conducted a study “to determine what types of training are most
effective in preparing people for overseas work assignments” (p. 687). He found that that

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

52

documentary and interpersonal approaches are critical to prepare managers for new cultures.
Harrison (1992) examined behavioral modeling and cultural assimilator in cross-cultural
management training. Prior to his study, the effects of combined training efforts including
learning and behavior were not discussed in the literature. Harrison’s findings suggest “that in
order to maximize learning, a combination of training methods is needed” (p. 959).
Metacognitive-cognitive facet training (self-concept theory), motivation facet training
and behavior facet training can all be combined to design intercultural training. Specific training
should be based on a needs-based analysis of the individual. Training suggested in the research
includes formal programs, global initiatives, mentoring, language proficiency, case studies,
simulations, role play, experiential learning, cultural assimilators, international rotation programs
and international practical experience (Alon & Higgins, 2005). Earley and Mosakowski (2004)
identify six steps to enhance CQ: assessment, training selection, training application, resources to
support approach, entering into a cultural setting and reevaluation.
Alon and Higgins (2005) indicate the benefits that CQ can have for global leadership
programs. Brislin et al. (2006) identified a four-step procedure to encourage CQ development:
1. Consider behaviors individuals may engage in with other cultures.
2. Introduce reasons for these behaviors.
3. Consider any emotional aspects.
4. Use knowledge to learn about other behaviors.
Triandis notes training techniques that enhance individual CQ are important (2006). Ang et al.
(2007) suggest “cultural intelligence has important implications for selecting, training and
developing a culturally intelligent workforce” (p. 365). Crowne (2008) states the depth of
cultural exposure influences CQ. Thus, CQ is not only valuable for conducting research and

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

53

understanding individual law librarian levels, but also for selecting and training librarians for
leadership positions in diverse environments (Earley & Ang, 2003).
Summary
Our environment is becoming more and more global. As the marketplace changes, so do
our workplaces. Cultures evolve, and managing within multiple cultures becomes a challenge.
Global leaders need to be “flexible enough to adapt with knowledge and sensitivity to each new
cultural situation that he or she faces” (Thomas & Inkson, 2003, p. 15). Behaviors that are
accepted in one culture may not necessarily be accepted in others. The concept of CQ is a
simple one, but takes time to cultivate and is an area this study explored with law librarians.

Chapter 3. Methodology and Procedures
The purpose of this concurrent mixed-methods study was to understand the phenomena
of cultural competency through an exploration of the CQ of law firm librarians. Law firm
librarians from throughout the United States were selected in order to understand their
perspectives and to help them better serve their law firm stakeholders. Three research questions
guided this study:
1. What is the overall level of cultural intelligence of participating law firm librarians?
2. What variations among participating law firm librarians, if any, exist among the four
capabilities of cultural intelligence?
3. What viewpoints do the law firm librarians have about the value and importance of
cultural intelligence within their law firms?
Research Approach and Design
Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) state a concurrent design entails combining both
quantitative and qualitative data within a traditional research design. For this study, both
quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The qualitative questions provided rich
narrative responses beyond what the quantitative data provided and gave insight into the
respondent’s viewpoints on CQ.
The researcher relied on a web-based survey process incorporating the CQS, a self-report
instrument used for academic purposes that measures an individual’s CQ level. The CQS is a
four-factor (capabilities) scale developed to test the four dimensions of CQ: (a) metacognitive,
(b) cognitive, (c) motivational, and (d) behavioral (Ang & Van Dyne. 2008). The web-based
survey also asked about select demographic information and included some open-ended items to
enable exploration of the librarians’ views regarding their law firms’ practices.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

55

Instead of using only the predominant quantitative method alone, the researcher selected
the concurrent nested strategy model in order to gain a broader perspective on CQ within the
sample. The qualitative data was useful to describe aspects of the study that could not be
quantified. The strengths to this type of model are that the researcher can collect the two types
of data at the same time, that it allows for a study with advantages of both qualitative and
quantitative analysis, and that it helps the researcher gain different outlooks from the diverse
types of data (Creswell, 2003).
Sources of Data
Population and sample. The target population for this study was made up of librarians
within the United States who currently work in private law firm libraries. The target population
included both males and females who hold a master’s degree in library and information science
and/or have equivalent law firm experience. Some individuals were in leadership or executive
positions at the time of this study and others had the equivalent job title of “law librarian”.
Individuals in these roles are not necessarily executives and may have differing job titles, but
they support the firm in their role as law librarians. This was an abstract population that could
contain tens of thousands of individuals. In order to better define the population, one prominent
professional organization served as the sampling frame: the Private Law Libraries Special
Interest Section (PLL-SIS) of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL). This
organization, established in 1977, was created “to promote interests and address issues of
concern to those employed in private law firms and corporations” (AALL, 2015, para. 1). The
PLL-SIS “has grown to more than 1,300 members and is the second largest SIS within AALL,”
comprising about a third of AALL’s membership (American Association of Law Libraries,
2015).

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

56

All members were subscribed to the My Communities section of the AALL website that
allows access to the Private Law Libraries Community, which was formerly known as the
listserv. Participants must be dues-paying members as well as members of AALL in order to
login and access this forum. All 1,292 current PLL members included in the PLL-SIS
community were invited to participate in the web-based survey. To obtain additional responses,
members of the SLA Legal Division and Law-Lib were invited to participate. The number of
law librarians who were members of either group was unknown. The sample was based on selfselection and, thus, may not be representative of the larger target population.
Data Collection Procedures
Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently via a web-based
process. The quantitative data consisted of demographic items and the already established CQS
with predetermined instrument-based questions. The already established CQS used for academic
purposes tests the four dimensions of CQ: (a) metacognitive, (b) cognitive, (c) motivational, and
(d) behavioral (Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). The qualitative data included open-ended items
necessary to explore the phenomena under study.
Permission to use the subscriber list was granted as part of the researcher’s membership
benefit, as she is a member of AALL, the PLL-SIS, and the SLA Legal Division through her
work. PLL-SIS Community subscribers and members of the SLA Legal Division and Law-lib
listservs received a link to the consent form and survey. A second notification was sent 10 days
after the first invitation, and a third notification was sent 7 days after the second invitation. The
survey was not sent out during peak season for annual conferences or during the holiday season
when law librarians are often on vacation. In total, the web-based survey was available for
approximately one month from initial announcement and closed thereafter.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

57

Web-based survey. The use of an electronic survey administration tool allowed IP
addresses to be removed prior to the researcher’s access to the results. An informed consent
form (Appendix D) was provided to explain the purpose of the study, the estimated time to
answer the survey, that questions may raise uncomfortable feelings, and to restate that results
would only be published in aggregate. Participants received the researcher’s contact information
in the event there were questions. It is possible that the researcher’s name influenced the
participants’ opting to take the survey.
Prior to administration, the survey instrument was revised based on feedback obtained
from the committee on the open-ended and demographic items. Pilot participants made
additional suggestions on the survey design and questions. The survey was administered
utilizing Qualtrics, a leading edge online survey software tool (Qualtrics, 2015). Interested
potential participants received an email with a link to the survey. This link led, first, to an
informed consent page and, when the participant agreed to participate, a link to the survey. If the
librarian chose not to participate, he/she was taken to a page thanking him/her for his/her
consideration.
Advantages of a web-based survey included the ease of managing the question form and
the speed of data entry and collection. Disadvantages are that participants were unable to go
back and make corrections and the risk of the Internet malfunctions (Fowler, 1993). There were
three components to the survey utilized in this study: a section with open-ended items, a section
containing the CQS instrument items, and a section with demographic items.
As an incentive to participate, the researcher agreed to provide a summary of the findings
approximately 6 months after the survey’s closing. If an individual wished to receive a summary
of the findings, he/she submitted his/her email address on a separate page. When the results

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

58

were reported, participants’ responses were described as a whole and not individually. As an
additional incentive, the researcher offered one in-depth CQ assessment and follow-up
consultation with CQ certified facilitator Michele A. Villagran after completion of the survey.
One participant was randomly selected among those who opted in via email on a page separate
from the survey.
Open-Ended items. The first section of the survey included several open-ended items to
encourage narrative responses regarding participant’s viewpoints on CQ, which could not be
obtained through close-ended survey items. The purpose of these items was to gather rich data
and additional information from the respondents. Open-ended items are listed in Table 1.

CQS instrument. The second part of the survey included the CQS assessment, granted to
academic researchers for research purposes. This is a 20-item four-factor scale developed by the

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

59

Cultural Intelligence Center (2005). This Four Factor scale developed by Earley and Ang (2003)
measures the elements of metacognition (4 questions), cognition (6 questions), motivation (5
questions), and behavior (5 questions). The CQS questions are measured on a 7-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The CQS was cross-validated in
Singapore and the United States (Ang, Van Dyne, & Tan, 2011), and use of the scale is granted
to academic researchers (Cultural Intelligence Center, 2005). In this study, the CQS was
converted from a paper-based format to a web-based format. The items and ratings remained the
same as in the already validated instrument self-report (Appendix A). Permission to use the
existing CQS four-factor instrument, converting the format for web-based use was granted
(Appendix C).
From a theoretical perspective, the findings indicate the 20-item scale is reliable and a
valid measure of CQ, and the scale can also provide insightful information about an individual’s
CQ. According to the Cultural Intelligence Center (2012) and Ang and Van Dyne (2008), the
CQS instrument shows strong empirical evidence of reliability, validity, and stability. The
Cultural Intelligence Center (2014) states that it “owns the copyright to the only academically
validated assessment of cultural intelligence” (“CQ Assessments,” 2015, para. 1). In addition,
results of six studies by Van Dyne, Ang, and Koh (2008) provide evidence that structure of the
CQS is stable across samples and across countries.
The Cultural Intelligence Center examined several elements of validity and reliability and
found that self-reported scores are positively correlated across observer-rated scores, and multimethod analysis supports the convergent validity of the scale. In addition, statistical analysis
shows the discriminant validity of the different factors and sub-dimensions of CQ. Results
demonstrated that all factor loadings were significant and supported the distinctiveness of the

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

60

four CQ factors relative to emotional intelligence, decision making, cultural judgment, mental
well-being, and cognitive abilities (Ang et al., 2007; Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). Ang et al. (2007)
demonstrated that CQ predicts cultural judgment, task performance, and decision making.
Directly related to this study, CQ also has predictive validity above and beyond general mental
ability, emotional intelligence, demographic characteristics, personality, rhetorical sensitivity and
social desirability (Van Dyne, Ang, & Koh, 2008).

Human Subjects Considerations
In complying with requirements regarding human subjects, all potential study participants
were informed their participation was voluntary, that responses were anonymous, and that they
would be held confidentially by the researcher and research committee.
Approval to conduct the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board (Appendix
E). This study qualifies as exempt within the category of research involving the use of
educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview
procedures or observation of public behavior (45 CFR 46.101 (b) (2)). The information obtained
would not be recorded in such a way that human subjects could be identified and responses, if
disclosed outside the research, would not place the participants at risk of criminal or civil activity
or endanger their reputation (Pepperdine University Institutional Review Boards, 2009).
The legal field, particularly law firms, is extremely sensitive to breach of contract, data
corruption, or confidentiality of internal practices and information. A perceived risk to law firm
librarians’ could be whether their responses were identifiable in the event of a breach in security.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

62

To minimize this concern, the software administration tool provided complete anonymity of
responses. In addition, no identifying information was collected, and participants were unable to
download their own results. The anonymous survey results were held in utmost confidence and
shared only with the researcher, the research committee, and one more researcher who verified
accuracy of the data. The survey data will be destroyed following completion of the study.
Data Analysis Processes
Raw data was available via the Qualtrics website. The researcher had password protected
access and downloaded the data to spreadsheets and documents for analysis and interpretation.
The researcher followed the processes for data analysis as suggested by Creswell and Plano
Clark (2011).
1. Prepare Data Analysis: Both qualitative data and quantitative data were prepared and
downloaded into their respective systems separately. The quantitative data were
downloaded into Excel worksheets and new variables were computed for analysis. The
qualitative data were downloaded into a text document and imported into a qualitative
analysis program, HyperResearch.
2. Explore and Analyze the Data: Both data sets were inspected. Analysis of quantitative
data consisted of descriptive analyses and of running reliability coefficients to determine
overall results. The researcher read through the qualitative data numerous times to gain a
better understanding of the responses and included memos/notes of importance to
forming categories (Richards & Morse, 2007). The researcher tracked these memos and
created a codebook based on the emerging topics and themes. The coding allowed
themes to be collected for each item, including themes that were not relevant to this study
or could be utilized for further research. This thematic coding analysis provided more

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

63

insight into the participants’ comments on items related to the topic that may not have
been collected from the CQS web-based data alone.
3. Represent the Data Analysis: The data results were represented in statements and
discussion of themes. Tables and figures were used.
4. Validate Data and Results: The researcher checked standards, utilized validation
strategies, checked for validity and reliability of current data, checked for accuracy, and
assessed internal/external reliability. The researcher checked for accuracy during this
process. Both forms of data were examined to develop trends and for understanding.
5. Interpret Results using Triangulation: Qualitative and quantitative analyses were merged
in order to interpret the data, address the research questions and compare the findings.
New questions based on the findings were also stated.
Internal Validity
The researcher’s role, particularly in qualitative research, requires the sharing of biases at
the beginning of the study, and the researcher implemented strategies to clarify these biases and
to triangulate the different data types in order to check for accuracy of the findings. The
researcher discussed her role when introducing the design and made every effort to be objective.
In addition, the analysis process involved bringing in a second researcher to evaluate the coded
data to ensure reliable interpretation. The second researcher has a research background, a
terminal degree, and understood the purpose of the study and the need for her assistance.
The researcher implemented suggestions by Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) regarding
minimizing threats to validity. The following are possible validity threats and strategies to help
minimize them based on suggestions that fit with the researcher’s merged data analysis (pp. 240241). There is the potential for bias in that one data collection may affect the other. To

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

64

minimize the risk, the researcher used one web-based survey to capture all the data in order to
minimize the threat. Secondly, because triangulation involves examining the data and utilizing it
to create a coherent justification for themes in the findings, there is potential risk of using
inadequate approaches to converge the data (Creswell, 2003). The researcher used a side-by-side
comparison for merged data analysis with quantitative categorical data and qualitative themes to
help minimize the threat. Third, the researcher addressed each question to ensure interpretation
and discussion of each.
There may be threats to the population external validity if the researcher draws inaccurate
inferences which are then applied to other individuals or future situations (Creswell, 2003).
Therefore, the researcher did not generalize beyond the group specified in the study. The results
were limited to other similar law firm librarians in the United States. Additionally, there were no
threats to statistical conclusion validity because the researcher made accurate inferences about
the data.
Summary
This mixed-methods study examined the phenomena of CQ of private law firm librarians
within the United States. Participants were selected in order to understand their perspectives and
to enable them to be of stronger service to their law firms. The established CQS, demographic
items, and qualitative items were developed into a web-based survey and disseminated to the
Private Law Libraries Community, SLA Legal Division listserv, and Law-lib listserv.

Chapter 4. Findings
The purpose of this study was to examine the CQ of law firm librarians in the United
States in order to understand their perspective and help them better serve their law firm
stakeholders. The nature of the study included the collection of data from both qualitative and
quantitative items on a web-based survey. The research questions were:
1.

What is the overall level of cultural intelligence of participating law firm
librarians?

2.

What variations among participating law firm librarians, if any, exist among the
four capabilities of cultural intelligence?

3.

What viewpoints do the law firm librarians have about the value and importance
of cultural intelligence within their law firms?

This chapter presents the demographics of the participants, qualitative analyses of the
open-ended responses from the survey, quantitative analyses of the survey data, and triangulation
of the data to determine study conclusions. The web-based survey consisted of three sections: a
section with open-ended items, a section containing the CQS instrument items, and a final
section with demographic questions.
Study Sample and Subjects
The sample was based on a self-selection process. Subjects were required to be based in
the United States and currently working within a law library at a law firm. Two prominent
professional associations served as the sampling frame. The Private Law Libraries Special
Interest Section (PLL-SIS) of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL), which
consists of approximately 1,300 dues paying members, and the Special Library Association
(SLA) Legal Division, consisting of an unknown number of members, were invited to participate

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

via their dedicated listservs. Additionally, the web-based survey link was sent to Law-Lib,
which is a listserv specific for law librarian use. It is not known how many subscribers there are
to this specific list. The quantitative and qualitative data was collected between February and
March 2015. Of the initial 170 individuals who responded to the request, 70 provided survey
responses. Not all participants responded to all items, and the discussion of findings indicates
the specific number of responses for each survey item. Only 29 to 30 of the respondents
answered the demographic items.
Sample Demographics
The study participants have a wide range of experience, education, job titles, and
geographic locations. As Figure 6 indicates, females represented 86% of the participants (n=25)
while males made up 14% (n=4).

Figure 6. Frequency distribution of gender (N=29)
Almost three-quarters of respondents have a master’s degree (70%; n=21), 23% (n=7)
have a terminal degree (post Masters), and 2 respondents (7%) have a 4-year college degree
(Figure 7). Thirty-six percent of respondents (n=11) have 20+ years of experience working in a

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE
law firm library, and the next largest percentage (27%; n=8) has 10 to 14 years of experience.
All respondents have at least a few years of experience (Figure 8).

Job title responses varied: 64% (n=18) included the word “library,” “libraries” or
“librarian.” Overall, there were 16 different job titles in use among the subjects. Job titles are
grouped as either director roles, manager roles or individual roles as either a librarian or a
research specialist. A few subjects worked in collaboration with a law firm and are indicated
separately as non-law firm roles (Tables 3 to 5).

Thirty subjects reported their geographic location. Thirty percent (n=9) were located in
the South (South Atlantic, East South Central, or West South Central), and 30% (n=9) were
located in the West (Mountain or Pacific) of the United States. Twenty-three percent (n=7) were
located in the Northeast (New England or Mid-Atlantic) and 17% (n=5) were located in the
Midwest (East North Central / West North Central) of the United States, as Figure 9 indicates.

Of these 30, most (n=25; 83%) work in their law firm’s headquarters, and only six (20%)
work in a branch location. One subject reported working virtually. Ninety percent (n=27) were
born in the United States of America, and the majority speak and/or write at least one language
(17/57%). Seven percent (n=2) indicated they speak and/or write over four languages. Eleven
respondents (36%) speak and/or write 2 or 3 languages (Figure 10). Approximately 43% (n=13)
of the subjects reported having lived or worked overseas (Figure 11).

Qualitative Findings
Ten items allowed subjects to provide narrative responses. Between 24 and 70
participants provided responses. All responses were analyzed, resulting in eleven themes, and
nine of these were specific to the study’s purpose: “Individual Drive”, “Individual Knowledge”,
“Individual Strategy”, “Individual Action”, “Understanding Different Cultures”, “Experience
with CQ Term”, “Challenges”, “Importance-Value”, and “Environment-Climate”. The first four
themes were identified following the order of the CQ model from the Cultural Intelligence
Center, with the remaining themes in no particular order. One theme, “Being Valued”, was
present in the data, but not specifically related to the research questions. However, it is
discussed as it has some relevance for future research. A final theme included content labeled as
“Other” because either respondents referenced n/a in the response or the response did not fit
within other themes or subthemes.
Overall, there are 841 coded text passages provided from the 70 subjects linked to
specific themes and subthemes. Of the 841, several text passages were coded to more than one
subtheme or theme (“Change”, “Communication”, “Diversity”, “Research Requests”, and

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

72

“Understanding Different Cultures”) resulting in a frequency of 1171 total. Table 6 shows the
major themes present along with the frequency of coded text passages. The subthemes came out
of the coded text passes and were subthemes that developed within the main themes. Seven of
the eleven themes included several subthemes as well and are displayed in Tables 7 to 13. Table
13 includes the frequency of the five recurrent subthemes. “Understanding Different Cultures”,
“Challenges”, and “Environment-Climate” did not include any subthemes and, therefore, no

Overall Level of Cultural Intelligence
Research Question 1 asks, “What is the overall level of cultural intelligence of
participating law firm librarians?” Seven overall themes from the qualitative results provide a
response for this question. Four are specific to the four sub dimensions (factors) of CQ, as
defined by the Cultural Intelligence Center, and identified as themes: “Drive”, “Knowledge”,

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

73

“Strategy”, and “Action”. Three other relevant themes emerged from the responses:
“Understanding Different Cultures”, “Experience with CQ term”, and “Challenges”.
Individual Drive. Fifty-two subjects responded to the question of “Do you utilize drive
and motivation to work through challenges that come with cross-cultural situations you
encounter?” Drive was identified as the extent to which one is energized and persistent in one’s
approach to multicultural situations. It includes self-confidence in own abilities as well as sense
of the benefits to be gained from intercultural interactions. Table 7 shows the subthemes and
frequencies for the theme, Individual Drive. Thirty text passages were coded to subjects
reporting they do use CQ drive.
Some subjects described their work environment as not being cross-cultural; however,
CQ drive may or may not have been used. There was some expressed intrinsic interest
(including gaining personal enjoyment, having a sense of purpose, wanting to leave a good
impression) with comments such as, “I am a very driven and motivated person and when I
encounter something different, I want to do a better job in order to make sure I have left a good
impression of myself and my library.” Another subject stated similar sentiments, “motivation to
provide great service to my internal patrons would apply here,” and another, “motivation to do
my professional best.”
Twelve passages of text were coded with “extrinsic interest” (which is gaining benefits
from culturally diverse experiences). One subject stated, the “drive and motivation to retain
employment” with other subjects indicating, “annual increases,” and “my achievements are
recognized with praise and promotion” as indicators of extrinsic interest. Two passages focused
on information needs expected to be met by the library. One respondent commented, “Law
librarians are expected to have the drive and motivation necessary to tackle anything that comes

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

74

up….As a general rule, the firm’s information needs are expected to be met by the library –
whatever that requires.”
A second subtheme was “self-efficacy”, which is the self-confidence to be effective in
cultural situations and was recognized numerous times throughout the responses. One study
participant commented, “I also rely on my people skills I developed through many years of
working in the restaurant business,” and another expressed, “I use a combination of social
intelligence and ability to read social cues, being widely read with a fairly broad knowledge
base, being smart, in addition to drive and motivation.” “Diversity”, which was also included
within other themes, was present six times within passages. One subject indicated,
I try to be aware of cross cultural situation especially when dealing with our clients and
younger associates. …I am noticing more diversity among our “American” staff,
attorneys, and clients as well. This is not limited to the obvious issues of race – we have
more mixed race staff and people who are more open about their lifestyles.
Another subject commented on diversity on his/her teams, stating,
There is some diversity on our team terms of sexual orientation, religion and philosophy
– but nothing that has ever caused any problems that I’m aware of. But I’ll give the
caveat that perhaps I’m just not aware of them, not that these situations haven’t come up.
Another respondent indicated his/her familiarity with the term “diversity”, but not cultural
intelligence.

Individual Knowledge. Forty-four subjects responded to the question of “Do you have
sufficient cultural understanding needed to be effective culturally within your law firm? Or
would you like to have training in this area?” This theme focuses on the degree to which one
understands how culture influences how people think and behave and one’s level of familiarity
with how cultures are similar and different. Table 8 shows the frequency of the subthemes
within the theme, “Individual Knowledge”. Passages were also coded as having sufficient
understanding, with several elaborations. One subject expressed that, “knowing the business
workings of a law firm could be more beneficial, so I can understand better priorities,” even
though she and/or he believes she and/or he has sufficient understanding.

Another subject suggested that,
I believe exposure to others in other social environments within the firm would aid in the
cultural understanding. By this I mean more than when a patron comes to the library to
request something specific or request guidance for a research project. Formal training is
not needed but context may be.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

76

As to training, 28 passages were coded to this subtheme, and comments ranged from,
“Training may help. However, if you are not involved in the front line decision making, you will
be reacting, not acting to changes,” to concerns,
I’d love training in this area but having worked at two firms now, I believe the culture is
different from firm to firm and this would be a great challenge to teach in an educational
setting. I’m not sure it can be taught.
Coded text passages throughout included elements of the macro understanding of cultural
similarities and differences such as economic and legal systems, values, norms, rules of
languages, and non-verbal behaviors (coded as subtheme, “Context General”). One subject
explained, “I was more culturally effective than the vast majority of my coworkers by virtue of
having studied foreign languages and cultures.” Another subject indicated that, “I have traveled
enough and lived abroad briefly so feel that I am aware of, and hopefully sensitive to, different
cultural perceptions, expectations that I’m flexible in approaching and dealing with all.” “Many
of our users are of different faiths and I always try to be sensitive to their religious holidays,”
illustrates another subject response.
Several additional examples came out of the response to the theme “Strategy” below, but
are worth mentioning here as they also fall under “Context General” which, is part of CQ
Knowledge. One subject explained that,
Knowing what foreign counsel is, and is not, saying; cultural norms may preclude
counsel from offering negative opinion or sharing certain information unless asked pointblank. I did this with Indonesian counsel after it was clear my boss was not “getting” the
unspoken message.
Another example illustrates use of “Knowledge”,
We had a Muslim employee. The employee wanted to pray at the proper times, and face
Mecca. In the Library, we devoted a small training space to the employee (who was not a
Library team member) so that he could pray in peace. We also figured out which way
Mecca was, and placed a small insignia in the proper direction.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

77

Another example shows a lack of “Knowledge”,
I had a black friend at a former firm, and I prided myself on my understanding of the
history of African Americans and the Civil Rights movement. I went overboard in trying
to represent this to her and this hurt our relationship for a time. I later apologized to her,
and let her know I would work more on focusing on our similarities, rather than any
perceived differences.
The subtheme of “Context Specific”, which relates to understanding how culture
influences effectiveness in specific domains, such as in leadership or a law firm environment,
was evident in some responses. One subject highlighted the institutional environment and that
s/he,
Sometimes feel out of the loop when it comes to gossip, but that is fine with me. When I
first got here, it was difficult without institutional history background to jump into
helping with a very large client matter or in knowing who was involved in various parts
of the matter, or how different partners liked to have things presented to them.
“Understanding Different Cultures” (coded to 63 text passages) is a theme on its own described
further below; however, within “Knowledge”, this theme appeared three times. Subjects
expressed, “I have traveled enough and lived abroad briefly so feel that I am aware of, and
hopefully sensitive to, different cultural perceptions, expectations that I’m flexible in
approaching and dealing with all,” and, “I have a basic understanding of the firm’s culture.”
Individual Strategy. Thirty-seven subjects responded to “Share an example of what
extent you are aware of what’s going on in a multicultural situation. Describe your ability to
manage the situation effectively within your law firm and/or your feeling frustrated or lost in
such a situation.” Strategy is described as the extent to which one is aware of what is going on
in a multicultural situation and the ability to use that awareness to manage those situations
effectively. Table 9 shows the subthemes and frequency within the theme, “Individual Strategy.”
A few passages directly stated not feeling frustrated or lost in these types of situations, with 10
passages coded as expressing some level of frustration. At least three of these related to

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

78

management. For example, one subject stated, “It is often frustrating to have to lobby to firm
management to have extra expenses for new services approved when it is all part of the effort to
make the new groups functional and profitable!”

Other respondent commented with similar frustration with management, stating there is
“significant frustration with decision making by management without asking for or using the
expertise of librarian.” A third subject also expressed frustration with administration, saying,
I’m working now to plan the library space in new construction. The lack of
understanding the admins have of the current library’s state resulted in assumptions on
their part and now a time crunch to get the data needed for the designers to be able to
plan effectively. It made me feel like when I talk about the library I am either not heard
or my meaning is not effectively conveyed.
Further,
[E]ven more frustrating is dealing with vendors… that seek to preserve revenue streams
from smaller firms, or larger ones that have fallen apart, by including language in
subscription licensing agreements that essentially require the “new” firm to assume
responsibility for paying the former firm’s contract value.
Another example relating to the online research databases shows “there is frustration
when online legal research databases change constantly, but it would be worse if the vendors
didn’t modernize, and we are spoiled by such wonderful resources.” One subject commented on
the frustration with how staff is viewed, saying, “I feel demoralized when I see how staff from

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

79

different cultural, educational, gender backgrounds is dismissed as not having ideas of value
because they do not always present their ideas in standard business jargon.”
Some passages were coded to “Guidance”. One subject expressed how,
I meet regularly with other managers to gain an understanding of issues and problems
being experienced by my colleagues. I meet regularly with my attorneys to discuss their
needs. I work closely with my first-year associates during their transition year and
prepare training classes to develop specific skills needed to be successful.
Another expressed when confronted with a situation where there may be a cultural
difference, “I always ask a colleague for guidance.” Additionally, one subject mentioned that, “I
would also seek advice from our HR Director and colleagues at other firms (without revealing
any confidential information).” In another example one subject discussed his/her experience
when going to a single provider for their online research contracts and reducing the print
collection. S/he stated,
I had to be sensitive to the attorneys who were reluctant to do away with a large number
of our print subscriptions as well as not renewing one of our major online research
services contracts. I had to work very closely with many individuals to get buy-in and to
assure them that making the changes would be the best course of action.
This example also illustrates subtheme, “Planning”, as discussed below.
“Checking” was another subtheme within “Strategy”, focusing on checking assumptions
and adjusting mental maps when actual experiences differ from expectations. One passage
specifically hit on this and the subtheme of “Planning” when it comes to law firms and working
with Partners, stating “law firms are different than other companies. Larger law firms are
different than boutique firms. Different practices may have different personalities. Honestly, it’s
wise to assess the culture before pissing off a partner – to put it bluntly.” “Planning” is described
as strategizing before a culturally diverse encounter.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

80

Seven passages were coded to this subtheme, with specific examples. One subject
described involvement with practice groups:
We have a variety of practice groups in our firm, each of which meets regularly once a
month. I am not always successful in getting into the meetings, so in the background I
worked to have myself included on their e-mail groups. This allows me to be aware of
discussions that would occur outside of the official meetings and allows me to approach
individuals with suggestions of ways the library (Information Center) can assist.
Also, when it comes to contract negotiations, one respondent stated, “My firm has a
definite process for both cancelling as well as negotiating and approving vendor contracts and
over the years I feel good about the ways in which I have navigated this sometimes tricky
landscape.” Another subject reported on how CQ affected his/her frame of reference; she and/or
he stated, “My cultural intelligence has led me to decide not to continue with plans to dedicate a
large space to print resources in new construction and rather concentrate on the library as a
service.”
The subtheme of “Awareness”, described as knowing about one’s existing cultural
knowledge, was coded to eleven text passages, and seven of these fell within the theme
“Strategy”. One subject expressed, “Multicultuality is part of life in United States. I am an
immigrant. There are thousands like me here. It is second nature to us to deal with the problem.”
Another two respondents stated, “Many of our users are of different faiths and I always try to be
sensitive to their religious holidays” and “I understand that there are certain cultural differences –
such as acquiescing to authority.” An additional subject pointed out, “I have to find ways to be
aware of what management might be planning on a variety of fronts.” Regarding new
employees, one subject commented,
If a new employee with a different education background, different social background
joins our team I would want them to feel as welcome as possible and comfortable in their
new environment. Strong librarian skills begin with strong communication and critical

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

81

thinking skills. If one is nervous or uncomfortable in a work environment it will be hard
to build either of these skill sets.
The last subtheme within “Strategy” was “Example of CQ Strategy”, with several coded
text passages. It was important to code each passage because it shows real life examples of law
firm librarians who reported utilizing or not utilizing this factor within CQ. An example of lack
of CQ Strategy was illustrated in this subject’s comments,
Our firm has grown significantly during the past decade….As new practice groups have
joined the firm, they have often required subscription services that are new to us. Firm
management never asks the group that is joining, “What resources will you need and how
much will they cost?” Those details are worked out after the new group signs on, and as
a result, the expenses for those resources are usually unbudgeted, and often a shock to the
“powers that be.”
Another example highlighted both cultural and generational issues within in a law firm where
CQ Strategy was demonstrated: “One of our new associates is a woman from an Asian country
and despite our efforts to show her how to find information for herself she continues to ask us to
find relevant resources for her and then deliver them to her office.”
Individual Action. Many subjects responded to “Share an experience in which you
modified your actions and adapted to different cultural norms within your law firm.” As seen in
Table 10, five key subthemes came out of this theme: “Change”, “Communication”, “Modify
Expectations”, “More Efficient Billing”, and “Understanding Different Cultures”. “Change” and
“Communication” were also apparent in other themes, and “Understanding Different Cultures”
stands as one theme. Two passages focused on expectations and provided examples. One
subject stated,
My law firm is in a red state and is definitely more conservative. I have had to modify my
expectations about what is okay in a work environment (for example, I’m not used to
having to participate in Christmas activities), but since no actual religious aspects of the
holiday were observed, I got into the spirit of things without making a fuss.
In yet another example, a subject discussed travel and continuing education, stating,

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

82

In the past, travel and continuing education were broadly encouraged. As the firm culture
has changed, this “green light” default has yielded to more restrictive review processes.
Perforce, I have limited and modified my requests to account for what I perceive to be
different expectations.

Note. (N=115)

Within “More Efficient Billing”, two passages were specifically coded to this as
examples. One subject stated,
My last firm was very strict about billing for online research and if an attorney failed to
put in a number it was my job to track them down and ask if they had a number. Here
they are very laid back and I have learned to just let it slide if I repeatedly don’t have a
number for someone.
Another subject comments on the changes in practices in law firms regarding billing, stating,
“Much has been written about client expectations with regard to attorney billing practices, and
the change driven by those discussions is also a new experience for many law firms.”
Communication included comments related to adapting one’s communication, whether
verbal or nonverbal, modifying the manner and content of communication to fit multicultural
contexts, adjusting attitudes to those that you work with due to geographical cultures, and
adapting your own learning styles to different learning styles. Several subjects discussed how
their understanding of another’s culture allowed them to effectively communicate – whether it is
without offense, being politically correct, or with sensitivity. One subject observed, “Differences
in culture had led to a more difficult time in explaining a process, task, or technique, and have

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

83

made expectations on both sides of a research question more difficult to clarify” and that CQ
leads to effective communication.
Another subject commented, “As in any profession that is people-focused, it is imperative
that the attorneys be able to communicate with their clients.”
Another subject elaborates,
Learning to communicate effectively with members of a law firm is essential for law
librarians. We assist everyone from managing partners to legal administrative assistants.
Understanding cultural differences allow us to tailor the assistance we give to individuals,
instead of one standard that is applied to all.
Another subject discussed how important communication is with different levels of the firm,
stating, “I keep different levels of communication open with other departments and frequently
send them information that might be of interest, or relay awareness of challenges that they face.”
Another respondent says that, “open communication is key to managing multicultural issues
when they arise.”
Several passages discussed how subjects adapted their communication within their law
firms. One subject related this to norms, stating, “I learned to adapt communication to local
norms – some cultures disfavor directly proceeding to the business at hand, instead starting with
general inquiries into family, etc., whereas such an approach would be absolutely rude in other
cultures.” In a specific example, a respondent discussed the culture of the state of Minnesota,
saying, “The cultural nature of ‘Minnesota nice’ is something to adapt to. I need to realize
people dislike confrontation and I may need to be more proactive to make sure I am providing
them with sufficient/correct information.” Yet another subject discussed another geographic
area, the West Coast. S/he stated, “I am located on the West Coast, which has a perceived ‘laid
back’ attitude. I have had to prove that I can make quick decisions and am willing to work late
like our east coast colleagues.”

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

84

Another subject does two things when the exchange of information may be more
challenging due to culture: “Use a more formal but friendly approach. Document conversations
with email.” One respondent discussed non-verbal communication, saying, “I dress up for my
position especially in partner meetings.” Another subject adapted his/her language: “When
doing English-Spanish interpreting for pro bono political refugee cases involving Ecuadorian and
Mexican natives, adapted my Spanish to theirs as much as possible to facilitate communication.”
Another subject utilized his/her resources to accommodate and adapt to individuals who spoke
another language and explained, “I once had to deal with visiting legal scholars who spoke
mostly French. I asked our Westlaw rep (visiting at the time) to find resources in French.”
The subtheme “Change” was coded within multiple themes. Additionally, several of
these passages were also coded within “Environment-Climate”, as they deal with the
environment of the organization or department, and subtheme “Importance-Value” because they
are related to the value of CQ to law firms (both discussed below). Change is described as the
business of law undergoing change, law firm changes, and change management occurring at
different levels including change management. An example of a business transition mindset was
expressed within one passage,
I’ve been transitioning from a solely customer service-oriented frame of mind coming
from an academic setting to more of a business mind, as that is the focus of my direct
supervisor, the COO. I’m making library department decisions based on the desires of
the COO rather than the preferences of the users because that is what has been stressed as
necessary to be successful as a business.
Another respondent encompassed several aspects where adapting to unexpected change is
important:
IT departments might be working on planned technology overhauls that a librarian needs
to be aware of so as not to be taken by surprised when certain products suddenly don’t
work. Partners may move on to other firms, leaving a void; new practice groups may
arise that will need resources not already planned in an annual budget. Vendors change

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

85

product lines. These are just a few of the possibilities that can occur – and one has to be
ready to meet whatever challenge is raised by this constant state of flux.
Another subject discussed his/her “library change” with hopes of other changes in mind – “We’ll
likely transition into a ‘Resource Center’ rather than a ‘Library’ once we move. I’m hoping that
will help change the focus from the library as a place and a collection of books to a valued
service within the firm.” One respondent did not seem too optimistic regarding change, as she
and/or he stated, “understanding different cultures and identities are immensely
important...though, law firms are slower to shift than most.”
Another subject stated that, “Being able to adapt to changing or unfamiliar environments
will help a person succeed even despite changes in the workplace.” One passage particularly
illustrates the changes within the law firm library environment:
Change is inevitable and it is of paramount importance that one has the capability to
function effectively in a new and unfamiliar (or changing) environment. This last year
has proven how important it is in our firm. We have had a staffing reduction (i.e. I am
now a solo librarian), budget reduction of 20% (which will continue), library collection
reduction – weeding of print reporters, and a shifting of collections to empty shelving
space to make room for additional offices. The plan is to continue the budget reduction
where possible this year. These changes have required me to function in a new and
changing environment.
Another passage discussed the change over time for the profession:
I believe there is value is being able to adapt to new and changing environments
professionally, especially in a field that has undergone dramatic changes in the past 20 to
25 years due to the evolution of the electronic age and the internet.
Another subject summed up, “The profession is changing, the needs and demands of clients are
changing, and we need to keep up and get ahead of these developments.”
According to the responses, technology has also been a factor changing the practice.
“Technology has significantly changed law firm practice. If a person does not have CQ as
defined above, they will not survive in a medium to large law firm,” commented one subject.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

Another passage summed up the current state: “The only constant is change and leadership and
strategy in professional services is dependent on our knowledge services professionals being
extremely facile with changing technological, cultural, and information environments.” Further,
another passage highlighted this change element: “the profession is changing, the needs and
demands of clients are changing, and we need to keep up and get ahead of these developments.”
Understanding Different Cultures. “Understanding Different Cultures” was noted as a
main theme, but also identified as a subtheme within “Action”, with ten passages of the 63
identified within “Action”. One illustration that shows the library as inclusive was related to
holidays:
This particular experience has nothing to do with being the firm librarian, but it is in
regards to a task I undertake as extra….I created images for Hanukkah and Christmas
since we have staff/attorneys who celebrate both holidays. When I first came to my law
firm, celebrating Hanukkah or Kwanza did not enter into my norm, but because of this
project and discovering we had some who celebrated Hanukkah as well as Christmas. So
I try to make sure to be inclusive in all things in the library.
In another example, “Two of our newest employees in the library are vegetarian and vegan.
We’re adjusting to what foods we bring in for snacks and make sure that they know that we don’t
consider this an inconvenience.” In another example, on subject stated, “I think I tend to have
different political views than many in my firm, but it doesn’t come up in conversation, nor is it
integral to the work I do. I also don’t advertise my opinions.”
One passage considers different cultures, stating, “I think you need to be a sophisticated
person who broadly understands differences in culture. I don’t think you need to be an expert.
Good manners and patience can get you through most things.” Further, “As a member of the
dominant culture, it’s important to recognize others’ cultures and embrace them as equally
valid.” Another subject expressed, “Cultural intelligence is useful in dealing with foreign
offices, visiting attorneys, interns, and people of a minority background.” Another respondent

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

87

believed “understanding how others might think or react differently based on their culture can
help us to better achieve our mutual goals.” As a subject pointed out, “Each firm has a different
culture which includes set of values, work ethics, how people treat each other and attitude. A
person needs to be able to adapt to whatever culture they are in – and perhaps improve it.”
Understanding different cultures is also important and of value as “firms are dealing with a much
more diverse group of employees and clients, who have a wide variety of expectations,
experience, and points of view.”
Experience with CQ term. Numerous subjects responded to “What has been your
experience with the term or phrase cultural intelligence?” This item received the most
responses and was the first item on the survey. There are 10 subthemes identified within this
theme, and three of them (“Change”, “Diversity”, and “Understanding Different Cultures”)
coded within multiple themes (Table 11). Many passages were coded with “Never heard of it –
No experience” at all the term. One subject commented, “Not familiar with this term, but
familiar with the term ‘diversity’ for a while now.” Another commented, “Never heard the term
before. Sounds like Orwell’s 1984 newspeak. To me a more appropriate phrase would be
‘adapting to change.’” An additional respondent pointed out, “I am not familiar with this term,
and have not seen it come up in the literature of law librarianship or legal office administration.”

Some passage texts were coded with “Little experience”, as the text indicated little
experience with the term. One subject indicated first hearing of it at AALL several years ago,
and another indicated she and/or he has read several articles on the term. Another subject
indicated, “I can point to experiences I’ve had that could be tagged with this phrase, but it has
not been used in conversation I’ve been part of (whether professional or personal), nor do I recall
seeing it in my reading.” Another subject stated,
Although I have not heard the phrase, I understand the principles behind it. Sort of a
combination of an individual’s abilities to learn and an organizations manner of
onboarding new people so that they understand the way things are done at the
organization and can quickly become a functioning member of the staff.
Eight passages were coded to “Heard in Different Context”, as described as hearing this
term in another context. For example, one subject stated, “I have heard it used and understand it
as related to social adaptability.” While another subject indicated, “Mostly as a management
buzz word of the day.” Further, one passage discusses, “Sometimes seems like ‘corporate speak’
but that may be because I associate it with ‘emotional intelligence’ – well-overplayed phrase.” A
final passage denoted difficulty in understanding the term and the context it relates to: “I am still
having difficulty with the term ‘cultural understanding’. When I think ‘culture’ I think of persons
from different countries and ethnic or social classes. Your questions indicate more of an
organizational understanding approach.”

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

89

A small number of passages was coded as “Aware of Term”. One subject discussed it
within the law firm environment as
Law firms tend to cultural lethargy and have not yet widely adopted the measure of
cultural intelligence for law firm professionals. That said, knowledge and strategic
management professionals in law firms are aware of this term and manage to outcome of
“cultural intelligence,” whether they call it by that name or not.
Additionally, another subject identified where CQ is seen, saying, “…I believe cultural
intelligence comes into play with every new project – and it is a critical component to being able
to understand the client’s needs as well as their perspective.”
Two subjects stated they encountered the term within their academic career, and both,
specifically, in their library school curriculum. One subject explained that, “this term was used
to help us identify the ineffable qualities of working in an organization…. The caveat I would
insert is that having ‘cultural intelligence’ depends greatly on the solidity of hierarchy within the
organization.” Further, within the library school curriculum, this was “discussed as the
importance of being able to function effectively in unfamiliar environments and the importance
of being able to assess and serve the needs of users, regardless of whether those users are from
similar backgrounds.”
A few passages indicated experience with the term in “Teaching”. One subject mentioned
that, “I understood this term to mean the understanding of norms and idioms relative to the
dominant culture. Not knowing what certain terms meant could prove to be a handicap to
children trying to assimilate and to understand curriculum materials.” Another subject indicated
that, “cultural intelligence is most important in my capacity as a legal research instructor, where
it is useful to understand and respect the different experiential backgrounds of those receiving
instruction.” Several passages were coded to “Institutional Knowledge”, described as a
collective set of facts, experiences and know-how held by a group of people. One respondent

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

90

stated, “I don’t think I have any experience with that specific term, though I am familiar with
‘institutional knowledge’ – think they could be similar” and another described it as, “Institutional
familiarity that transcends the norm.” Another passage described it and its impact further: “By
being attuned to a firm’s institutional culture, employees and associates will be better able to
work effectively within that culture. It may be thought of as an efficiency heuristic for
interpersonal relations.”
“Onboarding” was also identified as a subtheme six times throughout the open ended
items when it came to experience with CQ. A subject stated, “First-year associates are
confronted with this issue upon arrival at the firm, as are summer associates who come onboard
for a three-month period every summer.” Another defined it as, “sort of a combination of an
individual’s abilities to learn and an organizations manner of onboarding new people so that they
understand the way things are done at the organization and can quickly become a functioning
member of the staff.” Other passages related to how it can add value in the onboarding process.
“It can help a law firm recognize and understand the need to address new employees’ issues with
adapting to the culture of a new and unfamiliar organization.” Further, another respondent
stated, “It will allow new employees to quickly learn how to become effective.”
Twenty-four subjects responded to “Share an experience of when your cultural
intelligence has been used and/or could be used in your role. This open-ended item consisted of
passages coded to various themes, including “Environment-Climate” and “Importance-Value”
(discussed more below). One subject commented, “We have numerous Summer Clerks come to
the law firm. I would like to be more sensitive about their backgrounds to help them adapt to a
stressful environment.” Another highlighted, “cultural intelligence is useful in dealing with

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

91

foreign offices, visiting attorneys, interns, and people of a minority background.” Another
subject illustrated both “Change” and “Environment-Climate”, stating,
We have had 3 marketing directors in a 5 year period. Because of my efforts to keep up
with business development and competitive intelligence trends and training I am seen as
a resource to help fill in gaps when new managers arrive and are learning the law firm
experience.
Challenges. Several passages were coded to this theme, and there were no subthemes.
“Challenges” are described as the following items: cultural group which provides challenges for
the firm, challenges when individuals discuss topics in the area, and other difficulties with
employment and working in the library. One subject indicated that “Drive” is the most difficult
part of his/her job. Other challenges have been more generational challenges from new interns
and associates to orient. As a respondent indicated, “The largest problem we have now is
meshing the generational approaches to the work which needs to be done.”
Related to both “Challenges” and “Change”, one subject provided the following example:
We have near-retirement counsel who dislikes change and innovation. Those senior
attorneys still influence firm management and can throw some weight to enact their
strategies, but they are removed enough from new procedures, new technologies, and the
expectations of our more junior attorneys and clients that their strategies may not fit well
with a changing environment. This is a dance of compromise, to communicate to these
attorneys how and why some things will change and also to integrate their good judgment
and insight as appropriate so that we don’t lose the benefit of their guidance and support
to firm initiatives.
Another generational situation that is a challenge was pointed out within this response:
There are a few people on the assistant level who are not as computer literate as is
probably needed. Training is offered over and over again to these individuals, but
unfortunately they just don’t get it, which can be a burden on those who work around
them who may need to review or redo work to make sure it is up to par.
One subject indicated that “generational intelligence far more important” than CQ within their
law firm.
Racial issues also came up as a challenge. A subject described his/her challenge”
Sometimes racial issues are a challenge for me because I am from an area that is very

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

92

white and this is the south. So, occasionally, people will refer to things that I don’t
immediately understand. For instance, once at lunch my coworkers were talking about
the sixth street church bombing and I didn’t know what they were talking about. I find it
is usually best to smile and nod and then google afterward.
Another related to gender differences and rare racial differences. As one subject stated, “Our
multicultural situations are limited to gender differences and rarely – very rarely – racial
differences. A greater measure of diversity is which of the two state law schools were attended
by my attorneys.”
In yet another example, one subject explained his/her experience with LGBTQ, stating, If
I were working on a research project that involved people that identify themselves as part
of the LGBTQ community, I believe that my knowledge about gender identity and
experience with people in that community would be helpful. For example, I know that
transgender is an adjective, not a noun, and I know that you should not refer to a person
as “transgendered.” I think I could use my knowledge to help ease relationships.
Another subject stated, “I worked hard to understand the culture of the firm and the people I
worked with. I have given up at my current job and am just looking for other employment.”
Importance and Value of Cultural Intelligence to Law Firms
Research Question 3 asks, “What viewpoints do the law firm librarians have about the
value and importance of cultural intelligence within their law firms?” Each of the following
items included responses which identified under the theme “Importance & Value” and
“Environment-Climate”. These items included responses to


Do you believe there is value of cultural intelligence to law firms? If so, what is that
value?



How important is cultural intelligence in your current role?



Share an experience when your cultural intelligence has been used and/or could be used
in your current role; and



Do you believe your cultural intelligence impacts your firm? If so, how?
Several subthemes appeared in the text passages: “Management”, “minimal importance”,

“no importance/not sure”, “Technology”, “Clients”, “Human Interaction”, and “Yes, there is

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

93

value of CQ to law firms”. Only four subthemes were coded and appeared within other themes:
“Communication”, “Diversity”, “Research requests”, and “Understanding different cultures”.
Importance & Value. Table 12 shows the subthemes and frequencies for each within
the theme of Importance & Value. Seventy-two text passages were coded to “Yes, there is value
of CQ to law firms”. Within these passages, there were several coded to other themes and
subthemes including “Clients”, “Human Interaction”, “Communication”, and “EnvironmentClimate”. One respondent commented, “Law firms should respond to their clients in a manner
consistent with the client’s cultural background. Furthermore, CQ helps members of a law firm
understand each other in a significant way, enabling greater communication, understanding, and
collective interrelations.” Another discussed experiences with clients, both at the office and
client locations, saying, all of these, “need to be effective and efficient and having an
understanding of working in new situations makes firms nimble and able to work on anything
anywhere without a great deal of new effort.” “Absolutely!” commented another subject, stating,
“Understanding how others might think or react differently based on their culture can help us to
better achieve our mutual goals.”

Several other subjects agreed when it comes to employees, saying, “I expect there is
value in that it can help a law firm recognize and understand the need to address new employees’
issues with adapting to the culture of a new and unfamiliar organization.” Another subject states,
“It will allow new employees to quickly learn how to become effective. It can allow attorneys to
understand how to communicate and work with clients. It can even help people in different
departments work together.”
Another subtheme, “Clients”, was used to describe passages which discussed the value to
clients and/or library staff, benefits to clients, or the importance to client needs and perspectives.
Several of these passages were coded to “Environment-Climate”, as discussed below, and related
to the library. Comments specific to “Clients” included, “There is always value in a business
setting in being able to work well with all potential clients.” Another respondent agreed, saying,
“It is extremely important as a librarian to understand the cultural heritage of the users.” Further,
another passage stated, “the more diverse experiences and awareness we bring, the more benefit
to our patrons.” CQ is viewed as a “critical component to being able to understand the client’s
needs as well as their perspective” states another subject. One passage illustrates an example
that relates to library value specifically, stating, “Knowledge of client matters and being able to
react quickly to or even anticipate industrial trends and legislation (for example) and alert
attorneys to these shifts can greatly enhance the library’s value.” Another respondent stated,
“there is value of cultural intelligence to law firms as every request from a client is a bit different

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

95

and will require someone to be capable of meeting their needs, even when they are unfamiliar
with the exact situation.”
Coded passages to “Clients” also included aspects related to the law firm clients. One
subject stated, “I think there is definitely value, especially when needed to … expand the firm’s
client base.” Further, another respondent stated, “The profession is changing, the needs and
demands of clients are changing, and we need to keep up and get ahead of these developments.”
One respondent offered, for example, “As in any profession that is people-focused, it is
imperative that the attorneys be able to communicate with their clients. It is also important for
litigators who have to select juries and interview witnesses.”
Twenty-one passages were coded to subtheme “Human Interaction”, with twelve coded
to “Technology”. One subject expressed, “Cultural intelligence is important for technology and
very important for human interaction.” Additionally, another subject explained the value within
his/her library staff, saying, “We thrive on bouncing ideas off each other – asking what you
would do with this project. The value of approaching problems from different angles is
invaluable to a research team.” From another subject, “people who think about issues from other
people’s perspectives are going to be better team members.” “Human Interaction” described in
this sense relates to teams and interactions with each other, similar to interpersonal relations. As
technology becomes more advanced, this is one area in which respondents saw CQ’s potential to
add value. “I think it could be used to educate our time keepers in advances in technology,”
suggests one subject.
Technology significantly changed the law firm practice. If a person does not have CQ as
defined above, she and/or he will not survive in a medium to large law firm. Clients expect the
attorneys and firms that represent them to be current in technology. Technology in law firms

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

96

changes almost as quickly as it does in other spheres, requiring users to constantly learn new
methods of carrying out their work. One passage focused on how technology has an impact on
the work environment: “technology in law firms changes almost as quickly as it does in other
spheres, requiring users to constantly learn new methods of carrying out their work.” Another
subject admitted that she and/or he will procrastinate as long as possible when it comes to
learning new technology. In addition, frustration, as discussed above, does exist among law
librarians when online databases change constantly. Two passages were coded to
“Management”, as subjects described being a manager and that CQ is very important. One
subject explained, “I’m a manager so I need to both work my staff effectively and
compassionately. But perhaps more importantly, I need to lead by example.”
Seventeen respondents where not sure if CQ was of any importance in law firms and
seven stated it was minimally important. One subject explained, “There isn’t much need for my
cultural intelligence–it doesn’t fit into the ‘making money’ part of our culture at large.” For one
subject, “It’s not really as important where we are as it might be in other locations. So it’s
something to be aware of, but the impact is not large.” One respondent stated, “Like many law
firm librarians, I spend much of my time conducting research and filling requests for
information,” therefore, “I would say that it is of somewhat limited importance.”
Environment-Climate. Sixty-nine passages were coded to “Environment-Climate”, in
that each passage related to some level of new environment, adapting to a new environment,
functioning effectively in an unfamiliar environment, improving firm reputation, and
understanding your work environment. There were no subthemes present for this theme. CQ
has an impact on a firm because it contributes to functionality, profitability and firm’s image to
recruit. Word of mouth can have an impact on the firm’s reputation and that of the library.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

97

From the library side, subjects expressed working within new “environments” and
changes within the law library landscape affect them:
As law librarians, we are frequently presented with new and unfamiliar “environments”
as regards unfamiliar subject areas, new and unfamiliar clientele, new and unfamiliar
processes and procedures. Absolutely – you have to have it to function in a law firm.
One respondent elaborated,
Everything every employee does or says can impact the firm’s image and the ability of
the firm to recruit and retain excellent employees. The law firm library world is also
much smaller than the law firm world at large. News of a poor work environment spreads
fast in the community.
Subjects expressed the value in helping staff at all levels adapt to new environments,
saying “there is value in enabling new staff to get up to speed reasonably quickly in a new
complex environment so that they can understand how the organization functions, unwritten
rules, taboos, best practices, how to get ahead, etc.” Additionally, as the legal environment
changed, several passages focused on the environment. One respondent said, “most lawyers are
going to operate in new and unfamiliar environments regularly” and that “lawyers often need
support in approaching new ideas and practice areas. They are notorious for resisting change and
fearing the unfamiliar.”
One specific example discussed the viewpoint of a law librarian from a firm that has a
global presence. This subject stated,
The firm at which I work has a global presence, and that means at any point an employee
could be working with attorneys, staff, or clients in new environments. If a firm decides
to open a law office halfway around the world, it would be beneficial for attorneys and
staff to be able to function effectively in the new environment. This will improve the
firm’s standing and reputation, and help the firm to keep up revenues.
Another respondent wrote,
Having the ability to function in an unfamiliar environment and/or with unfamiliar people
would allow job functions to be done better and more efficiently (the more instructions

required the longer a tasks takes the more time is spent doing things that potentially
cannot be billed).
Recurrent subthemes. Table 13 shows the five reoccurring subthemes present within
the six themes. “Diversity” was present within “Individual Drive”, and “Experience with CQ”,
and “Importance & Value”. “Understanding different cultures” was a separate theme, but also a
subtheme within “Knowledge”, “Action”, “Experience with CQ”, and “Importance & Value”.
“Change” and “Communication” were identified within two themes each. “Research Requests”
were present in “Importance & Value” and “Being Valued”, which were two themes that came
from data related to Research Question 3 and may lead to additional research.

Additional findings. A theme emerging from the data was grouped as Being Valued.
Although not specifically related to the research questions of this study, this theme was present
in the data and may have relevance for future research. Fifty-seven participants responded to Do
you feel you are valued by your firm? If so, please provide an example. As Table 14 shows, six
subthemes were identified within the data: “Examples of Being Valued”, “Great Performance
Reviews/Raises/Bonuses”, “I am Valued by my Firm”, “No I am not Valued in my Firm”,
“Sometimes-Not by all Members of Firm”, and “Research Requests”. Of these, three directly
related to the subjects view of whether they feel they are valued or not by their firm.

Forty-two passages expressed the subjects were valued in their law firms. Of these
passages, 41 were coded to examples of being valued. Several subjects explained the value they
receive at all levels within the law firm with staff and partners saying hello and acknowledging
them on their birthday. For example, one subject stated, “My diplomatic & professional
interactions and communications via email and in person are respected and noted.” Further,
multiple librarians noted the firms’ appreciation for librarians:
The firm communicates its appreciation of librarians value through appropriate salaries,
support for professional development, inclusion in strategic planning and budgeting (as
part of IS), specific recognition of individual librarians contributions to legal matters and
acknowledgment of the contributions to publications.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

100

Another subject, stated,
My insights are solicited by management and my recommendations incorporated into
actions and decisions taken. My achievements are recognized with praise and promotion.
My mistakes or errors are reviewed in context of my perceived capabilities. This
communicates to me the value the firm perceives in my work and contributions.
A few passages related to being valued “Sometimes-Not by all Members of Firm”. One
subject stated, “I am deeply valued by the attorneys I work with but am somewhat less valued by
firm non-attorney management.” Another says,
I am valued by the administrative team who appreciate my ability to manage the library
without much support from others. My boss often expresses his appreciation of my work,
but the attorneys here are very standoffish, and I could not give you an example of any
time I was made to feel appreciated by them other than a simple "Thank you" in an email
following a research report.
Another respondent felt his/her value was not reflected in his/her pay, even though she and/or he
was identified as the go-to person for several items within the firm. Eight passages were coded
to “No value”. “Value in law firms is often defined in bottom line dollars and most law firm
libraries are not seen as contributing to the bottom line,” one stated. Another individual said the
same thing, stating, “I am ignored, condescended to, reprimanded for things outside my control
and underpaid.” Another stated not feeling valued by their firm, but “there was a time when I
felt differently.”
“Great Performance Reviews/Raises/Bonuses” was coded to thirteen responses. “I
receive a lot of verbal affirmation, great performance evaluations and raises, and am included in
conversations and decisions regarding my department, for example in moving and downsizing
library space,” commented one respondent. Additional subjects wrote about salary and bonuses:
“the firm communicates its appreciation of librarians’ value through appropriate salaries,”
“good-sized bonuses,” “solid annual increases in salary,” and “our salary matches not only our

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

101

profession, but also is in step with other departments within the firm. (We all seem to be treated
equally well.)”
Performance reviews and annual reviews were also commented on in terms of value.
“We do annual reviews where she has clearly thoughtfully examined what I've accomplished,
etc. My compensation and benefits are competitive.” Another stated, “My achievements are
recognized with praise and promotion.” One passage, while related to positive performance
reviews, noted,
I have had many positive remarks on my performance reviews for those I have provided
reference services to. I believe there is room for my services to be valued more by those
who aren't as aware of what we as librarians can do for them.
“Research Requests” described the value librarians bring to the firm. Key remarks from one
subject were:
My research work has been commended as being key to winning cases and convincing
clients to hire our firm as counsel. I have discovered crucial information that colleagues
at the firms on the other side of the case were unable to find. My writing skills are such
that the attorneys frequently comment that they never have to edit my research memos they just send them on to the client directly.
Another stated, “I am often consulted on international matters, especially given my knowledge of
other languages. Recently, had to research Haitian court structure before translating an official
report for a Haitian refugee family in a pro bono case.” Further, “Attorneys will refer other
attorneys to me for research and competitive intelligence purposes.”
Other. Passages were coded to this category when they either did not fit in with the
other themes, were not applicable to the audience this survey applies to, or were topics that may
be utilized for further research. As an example, when discussing the value within their firm, one
subject commented, “Not in a law firm (anymore, thank God). When I was, no, but I was a
junior- and mid-level associate, who by definition is not valued.” This may be of interest for

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

102

future research on attorneys and their value within law firms. Additionally, academic law
librarians who responded to this survey even provided the current requirements for working in a
law firm within the United States. One subject said she and/or he was valued in terms of his/her
teaching; “I teach classes, and students seek me out.” Academic law librarians, though not the
audience, may be another group worthy of further research in terms of value.
Additional passages indicated respondents were not sure or did not understand the
question presented, and, therefore, did not respond. Two subjects inquired about what “crosscultural situation” specifically meant before responding to the question while another passage
questioned why this specific question was asked (Do you utilize drive and motivation to work
through challenges that come with cross-cultural situations you encounter?). One subject said,
“I’m not sure how to answer this. Does ‘cross-cultural’ in this context refer to institutional
culture? No matter, I can say that I ‘utilize drive and motivation’ very little in my day-to-day
work.” A common question Cultural Intelligence Certified facilitators do receive when
discussing CQ is about what “cross-cultural situation” means because, generally, in the
beginning, facilitators want the audience to begin thinking about the concept and what they
believe terms to mean before learning the framework behind the concept. It would be interesting
for future research to analyze and discuss cross-cultural situations.
Another theme that was present but not related to this study was political consideration
related to office politics. While this does relate to the “environment-climate” theme, the focus
was on the political focus within an office. One passage noted, “On a related note, there are a
lot of political considerations to any potential course of action and navigating office politics
would be a great area for training.” This topic may be of interest for future research related to
the specific politics within a law firm environment and the impact it has on staff at all levels.

Level of Cultural Intelligence as Measured by the CQS
Research Question 2 asks, “What variations among participating law firm librarians, if
any, exist among the four capabilities of cultural intelligence?” The CQS consists of twenty
items with an overall score and four sub dimension (factors) sections (motivational, cognitive,
metacognitive, and behavioral). The higher the sub dimension score or overall score, the higher
level of CQ one has. Tables 15 to 22 show the descriptive statistics on each of the items within
the four factors of CQ (motivational, cognitive, metacognitive, and behavioral) and the level of
agreement for each of the statements within the four factors.
Motivational (Drive) CQ scores. Motivational CQ means how to use knowledge of
another’s culture and acknowledge cultural differences. Between 19 and 25 subjects responded
to the five items used to determine the motivational CQ score. Minimum values were within one
to two points with all maximum values the same. The means were within the 23 to 24 range.
The fourth item had the highest standard deviation while the first item had the lowest below 1.0.

As the item analysis indicates, of the five items used to determine motivational CQ,
“Agree” had the highest scores for three items. All questions received between 73% and 94%
response of “Somewhat Agree,” “Agree,” or “Strongly Agree” with item one having the total
highest agreement. This factor had higher levels of total agreement than cognitive. Two
statements received response of “Strongly Disagree.” Item 3, “I am sure I can deal with the

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

stresses of adjusting to a culture that is new to me,” received the highest response rate where
respondents were not sure if they agreed.

Cognitive (Knowledge) CQ scores. Cognitive CQ means how one relates and operates
within a new culture. Twenty-nine to 30 subjects responded to the six items used to determine
the cognitive CQ score. Minimum values were within one point, except for the third item, and
all maximum values were the same. There was more variance among these items with standard
deviations all above 1.27.

Metacognitive (Strategy) CQ scores. Thirty-two subjects provided responses to the
four items used to determine metacognitive CQ. Metacognition CQ means the extent to which
one is aware of what is occurring in a cross-cultural situation and the ability to use the awareness
to manage it successfully (Livermore 2010, 2011). There was only a small amount of variation
in the minimum value ratings for each of the four items. The mean was also fairly consistent
among each of the items. MC2 was the only item below 1.0 standard deviation.

knowledge as I interact with people from different cultures”. This item also had the highest
percentage of respondents indicating they were not sure. No subjects selected “Strongly
Disagree” for any of the items. Only 3% to 9% responded “Somewhat Disagree” or “Disagree”
to all items within the metacognitive sub dimension.

Behavioral (Action) CQ scores. Thirty subjects provided responses to the five items
used to determine behavioral CQ. Behavioral CQ is the action factor -- how one adapts through
utilizing verbal, nonverbal, and speech acts in approaching cultural situations. There was only a
small amount of variation in the minimum value ratings for each of the four items. The
maximum value was the same for all items. The fifth item had the highest deviation.

Summary
An initial 170 individuals responded to the request, and 70 provided survey responses.
Not all subjects responded to all items on the survey. This chapter examined the outcomes of the
methods employed to study the CQ of law firm librarians in the United States. Both the
qualitative and quantitative results were presented in order to explain the results of the study.
Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were used to analyze the CQS data, while
coding and themes were utilized to analyze the qualitative open-ended data.
The key findings from Research Question 1 indicate there were seven overall themes
from the qualitative results fit into response of this question: “Drive”, “Knowledge”, “Strategy”,
“Action”, “Understanding Different Cultures”, “Experience with CQ term”, and “Challenges”.
Of all themes, “Environment-Climate” was the highest, with 69 passages coded to this, and
respondents showed the importance of CQ within their environment. Respondents related
understanding of CQ to understanding of different cultures; however, there were several
passages that indicated subjects had no experience with the term or had never heard of it. There
was an overwhelming 72 passages that expressed their firm values CQ.
The key findings from Research Question 2 reveal variations about participating law firm
librarians among the four capabilities. The CQS indicated areas where subjects responded in
stronger agreement for differing items within each sub dimension. Additionally, metacognitive
had higher responses than the other three factors.
The research supports that law firm librarians have a strong sense of the value and
importance of CQ to their law firms, which is a key conclusion for Research Question 3. The
data suggested law firm librarian participants viewed “Clients”, “Human Interaction”,
“Communication”, and “Environment-Climate” as key elements when it comes to discussing

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

111

value. Additionally, the research results showed that the work that a librarian does (handling
“Research Requests”) is valued, and the majority of respondents feel they are valued by the
appreciation received and their salaries. Chapter 5 states the conclusions and examines
interpretations of the key findings, implications for practice, and recommendations for further
research.

Chapter 5: A Study of Cultural Intelligence
Research on CQ in law firm libraries does not exist, which is unsettling as law librarians
work within a very diverse environment and serve clientele from all cultural backgrounds.
Studies discussed cultural competency or diversity within the field of librarianship as a whole,
but there is nothing specific to the specialty of law libraries. The purpose of this mixed-methods
study was to explore the CQ of law firm librarians within the United States. A single-phase
concurrent strategy including both qualitative and quantitative items was used in order to
examine this phenomenon: to identify whether law firm librarians are culturally intelligent and
how they view their CQ as affecting their firm. Three research questions guided this study:
1.

What is the overall level of cultural intelligence of participating law firm
librarians?

2.

What variations among participating law firm librarians, if any, exist among the
four capabilities of cultural intelligence?

3.

What viewpoints do the law firm librarians have about the value and importance
of cultural intelligence within their law firms?

It is critical to understand the significance of CQ to law firm librarians as they are in a
distinctive position due to the various audiences they serve. For example, law firm librarians
help all stakeholders, from attorneys to secretaries to partners to paralegals, and outside
stakeholders including clients and vendors. The librarians have unique internal knowledge of the
law firm, including the culture, practices and procedures. They can use their knowledge of the
firm and resources available to help an attorney become more knowledgeable about his/her own
clients. Law firm librarians often help in an effort to provide information from many resources
in the most cost efficient manner. Librarians are the key to information and are uniquely

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

113

qualified to sort through, curate and manage content. Librarians also maintain collections,
negotiate vendor contracts, manage the library and wear a multitude of other ‘hats’.
The support of internal stakeholders benefits the external clients the firm serves and has a
direct impact on the success and profits of the firm. For example, a librarian may contribute to
initiatives to gain new clients by investigating, gathering, organizing and presenting information
that is shared with internal constituents internationally. Understanding the CQ of law firm
librarians provides more than just an international or global perspective. Law firm librarians
often may support more than one geographic office and must be able to adapt to new settings,
especially with the many changes occurring within the information profession and legal
segments. The law firm librarian engages with staff members at all levels to ensure they get the
information that they need. A law firm librarian may interact with the human resources staff
when hiring or firing information professionals, work with the information technology
department to install and oversee the new online legal research platform, or may need to lead
staff in professional development training. CQ is of significance to law firm librarians and
libraries as they work with varying and diverse cultures.
Conceptual and Theoretical Foundation
This study was based on the underlying foundation of CQ, which is defined as “a
person’s capability for successful adaptation to new cultural settings, that is, for unfamiliar
settings attributable to cultural context” (Earley & Ang, 2003, p. 9). CQ, as defined by Earley
and Ang, builds on Sternberg’s framework discussing multiple loci of intelligence (Stenberg &
Grigorenko, 2006). They examined what significance, if any, culture has on intelligence. To
date there has not been any empirical studies to examine the phenomena of CQ in law firm

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

114

libraries or law librarians. The present study fills a significant gap within the existing literature
and sheds some light into this specific area.
The law library within a firm is often one of the first departments to be cut from the
shown their value to the firm, or the firm is not aware of their value. The library is often seen as
strict overhead because of the costs of print materials and online legal research platforms, and
not as an integral part of the law firm business even though the law library provides critical
support functions that affect the firm’s profits. The cost of ignorance or arrogance with law firm
associates and partners in not using the librarian has true implications on time and money
(University of Michigan, 2011).
With law firm librarians’ experience, both degreed and on-the-job, librarians are the
experts in saving an attorney time and money when it comes to locating and obtaining
information. It takes a trained librarian to help one navigate and obtain authoritative, legitimate
information. The law firms C-levels, top executives (i.e., Chief Operating Officer, Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Diversity Officer, etc.), and attorneys need to better understand the role
of the librarian and leverage the skills that a firm librarian can provide. The role of the librarian
can affect all within the firm, and that is one reason CQ is critical. Through understanding
elements and expectations of the firm’s culture, librarians help support the importance of CQ for
succeeding in the global work environment.
Law firms may view data from this study as an important indicator for selecting law firm
librarians. The data may lead to the development of training programs for law librarians which
may include how to enhance a law librarian’s leadership role within the firm. As Ang et al.
(2007) point out, CQ is important for “selecting, training, and developing a culturally intelligent
workforce” (p. 365). Law firm librarians also have not been viewed as equivalent to other

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

115

director and administrative levels within the law firm. CQ can help organizations successfully
manage their own cultural diversity (Earley et al., 2006). Since firm librarians continually have
to adapt to differing situations, depending on whom they are serving within the law firm, it
makes sense to ensure they utilize their CQ and evaluate the impact it has on firm attorneys and
others they support.
Methods and Findings
A mixed-methods design with a concurrent strategy was used to examine CQ within law
firm librarians in the United States. In a single phase, both qualitative and quantitative data was
collected via a web-based survey. The CQS was not used to measure an individual’s CQ level,
rather it was used to measure the level of agreement of each item within each of the four factors.
The CQS includes four-factors (motivational, cognitive, metacognitive, and behavioral) and was
developed to test each of these factors and overall level of CQ (Van Dyne et al., 2008).
A sample of 70 individuals participated in the survey. The sample was based on a selfselection process and subjects were required to be law firm librarians within the United States
working in a law firm library. Two primary professional associations (PLL-SIS and SLA Legal
Division) were used as the sampling frame. The data were collected using the web-based survey
between February and March 2015.
The majority of respondents were female, and three-quarters had a master’s degree and
more than 20 years of experience. Job titles varied among responses, indicating the diversity of
job titles within the profession among law firm librarians. Responses were received from across
the United States, and the majority of respondents worked at their firms’ headquarters. The vast
majority of respondents (90%) were born in the United States and most spoke and/or wrote a
minimum of one language. In addition, 57% had neither lived nor worked overseas.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

116

The data analysis generated eleven themes, with the first four relating specifically to the
four factors of CQ. The eleven themes were (a) Individual Drive, (b) Individual Knowledge, (c)
Individual Strategy, (d) Individual Action, (e) Understanding Different Cultures, (f) Experience
with CQ Term, (g) Challenges, (h) Importance & Value, (i) Environment-Climate, (j) Being
Valued, and (k) Other. The findings clarify the overall level of CQ of participating law
librarians; variations that may exist, and law firm librarians’ perspectives on its importance.
Overall level of CQ. The overall level of CQ of participating law firm librarians was
varied. Four of the seven themes (Drive, Knowledge, Strategy, and Action) tie directly to the
four factors of CQ (motivation, cognitive, metacognitive, and behavioral). The findings indicate
that each of these four is utilized within law firms and drive had the highest frequency. Drive is
defined as the extent which one is energized and persistent in approaching multicultural
situations. Both intrinsic and extrinsic interest was expressed as being used within firms. Law
firm librarians also reported utilizing self-efficacy in order to be effective in cultural situations.
Numerous subjects reported utilizing aspects of cultural knowledge within their firms; however,
several indicated they do desire additional training on this subject, but it would be a great
challenge to teach in an educational setting or present to their firm. The vast majority of
respondents provided examples in which they utilized cultural similarities and differences to
understand specific contexts and situations.
Participants expressed the use of strategy, defined as the extent to which one is aware of
the multicultural situation and the ability to use that awareness to manage the situation, and
offered examples of how they utilize strategy within a CQ knowledge context. Few indicated
frustration in managing cultural situations effectively; however, there were concerns with
management and vendor relationships. A few participants expressed they strategize before a

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

117

cultural encounter, described as planning, when dealing with culturally diverse groups,
particularly practice areas, and when involved with library changes in resources or space.
Subjects also reported being aware of their own cultural knowledge, which has an impact on how
they interact and react to cultural situations.
Findings do indicate that changes within the law firm environment and law firm library
affected the law firm librarian. Law firm librarians continually modify expectations to
understand different cultures. Changes with vendor resources, the information profession
transitioning from library to resource center, and technology all were expressed by subjects as
situations in which adapting to change was critical. Communication was also a key theme that
came out of the results in that law firm librarians commented on utilizing both verbal and
nonverbal communication styles, modifying them, and changing their attitudes as needed
depending on the cultural situation and the audience they served.
The findings indicate variations amongst the level of experience with CQ. A significant
number had never heard of the term within the context presented, while other subjects had heard
of the term in academia, teaching, or onboarding, but within a different context. A majority of
respondents shared examples of utilizing CQ within their roles, whether they knew it or not, as
defined within this study. Subjects also expressed facing challenges when it came to differing
generations, races, and genders within the law firm. This aspect caused law firm librarians’
frustration.
Variations among four factors of CQ. The findings indicate that variations do exist
among the item analysis for each of the four factors (motivation, cognitive, metacognitive, and
behavioral). The values, mean and standard deviations varied within each of the factor items on
the CQS items. The respondents did not respond the same for each CQ item. The minimum

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

118

values consisted of small amounts of variation. Regarding the standard deviation, the larger the
standard deviation, the further away the value was from the mean. Within the item analysis, the
subject’s level of agreement to each item also varied. Most respondents agreed at some level
more than they disagreed when it came to each item statement per factor. This shows that, while
respondents have some level of agreement, there is still variation as to their level of agreement
within each CQ factor.
Qualitative findings revealed that the majority of law firm librarian participants use their
drive more than they use the other factors. Drive is equivalent to motivational, knowledge
equivalent to cognitive, strategy equivalent to metacognitive, and action equivalent to behavioral
on the CQS. Both intrinsic and extrinsic interest and self-efficacy were used; however, this
varied as some subjects described their work environments as not cultural and, therefore, they
may or may not use drive. Some librarians had sufficient understanding of cultures within their
firms while others desired training. Some subjects expressed a level of frustration when dealing
with firm administration and vendors; however, examples were provided that illustrated the use
of strategy when dealing with cultural situations. The results, as described in this finding, are
consistent with Earley and Ang’s (2003) definition of CQ in that a person has to adjust his or her
behaviors to adapt to differing cultural situations. Subjects associated action with change,
communication and understanding different cultures. The respondents also felt that the changing
legal and information environment and technology played a key role in their application of
strategy.
Views on value and importance of CQ. The findings show the majority of law firm
librarian participants believe there is value and importance in CQ within their firm and current
role. Law firm librarians recognized the value to clients and library staff, including the benefits

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

119

to their clients and the importance of client perspectives. According to Brown, a partner at a law
firm, “cultural competency adds value to our clients and ultimately to the firm because you need
to be able to relate to the client” (as cited in Frink-Hamlett, 2011, S6).
The findings indicate that subjects view CQ as an important factor when it comes to
technology and human interaction. A few respondents were not sure if their firms placed
importance or even minimal importance on it, as the law firm library is not viewed as the money
maker for the firm, but, rather, as overhead. Another key finding was that environment plays a
critical role in the subject’s determination of the importance and value of CQ. Subjects
expressed that changes in the environment influence them, and this impacts their value. Subjects
have to adapt to new environments in order to understand best practices and how the firm
functions. Several participants reported feeling valued at varying levels within their firm and
that, sometimes, they are not valued equally by all firm members. Raises, good performance
reviews, verbal affirmation, and bonuses all were expressed as important ways in which law firm
librarian participants felt valued. Particularly, with research requests, subjects felt they bring
value to the firm because of their expertise in information research, analysis, and dissemination.
Conclusions and Implications
Based on a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative findings for this study on CQ in
law firm libraries, four conclusions were drawn. First, law firm librarians have a strong sense of
the value and importance of CQ to their law firms. Second, law firm librarians have varying
levels of CQ within each of the four CQ factors. The third conclusion focuses on the librarian’s
sense of being valued and appreciated within their law firm. Last, law firm librarians have to
cope with numerous cultural challenges and be proactive in adapting to unfamiliar environments.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

Conclusion 1. Librarians have a strong sense of the value and importance of CQ to their
law firms. The data reveals that the majority of respondents believe there is value in CQ to a law
firm’s practices. Subjects felt that CQ could help law firm members when working with clients
of different backgrounds and that understanding others could help librarians achieve their goals.
Plum et al. (2008) state the purpose of using CQ is to act appropriately in cultural encounters
with the goal to bridge the gap between cultures.
When it comes to staff, subjects also expressed how law firms could use CQ in
introducing new staff from different cultures to the organization. Individuals have CQ, and their
views must be experienced not predicted (Plum et al., 2008). All employees would be able to
adapt better if staff know how to communicate with individuals from within different
departments. This ties into several guiding principles as recommended by Lindsey et al. (1999,
2003). Their guiding principles suggest that culture is always present and that we need to be
aware of the diversity and differences within cultures. Furthermore, culturally competent
individuals have five essential elements of cultural competence:
1. Individuals need to evaluate their own culture and how it may influence others.
2. Culturally capable individuals appreciate diverse individuals.
3. Alternative dispute resolution skills are learned in order to work with differing issues.
4. Learning is an important aspect and culturally intelligent individuals want to enhance
their cultural skills and adapt as needed.
5. Individuals incorporate cultural understating into their daily lives to have improved
cultural interactions.
Law firm librarians expressed the value in working with prospective clients and the
benefits that can be drawn from utilizing CQ with these clients as law firm staff understand their

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

121

needs. Patrons can also benefit, as law firm librarians are aware of differences and can better
communicate with them. Kienzle and Husar (2007) express the value of cultural awareness in
that an organization can avoid offending individuals, improve communication, and improve the
quality of relationships. “Cultural intelligence is the answer to becoming culturally aware” (p.
85). Griffer and Perlis (2007) believe that developing understanding of CQ starts within one’s
self and awareness of others. Industry knowledge and knowledge of client matters can help
enhance the view of the library. Both human interaction and technology were also findings that
support this conclusion. As law firm librarians share ideas with each other, the value is seen in
problem solving and team projects through the use of communication. Technology affected the
information profession and the business of law. Thus, law firm librarians see value in users’
continually learning new ways to complete their tasks in their firms even as technology
advances.
Implications. The findings contribute to the literature on CQ by providing evidence from
these librarians of their sense of the value and importance of CQ concepts, areas law firm
librarians strongly saw as important, and those where there are challenges. Ang et al., (2004)
examined the construct within international executives and foreign professionals when it came to
their performance and adjustment. Templer et al. (2006) found that CQ, specifically
motivational, predicts adjustment of foreigners. While there have been many studies of
expatriates and overseas assignments (Brislin, 1981; Caligiuri, 2000; Ones & Viswesvaran,
1997; Shaffer & Miller, 2008), none of them focus on law firm librarians. This provides a
starting empirical framework for law firms’ further use of the law firm librarian. This
contributes to the field, as it has deepened the understanding of CQ to law librarians in law firms.
Law firm administrators and human resources departments can incorporate CQ training into

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

122

onboarding and continuing education. The factors are malleable, and an individual may increase
his/her level through experience and practice (Ang et al., 2007; Brislin et al. (2006). Also, law
firm librarians and law library associations can offer ongoing professional development around
CQ. Law firm human resource departments and diversity committees can work with the law
firm library to provide these trainings and integrate the importance within the firm. Additionally,
law firms can take this information to help them hire and support their law library staff.
The literature reviewed for this dissertation focused on the construct of CQ and law firm
libraries. There are several studies which focus on culture and diversity that include crosscultural leadership and training (Black & Mendenall, 1990; Erez & Earley, 1993; Hofstede,
1991; Triandis, 1994). The term “cultural intelligence” was officially defined in 2003 by Earley
and Ang and expands on the research of Sternberg’s theory of intelligences (Sternberg &
Grigorenko, 2006). CQ has been studied in other fields, specifically in areas looking at
foreigners, expatriates, psychology, and leadership. Within the legal sector, however, there has
been limited application of CQ. Stevens (2009), Peckman (2011), and Caputo and Rasmus
(2011) have each examined the construct as it may relate to the justice system, international
transactions or attorneys. Both Ward and Miller (2010) and Frink-Hamlett (2011) report on the
role CQ plays within law schools but not law school libraries. There is no discussion of law firm
libraries and CQ within the current literature.
CQ involves a person’s ability to obtain, interpret and act based on different cues when
working in a cultural situation (Earley & Mosakowski, 2004). It involves cultural strategic
thinking and explains unpredictability in managing diversity (Ang & Inkpen, 2008; Earley et al,
2006). The Cultural Intelligence Center (2014), as well as CQ certified facilitators, can offer the
CQS to measure each of the four factors. Including an assessment such as the CQS online can

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

123

better inform law firms and law libraries as to current levels of cultural competence and help
align goals to both strategic and future plans.
Conclusion 2. Librarians have varying levels of CQ within each of the four CQ factors
(motivational, cognitive, metacognitive, and behavioral). Variations were seen within the CQS
responses for each item within each factor and within four qualitative items, each specific to a
factor of CQ. Earley and Ang (2003) express that an individual who displays CQ has all factors
working together.
Motivational consisted of the most disbursement among the standard deviation. “Agree”
had the highest scores for three items. This is like-minded with what Earley and Ang (2003)
state, as an individual must feel motivated to engage with others in a new cultural setting. This
also is the first factor when considering the CQ model. The second factor, cognitive, was
measured through six items for which values ranged from 34 to 40 with all maximum values at
40 and means from 37.03 to 38.1. “Somewhat Agree” was still the largest response for all items.
The knowledge (cognitive) qualitative findings supporting this conclusion showing that subjects
do believe they understand different cultures; however, a significant number of passages
mentioned a desire for training (whether more or currently have none at the firm). Macro
understanding of cultural similarities and differences such as economic and legal systems,
values, norms, rules of languages, and non-verbal behaviors was seen in the qualitative findings.
The findings show there were variations on subjects’ responses to strategy
(metacognition). Findings within metacognitive CQ indicate the subject’s total agreement was
highest for “I adjust my cultural knowledge as I interact with people from a culture that is
unfamiliar to me”. There were concerns and frustration with management and vendors within a
dozen passages. However, real life examples illustrated the use of strategy within the firms,

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

124

including awareness, planning and checking for cultural interactions. Cultural metacognition
allows individuals to adapt, select and shape the cultural interactions within their environment
(Thomas et al., 2008). Triandis (2006) suggests CQ involves suspending judgement, integrating
and understanding knowledge gained from a cultural situation.
Behavioral CQ, the fourth factor, was measured through five items with minimum values
from 19-21 and maximum all at 25. Subjects identified the most with “Agree” for only one item;
“I change my verbal behavior when a cross-cultural interaction requires it”. Within the
qualitative findings, subjects expressed understanding different cultures; however, change and
communication were largely apparent when it came to taking action. Some felt they have to
modify their communication or adjust their attitudes to fit the multicultural context. Other
passages indicated that adapting to change or unfamiliar environments was critical to the
workplace.
Implications. The research on culture and diversity is large in terms of scholarship, but
limited regarding law librarianship. Nonetheless, there have been several dialogues on diversity
and culture within librarianship (Greer et al., 2001; Howland, 2001; Kreitz, 2008; Overall, 2009;
Smith, 2008). Greer et al. (2001) focus on gender roles and recommend that organizations
institute “effective and ongoing training” (p. 137). This is of specific importance as the
information profession is highly dominated by females (American Association of Law Libraries,
2013) and this is one aspect subjects commented on as a challenge. Overall (2009) focuses on
how cultural competence can be integrated into the information profession. Smith (2008) agrees
with suggestions that the library itself become more diverse. It is with this cultural competence
that one may “effectively reach those who would benefit the most from library services”
(Overall, 2009, p. 200).

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

125

Law firm human resource departments and diversity committees can work with the law
firm library to provide training. Ramirez (2010) presents a model for how CQ levels may affect
conflict resolution ability. Since human resources not only handle onboarding, but disputes
within the law firm among staff, this may be something they can put into practice. She suggests
that a higher level of CQ affects and predicts whether an individual will choose an appropriate
conflict resolution strategy based on the cultural backgrounds involved (p. 43). Based on the
findings, there are varying levels within each of the four factors, so case studies, simulations, and
exposure to other cultures may help (Alon & Higgins, 2005; Earley, 1987; Earley &
Mosakowski, 2004; Harrison, 1992; Tung, 1981).
Budrina (2011) suggests it is important for companies to develop the CQ of their
employees as culture and cultural difference have a greater influence on business effectiveness
than we think. Participants should be immersed in the trainings year-round and continually.
New staff and attorneys should also be integrated as part of the onboarding process. Deal and
Prince (2003) focus on how to culturally adapt and educate individuals on different cultures
when it comes to leadership development. Focused training with a facilitator providing a CQ
assessment for self, multi-rater and/or group is suggested. This will allow individuals to
understand their levels more in-depth and each of the four factors. Earley et al. (2006) also
suggest the following ways to work more effectively in culturally diverse workplaces: (a)
develop cultural strategic thinking, (b) enhance your motivational CQ, and (c) broaden your
behaviors by enhancing behavioral CQ.
Conclusion 3. Law firm librarians are valued and appreciated within their firms. While
the theme of value was prevalent within the qualitative data, it was not anticipated as an initial
study question. However, it is an important conclusion that was determined because of the

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

126

overwhelming responses and reference to the librarian’s role as valued and appreciated within
firms. An overwhelming number of respondents expressed they are valued within their law firm,
and many presented examples of being valued.
Law firm librarian subjects voiced that good performance reviews, raises and bonuses
equated to their feeling valued in their law firm. Subjects stated they were acknowledged and
respected by their firm for their input on matters. Subjects also showed that, through the work
they do, including handling research requests, they were appreciated by their law firm. Key
findings included that attorneys would consult with law firm librarians on research matters, and
come back or refer another attorney to them for the good job they did. Some subjects, however,
did show they are sometimes valued, but not equally by all members of their firm.
Implications. There has often been discussion about the value of the librarian, and the
findings within this study can add value to those discussions. Cunningham (2013) shares that
law firms should take advantage of the competence of their staff in order to realize benefits in
productivity. “Law firms that can deliver value through competitive advantage are the law firms
of the future – and leveraging library services is integral to that value” (Terjesen, 2014, para. 1).
Gohlke (1997) says that, “librarians…are finding themselves in the position where they must
build a solid and effective case on how their library adds significant value to the organization or
institution that pays the bills” (p. 22).
This conclusion is critical for the law library profession and that of the legal industry.
Awareness and promotion of the value that law firm librarians provide needs to be made known
by those who can influence decision-making within a law firm. Library staff should be
communicating the value of the library to clientele at all times and expressing the value of the
service in time and money (Holt, 2007). A librarian’s ability to quantify the value of the library

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

127

to management will be the key to controlling the future of the law firm library (Todd, 2006).
Human resource departments and attorneys need to understand the value that the librarians bring
to the table and support them. Law librarians can also use results such as this for getting jobs,
and even justifying promotion within their firms. A law librarian may become a more integral
part of meetings, strategic planning, the decision-making process, and viewed at a leadership
level equivalent to other executives. “The possession of cultural intelligence by a firm’s
managers is a valuable resource, especially when the CQ resides in its upper echelons or top
management team” (Ang & Inkpen, 2008, p. 343).
Conclusion 4. Law firm librarians deal with cultural changes and adapt to unfamiliar
environments. The qualitative findings about the environment-climate and changes within the
legal profession, information profession, and technology support this conclusion. Items within
the CQS also show agreement levels regarding cultural knowledge related to the environment.
A majority of passages within the qualitative findings were tied to the theme of
environment regarding the new environment, adapting to a new environment, functioning
effectively within unfamiliar environments, and understanding the work environment. From
2004 to 2008, Citi Private Bank & Hildebrandt Consulting LLC (2013) reported law firms
experienced the following lessons: (a) firms need to earn demand growth, (b) excess capacity
squeezes margins, (c) double-digit profit increases no longer exist, and (d) volatility is a
constant. Law firms now face reduced budgets, layoffs, and pressures from clients. According
to the Canadian Bar Association (2013), the law firm business model is changing as clients are
frustrated with the rising cost of legal services and the decreased demand of legal services for
particular practice areas. The findings support the fact that law firm librarians are dealing with
new environments within the rapidly changing landscape of law firms. Large law firms are

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

128

overstaffed and the legal spend has not bounced back from the recession (Altman Weil, Inc.,
2014). The reputation of a firm is important and word spreads fast amongst the law library
community when a law firm has a bad image or reputation. Subjects also expressed their
abilities to help staff to transition and adapt to new environments as practices change, mergers,
and staff shifts in roles.
Technology was also a frequent theme when discussing the environment. Subjects not
only expressed the challenges with new technology, but also the ability to adapt to changes with
new technology. This is important as legal vendors continually update and modify their software
and online legal resources. Law firm librarians need to understand these changes and be
prepared to share and teach their end users about the updated technologies. Subjects expressed
how comfortable, with a few exceptions, they are when adapting and working with unfamiliar
environments. The work law firm librarians conduct daily, particularly research, was also an
area in which law firm librarians need to adapt and modify their skills in order to answer
questions successfully.
Within the CQS, several items relate to this particular conclusion, and the findings
support it. For example, 91% selected somewhat agree or higher when it comes to discussing
adjusting cultural knowledge as one interacts with people from a culture unfamiliar to them.
Additionally, 85% are in total agreement with being conscious of the cultural knowledge that is
used when interacting with other individuals. Finally, within motivation, 77% of subjects at least
somewhat agreed when it came to dealing with the stresses of adjusting to a culture that is new,
and a smaller percentage agreed they enjoy living in unfamiliar cultures.
Implications. These findings contribute to the literature on CQ by examining the law
firm librarians’ responses of dealing with change and unfamiliar environments. This study

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

129

supports literature on the changes within the law firm environment and information profession as
it relates to law firm libraries, including changes in billing practices, business models, library
staffing, budgets, and resources. Callinan (1995) points out that the headquarters offices are
being relied upon by branches for library services, and this requires the librarian to have access
to international resources, but also be aware of time and distance. Smith and Marrow (2008)
suggest challenges of the law firm environment today require skills in managing talent, setting
strategic direction, and developing growth. They also found that managing partners of law firms
believe that adaptability, relationships, change leadership and decision-making are required when
leading a law firm. Goleman’s research on emotional intelligence aligns with this premise and
includes aspects of self-awareness, self-management, awareness and relationship management
(1998).
Scholars agree on the changes within the information profession and law firm
environment. From bottom line to profits per partner and business models, law firms have
become more conscious of their own business dynamics. Law libraries are not exempt from
feeling the changes within firms. Todd (2006) explains that the client “does not always
understand…what is required to provide quality service, which is the root of law firm librarians”
(p. 12). Further, she stresses the importance of having a voice within the profession. This study
provides a benchmark for examining CQ in law firm libraries, and law firms should use CQ to
help with industry changes.
These findings can also support law firm staff and law firm human resources departments
be proactive and prepare employees for upcoming shifts within the firm. As an example, if the
library director knows that a resource is going to be cancelled or eliminated, she or he needs to
prepare users for this change and have other possible resources available to fill that gap.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

130

Similarly, if the firm’s leaders know there is a need to reduce their footprint, the law librarian
should be included in the space planning changes. Libraries are no longer the large, spacious,
glamorous collections with huge staff departments as they once were (Andrea, 2014; Gentilozzi,
2013; Rieger, 2011). Instead more law firm libraries are now being outsourced, certain functions
outsourced, or transitioned to virtual (Ahearn et al., 1997; Ebbinghouse, 2002; Estes, 2008; Roy
& Basak, 2011).
Study Limitations and Internal Study Validity
The study was voluntary and based on self-selection of those who chose to participate.
Thus, whether the sample is representative of the target population was not known.
Consideration of librarians outside the United States could also provide a different set of
responses. Research could reveal differences as well among law firm library directors and law
firm library staff, and/or differences among the law firm library and other law firm stakeholders.
Participants may have self-selected because of personal interest, a belief that they would
benefit from participating or because of the cultural interactions they are involved with in their
law firm. Babbie (1990) states, “survey research almost always represents an intrusion into
people’s lives….the survey often asks the respondent to reveal personal information—attitudes
and personal characteristics—that might be unknown to others” (p. 339). Those who chose not
to participate may have had different responses than those who participated and could have
changed the survey results. This study provides a starting place for future research, as the results
were limited to law firm librarians within the United States. Finally, though some findings
discussed law firm aspects, the study did not measure CQ of law firms, but focused on the
librarians within these firms.

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

131

The CQS has been considered a valid and reliable measure of CQ (Van Dyne et al.,
2008). However, within this study, several subjects commented they felt the items were not
clear, almost too easy or duh type of statements, or that they did not understand the context in
which the questions were asked. This is likely due to the fact that the CQS utilized is only
granted to researchers for academic purposes and an abbreviated dummied-down version of the
online CQS self-report. It has often been found that it undermines the credibility of the full
online CQ assessment available for purchase, and is therefore not used except for research
purposes. The CQS that was utilized was not as valid as I had expected and led to weakness and
limitation of my study. This may be one reason for the low response rate of the CQS items or
the lack thereof responses.
To ensure internal validity of the study, the researcher employed the following strategies.
In order to check for accuracy of the findings and ensure reliable coding, the researcher had a
second researcher examine the coded qualitative data three times and the quantitative data twice.
The researcher clarified the biases brought to the study from the beginning, including discussion
of her role as a law firm librarian and a CQ certified facilitator. While the researcher is aware of
the world-wide norms of CQ, this is proprietary to CQC and not included within the research.
The researcher made every effort to remain objective during the process.
The web-based survey captured all the data in one place to minimize the validity threat of
moving from one data collection to the other. Once the results were received and analyzed, the
research triangulated the different data types to compare the merged quantitative with the
qualitative themes. The researcher addressed each of the items on the survey to ensure
interpretation and discussion of each item. Last, the researcher did not generalize beyond the

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

132

specified group within the study, as this would lead to inaccurate inferences beyond the
participant data.
Recommendations for Scholarship and Practice
While the study did provide insightful results of value to law firm libraries, there is much
of room for additional research since this only provides a starting point for future research to
explore this concept within law firm libraries (Ang et al., 2004; Brislin, 1981; Caligiuri, 2000;
Greer et. al, 2001; Overall, 2009; Smith & Marrow, 2008). Per the law firm librarian responses,
this study established CQ as a significant capability when it comes to value within a law firm.
Future research should examine other verticals of value to determine whether there are any
correlations between CQ and other skills. Further, law firm librarian roles should be examined
to determine whether there are differences dependent upon each specific role or other firm
demographics. Law firm librarians, both domestic and international, can be surveyed to gain a
wider pool of responses and other interesting results.
It would also be important for further research to examine and determine the impact CQ
has on the firm bottom line, if any, and whether increased levels of law librarians do make a
difference (Cunningham, 2013; Gohlke, 1997; Holt, 2007; Terjesen, 2014; Todd, 2006). Each of
the four factors and overall levels in law firm librarians can be examined for a direct correlation
to return on investment within the law firm library or firm. This study also established there are
varying levels within each of the four factors of CQ. Attorneys should be studied, and future
research should examine their own CQ levels and the value and importance of this construct to
their roles (Ang & Inkpen, 2008; Smith & Marrow, 2008). Are there any correlations to the
success of the firm based on the CQ of the library and the attorney she or he is working with?

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

133

As research on CQ expands, law firms may want to consider the integration of CQ into
training. CQ is important for selecting, training, & developing a culturally intelligent workforce
with the goal to bridge the gap between cultures (Ang et. al, 2007; Plum, et. al, 2008). CQ
should be integrated into current diversity initiatives within law firms and professional
development offerings through law library associations. Law firms should take the time to seek
out cultural assessments and integrate them within their training. Assessments can provide a
deeper dive into each of the four factors, include further discussion and reflection. The recent
application of the construct to law firm librarians shows it may improve the understanding of not
only law firm librarians, but their interactions with attorneys, staff, and vendors. Kienzle and
Husar (2007) suggest benefits include improved communication and improved quality of
relationships. Scholars can create a version of the CQ scale that is specific to legal settings
working in conjunction with the Cultural Intelligence Center, and customized training can be
created to focus on the law firm sector. Scholars can also examine CQ in law firms further by
examining generational intelligence and gender differences to understand whether CQ plays a
role in interaction among groups.
Law firm librarians are valued and appreciated within their law firms. This has important
implications for future research into the value of the role and may help when a law firm faces
reducing the library headcount or collections. Future studies should focus on this aspect of value
and widen the scope to other segments of law librarianship. As Gohlke (1997) states librarians
need to justify their library value to their firms. The key according to Todd (2006) is for a
librarian to know how to quantify the value of the library to upper management. Scholars could
work with law library associations, such as the American Association of Law Libraries, on a
white paper and/or publication of findings within adjacent associations such as the American Bar

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

134

Association, so that attorneys and administrators may see this work. This could be used to
leverage and justify positions as firms may try to downsize or merge (Andrea, 2014; Rieger,
2011). Scholars could also use this to evaluate what it means to be valued. Law librarians need
to promote and market themselves within the industry as to the value they can provide to law
firms. The value that law firm librarians bring to the table needs to be known by their
stakeholders. Therefore, this means marketing and promoting expertise. The scholarship should
extend further within law firms internationally and beyond just law firms. Government
agencies, academic institutions and corporations can benefit from this. Additionally, within law
school and library school curriculum, schools should discuss the law library and the value it
brings to the profession (Frink-Hamlett, 2011; Ward & Miller, 2010).
The law librarianship field is shifting as job skills transition. Law firm librarians should
be studied further to determine what areas will require support in the future and how law
librarians can be adequately prepared for these new roles. For example, competitive intelligence
and knowledge management are two areas in which there has been significant growth within the
law firm industry. Studies should be conducted to determine the extent of law firm and law
libraries’ capabilities to adapt to these new areas (Beaumont, 2010; Saylor, 2014). Abramovitz
et al. (2010) state, “experienced law librarians are ideally situated to manage and deliver the
quality intelligence that is critical in this economy” (“Law Firm Business Intelligence,” para. 2).
Barker (2014) believes that law librarians should expand into the role of business development
and competitive intelligence.
Closing Comments
CQ is malleable, and this is an opportunity for law firms to assess and integrate the
framework into their business models. However, as the researcher, I was disappointed in the low

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

135

response rate and the comments regarding the instrument utilized. The self-report is only a
sample and does not illustrate the true value of the CQS. While this study provided crucial new
information to the profession regarding the importance of the construct of CQ, the self-report
CQS utilized is a modified version available for academic researchers to use for research
purposes. It didn’t provide valid responses and thus undermined the credibility of the findings of
this study.
The full online questionnaire of 50 items+ is a much more sophisticated instrument
providing in-depth reports with analysis about each factor and additional value-add features.
The Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) does provide a valid and reliable measure of a person’s
ability to function effectively in culturally diverse situations. CQ research has been peer
reviewed and published in over 68 academic journals, across a wide variety of disciplines. The
CQS was developed to test and validate Earley and Ang’s (2003) conceptualization of cultural
intelligence, which is based upon Sternberg’s multiple loci of intelligences. Scale development
and validation followed rigorous construct development procedures, involving multiple
development samples and multiple cross-validation samples, over a period of several years. Law
firms could really use this type of assessment to understand their diverse cultures better and
through the use of ongoing training, including role play and activities with all staff, have a true
impact on their business and bottom line.
It can be concluded that the scope studied here is important to the profession and that
awareness of CQ can help improve interactions with stakeholders. I believe CQ does have
impact on bottom line, productivity, and job performance as illustrated by various clients of the
online assessment. As the legal industry and information profession shift, the construct of CQ is
important to understand and incorporate into law firms and law firm libraries. As more law

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

136

firms work with clients globally and with staff in other offices, it is critical to understand CQ and
how it can be utilized within a firm. Law libraries are in a unique position to not only utilize CQ,
but also to help their firms be successful.

PERMISSION TO DEVELOP CQS INTO WEB-BASED SURVEY
(sent via email to vandyne@culturalq.com)

Dr. Linn Van Dyne
Cultural Intelligence Center, LLC
5337 Panda Bear Circle
East Lansing, MI 48823
Dear Ms. Dr. Van Dyne,
I am a current doctoral candidate at Pepperdine University and CQ certified facilitator (level 1 &
2). For my dissertation, I am conducting a mixed methods research study to examine the cultural
intelligence of law firm librarians within the United States. I will be using the 20-item four
factor Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) in my research study.
I would like to take the Scale and develop into a web-based survey with additional demographic
and qualitative items to provide to my target population. I am requesting permission to convert
the current paper format of the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) into a web-based format. The
Scale content will not be modified.
The instrument will be included with my additional questions and provided via the Private Law
Libraries Special Interest Section (PLL-SIS) Community, the Special Library Association Legal
Division listserv, and the Law-lib listserv to law firm librarians with instructions on use. This
Community is available by member access only and password protected.
Please let me know if these are acceptable terms and conditions to utilize this instrument.
Sincerely,
Michele A. Villagran

Hello Michele,
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I have been out of the country and did not have
internet access. You have my permission to use the 20 item CQS scale in your academic
research and you can convert it from paper to web‐based format – as long as you include the

Please recall that the world‐wide norms are proprietary and should not be used in your research.
The goal of research is examining relationships; not assessing whether participants have low,
moderate, or high scores; not comparing their scores with the world‐wide norms. As a
consequence, even though you are aware of the world‐wide norms because you are a certified
facilitator, please do not refer to them in your research.
Please let us know if you have any questions and I wish you the best with your research. Please
share your results with us so that we can learn from you.

APPENDIX D
Informed Consent
The below message will appear on the screen that precedes the web-based survey.
Date
Dear Participant,
I am a student at Pepperdine University working on a Doctor of Education in Organizational
Leadership degree, under the supervision of Dr. Kay Davis. I am conducting a mixed methods
research study with the purpose of examining the cultural intelligence of law firm librarians in
the United States.
I would like to invite you to participate in a survey on cultural intelligence. Your participation
in this study is voluntary. Should you choose not to complete the survey, this will in no way
affect your status as a law librarian.
The survey will take 30 minutes to complete. There is no right or wrong answers. The survey
includes: (a) open-ended items related to cultural intelligence; (b) the 20-item four factor cultural
intelligence scale to assess your current level of cultural intelligence; and (c) demographic items
such as gender, education level, years of experience, number of languages spoken, job title,
geographic location, and experience with other cultures.
The only foreseeable risk associated with participation in this study is the possibility that
reflecting upon personal biases may cause uncomfortable feelings. Although there may be no
direct impact to you, the possible benefit of your participation is a better understanding of
cultural intelligence within law firm libraries.
I am required to keep the information collected for this study in a secure manner for at least 3
years. After the survey information is no longer required for research purposes, the information
will be destroyed.
A summary of the findings may be obtained in approximately 6-12 months. If you wish to
receive a summary of the findings, please fill out the last page of the survey. When the results are
shared, the information that is provided will describe the participants as whole, not individual
participants. To further protect your privacy, we are not asking you to provide any information
that can identify you, such as your name.
You may also elect to be entered in a drawing to for one on-depth cultural intelligence
assessment and follow-up consultation with CQ certified facilitator, Michele A. Villagran after
completion of the survey.
Feel free to contact me with any questions concerning the study herein described at
michele.villagran@pepperdine.edu or michelealucero@gmail.com. If you have further questions

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

about this research, you may contact my dissertation chair, Dr. Kay Davis, Pepperdine
University, Graduate School of Education and Psychology, 6100 Center Drive, Los Angeles, CA

Professional Schools Institutional Review board, Pepperdine University, Graduate School of
Education and Psychology, 6100 Center Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90045, (818) 501-1632.
I would appreciate the survey being completed by DATE. I hope you will participate in this
study. Thank you for your time and consideration.

IRB Approval Notice

Graduate & Professional Schools Institutional Review Board
January 20, 2015

Michele Villagran
Protocol #: E0115D04
Project Title: Examination of Cultural Intelligence within Law Firm Librarians in the United
States: A Mixed Methods Study
Dear Michele,
Thank you for submitting your application, Examination of Cultural Intelligence within Law
Firm Librarians in the United States: A Mixed Methods Study, for exempt review to Pepperdine
University’s Graduate and Professional Schools Institutional Review Board (GPS IRB). The IRB
appreciates the work you and your faculty advisor, Dr. Davis, have done on the proposal. The
IRB has reviewed your submitted IRB application and all ancillary materials. Upon review, the
IRB has determined that the above entitled project meets the requirements for exemption under
the federal regulations (45 CFR 46 http://www.nihtraining.com/ohsrsite/guidelines/45cfr46.html) that govern the protections of
human subjects. Specifically, section 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2) states:
(b) Unless otherwise required by Department or Agency heads, research activities in which the
only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the following categories are
exempt from this policy:
Category (2) of 45 CFR 46.101, research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive,
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of
public behavior, unless: a) Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human
subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects; and b) any
disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research could reasonably place the
subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing,
employability, or reputation.
In addition, your application to waive documentation of informed consent has been approved.
Your research must be conducted according to the proposal that was submitted to the IRB. If
changes to the approved protocol occur, a revised protocol must be reviewed and approved by

EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE

165

the IRB before implementation. For any proposed changes in your research protocol, please
submit a Request for Modification Form to the GPS IRB. Because your study falls under
exemption, there is no requirement for continuing IRB review of your project. Please be aware
that changes to your protocol may prevent the research from qualifying for exemption from 45
CFR 46.101 and require submission of a new IRB application or other materials to the GPS IRB.
A goal of the IRB is to prevent negative occurrences during any research study. However,
despite our best intent, unforeseen circumstances or events may arise during the research. If an
unexpected situation or adverse event happens during your investigation, please notify the GPS
IRB as soon as possible. We will ask for a complete explanation of the event and your response.
Other actions also may be required depending on the nature of the event. Details regarding the
timeframe in which adverse events must be reported to the GPS IRB and the appropriate form to
be used to report this information can be found in the Pepperdine University Protection of
Human Participants in Research: Policies and Procedures Manual (see link to “policy material”
at http://www.pepperdine.edu/irb/graduate/).
Please refer to the protocol number denoted above in all further communication or
correspondence related to this approval. Should you have additional questions, please contact
Kevin Collins, Manager of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at gpsirb@peppderdine.edu. On
behalf of the GPS IRB, I wish you success in this scholarly pursuit.
