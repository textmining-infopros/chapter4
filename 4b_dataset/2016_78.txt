Librarianship. Doctor of Philosophy (Information Science), December 2016, 254 pp., 12 tables,
31 figures, references, 127 titles.
From the very beginning, library education has been a mixture of theory and practice.
Dewey required apprenticeships to be part of the first library school at the University of Chicago
as a method to indoctrinate new professional. Today, acculturation is incorporated into the
professional education through a large variety of experiential learning techniques, including
internships, practicum, field work, and service learning projects, all of which are designed to
develop some level of professional skills within an information organization. But, what is done
for understanding library culture? It is said that one cannot truly recognize the extent of one’s
own cultural assumptions, until they have experienced another. This study followed a group of
LIS graduate students that took that next step – going to Russia.

INTRODUCTION
Experience has impact. When we experience something new or different, a reaction
occurs. It may be positive; it may be negative, but either way, an impression is formed. In the
world of education, we hope that this impression will provide for a teachable moment, that
students will take something away from the experience that will affect how they interact within
the world. In fact, one of the foremost thinkers on modern education believed that it is the quality
of the experience which effects whether that teachable moment comes to pass. “The effect of an
experience is not borne on its face...(w)holly independent of desire or intent, every experience
lives on in further experiences” (Dewey, 1939/1997, p. 27). Thus, a quality learning experience
must be provided for a student to benefit from a teachable moment that lends itself to causing
change in a person and develop their future in a particular direction. It is the role of the educator
to identify, craft, and provide the opportunity for a quality experience. In the following study, the
examined quality experience is an understanding of libraries professionally, holistically, and
globally, developing “library cultural competency.” This chapter provides an explanation of the
problem, the importance of the proposed study, a multi-faceted purpose statement, and concludes
with a plan for the further development of this dissertation.
Through serendipital circumstances, , had a chance to study librarianship in DQ
international context (Appendix F). This resulted in observing many differences in how
libraries, librarians, and patrons interact. In the U.S., according to a 2015 report from PEW
Research (Figure 1), people came to libraries to learn, use computers, look for jobs, figure out
where to go for what, expand their horizons, and find information they can trust.

1

Figure 1. Why people use libraries
It is the job of LIS educators and professionals to ensure that new librarians are ready to
assist all patrons. However, people from all over the world make their homes in the U.S. and not
all patrons are familiar with how our library system works. Global library experiences provide a
learning laboratory for students, helping prepare them for today’s jobs, the face of which
continues to change. U.S. library schools teach the theoretical and practical of the existing
system. However, ours is not the only system. Libraries in different countries operate differently.
,Hxperienced this in P\ previous travels and again firsthand in Russia.
In Russia, all adults above university-age have library access. Those in a university are
afforded entrée to the large libraries, such as the Lenin Library in Moscow. These facilities are
2

designed as large study rooms with external storage for the massive collection of volumes. A
student orders a book and then can wait up to two hours for it to be retrieved. Once volumes are
in the hands of the student, they may not leave the building. Once done for the day, they turn the
books in, which may be placed on individual reserve for that student for up to two weeks.
Children have access to children's libraries that allow for self-selection of books not allowed to
circulate, as well as to story times and some children’s programming.
For the author, attempting to use these different library systems required assistance, even
as a professional librarian. Until U.S. librarians see their profession as an international patron
from the other side of the desk, they may not understand the extent of culture shock and
assistance these patrons need to use U.S. libraries. Imagine patrons from Russia with their closed
stacks may not recognize the process of physically selecting their own book or that, once
selected, believe that the library will hold their items for them. This could be confusing for the
patron and the librarian may have no concept of why. The library staff does not understand
librarianship could be practiced any other way than how the American Library Association
(ALA) accredited education they received prescribes. This scenario sets up not just a hurdle to
providing services to diverse populations, but shows that library staff need to consider the
purpose of libraries outside of the box.
Additionally, in the era of a completely online library and information science program,
librarians who graduate without live professional interactions or hands-on, real-world
experience. Those who complete a practicum, field experience, or service learning effort,
typically do so locally, not internationally. As a result, students may not have the opportunity to
experience societal or cultural challenges that illustrate the depth and breadth of librarianship’s
influence. By learning about library services in other countries, students can see beyond what

3

they are taught in a U.S. library school and then think about creative ways to meet the needs of
patrons. These professionals may start to see how patrons from other countries interact with their
home country’s libraries differently and begin to challenge their assumptions and look to the
needs of our growing diverse patron base.
This challenge and call to expanding library students’ views of librarianship arises also
from the fact that the face of U.S. librarianship is changing. This transformation is two-fold: the
tasks of library themselves and the needs and expectations of patrons. What used to be a
profession focused on creating rules to treat everyone the same and provide equal access to
information, the profession is now evolving into one of making information accessible to all.
This means that, instead of being a sideline observer with no opinion, librarians should
customize the information to the needs of the patrons. Librarians cannot assume that everyone
knows how a library works or that patrons of any age know how items are organized; even
directional signs may be misunderstood. Many concepts taught in U.S. are not universal, despite
how they are presented. Additionally, no longer are librarians catering to the needs of a
predominantly white, Western-European descent, English-speaking constituency. The American
Library Association (ALA), the main accrediting body for LIS schools, challenged librarians in
2007 to expand their core competencies to include an understanding of diversity. This originated
from a discrepancy in diversity as identified by the ALA in the cultural makeup of librarians
compared with patrons. “The U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority nation for the first
time in 2043. While the non-Hispanic white population will remain the largest single group, no
group will make up a majority” (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). A recent ALA membership
demographics study by comparison showed the field to be 89.3% white (ALA, 2011). So, not

4

only is diversity needed in the ranks of libraries, but also an understanding of how to meet the
needs of diverse patron groups.
A movement to meet this challenge has begun. For example, Mestre (2010) conducted a
study of LIS students and the impact diversity training had on their cultural competency. The
author’s initial supposition was that LIS graduates starting their first job should have learned
everything they need to know to address the needs of a diverse workplace and patron base.
However, as of 2010, she found that little had been done to assist students achieving professional
cultural competency. The study participants, all active librarians, did not feel they had adequate
training from their university program in this area, nor are recent graduates entering the
workforce with these skills. The study found that much cultural diversity knowledge comes from
on the job experiences. Librarians should not have to learn by trial-and-error how to interact with
patrons respectfully, adjust their communication styles, or understand and accommodate
differing worldviews, at the expense of the patron’s information seeking process. If United States
librarians are seen as hostile, confused, or uncooperative by the growing population of culturally
diverse library users, then patrons will stop seeking their assistance. Herein lies the beginnings of
what this dissertation addressed; that is, finding a way to support new librarians learning cultural
competency at the moment of having offended or been unsuccessful at helping a patron.
A tier 1 university in northern Texas, too, has taken up the challenge. Every year for the
past ten, the College of Information has presented an opportunity for its LIS graduate students to
work on a project at an international school library. Much planning takes place in the preceding
year. The experience is positioned within the three weeks between the spring and summer
semesters to afford for maximum participation by all types of librarians (school, academic,
public, special, and information professionals). Additionally, by keeping the travel portion short

5

cost can be kept low for participants as well. The professor coordinates with the study abroad
office, the graduate school, and the department to assist students with scholarship for partial
reimbursement. More importantly, the professor works with the host library to define the project
which will make up the courses. Not all experiences are the same and none have ever been
exactly what was understood before arriving at the host location. In addition to the academics
and service logistics, the professor is responsible for arranging lodging, in country transport, and
developing a plan for cultural enrichment. This includes local color, museums, tours, shopping
adventures, and historic sites. Again the variety of the cultural activities depend on the
experience location and availability of staff and funds to accompany the participants. Russia
posed a number of unique situations at all levels of planning. The details of this specific trip are
outlined in chapter , including an itinerary and the initial cultural and educational
opportunities established for the students.
This dissertation study was an evolution of previous understandings about how taking
LIS students out of the country to participate in the world of international librarianship through
this program affects them. In a previous study, the focus was solely on observing whether
western bias or cultural competency was mitigated or developed through international
experiences. This study expanded to examine the professional skills, professional culture, and
global view of libraries that a quality experience in an international library could provide
students.
To provide a quality experience, several key pieces were identified. First, this was an
international experience and students were sequestered in a foreign country for the duration. By
studying comparative librarianship firsthand, library students began to understand the challenges
that patrons from diverse cultures may experience. Additionally, the study sought to introduce

6

these students to different world views of librarianship, while deepening their commitment to
providing services to ALL patrons. Both aspects have been proposed as vital to making a wellprepared library sciences graduate to meet the challenges of today's changing patron base.
Second, this was a service-learning experience. Students actively cooperated with the
host staff to achieve results on a project designed to benefit the host library as well as provide for
a university credit-bearing learning experience for them. Third, this was a circumscribed
experience and students were in country for no more than three weeks. Additionally, the group
functioned as a cohort – spending working hours together, maintaining common lodging
arrangements, and participating in coordinated evening and weekend activities.
Last, this study helps us understand the benefits to such an experience and to see whether
duplication of such an experience can provide similar results in library cultural competency. As a
result, it provides evidence of the support that professional development provides, especially
when including an international experience as part of the curriculum, which the LIS education
field can use to transform its programs of study. If even a nominal benefit increasing
participants’ cultural awareness is evident, it may open the door for the way to prepare our future
colleagues for working with an expanding diverse patron base in the process.
Purpose Statement
The study sought to understand how the service-learning aspect of an international study
abroad experience affects LIS students. The research investigated whether being sequestered in
an international service learning experience deepened library science student’s knowledge of
their profession. Supporting subtopic questions were included to provide an understanding of the
central topic of inquiry were:

Overview of Dissertation

The remainder of this dissertation develops the complete story of this study. As part of
contextualizing and arguing the need for the study, chapter  provides definitions and surveys
the literature on two topic areas: service learning and its subset, international service learning, as
well as cultural competence and its corollary, library cultural competence. This also includes a
historical look at each topic, including key works. The chapter then looks at how the field of
library and information science has dealt with each. Additionally, each section uses field-specific
literature correlated with commentary on international experiences. From these topics, specific
term definitions are solidified for theories and employed guiding models.
The third chapter presents the methods used in this study. It explains the qualitative
nature of the study and ethical research in keeping with university institutional review board
requirements. This section also introduces the participant information instruments used for data
collection: pre-experience surveys, experience challenge questions, post-experience interviews.
It also presents the additional rich texts to be used as contextual and corroborating documents:
researcher observation notes, course syllabi, and instructor recap thoughts. The processes used to
compile the data, the use of the constant comparative coding process, and triangulation, the
method used to establish credibility are explained. Finally, as this dissertation is founded on a
pilot study, it describes additions, changes, or tweaks made to the original instruments and any
expected impacts as well as the sample selection process.

8

The fourth and fifth chapters discuss the results and findings, respectively, that emerged
from the research and contextualizes them with the initial research questions, and where
appropriate, past research. It also includes a description of the participants and their expectations
prior to the experience. Those themes where the majority of participants expressed similar
reactions are highlighted with example quotes and any outliers are noted. General statements
regarding suggestions for the future of the program are summarized. Finally, a synthesis of the
results focuses on the original topics of inquiry for further discussion, including pilot data where
it corroborates findings.
At the end of the dissertation, a conclusion chapter is included that offers the researcher’s
perspective of the findings in the previous chapter and implications they suggest not only for
this particular program but also for other ISL experiences within the field. Suggestions for future
areas of research are presented. Lastly, appendices include all materials used with the
participants to ensure transparency.

CHAPTER 
RELATED LITERATURE
Critical hermeneutics, a research method that is fully introduced in the next chapter,
involves understanding a phenomenon through a critical lens. A critical lens involves looking at
the political, social, economic, cultural, and historical impacts on an event or text. A critical lens
is typically seen within critical theory. Critical theory examines the inequalities of society and
culture in an effort to cause change (Carspecken, 1996; Creswell, 1998; Miller & Salkind, 2002).
Critical research, according to Kilgore, “illuminates power relationships between individuals and
groups of individuals, enabling the researcher and participants to critique commonly-held values
and assumptions” (as cited in Willis, 2007, p. 82). This study examined an international service
learning experience through the critical lens of library culture. Applying a critical lens let us look
at a library from the political, social, and cultural systems of the country in which it was
embedded and used it as a catalyst to prompt reflexive deliberation on how U.S. library
structures and systems can positively change as corroborated by the research findings from this
study. In this chapter, two sets of literature relevant to the proposed study are examined. The first
is service learning/international service learning and second are taken to examine the
components of what is known as library cultural competency as part of making the argument that
a critical qualitative study is needed to more fully understand the educational role of international
service learning experiences.
Service Learning
Service learning is a form of experiential learning. Learning through experience is an
entire branch of instructional methodology or pedagogy. Service learning is one of these. Bringle
and Hatcher (1996) put forth the founding idea that “service learning is a credit-bearing

10

educational experience in which students participate in an organized service activity that meets
identified community needs” (p. 222). According to Eastmond (2010), it involves the
incorporation of “socially worthwhile projects rather than assignments that have no practical
value other than providing practice” ( p. 2) into the curriculum. To understand service learning,
one must first explore its origins – experiential learning and what components that make it
unique from other experiential learning pedagogy, before introducing the pedagogy of
international service learning (ISL).
Origins of Service Learning
Service learning as a discrete concept is relatively new and even newer in the library and
information science field. However, it stands as the latest iteration of a long line of experiential
learning pedagogies. The concept of learning through experiences was initially introduced as a
radical departure from traditional education. Dewey (1997) extolled the virtues of education
based on experience. He believed that, although education should be based on experiences, not
every experience was educational. To be educational, the experience must move the student
towards additional experiences that promote growth. To that end, Dewey put forth that it is the
educator’s role, as the mature participant in the educational process, to be ever forward looking
to identify and provide opportunities for such experiences.
Since Dewey’s time, several authors have investigated experience as the primary factor
that helps us retain what we learn (Senge, 1990; Borg & Stranahan, 2002; McClean, 2006;
Knowles, 1998). This retention comes from the process of resolving conflicts between opposing
concepts of dealing with the world (Kolb, 1984). Learning in this fashion breaks into four main
concepts: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active
experimentation. All of these together provide the “experience” in experiential learning.

11

Another viewpoint put forward by Hawtrey (2007) focused on student’s role in the
experiential learning process. She conducted a survey of economics student asking the impact of
different learning activities on developing knowledge, examination preparation, and stimulating
curiousity. She showed in the results that experiential learning techniques make the student a
stakeholder in their own educational process by giving them opportunities to apply learned
concepts and work through their implementation in a live situation. Hawtrey concluded that it is
the act of personal involvement in the learning process that makes experiential learning have
lasting effects.
Similarly, Carver (1997) explained how to be a stakeholder in one’s education through
his conceptual framework – the ABCs of student experience (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Carver’s conceptual framework for experiential education
She posited that experiential learning encourages agency, belonging, and competence in a
learner. Agency is the act of becoming responsible for one's own growth, developing awareness,
acceptance and power. Belonging is incorporation, induction, integration process through which
learners find a sense of place and meaning within their community. Finally, experiential learning
provides competence through skills development, knowledge generation, and an exhibited
12

applicability of concepts. Carver’s model provided four key factors for a successful program:
“authenticity, active learning, drawing on student experience, and connecting lessons to the
future” (p. 147).
Experiential learning was a foundational component during the formal birth of library
education. Melville Dewey, a pioneer in the field of library education, incorporated this
philosophy of learning through experience in the first library schools (Wiegand, 1996). Dewey
believed in the cultivation of “library spirit” in new professionals. His lectures focused on the
principles that have since been institutionalized within the American Library Association’s
(ALA) Code of Ethics. At the heart of the education for librarian, Dewey believed that the
intangibles of the field were learned through apprenticeship. It was this apprenticeship that
addressed the experiential learning necessary to allow an “individual to refine their vocational
practice in the workplace and to acquire wider knowledge about the concepts and theories
underpinning that practice” (Fuller & Unwin, 2012, p.8).
Experiential learning has spawned a number of subcategories, such as the apprenticeships
required by Dewey. Today, the field includes experiences through apprenticeships, internships,
field work, practicum, volunteerism, community service, and service learning. Each has a
varying degree of connection to a classroom. Some experiences such as apprenticeship,
internship, and co-op all seek to provide real-world education but are detached from any
formalized instruction. Other experiences, including fieldwork and practicum, provide for
academic guidance from a faculty advisor. The last category is intricately tied to service projects
and includes volunteerism, community service, and service learning.

13

Components of Service Learning
Service learning, a subcategory of experiential learning, has some unique aspects that set
it apart from the other pedagogy. Service learning experiences are designed to provide mutual
benefit (Hall-Ellis & Grealy, 2012) for all parties involved. Anderson, Swick, and Yff (2001)
explained several of these benefits. For example, from the student’s perspective, students are
afforded an opportunity to assist with planning and implementing the service project.
Meanwhile, they are also required to participate in reflection assignments designed to assist them
in incorporating their experiences into their coursework. At the community partner level, the
organization typically completes a strategic project with the assistance of a high quality
workforce. Unlike philanthropic efforts, the project is designed to address a specific need of the
organization’s choice. Finally the university positions themselves within the community as an
active member willing to give back.
Unlike other experiential learning options, service learning stands out because it is
integrated into a credit-bearing course (Coleman, 1989). The nature of academic learning that is
made possible through service learning was investigated by Eyler and Giles (1999). The authors
conducted a quantitative study of 1,100 students who had participated in service learning
experiences. The variables examined were academic learning, citizenship, critical thinking and
problem solving, transformation, and engagement, curiosity, and reflection. A positive
correlation was found between service learning and academic learning. Students reported an
increased understanding and ability to apply course content.
A study of 12 years of data of program alumni by Canfield, Low, and Hovestadt (2009)
went further and confirmed that a service learning project can help develop cultural competency
in participants if it is structured to immerse them in a culture other than their own, regardless of

14

the physical location or medium of presentation. Having written on service learning in many
different fields, Zlotkowski (2001) also shared research findings related to the implications of
service learning in the academy. He stated that “because well-designed service learning activities
naturally and effectively lead to a deeper understanding of the learning process even while they
provide an opportunity to create larger units of curricular coherence, they can simultaneously
address the challenges of facilitating deep learning and of overcoming piecemeal implementation
of reform” (p. 58). Since its inception, thousands of studies have been conducted and millions of
students have participated in such experiences.
International Service Learning
International service learning is a subset of service learning. Theories are put forth in this
section that are used to study ISL, the outcomes that international service learning has been
shown to impact, the mitigating variables present when using service learning, some examples of
ISL within the field of library and information science, and, finally, suggestions for developing a
successful service learning experience. Service learning takes on an international context by the
inclusion of study abroad and international education components. This adds two spheres of
influence to the existing model. International service learning (ISL) is defined in this context as
a structured academic experience in another country in which students (a) participate in
an organized service activity that addresses identified community needs; (b) learn from
direct interaction and cross-cultural dialog with others; and (c) reflect on the experience
in such a way as to gain further understanding of course content, a deeper understanding
of global and intercultural issues, a broader appreciation of the host country and the
discipline, and an enhanced sense of their own responsibilities as citizens, locally and
globally. (Bringle & Hatcher, 2011, p. 19)
In the second part of the definition, learning incorporates the benefits of international
education. As such, research has indicated that ISL can allow “instructors to

15

1. teach students an appreciation for the challenges faced by people in societies other
than their own and an understanding of the complex systems and structures from
which these challenges arise;
2. lead students in developing effective strategies for addressing those challenges in
appropriate, respectful, and constructive ways;
3. foster in students an understanding of the meaning and value of responsible global
citizenship;
4. and provide students with skills that will give them a competitive advantage in the
global marketplace.” (Smith-Paríolá & Gòkè-Paríolá, 2006, p. 75)
This interaction between service learning and the international perspective is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. International service learning: The intersection of service learning, study abroad, and
international education
This depiction combines the model developed by Koren (2009) to show the dimensions of
effective service learning: knowledge, service, practical professional experience, and reflection,
placing it within the characterization provided by Bringle & Hatcher (2011). With this model in
mind, a vision of international service learning experience may also be drawn.

Theories and ISL
Several theories have been put forth to study the nature, benefits, and outcomes of service
learning which includes international service learning. Three are: contact theory, intensity
factors, transformative learning theory. Having been described as the magic that comes from life
abroad (Engle & Engle, 2002), Allport (1954) suggested that prejudice may be alleviated through
contact with Others. Others are defined in sociology as those that do not share the habits, such as
language, sense of property, sense of self, or morales, of one’s social group (Mead, Section 20).
Engle and Engle’s purported magic has since expanded beyond the single concept of addressing
prejudice. The impact of interacting with Others has been proposed to affect linguistic
development, dealing with and sensitizing to cultural concerns, deeper connection to course
materials, and providing a forum for personal growth in the face of adversity and reassessing
one’s world view and locus of control. Adler (1975) believed that contact was just one step in the
path of developing one’s cultural awareness. His transitional theory suggested that a participant
moves through the stages of contact, disintegration, reintegration, autonomy, and independence.
However, Pettigrew (1998) showed that it was not the Others that provided this magic; instead, it
is four specific conditions a student experienced:
x
x
x
x

Equal group status (external, inter-group)
Common goals (internal, intra-group)
Inter-group cooperation (sub-groups)
Support of authorities, law, or custom (group interactions must be sanctioned)

Another way to examine international service learning is through the lens of intensity
factors. Intensity factors theory is useful because it provides a host of factors (Table 1) that,
depending on the degree to which a student experiences them, can affect a participant's attitudes
regarding the success of an experience.

By being out of one’s normal environment and required to interact with another, students
should change due to a reaction to stress or anxiety (Meirzow, 1991). The key to transformation
is being involved in an experience that challenges the individual to rethink their perceptions of
how the world functions. One lens to understand this idea through it Transformative Learning
Theory, which was first connected to the field of service learning by Taylor (1994).
Transformative learning, using the concept of perspective transformation, was linked to service
learning by Eyler and Giles (1999). The authors explained that “transformational learning occurs
when individuals confront disorienting dilemmas; perspective transformation becomes possible
when this dilemma raises questions about fundamental assumptions” (p. 141). In their study,
students experienced challenges to stereotypes, personal values, and experienced life from
viewpoint of the Other that they were able to convert into a new understanding of social issues.
Studies
International service learning, as pedagogy, is employed in many locations, within
different fields, and to investigate a broad range of topics. Two major associations have taken on
the cause. The first was Campus Compact, “a national coalition of more than 1,100 college and
18

university presidents—representing some six million students—who are committed to fulfilling
the civic purposes of higher education” (Campus Compact, 2013, “Who We Are”). The second is
the National Service Learning Clearinghouse, which “supports the service-learning community
in higher education, kindergarten through grade twelve, community-based organizations, tribal
programs, and all others interested in strengthening schools and communities using servicelearning” (NSLC, 2013, “About-NSCL”). In addition to providing faculty and student resources
on engaging in service learning, Campus Compact (http://www.compact.org) highlights
universities with seven different international service learning opportunities from Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, Haiti, Bolivia, and Mexico to Bosnia, Tibet, Japan, and South Africa and focusing on
clinical medicine, education, reading and mentoring, social justice, non-violence, and rebuilding
communities. The National Service Learning Clearinghouse (http://www.servicelearning.org)
provides resources for examining service learning from faculty, community and student
perspectives. This study focused on student perspectives, impacts, and benefits.
Student-focused learning studies, drawn from the EBSCO, Taylor and Francis Online, JSTOR,
and ERIC databases for international service, indicated 60 items published within the past year in
peer-reviewed journals, a strong sign of how important this area has grown in recent years.
Students have been engaged in international service learning experiences at all ends of the globe,
Southeast Asia, Rwanda, Peru, Czech Republic, Mexico, and beyond. These recent studies have
been conducted in health, nursing, higher education, human resources, theology, political
science, and business disciplines. Many areas of personal growth (Table 2) have been examined
as a result of students participating in international service learning opportunities. Other studies
employed an emergent approach and focused on broad questions of whether ISL really impacted

19

students (Le, Raven, & Chen, 2013) and what “meaning” students made out of their experience
(Jones, Rowan-Kenyon, Niehaus, Skendall, & Ireland, 2013).

Although termed “international” service learning, some studies have addressed projects
in a home country that were conducted within a different culture, either socio-economic or
ethnicity. In an ethnographic study of education students in the UK, using the framework of ISL,
Bamber and Hankin (2011) looked that the transformational properties of a “local” experience.
Using the six areas of transformation, political, moral, intellectual, cultural, personal, and
spiritual identified by Kiely (2004), they were able to show that a “local” experience in a
different subculture can indeed be a catalyst for challenging students’ “personal values and
stereotypes” (Bamber & Hankin, 2011, p. 202). Other “local” experiences have been conducted
on Native American reservations, foreign soil within the U.S. In social work, Bolea (2012)
presented the idea that through learning the historical context of Native Americans, students
could be better prepared to engage their community. As a result of their experiences and
reflections, students reported increased cultural competence, critical thinking skills, and self-

20

awareness. In addition to these effects, students completing a service learning project on the
Lakota and Dakota reservations experienced transformation when they were confronted with a
new view on the “history of the Indians and the degree to which American society is rooted in
Indian practices” (Pusch & Merrill, 2007, p. 33).
However, in the past ten years, few studies have addressed the development of
professional skills. ISL was employed to develop tacit knowledge of engineering at several
remote sites in Peru. Developed to resemble the Engineers Without Borders ™ program, 28
students participated in service learning projects to build latrines, solar panels, and other
engineering feats (Johnson, Johnson, & Shaney, 2008). Through this qualitative study that
included reflection journals, nightly group project conversations, and final reports, students
identified several areas of learning that were unique to the ISL experience: technical
communication, understanding cultural issues, the positive aspects of teams, “ingenuity,”
“leadership, coping, personal growth,” as well as the “value of international travel” (p. 84).
International Service Learning in LIS 3rograms
Service learning has been adopted as an option for providing practical experience within
the field of library and information science; however, there are few accounts and even fewer
studies outlined in the literature relating to international service learning experiences. Although
most of its offerings are locally situated, the University of Michigan’s School of Information
incorporates international service learning into a few of its offerings. For example, in 2007,
students traveled to and worked with the University of Fort Hare, in Alice, South Africa to help
them “manage, preserve, and provide access to its cultural assets” (Frost, 2009, p. 130).
Nazarova (2007) surveyed 211 library and information science program alumni from the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign whom had participated in a service learning experience

21

course. He found six areas that these students valued most in their service learning experience:
communication leadership, leadership, teamwork, technology skills, the ability to work with
community organizations and members, and how they think about LIS professions. One course
included in this study was an experience where students had worked with schools in Saõ Tomé e
Príncipe, an island country off the coast of Western Africa, to establish computer labs and
networking infrastructure at nine locations. In a related study by Montague, Wolske, and Larkee
(2009), one participant provided her perspective of this project. The challenges were great,
ranging from the physical (i.e. limited electrical supply), to logistical (i.e. reaching the sites), and
cramped classroom conditions, to cultural, not having a common language and adjusting to the
pace of life on the island. As a result, she explained that “I know that without my service
learning experience, my career would have looked very different. I feel prepared for work and
life and intend to continue looking for ways to foster positive community change” (p. 44). It is
this form of self-report that makes up the bulk of the current research in LIS on international
service learning.
Suggestions for Success
International service learning, especially at the graduate level, is typically conducted
through short-term experiences. “Short-term experiences do not always have the full desired
impact, because students are not away from home long enough to absorb and process
information about the new location and its cultures” (Cushner & Karim, 2003 as cited in Ryan,
2010, p. 308). Since not all studies show positive results, the literature is peppered with many
suggestions for increasing the effectiveness of ISL programs. The overwhelming majority call
for more reflection activities to be included in the program (Bacon, 2002; Hanvey, 1979;
Whalley, 1995). Reflection activities can include any method by which the student is prompted

22

to review and process their experience, such as speaking with mentors, providing country
informants at the host location, and personal journals (Bacon, 2002). Another suggestion is to
increase the amount of pre-experience orientation provided (Medina-Lopez-Portillo, 2004; La
Brack, 1993). Specific topics suggested to be covered were: values of the host culture, socioeconomics differences, host country politics (Medina-Lopez-Portillo, 2004; Ryan, 2010) and a
general setting of expectations (La Brack, 1993). Finally, Ryan’s (2010) findings encouraged
that the experience be specifically geared to provide practice in professional tasks and behaviors.
ISL: Conclusion
International service learning as a subset of experiential learning, has been shown to
produce a multitude of learning and personal outcomes. Everything from emotional regulation,
critical thinking, and a greater satisfaction with life (Savicki, Cooley, & Donnelly, 2008) and an
increased interest in international affairs of the host country (Carlson, Burn, Useem,
Yachimowicz, 1990) to a better understanding of course materials, enjoying learning, liking
service, professional development, gaining skills, experience, and confidence in one’s abilities
(Isaacson & Saperstien, 2005). Within the LIS field, ISL provided the foundations for
socialization, professional networking with future colleagues, resume building, and a competitive
edge for obtaining one’s first professional position (Hall-Ellis & Grealy, 2012). As such,
participating in an experiential learning project that provides a service to the community while
also being firmly ensconced within a credit-bearing course is a win-win situation for effective
learning.
Culture
Culture has been viewed as varying systems: cognitive, structural, and symbolic
(Kessing, 1974). Each of these systems establishes a different viewpoint from which to define

23

culture. Each one has purpose for this discussion. As a cognitive viewpoint, culture takes on
linguistic attributes. Information regarding how the world works is mapped out so that people
understand how to operate within it. This process of mapping the information is the cognitive
culture for that people. Structural culture is derived from examining the social constructs of a
people. It examines the power relationships within a people and how they interact as a result.
Finally, symbolic culture, the main focus of this study, examines on the shared meaning a group
of people maintain.
Within the symbolic viewpoint, Schein (1990, 1996) positioned culture as a set of shared
beliefs and ways of being borne out of experiences and their resulting successful coping and
growth strategies of a certain group of people. These strategies were then brought forward to the
subsequent generations as just the way we do things. Similarly, according to Shih and Allen
(2007), “culture, directly or indirectly (but indubitably), influences how individuals and groups
think, act and respond within organizations” (p. 92). Within libraries and library schools, culture
and lack of diversity is a great concern. Gulati (2010) points to deficits in cultural diversity in
areas of staffing, recruitment and retention of permanent staff; recruitment, hiring, and retention
of student staff; recruiting students and faculty to library schools; developing library collections;
and providing library services.
Library Culture
In addition to traditional conceptions of cultural diversity, librarians experience their own
culture. In the context of this dissertation, library culture refers to the professional culture of
being within the field. Notably,
Libraries have a strong culture that is embedded in practices and policies…Libraries
place a high priority on constructive interpersonal relationships and conflicts are often
avoided. Employees are expected to conform and be supportive and constructive when

24

dealing with others. New employees who violate the cultural norms may never be
accepted within the organization. (Sannwald, 2000 as cited in Chapman, 2009, p. 128)
Libraries, as a collective and as a profession, exhibit several shared traits, although each
individual library will maintain its own organizational culture. One lasting example of these
shared traits comes from outside the U.S. in Ranganathan’s (1957) Five Laws of Library Science.
Although it originally addressed “books,” today’s interpretation broadens the concept to all
informational artifacts a library might hold. He put forth this concise view of library culture:
“Books are for use. Books are for all. Every reader his book. Every book its reader. Save the time
of the reader. A library is a growing organism” (p. 9). These laws embody the spirit of
information should be shared and our profession needs to be ready to adapt to provide it to our
customers in the way that makes it most effective to them. These foundational concepts have
been institutionalized within the codes and guidelines of the American Library Association
(ALA) and its many working partners, such as the International Federation of Library
Associations (IFLA).
The symbolic nature of library culture is also present in the Library Bill of Rights (BOR)
(ALA, 1996), the ALA’s Code of Ethics (COE) (ALA, 2008), and IFLA Code of Ethics for
Librarians and other Information Workers (IFLA CODE) (IFLA, 2012). In these documents,
library culture is shown to include a commitment to the “enlightenment of all people” (BOR),
providing a non-partisan view of current information (BOR), “free expression and free access to
ideas” (BOR, COE, IFLA CODE), equal treatment of all customers (BOR, IFLA CODE), work
with co-workers in a collaborative manner while always exhibiting respect and fairness (IFLA
CODE, COE), and do not allow our personal interests to affect our neutrality in providing quality
service (COE, IFLA CODE).

25

However, even these shared traits are in flux. Gomez (2000) challenged the concept of
providing equal and neutral access to all. He contended that quality “library service does not
depend on (the person providing the service) being a member of the target ethnic-minority
community, adhering to conventional operating policies and business practices, or (even) being a
librarian” (p. 39). Librarians and libraries are called to provide unique and customized solutions
to library service by suggesting that
many of our operating policies and business practices are based on a system of support
structures and organizational relationships that cater to the greatest common
denominator, often making it very hard to meet the unique needs of the ethnic-minority
communities. (pp. 40-41)
It is not just our patron base that is driving this evolving nature of library culture. Instead,
The information profession has undergone changed regularly and at a high level due to
the ongoing development of information technology, advancement of information
management, and the ever-changing learning behaviors and needs of users. (Tanloet,
2011, p. 123)
As a result, the profession has sought to enumerate its core competencies. Core competencies are
described as those skills and attributes which lead someone to succeed in their environment
(Spencer & Spencer, 1993; Boyatzis, 1982; Armstrong, 2006; Parry, 1996). Key items included
for librarians include user satisfaction (Mcneil & Giesecke, 2001) and an understanding of others
(Chat-uthai, 2008), as well as flexibility (Abels, Jones, Latham, Magnoni, & Gard, 2003) and
global thinking (Mcneil & Giesecke, 2001).
The shared beliefs and core competencies of library culture have been categorized into
three categories: material, institutional, and spiritual (Sheng, 2005). Material culture refers to
how a library portrays itself and communicates its rules and processes to the public. Institutional
culture, as exhibited by ALA’s Code of Ethics V-VIII, focuses on the people who staff the
library. It addresses how the collective reacts to special situations and the accepted norms of
behavior in routine transactions. Lastly, “spiritual culture of libraries [as exhibited by ALA’s Bill
26

of Rights III-V] is the standard of value and basic idea which guides staffs, such as thought of
operating libraries, core value, management mode and method, image, ethics, and work style”
(Sheng & Sun, 2007, p. 37).
Cultural Competency
Cultural competency has been a subject of study in many different fields. In the education
field, cultural competency is based on how functional one is in situations involving other cultural
contexts (Cross, Bazron, Dennis, & Issacs, 1989; Wehling, 2008; Paz, 2008). Similarly, the
American College Health Association (2011) maintained that “cultural competency refers to the
capacity for an individual, an organization, or an institution to respond to the unique needs of
populations whose cultures are different from that which might be referred to as dominant” (p.
436). For this dissertation, I will look at cultural competency as a means by which a non-librarian
achieves functionality and in fact full integration into the new culture, also described as
acculturation.
Each profession has its own social norms, ethics, key tenets, and competencies.
Becoming part of a profession, such as librarianship, requires the development of professional
cultural competency through a process of acculturation. As early as 1919, the concept of
acculturation was acknowledged and studied, with Riley (1918) stating that, “acculturation
comprehends those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cultures
come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original cultural patterns
of either or both groups” (p. 545). Thus, acculturation is the process of integrating with a culture
other than the one of your origins. This integration can have many steps. According to Sherlock
and Morris (1969), professional socialization is a collection of institutional processes—selection,
sequestration, didactic instruction, apprenticeship instruction, sanctioning, certification, and

27

sponsorship (p. 29). In the field of U.S. librarianship, obtaining an accredited Master’s degree
addresses a number of these items. Unfortunately, most librarians do not experience the full
depth of the acculturation process until they experience their first post-graduate position. This is
when they experience the differences between being a paraprofessional or a highly involved
volunteer. It is through experience that librarians learn the inherent level of stewardship and
obligation to uphold the shared beliefs of our culture.
Structured Acculturation
Academic libraries and school libraries especially, purport a structured process of
acculturation early in one’s career because these positions are situated within another institution.
Librarians in these areas must come to their position with the professional culture firmly
ingrained so they can then begin the process of learning the culture of their governing institution.
To fully prepare students to join the profession one day, the indoctrination process must come
from their graduate program. An international service learning experience, as illustrated earlier,
within the LIS curriculum may serve as a playground to address many points of Sherlock and
Morris’s process of professional socialization as well as provide a challenging cultural context.
To date, unfortunately,
[C]ultural competency has rarely blessed our professional practice or even penetrated our
professional consciousness…[because] librarians seldom learn the language, collect the
literatures, or understand in any deep way the beliefs, traditions, morals and mores,
lifestyles, or aspirations and expectations of the minority cultures in their midst. I reach
out to hand them only our culture and heritage, rather than receiving and learning about
theirs and respectfully adding them to our collections and personal service. (Berry, 1999,
p. 112)
A pioneer in this space, Montiel-Overall (2009, 2010) addressed cultural competency within the
LIS profession. After an exhaustive compilation of the literature outside the field, she presented a
cultural competency model for LIS professionals who show the need for personal development
in three areas: cognitive, interpersonal, and environmental to truly achieve cultural competence.
28

To achieve cognitive cultural competence an individual must show signs of “cultural selfawareness, cultural self-examination, ability to identify underlying cultural assumptions, cultural
knowledge, shared cultural knowledge, insights into cultural differences, and sensitivity to
cultural differences” (Overall, 2009, p. 191). When interacting with others, an individual they
must show signs of cultural appreciation, emotional connections, (an) ethic of caring, authentic
caring, (a) desire to know others' culture, (engaging in) personal and cultural interaction,
communication, participation with culture groups through community based learning (i.e. service
learning).
Finally, an individual must experience and understand a culture's setting, resources/assets
(e.g. language), transportation, home mobility, sense of security, family housing and conditions
(e.g. occupancy, lighting, noise, comfort). The interaction of these three areas, she posited, is
what makes for a fully competent LIS professional. She further argued that “greater
understanding of cultural issues will result in increased library use” (Overall, 2009, p. 176).
Library Cultural Competency
When examining the gap in the literature, Plater (2004) identified three potential areas for
further development: cognitive and intellectual learning, skills acquisition and development, and
identity development. These areas, when looking at in the LIS field, are the framework for a net
concept, library cultural competency. The concept of library cultural competency makes its debut
in this dissertation. A working definition for library cultural competency is achieving a global
perspective towards librarianship while learning the proficiencies necessary to be a professional
librarian. This definition suggests that library culture can also be learned through cultural
competency. Library cultural competency is more than understanding our professional tenets or
having enough language familiarity to interact with diverse populations. As Mestre’s (2010)

29

study from earlier points out, it affects all aspects of being a librarian, including providing
service to diverse populations, maintaining a cultural and language awareness and sensitivity
internally and externally, and an understanding how culture affects library use. Being culturally
competent within the library profession starts with interacting with patrons but is so much more.
It goes beyond being culturally sensitive and aware. It is about truly integrating the worldview of
others into all aspects of the profession. Within the Public Affairs discipline, a case has been
made for international experiences, even short-term ones, to fully prepare students for the
complexities of facing a career engaged in culturally diverse settings. Ryan (2010) uncovered the
need for face-to-face experiences, despite multicultural and internationally aware courses already
in the LIS curriculum, to challenge U.S. educated students to re-examine their own culture and
cultural norms. It is not until she is out of the country that Ryan claimed, “a student realizes that
his or her home culture is not neutral or universal [and] alternative forms of organizing,
managing, and mediating conflict become rational options, and colleagues with different
perspectives become more important sources of information” (p. 310).
Socialization, indoctrination, and acculturation of librarians typically occur once they
have graduated their LIS program. There are many avenues after library school for professionals
to learn the professional tenets of the field These include participation in New Member’s
Roundtables within state and national associations, participation in the ALA’s Emergent Leaders
program, webinars dealing with challenging patrons and other topics, on-the-job multicultural
training for working with diverse populations. However, even if a recent graduate availed him or
herself of all these opportunities, there remains a hole in their knowledge; namely, global library
culture.

30

As mentioned in the first chapter, U.S. libraries and their patron base are increasingly
heterogeneous. On a global scale, many concepts taught within the ALA-accredited curricula in
United States are not applicable. Libraries are organized differently in different countries. Closed
stacks are not an antiquated idea; rather, they are real and vibrant in many countries. The lending
library, although common to most K-12 students in the U.S., is unheard of in most of Eastern
Europe. Other countries have addressed library space needs in other exotic ways. The
Presidential Library of Russia in St. Petersburg is paperless. Its collection is electronic and the
physical structure allows patrons to read and browse books “through page and two-dimensional
view not to mention the chance to turn the pages. The technologies of three-dimensional
modeling make it possible to create the virtual book images that can be viewed at different
angles” (Yeltsin Presidential Library, 2015, About section, para. 15). As a result, librarians can
no longer assume that all patrons know how a US library works. Librarians cannot assume
patrons of any age know how items are organized or that directional signs will be understood.
The concept of professional library cultural competency in this study has been created to help
librarians understand and respond to those needs.
It is proposed in this study that through learning how other countries provide library
services that students can see beyond what they are taught in library school; they can begin to
think about creative ways to meet the needs of patrons; and it is through seeing how patrons in
other countries interact with the libraries in their home countries that librarians here can
understand the assumptions and needs of our growing diverse patron base.
Previous Studies on this Program
Finally, two studies were conducted on the particular program that serves as the setting
addressed in the next chapter. In 2010, a study examining the effects of cultural competency, as

31

described in Overall’s model previously, on LIS graduate students engaged in an international
service learning experience was conducted (Walczyk & Schultz-Jones, 2010). Results of that
study found that although some increase in cultural competency was achieved in the
interpersonal area, students exhibited a strong sense of library cultural competency. Through
working with an international school library in Kyiv, Ukraine, these students developed not only
a holistic set of professional skills, but also a new appreciation of libraries and library culture. In
2012, Baron and Schultz-Jones conducted a constructivist mixed-methods study, one that looks
at knowledge and meaning creation through experiences (Piaget, 1967), on a group of students
that went to Russia. They reported on student perspectives of the international service learning
environment from ten dimensions: reflection, faculty support, involvement, investigation, task
orientation, cooperation, equity, satisfaction, friction, and cohesion (Baron & Schultz-Jones,
2012, p. 11).
Reflection, faculty support, and friction were statistically significant for this student
population: “Reflection (t-stat = 2.22, t-crit 2.10, α = 0.05), Faculty Support (t-stat = -4.23, t-crit
2.10, α =0.05), and Friction (t-stat = 3.02, t-crit 2.10, α = 0.05)” (p. 11). Interestingly, none of
these dimensions were present as themes in the 2010 study and present an opportunity for
learning more about what transpired on the 2012 experience. They suggest that qualitative data
“may provide researchers with broader perspectives not captured through the relatively limited
responses offered by survey instruments” (p. 12). Using international service learning has the
potential to view librarianship from a holistic point of view and understand exactly what students
do experience in the development of library cultural competency.

32

Chapter Conclusion
Library cultural competency is a nascent concept. The literature suggests that
international service learning in other fields can provide access to cultural awareness, selfawareness, professional skills, and an appreciation for one’s own place in the world. Perhaps by
challenging library and information science students to experience their profession from within
an international context, they too can experience these growth opportunities. In an effort to
provide a deeper understanding of such an experience from the perspective of the participants, a
qualitative methodology is outlined in the next chapter. The variances in the experiences students
reported provide an opportunity to look beyond the objective viewpoint of quantitative analysis
and address the students in a communicative manner. The methodology provided in the next
chapter, as well as the remainder of this dissertation, examines at the value or benefit
experienced by these students from their own eyes. By engaging the students in conversation
through qualitative research, one can hope to understand the essence of their experience.

CHAPTER 
METHODS
Conversation is an interaction between a researcher and her subject, with a purpose
mutual understanding. Understanding is the result of examining the gap between a two
individual’s worldviews, which allows for reassessing and/or adjusting one’s original view. We
can only truly understand through the lens of our life’s experiences, what Husserl called the
lebenswelt, or lifeworld (Habermas, 1987). The lifeworld is the space in which humans have
immediate experience. It is constituted by the physical and mental space surroundings that
encompass a communicative act; it can also be a moment of interchange between two actors.
During such an interchange, Gadamer (2004/1960) asserted, we cannot separate our own
experiences, biases and prejudices from the development of understanding. Rather, humans
understand another person through these internalized experiences, biases, prejudices otherwise
known as cultural norms in the process of interpretation. Understanding includes perceiving the
reasons why something is done or said and the two are comprehended simultaneously
(Habermas, 1981).
The Theory and Process of Hermeneutics
Hermeneutics are a qualitative method of understanding the embedded meaning within a
body of text (or conversation). “Interpretation is hermeneutic” (Carspecken, 1996, p. 102) and is
central to the research endeavor undertaken in this study. Information or data interpretation of
comes from reassembling the meaning of a communicative act by piecing together semantic,
syntax, tone of voice, gestures, and body language to form an idea. This reassembling, also
known as meaning reconstruction (Carspecken, 1996), is a by-product of the hermeneutic circle,
a concept originally expressed by Gadamer (1976). The hermeneutic circle, made more

34

accessible by Carspecken (1996), is the process of developing an impression of meaning from an
act using one’s cultural understandings/norms; then, comparing this initial meaning explicitly to
one’s delineated norms. If a difference exists, we look for evidence to view the act as part of a
separate set of norms held by the actor/participant and then integrate this new meaning into how
an actor can be understood.
The new understanding produced through this process is then used to adjust one’s own
understanding of cultural norms. Caputo (1987) framed it this way,
If intentional acts and their correlative objects are not isolable, atomic data, that is
because they are always bound about by what Husserl calls a ‘horizon structure.’ The
perceptual object, indeed the intentional object generally, is bound about by a ring of
horizons which provides it with an inherently contextual meaning (p. 40).
Every meeting of one’s cultural norms while trying to understand another’s actions that provides
a meaning horizon. It is this meeting, negotiation of meaning, and consent of validity by the two
actors that leads to Gadamer’s “fusion of horizons,” which for him, was the ultimate process for
developing understanding.
LIS and Hermeneutic Research
As a research method, the hermeneutic process is an attempt to make sense of the world
and to generate meaning from it. To approach the research within from a hermeneutical
framework is a large departure from existing research within the field of library and information
science (LIS). Until Benediktsson (1989) provided a foundational review of hermeneutics and its
ability to serve as a qualitative paradigm for LIS research, hermeneutics, as a philosophy and a
methodology, were not considered in LIS. This seminal work within the field provided an
examination of how the different schools of hermeneutical thought: hermeneutical theory,
hermeneutical philosophy, critical hermeneutics, and phenomenological hermeneutics could
influence LIS research. Since the publication of this article, only 1% of the 7,197 LIS

35

dissertations published have incorporated any mention of hermeneutics, making this an underutilized lens for research in the field.
During the hermeneutic process, the researcher places herself within the imagined
lifeworld of another, becoming a virtual participant in his situation, in order to develop multiple
possible meanings for a communication or action. Understanding the intended meaning takes
place naturally or holistically. Intuitively, we select among them and respond from them. This
selection process is presented through language. Hermeneutics looks at the language selected to
derived the “best” meaning. Within this study, hermeneutic interpretation is presented through a
critical lens.
One means to critically analyze language is the pragmatic horizon analysis, a tool of
critical ethnography (Carspecken, 1996). It provides a process to examine perceived meanings,
set against the background from which originally expressed the ideas expressed originally
emerged; namely, that of the study participants. Phillips and Brown (1993) articulated their use
of a horizon analysis to show the underlying perceptions of a company by looking at the text of
its marketing campaign materials. The current study looked at the perceptions of an international
service learning experience in library and information science by looking at the text of its
participants’ communications and reflections. The primary document, a thick record containing
multiple forms of collected data from the lived experiences of the participants (Thompson,
2001), was examined for this study. It is a collection of transcribed post-experience interviews
conducted with participants in a 2012 ISL experience at the Anglo-American Schools’ libraries
in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Each participant provided a 45 to 60-minute interview with the
researcher taking place two months after returning from the event. These interviews were
conducted in person and on the telephone. Each interview was digitally recorded and then

36

transcribed word for word. The primary document was situated within its own horizon through a
presentation of its supporting documents including pre-experience expectation surveys,
transcriptions of orientation online chats, and reflection documents, including assigned thought
challenge questions and photo journals which participants completed during the event. The
eleven challenge questions (Appendix D) were posed to the students at different points in their
three-week stay to encourage reflection on particular moments.
Research Methods
The literature reviewed here indicated that international service learning experiences are
correlated with positive impacts on lives of participants. However, each individual experience
creates a unique set of outcomes and these outcomes are typically presented in using qualitative
research outcomes. Such qualitative analysis, as described by Creswell (2013), is typically
conducted in a natural setting, employs the research as its key instrument of analysis, allows for
multiple sources of data to be reviewed, uses inductive reasoning in building a case and
deductive reasoning to arrive at final conclusions and is focused on providing a meaning of
participants’ experience (pp. 185-186). Also, qualitative methods are specifically useful for
“discovery-oriented analysis of verbal text” (Rennie, 2012, p. 385), such as proposed in this
study. This study aimed interpret and explain the lived experiences of students and understand
the value graduate LIS students feel they received from participating in an international service
learning (ISL) experience in an international school library.
Critical Hermeneutics
This method (Roberge, 2011) was used to gain an understanding of the participants’
perceived value of this specific experience. According to Gadamer (1960/2004, 1976) and
Ricoeur (1981), hermeneutics premises that texts are ambiguous and it is only when they are

37

interpreted within their appropriate context that they have meaning and can thus provide us an
understanding of what was originally intended. Critical hermeneutics aims to “marr[y] the focus
of understanding in context with critical ideology” (Willis, 2007, p. 302). Faye explained that
critical ideology exhibits a “perspective concerned with empowering human beings to transcend
the constraints place on them by race, class, or gender” (as cited in Creswell, 2013, p.65). By
employing a critical ideology, this study sought to address the cultural, power, and economic
conditions that affected how value was constructed through an international service learning
experience to Russian school libraries.
Program
This study was set within an ongoing program to provide LIS graduate students
experience within an international school library. Although some similarities exist from year to
year, each year is unique in the planning necessary to provide for a quality experience. Through
contacts made in previous years, the professor was invited to bring the 2012 participants in the
program to work on a project in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia. The experience was timed
in late May so that students would be able to interact with the library patrons and staff during the
school year. Preparation for the project began in June/July 2011 and the completed in July 2012.
Academics
The project was conducted within the construct of two graduate level courses within the
Library and Information Sciences Department at the University of North Texas. The first class, a
seminar on providing services to special population, required participating in online discussions
prior to the international component, reading select materials to become familiar with
multicultural concepts and international school libraries, and interacting with the host school’s
library team to see how service delivery was implemented in an international school context. The

38

second class was a study in managing library automation projects. Students discussed
“appropriate options and assist(ed) with an automation system for each school library. The
project involve(d) organizing the school library, completing the migration of all bibliographic
records and patron information, adding new resources to the OPAC, and providing training to the
school librarian and teachers” (SLIS5750 Syllabus, “Project Overview”). The program had two
parts: an online course instance and a three-week in-country service learning experience which
provided the experiential opportunity. Online chats were conducted before the in-country
experience to provide an orientation and introduction to the program, course expectations, and
the host library. Both classes culminated in students writing a final paper outlining their
experience.

Program Timeline
There are three facets to the program, pre-experience, in country, and post-experience.
Most of the pre-experience activities were completed by the main professor as seen in Table Y
above. The professor had secured lodging for the group in Moscow at the Aerostar Hotel, a
business traveler hotel in the convention center district, and at the Nevsky Breeze in St.
Petersburg, a small tourist boutique hotel near the cultural center. Students were paired by age
for roommate assignments and by experience for their work assignments. Participant involved
began with the four online chats conducted in late March, April, and just weeks before departure.
While in-country, participants were observed in multiple locations (Table 4) including the
Anglo-American School (AAS) in Moscow especially the libraries, various cultural and tourist
outings in Moscow, the Anglo-American School (AAS) in St. Petersburg especially the libraries,
and various cultural and tourist outings in St. Petersburg. AAS Moscow was a large K-12
International School. AAS St. Petersburg was a medium-sized K-12 International School. Both
provided English-language IB-focused education. “AAS receives substantial support from the
three founding embassies [American, British, and Canadian] and maintains its essential character
as a non-profit educational institution serving the expatriate diplomatic and business
communities in Moscow and St. Petersburg” (AAS Strategic Plan, 2010, p. 4). Each of these
schools maintained an active library where the students studied and worked. The libraries at
AAS Moscow and St. Petersburg housed “approximately 70,000 items, including books,
magazines, newspapers, audiobooks, CDs, DVDs, and e-books” at the time of this study.
Together they “offer(ed) one of the largest English-language collections in Russia” (AAS, para.
1).

Student Participants, Researcher

Each weekday for the first two weeks participants were bused to the Anglo-American
School (AAS) in Moscow. The libraries were located on the fourth floor and participants were
housed in a large classroom located between the two libraries. Each morning, upon settling in,
the professor conducted a session on the day’s topic and agenda. After which, participants would
break into their assigned work groups. Initially the group was told that five groups would be
required for the project: space planning, cataloging, classroom collections, IT, and policy. As
with all prior programs the scope evolved during the project when face to face meetings between
the professor and host librarians. Depending on an individual’s assignment, she may spend the
day in one of the two libraries or in the classroom. Lunch was provided by AAS Moscow. Their
hospitality grew to included snacks, generous amounts of bottled water, and even the use of their
laundry machines. Near the end of the day the professor would reconvene the group to conduct a
daily wrap-up. Unexpected, the first day, the host librarians announced that he had arranged for
school faculty to chaperon evening events for the group. So after a bus ride back to the hotel and
eating, participants went to the street market, a chamber music concert, a river cruise, a visit to
Moscow University, and a special invitation to the National Public Library for Science and
Technology. On off nights, some participants explored Red Square, the local neighborhood, or
made their way to the grocery. Others spent their time in the hotel talking and using the internet

44

access. Initially the outings seemed mandatory but as the time progressed more participants
started staying at the hotel. The first weekend the group explored the city together and visited the
Church of Our Savior, a famous Russian orthodox “cathedral”, and the Pushkin Museum. The
second weekend the group took in Red Square, including St. Basil’s Basilica and Lenin’s Tomb,
and the Kremlin complex, including several churches and the Armory, home of the state jewels
and Faberge eggs. Additionally they experienced shopping at the open air flea market.
As a result of their visit to the SciTech Library, the group was invited to Google Moscow
for a cultural exchange with the Russian School Library Association (RUSLA). On their last day
in Moscow, the group toured the Google Moscow site and attended several presentations given
by both program staff and Russian librarians. Their time in Moscow concluded with a group
dinner at a Georgian restaurant to provide a taste of authentic Russian culture.
During the two weeks in Moscow, continual adjustments were made to the plan for St.
Petersburg. Before leaving the U.S., the expectation was a site visit with portions of the group
visiting on different days to help evaluate their situation. This plan remained in flux as
participants made their way to St. Petersburg. Participants were up early the morning after the
Georgian restaurant to make their way to the train station. The group took the high speed rail to
St. Petersburg. Upon arriving, they made their way to a tour bus which took them to the Nevsky
Breeze hotel. Participants spent the afternoon on their own while the leadership visited the AAS
St. Petersburg to nail down the plan for the week.
On their first full day in St. Petersburg, participants attended another cultural exchange
with RUSLA, this time at the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library. Participants were treated to a
grand tour of the facility and presentations by Russian librarians. The group then proceeded to
AAS St. Petersburg on foot and enjoyed lunch upon arrival. Program leadership met with the

45

local administration to learn the final plan for their visit. The entire group spent the afternoon in
an assembly line of cataloging and organizing the collection. This change of plan surprised
everyone including the professor who attempted to balance the host library’s needs and requests
with the expectations previously established with the group.
The remaining two days in St. Petersburg were spent in tourist endeavors. Day one the
entire group met at the Hermitage Museum to collect their two day passes. After which the group
dispersed. Some spend many hours in the museum. Others visited St. Isaac’s Cathedral and
Colonnade, the Peter and Paul Fortress, the Church of Our Savior of Spilled Blood, the markets,
the Vodka Museum, and walked the river area. The final evening of the program, the group had a
closing dinner. The next morning the group left for the airport and travelled home. In the
following four weeks each submitted their challenge questions, their photo journals, and their
final paper online. As for the professor, work had already begun on the following year’s
program, as the AAS libraries had proposed another group returning to implement some of the
suggestions made by the 2012 cohort.
Population
This study employed a convenience sample of the students participating in the Study
Abroad Program to Russia in the spring of 2012. Participants self-selected the experience based
on their interest in travelling to Russia, in learning about the field of librarianship, needing a
summer class, and wanting to learn about library automation and/or services to special
populations. No external demographic or other experience prerequisites were imposed on
participants. The final population (n=19) studied was the students who successfully completed
all portions of the study: initial survey and follow-up interviews. Participant demographics for

46

this study were seventeen (17) female vs. two (2) male, age range from 18 to 50+, sixteen (16)
were graduate students, two (2) were undergraduate students, and one was an active professional.
Data Sources, Collection, and Analysis
Multiple documents were compiled to create a thick record of the experience. This thick
record, developed in the spirit of thick description as presented by Thompson (2001), served as
the central context for coming to understand the dense collection of data. According to Denzin,
thick description has four characteristics: (1) It gives the context of an act; (2) it states the
intentions and meaning that organize the action; (3) it traces the evolution and development of
the act; (4) it presents the action as a text that can then be interpreted” (as cited in Thompson,
2001, p. 66). The main text consisted of post-experience interviews (Appendix E) of 45 minutes
to an hour each. The interviews allowed a first-hand account of the participants lived experiences
(McCracken, 1998; Fontana & Frey, 1998; Strauss & Corbin, 1990; Bates, 2004) while it was
fresh in their minds. The supplementary texts include pre-experience surveys (Appendix C), to
gauge their ideas of librarianship and their concerns, expectations, and thoughts about visiting
Russia before engaging; participant-observer notes (Kawulich, 2005) (Appendix G), to provide a
memory of the daily events and the researchers mind frame; thoughts from the faculty member
in charge (Appendix F), to provide access to the main professors mindset; challenge questions
(Appendix D), completed by the participants in-country as a means of reflecting on their
experience real-time; and the syllabi (Appendix A), for course context.
A thirty question survey addressed students’ prior travel experience, prior library
experience, expectations of libraries in Russia, expectations of visiting Russia, and basic
demographics and was administered to the group prior to their first day at the AAS library.
During their trip and the remainder of their ten-week course, students were asked specific

47

challenge questions to capture their real-time experiences. A month after returning from Russia,
students were interviewed. Phone and/or in-person semi-structured interviews were conducted.
Semi-structured interviews, “allow(ed) the investigator to probe, to clarify, and to create new
questions based on what has already been heard” (Westbrook, 1994, p. 244) and allowed for the
capturing of additional commentary. Similar initial survey and the final interview protocols were
used to explore cultural competency in a 2010 ISL experience to Kyiv. Adjustments were made
to the original instruments merely to focus on the study’s location of Russia.
Nvivo™ was used for the coding and the subsequent queries. Transcripts were uploaded
to Nvivo™ to begin the qualitative analysis. , created an attribute sheet as data SRLQWVIRU
analysis. Originating from the pre-experience survey, the set established seven SRWHQWLDO
independent variables: age group, point in program, time in profession, time spent RXWVLGH
the US, type of LIS work experience, having worked with people from another country, DQG
area of specialty. All of the attributes were multimodal making them viable variables, except
Drea of Vpecialty which broke down into eight possible groupings spreading the data too thin
and was thereby discarded. A series of queries were built to examine participants by themes,
participants by codes, each attribute by themes, and each attribute by codes. Query results were
exported to Microsoft Excel ™ for analysis. Spreadsheets depicting means for each attribute
(independent variable) and theme (dependent variable) pair, each attribute/code pair, and “Top
five” pie charts for each provided an initial view of the data.
Structure of the Analysis
Within critical hermeneutics, an interpretation of the text is created to derive a truer
understanding of some phenomenon (Baranov, 2012; Roberge, 2011). The phenomenon studied
here is value. Value, what one sees as “good, bad, right or wrong” (Carspecken, 1996, p. 76), is

48

variable. What is valuable to one is not necessarily to another. Value according to Galileo was
described as, “you cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to discover it in himself.”
The aim of this study was to understand the recurrent themes of discovery experienced by the
group. In previous studies on service learning (local and international), many different
discoveries have been presented. An exemplary list is provided here (Table 5) and categorized
into four groups: internal factors, factors involving others, professional factors, and cultural
factors.

In this study, all discovered phenomenon were examined as containing value, despite the
individual participants’ judgments as to the positive or negative natures of these discoveries.
Horizon Analysis
Phillips and Nelson (1993) outlined a critical hermeneutical approach, known as a
horizon analysis, which will be adapted for this study. A horizon analysis examines a text using
three dimensions, the temporal axis, the paradigmatic axis, and validity claims. According to
Carspecken (1996), the temporal axis allows the researcher to place the text within the prior
experiences of the participants and their shared expectations of future ones (p. 106); the
paradigmatic axis looks at the “similarities, complementaries, contrast, opposition, hierarchical
inclusion, and inference” of acts (p. 106); and validity claims are subjective, objective, and
normative-evaluative statements which can be analyzed by their type and whether they are
emphasized or de-emphasized in importance (p. 110). Phillips and Brown (1993) used horizon
analysis to develop an understanding of organizational culture through the examination of a
company’s ad campaign. They were able to interpret perceived communication of organizational
values through three phases: the social-historical moment (contextualization), the formal moment
(traditional data analysis), and the interpretive-re-interpretive moment (understanding). These
three phases provided the structure for the data analysis in this study.
50

The Socio-historical Moment
The socio-historical moment, presented later in Phase , was an attempt to place the
participants to be interviewed within their own particular social-historical context. This allowed
an examination of what biases, prejudices, pre-understandings, worldviews, and experiences the
text was created amidst. Its primary purpose in this study was to specifically identify the
demographic make-up, prior international experiences and expectations for all involved in the
program. The social-historical moment incorporated three aspects of the study: intentional,
referential, and contextual.
The Intentional and Referential Aspects
This is part of the temporal axis, was the view of what the participants were expecting to
bring to and gain from the experience. The expectations were found in the pre-experience
surveys and reflective pieces written by the participants during their experience. Additionally, it
showed the overall intention of the experience itself from the perspective of the professor
involved taken from a transcript of a conversation and through transcribed recordings of the
orientation chats held prior to departure. The referential aspect dictated that all pre-experience
information was reviewed to look for participants’ implied worldview. , looked to H[SODLQZKDW
the world of the participants looked like, culturally and professionally, before they HPEDUNHG
upon the adventure.
The Contextual Aspect
This was created from the physical and social perspectives. The physical perspective, the
scene of the ISL experience, was constructed from the ISL course descriptions (Appendix D), the
recruitment flyer (Appendix D), information on the host location’s website, and P\RZQpersonal
reflections (Appendix F). The social aspect addressed all resources available

51

to the participants, in preparation and during the experience. Resources in this context included
all tangible as well as informational items such as orientation chat sessions and suggested course
readings, available to the participants that could affect their ability to be interviewed. The social
aspect also included all resources which affected the researcher’s ability to receive the text, such
as the researcher’s role during the experience and any prior personal knowledge of ISL
experience participation (Appendix F). As a result of looking at these different dimensions, this
first horizon analysis presents a case study of the participants and their expectations, the
experience’s landscape including the professor’s expectations (Appendix E), and the researcher’s
viewpoint on this specific ISL experience.
The Formal Moment
The second moment or presented in Phase ’s summary and coding sections and
encompassed the paradigmatic axis, is the one most familiar to most readers. In critical
hermeneutics, the formal moment can include any formal method of analysis (Phillips & Brown,
1993). The key is that it be an appropriate method for the text to be considered. Having a
collection of interviews as the main text, the formal method used was the constant-comparative
method (Glaser, 1965; Dye, Schatz, Rosenberg, & Coleman, 2000; Westbrook, 1994). Generally,
this method entails a sort of pattern analysis of the interviews through identifying common
concepts known as coding (Moustakas, 1994; Patton, 2002; Fereday & Muir-Cochrane, 2006),
creating a consistent list, and then looking at all documents to apply this list.
Coding
Coding is part of the formal moment. Tesch (as cited in Creswell 2013) provided a
detailed process for coding that was adapted for this study:

Reliability and validity of codes. Since, constant-comparative method was designed “to
guarantee that two analysts working independently with the same data will achieve the same
results,” it also required a degree of validity and reliability. This validity in coding, accuracy in
the selection of codes (Creswell, 2013), was addressed through triangulation. Triangulation is the
process of looking for these topics within secondary and related sources for confirmation of their
existence (Creswell, 1998; 2013; Maxwell, 1998). Reliability, the ability to show consistency
(Creswell, 2013), of the coding was addressed through inter-coder agreement. This inter-coder
agreement was achieved in this study by having two, separate researchers code the postexperience interviews and a third validated their process through a review of their findings.
Additionally, once the final themes were determined, the third party reviewed them for logic and
consistency. These resulting themes served as the basis for the last piece of the methodological
process, the interpretation/reinterpretation moment. To judge the similarity of the two coders
derived codes and themes, , used the Landis and Koch’s (1977) scale of for LQWHUSUHWLQJ
Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (Figure 4). The two observers exhibited a .93 level of UHOLDELOLW\
of at least slight agreement. This allowed the research to feel confident that the FRGHERRN
was valid.

The Interpretative/Re-interpretative Moment
Phase , the interpretative/re-interpretative moment, is presented in Fhapter 4. The
overarching goal of this moment was one of construction. Critical hermeneutics follows in the
footsteps of other qualitative methods as it “always proceeds in uncertainty” (Phillips & Brown,
1993). This uncertainty exists because there is no beginning problem and thus no problem to be
solved. This moment is
an ongoing process of interpretation. Ideas and understandings develop at various points
in the process and are then tested and shaped as the two moments of analysis proceed.
The final synthesis is therefore not a result of the application of a certain set of steps, but
rather the product of an intelligent researcher's working within the framework of his or
her interests and skills. The value of the synthesis produced is therefore primarily
determined by the creativity and skill of the individual researcher, not by the correct
application of a particular method. The researcher must develop an interpretation of the
text and its role in the context of the organization and justify this interpretation using the
results of the previous two moments. (Phillips & Brown, 1993)
As explained by Phillips and Brown (1993), the interpreter herself functioned as the instrument
in this moment and derived several validity claims. Each of these validity claims provided a new
avenue of analysis (Carspecken, 1996, p. 113). The interpreter used these claims to view and

56

provide commentary on themes that arose as well as those that might have but did not. Individual
portions of the text are re-examined for specific examples of value or benefit. These examples
are added to the collection of themes to provide a collective understanding of the ISL experience
that appears in the final chapter.
The remainder of this dissertation describes the story of the 2012 International Service
Learning experience as reported by its participants. It provides an understanding of the event
itself, the experience of the participants and a delineation of all discoveries encountered and
derived value. As put forth by Petruzzi (2008), "we are not ‘measuring’ writing as scientists;
rather, we are humanists analyzing the thinking and reasoning – equally hermeneutic and
rhetorical performances – of other human beings" (p. 239). The study concludes with a statement
of the understanding , achieved through the process including those areas remaining WRVWLOOEH
understood. Such an understanding of U.S. LIS students as they explore international
librarianship in Russia is the purpose of employing critical hermeneutics.

CHAPTER 
DATA ANALYSIS/FINDINGS
Phase 1: Initial Worldview
Setting the Socio-historical Context - A Little US - Russian History
At the end of World War II, the world was polarized between beliefs and the
governmental and economic systems of the USSR (Soviet Russia) and the US. These two
countries invested substantial resources to spreading their ideological, political, and economic
views around the globe. Communism, to the Americans then, was seen as bleak and oppressive
with little art or creativity, and certainly no religion.
During this time period, many American people lived in fear of subversion by
communists or nuclear war with the Russians. Both countries started stock piling nuclear
weapons to guard themselves against the other. At the same time, nuclear fall-out shelters were
dug. Children were taught what to do in case of an attack – bomb drills were as common as
today’s fire drills. The media (TV, films, books) and the music industry even focused on this
(Ford Library, n.d., America’s Cold War Culture section). The US news showed tanks and
military parades in Red Square.
However, life changed at the end of the 1980s when the Berlin Wall fell and in 1991
when a freely elected president came to power in the USSR (today’s Russia). For the older
participants, they grew up with the collective memory of the Cold War era which saw today’s
Russia as the USSR, a highly militarized state which was ominous, out to destroy freedom’s they
held dear and a country to be feared. At the time of this study, the participants under the age of
30 had never lived in this world, they may have had preconceived ideas of Russia.

58

Socio-historical Context of the Study
The initial worldview was constructed through a compositing of the participants, the
instructor, and the researcher’s environments. The instructor was informally interviewed after the
experience. Questions encompassed her thoughts going into the project and those following.
Comments in Appendix F illustrate the instructor’s expectations and worldviews of conducting
this program. An overview of the researcher’s expectations and worldview is also available in
Appendix G. However, the focus of locus throughout this dissertation was the participants’
environment. Participants’ worldview was influenced by a number of factors including, but not
limited to the marketing materials in Appendix A, were provided to students to interest them in
signing up for the program and their existing knowledge of Russia and libraries. Additionally, all
of the participants were given the opportunity to attend four different online sessions (detailed
accounts available in Appendix B) prior to the trip during which information necessary for
planning, safety, and expectations setting were provided. One such session also included the host
librarian from the AAS Moscow library to address specific concerns and detailed logistics. To
summarize these sessions, students were given an itinerary, discussed travel logistics, and
provided with some basic background on the two schools they would be engaged. Roommate
assignments, proper methods for conducting one’s self while representing the university, and the
rule of three (three people at all times out in public so that one may go for help and the injured
party would have someone to keep them company) were made clear. Finally, general travel,
packing, and money tips were also provided.
Participants
These were selected using a convenience method. All of the participants in the cohort
going on the experience (n=19). Their level of participation varied as only some completed all

59

data points, including the pre-experience survey, in-situ challenge questions, post-experience
interview, and final paper reviewing the experience. Before the students began their international
service experience, each was asked to complete the aforementioned pre-experience survey. This
survey was designed to build a profile of each participant and to establish their initial worldview,
focusing on thoughts of going to Russia, libraries in general, and the library at the host
international school. Participant profiles and their expectations provided throughout the
remainder of this section.
Tammy is an over 40-year-old female. She had lived in Florida, Europe, Alaska, and
Texas and was completing her first year in the LIS program with an area specialization of school
libraries. She came to the program with no prior professional LIS experience but had spent 30
years in schools as a teacher and interacting with school and academic libraries. Not only had she
had traveled internationally before to Mexico, St. Kitts, England, Germany, and 16 countries in
Europe, but also she had lived in both England and Germany. She did have prior experience
working with people from other countries but not in a library or reference setting. This
experience was her first professional international trip. Her biggest hope for visiting Russia was
to buy a balalaika (a Russian string instrument) for her daughter. Professionally, she expected to
gain a better understanding of the library profession. Personally, she hoped to learn more about
another culture.
Cindy was a female in her 20s originally from Pakistan. At the time of the experience,
she was in her last semester of the program, needing only two classes to graduate with a
specialization in Health Informatics. Her background was as an anthropology undergraduate who
had worked internal sales at a publishing company. Although she had no prior professional LIS
experience, she had held an internship at a Children’s Medical Center library. Her prior travel

60

experience included living in London and Pakistan. She had not spent time at a reference desk
with international patrons but had worked with patient family from different countries during her
internship. This trip to Russia was her first professional experience internationally. When asked,
she expressed concerns for being able to afford the trip as well as being anxious about a huge
language barrier since she did not know Russian. Personally, she expected to see many sights,
make new friends, and have an incredible experience. Professionally, she hoped to gain some
work experience to add to her resume and hopefully end up with a job as a result.
Jane, a 20 something female from Texas focusing on cataloging and metadata, was in her
last semester of the program. She had been a volunteer and participated in library internships at a
special library and in a public school. Jane had been involved with libraries for over eight years.
Her international travel experience consisted of a trip to Ireland and she had not worked with
anyone from another country either as a co-worker or as a patron. She did not express any
concerns or explicit hopes in visiting Russia. As for the service learning experience, Jane
expected to gain an understanding of automation systems and different aspects of librarianship,
internationally, culturally, and professionally. She did expect to broaden her horizons culturally
and find a willingness to be open-minded about different cultures.
Jill, one of youngest in the cohort, was in her very first semester of the program, having
just graduated with her Bachelors. She had spent six years volunteering at her local library in the
children’s department before starting the program. Her work experience did not engage her with
international patrons. Jill’s travel experience extended as far as a trip to France. On this, her first
professional international experience, she expressed a number of concerns and hopes for visiting
Russia. She was worried about not understanding the language and coping with the unknown.
She was excited about the experience, the work, and the opportunity to see a new country. Her

61

goals for the experience personally was coming to understand a new culture and professionally
was gaining valuable skills for future professional work and opportunities for scholarships.
Ann was the youngest of the group and an undergraduate from Texas. Her interest in
libraries had come from being a school library volunteer. Thus far, she had traveled to Mexico
and had no other experience interacting with people from other countries. She was forthcoming
with her hopes and fears for the upcoming travel to Russia. She was worried about getting lost.
Her main hope was to gain some experience in a real library and learn about librarianship outside
the Anglo-American centric system. Her expectations were to expand beyond her current cultural
viewpoint both professionally and personally.
Troy, one of the only two men in the cohort, was over 40 and considered Texas his
current home. His first area of expertise was in the law. His main exposure to the library
profession came from the program. During the course of his program, of which he was in his last
semester, he gained experience in archives and museums. His experience interacting with people
from other countries was through his travels to Venice, Poland, and Berlin. His main concern for
visiting Russia was being careful and return without incident. “When I learned (the trip) was
Russia, I paused for a while, to think do I really want to do this. Because of the distance, and I
just didn’t…it had no particular allure to me.” Despite this hesitation, he expected that the
experience would provide an opportunity to see and do new things as well as provide a
professional avenue to gain hands-on experience organizing a library.
Carrie had completed the LIS program within the past year and was a full-time
children’s librarian at a public library. In her 30s, Carrie had been in the profession seven years
working directly with youth services. In this position, she had worked with many new
immigrants from China, Vietnam, India, and Mexico. Her own travels had taken her to Germany,

62

France, Mexico, Austria, Venice, and Peru. In Peru, she had been part of a previous year’s
experience of international service learning. For this trip, she had a few concerns: contracting
food poisoning, adjusting to the cultural difference, and having no understanding of the
language. She had several expectations for expanding herself – gain a well-rounded view of the
world and its inhabitants, explore Russian Art & Architecture, develop some understanding of
the Cyrillic alphabet, make friends, and have a break from work. Professionally, she was
interested in experiencing another library and developing a group of professional contacts.
Our second male in the cohort was Glen. Glen, a Texan in his 30s, was a fresh graduate
of the LIS program and a beginning PhD student. His main areas of interest were space
planning, policy, and social network analysis. Although his professional experience was in retail,
he had familiarity with school and public libraries through his coursework. His travel
experiences included Costa Rica, Canada, Venice, the Ukraine, and Peru. He had worked with
international coworkers but also had been part of two previous international service learning
experiences in the Ukraine and Peru. He expected this experience to be similar culturally to the
Ukraine, but possibly different professionally due to the school’s affluence. Glen shared no
concerns and looked forward to additional exposure to the Eastern European culture.
Professionally, he hoped to expand his experience working with non-American schools and
educators while developing some skill in conducting surveys.
Meg was new to the program and librarianship. A woman over 40 living in Texas, she
came to this experience in her first year of the program and only just started volunteering in
libraries. Although unsure of her area of focus, she did express an interest in book processing.
Her prior travel experiences took her to the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Mexico. She had no
prior experience working with others or serving patrons from other countries. While she worried

63

about not being able to communicate with others due to her lack of Russian, she hoped to learn
about a new culture as well as gain library experience in an international setting.
The state of Montana was represented by Sherry, a woman over 40. Shelly was proud to
state she was in her last semester of the program and had focused generally as well as working
on her digital content management certificate. She was employed for the past six years as a
library assistant in a county city library with a previous background in social work. Her personal
travel experience is limited to the UK. However, as her library is near one of the National Parks,
she has interacted with international patrons regularly at the circulation desk. Similar to other
participants, Shelly expressed a concern for the language barrier. Personally, she was looking
forward to learning about the Russian people and culture while professionally developing a
deeper sense of cultural awareness.
Nancy, a female over 40, came to the experience from Wisconsin. She was in her final
semester of the program and had focused on special libraries. Nancy brought a wealth of
knowledge with her. Her prior work experience included working in a library at the Department
of Health, serving as a school librarian, and running her own bookstore. Her travel history
included Spain, Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Mexico. Although her library
experience did not include contact with people from other countries, she did work with tourists at
her bookstore. Although Nancy did not express any concerns for the experience, she did share
that she was expecting to experience a new culture and learn from other professionals in a new
library setting.
As a woman in her 30s, Lynn came to the experience with two semesters left in her
program. Prior to settling in Texas, she has also lived in California and Hawaii. She did not have
a specific area of concentration program but brought 10 years of experience as a Middle School

64

teacher to the group. She had travelled to Europe before this experience and had worked with
students from other countries as an ESL instructor. Lynn had some particular ideas about what
she would find in Russia. She believed that most would be poor, strict, and unfriendly. Her hopes
and expectations were as specific. Lynn hoped to gain more experience working with people
from another country and to make contacts leading to possible international employment.
Kim, a 20 something Texan, was within two semesters of graduating. Her general focus
was supported by four years of working in circulation at a public library. Her travel experiences
were notable including Norway, Abu Dhabi, Venezuela, and spending a semester in Ireland. Kim
not only worked with international coworkers, but also supported international patrons. She
shared that the hardest part of those experiences were in communicating library policies. Her
concerns for visiting Russia were twofold, having things stolen and not being able to
communicate. Kim provided detailed expectation for personal and professional growth. She
hoped to form social ties with fellow students, see how foreign libraries operate, sightsee, learn
what the school librarian felt about Russia, and gain library experience to add to her resume.
Julie was born in El Salvador. In her 20s, she was in her last semester of the program
with a focus of digital content management. She had spent five years working in public libraries.
Aside from the US, the other international country she had experienced was Mexico. Her stated
expectations were laconic, growth and enhancing her resume.
Laura was relatively new to the program. Just two semesters in, this 20 something was
pursuing a general knowledge path while working in circulation at a public library. Her main
international experience was a mission trip to Nicaragua where she interacted with many
internationals. This experience did not cause any concerns for her, but she had some

65

expectations. Laura was looking for a greater understanding of Russian culture and insight into
their information use while gaining practical experience setting up library automation systems.
Mary was an over 40 female participant from Idaho in her last semester. Her focus was
information science, as her background was information technology, systems administration, and
web design. This trip was her first off the continent having seen Mexico and Canada previously.
She interacted with international customer doing help desk support. She hoped for experience
and understanding of a different culture.
Perhaps our eldest participant, Helen was in her last semester of the program. Her first
career was in education. She taught special education, as well as Texas and American history to
middle school students. Her library experience extended to working in the school library during
summer school and participating in the Albania iteration of this experience. Helen was quite well
travelled having visited Italy, Switzerland, England, Albania, Canada, China, Mexico, and
Scandinavia. She had worked with people from other countries during the Albania trip, as well as
special education students from Mexico and Africa. Her expectations for this experience were to
see Russia and its people and gain work experience within a library setting.
As a female in her 30s, Angie came to the experience having never travelled outside the
U.S. previously. Participating in the program was her last semester required for her degree. Her
work experience focused on providing adult reference services as a library assistant for nine
years at a public library in south Texas. Her main hopes both personally and professionally were
to obtain a better job opportunity.
Denise, a female in her 20s, chose not to complete the initial survey. Thus, we do not
know her mindset prior to the experience.

66

Existing Beliefs about Libraries
The survey progressed into questions about libraries in general. The initial query was
regarding physical design of a library. Answers to this question were grouped into four different
common ideas: 1.) a welcoming and accepting atmosphere, 2.) being physically accommodating
both in ADA and material retrieval concerns, 3.) having been designed around the patron’s
needs, and 4.) specific suggestions for layout. Carrie provided this excellent reply encompassing
many of the layout suggestions provided by the rest of the group, saying that the
21st century library is less about book storage and more about (being a) community
center and technology; children's, teen, & adult areas (should be) physically separated;
room for adult and youth programming; Wi-Fi; plenty of study rooms; and room for
library employees to work with and way from the public.
Lynn’s response did not provide the same vision for libraries. A library should have “nice even
stacks of books and other items. Very little room for tables, except for computers. No space for
socializing.”
Perceptions of library standards. From a policy view, participants were asked to provide
their understanding of library standards. Participants expressed four main concepts. The first was
that libraries should follow standards set out by ALA in documents, such as the Bill of Rights
and the Code of Ethics while also implementing their own local standards. Second, they both
noted privacy and the freedom to pursue one’s own information needs are crucial. Third, they
believed that collections should be open access with all patrons being served equally. Lastly,
they expressed that librarians need to respect both personal professional and ethical standards.
Access, assistance, and the role of librarians. The topic of access to collections,
availability of librarian assistance, and typical librarian duties comprised the next three
questions. When sharing their thoughts on providing access to the collection both in person or
online, most expressed a requirement for easy and open access to materials remotely. Specific

67

ways of providing access to patrons were enumerated including e-books, audiobooks, online
catalog, databases, interlibrary loan service, chat reference services, and a bookmobile in rural
areas.
Regarding access to the librarian, participants said they expected a number of things from
librarians in Russia. Kim mentioned that in her experience sometimes people are intimidated by
the librarian, either through their demeanor or the physical arrangement of the desk they sit at.
Julie also felt that a librarian should be available all the hours the library is open, provide
assistance online as well as in-person, be willing to help all patrons and again, be approachable
without environmental barriers or demeanor issues. While maintaining this demeanor,
participants also expressed the duties a general librarian should perform. The duties with the
most consensus were reference, research, and patron assistance, and bibliographic instruction,
which included evaluation of information, technology usage, library usage, and library behavior.
Further, they stated that collection development, curriculum support is also within this purview,
encouraging literacy, technical services tasks and shelf management, programming, acquisitions,
community outreach, and professional development.
Expectations for library technology. Participants were asked about the technology which
should be available in any library and specifically about Internet connectivity. Participants
responded in two different ways to the question of what technology should be available in the
library. The first manner was to provide examples of items/services that should be available to
patrons. Items identified by more than one person were computers, fax machine, color scanners,
Internet access, disability access and equipment, and online databases. Other suggestions were
copiers, printers, business software (MS Office), webcams, graphic design software, CD/DVDs,
streaming music/video, video gaming, e-Readers/iPads, document cameras/Smart boards, and an

68

ILS. The second approach suggested by participants was to provide a more general statement for
determining the answer to the question, such as: “depends on the library,” “as needed to support
the curriculum,” “as much as possible”/feasible, “anything we can make available in the library
would be good,” and a reminder that all technology needs to be kept up to date, not just the
hardware but the software, access speeds, and the librarians’ own knowledge of the technology
provided. When asked to focus on Internet connectivity in libraries, one student responded that it
“depends on (the) school. The more advanced the society, school, patrons, the more that (Internet
connectivity) is needed.” Looking at the rest of the comments it was clear that most of the
participants were emphatic that free, fast, reliable and unblocked Internet access be provided by
libraries. Additionally, two participants specified the need for public machines connected to the
Internet. Finally, three participants advocated limiting or filtering access for children/students.
Although comments are provided from all participants in the next phase, when significant
duplication existed, the study results highlighted five participants who were identified as having
a “typical” experience, including Sherry, Troy, Angie, Nancy, and Jill. The extremes of
experiences were also represented. Three additional participants were selected because they had
the worst experiences (Mary and Cindy) and the best experience (Lynn).
Phase 2: Experiences in Russia
Participants’ resulting worldview was derived from one primary source, post-experience
interviews, and two supporting sources, participant answers to challenge questions, and
instructor and researcher notes. In this section, a detailed analysis of the post-experience
interviews is presented. Instructor and researcher notes are provided in Appendices E & F
respectively. Data analysis of the participants resulting worldviews is broken into two sections.
First, the text was reviewed according to participant attributes and the story is told through the

69

derived codes and themes from Fhapter 3. Second, the text is viewed at the level of individual
participants’ experiences, retelling the story in their own words. Both steps combined to create
the understandings learned from the experience in the interpretive/re-interpretive moment
presented in Fhapter 5.
Part 1 – Attribute Summaries
Age Groups
Graduate student ages within the department varied widely as some choose librarianship
as their first career, some as a subsequent option, or still others return to school to increase their
earning potential within the field. Thus, the first attribute H[DPLQHG was age group.
Participants were broken into those under 20, those between 20 and 30, those between 30 and 40,
and those over 40. The mean response was then charted in comparison to the themes (Figure 5).

Across all age groups, four themes consistently appeared in the top five. These included
professional competency, which encompassed professional insights learned, technical and soft
skills learned, and realizations of the essence of librarianship; comparisons between libraries,
countries, and peoples; comments on the overall experience including perceived value,
disappointments, challenges, communication, benefits, and whether an alternative experience
would have been effective; and cultural competency, a focus on participants awareness,
expectations, and identified differences of a foreign culture. Other themes found in the top five
included Judgments, Library Cultural Competency, and Skills & Education Levels. Although
they presented in differing order, Professional Competency, Comparisons, and Overall
experience were the top three themes for both the 18-20 and the 20-30 age groups. Within the
30-40 age group, Comparisons, Judgments, and Professional Competency were most frequent.
Within the 40+ age group, Judgments, Cultural Competency, and Comparison were most
frequent.
When specific codes were examined across age groups, the 18-20 age group and the 2030 age group both remarked on four most frequently: professional insights, lessons they actually
learned, the AAS library staff’s skills and education, and comparing the AAS libraries to US
school libraries. The two groups only differed in that the younger group exhibited Library
Cultural Awareness and the slightly older group focused on Cultural Awareness. Jill provided a
great explanation of what she learned professionally from the experience as a young participant.
I definitely learned there was a wide range of different types of librarianship, different
types of librarians themselves. I guess for myself, being one of the younger people in the
groups, I learned a lot from those people who were returning to school and returning to
get their masters in library science. That gave me a different perspective on the
dedication and type of education for people who were returning to school in pursuit of a
goal they really wanted to achieve to become a better librarian in some cases or just to
really try something new. There were librarians who worked in different fields of course.
So I did learn a little bit about working in the medical field, in a school library, or a

71

public library. Just beyond those types of librarians/librarianship, there were also people
who were I guess you could say, were focused on the technology aspect or the
information aspect of librarianship. So I got to learn a little bit about them, about their
story and how they got to be where they are today. It was definitely at first a little bit of a
daunting experience, being surrounded by so many librarians all at once, but over the
course I did feel familiar and at home with my group and just really enjoyed learning
from all of them.
Ann also told how working in a different library culture affected her: “I wouldn’t say changed,
maybe expanded a little. I kind of have a better view of exactly what it takes to work in a library.
I definitely feel better about it.”
Although the 30-40 age group (Figure 6) also looked at professional insights, the AAS
library staff’s skills and education and their own cultural awareness like the 20-30 age group,
they also focused on judgments of the AAS Moscow’s Library, such as a number of comments
from Angie: It’s very up-to-date. It was definitely small. They did ok with what they had. In the
HS, I thought it was pretty good space. With what they had I thought they had a good flow. It
was really cool that in the HS they had the DVD’s where family could check out. This group also
made a significant number of comparisons between Moscow and St. Petersburg as cities. Glen
thought that:
St. Petersburg however, had more of the older artistic, Austria Hungarian, Parisian,
Prussian influence to it. That was the thing that I took away from there. It seemed like a
much more international city than Moscow did.
Carrie agreed that the two cities had very different personalities.
They (the cities) were within the same country but definitely had different feels like
Dallas and New York or something. The people dressed differently too. We noticed it
instantly. People were more fashion plate in Moscow and then in St. Petersburg people
would dress more casually.
Although reaching the same conclusion, Lynn reflected on the personal differences she
encountered.

72

It was just a lot easier to navigate for me especially because of the signage and that
people spoke other languages. People seemed friendlier in St. Petersburg too. They
wanted to learn, they wanted to practice their English or learn about the US.

However, it was Angie that provided a reason for many of these differences when she said,
“Moscow is definitely busier that St. Petersburg but that could be due to population.” Being one
of the Cold War survivor groups, it was not surprising to see this focus on cultural judgments and
comparisons. Nor was it surprising to see that the 40+ age group (Figure 7) strongly explored
cultural awareness and differences, as well as AAS’s library staff’s skills and education levels,
comparing the AAS libraries and US school libraries, and sharing professional insights.

Another data point for analysis for age groups was uniqueness of experience. Each age
group was examined to determine whether any particular theme or code was only expressed by
that group or was not present. For the 40+ age group, personal growth in the areas of sensitivity
and helpfulness were unique. The 30-40 age group were the only ones that expressed specific
expectations of Russian Libraries such as the Science & Technology Library and the Presidential
Library as well as compared the AAS libraries to other International School libraries. The 20-30
age group did not experience any unique experiences and were the only group to have no
judgments of churches and librarianship or expectations of the Russian people and the program
itself. Lastly, although the 18-20 age group experienced the highest observation of library
cultural competency, they did not experience or observe any unique phenomenon at the
code/micro level. It is best said that their experience was most unique in what they did not
comment on. They expressed no expectations of what the AAS libraries or the Russian food
would be like. They made no extraneous suggestions or explored personal growth at an
assertiveness or confidence level. Also, they were the only age group to reserve judgment on
Russian special libraries, the political or military presence, the library staff or their
accommodations. These absences of commentary could be accounted for by not being old
enough to have experiences to compare to this trip or career experience.
Point in Program
Data points for the “Point in Program” attribute were collapsed into four categories, those
who had not yet completed two semesters – Just Starting, those who were at the midpoint in their
program – Two Semesters, those within one semester of graduating – Nearing Graduation, and
those who had already completed the program – Post Program. Across all of the categories, three
themes were within their respective top five lists (Figure 8): Professional Competencies, Overall

74

Experience, and Comparison. Other themes which occurred with high frequency were Skills &
Education Levels, Library Cultural Competency, Judgments, and Cultural Competency.

In fact, the one theme all of the groups observed in their top three was Comparisons. All groups
except those nearing graduation also expressed comments related to professional competency in
their top three. Those just starting and those who had completed the program focused on skills
and education levels. Lastly, those just starting their program were unique in two ways. They did
not express judgments and were the only group to recognize or exhibit growth in library cultural
competency. This phenomenon was also seen in the youngest age group. This lends more
credence to the idea proposed in the first attribute that judgments are developed through
experiences; those with the least experience are more apt to develop library cultural competency.

75

When looking within the themes, there were two codes which all of the groups addressed
the professional insights gained through the program and seeing something of interest in the skill
and education level of the AAS library staff. The next few paragraphs will look at each
individual group’s top five codes and how their experience was similar or unique to other groups.
For the group just starting their LIS degree (Figure 9), their experience appeared to be focused
on learning about the profession.

These participants expressed comments which indicated a level of professional competency
through professional insights, seeing the essence of librarianship, and describing professional
lessons they actually learned. Other areas of professional growth were in exhibiting a level of
library cultural competency through an increased awareness and identification of differences.
Some of these differences were also expressed through their comments comparing the AAS
libraries to US school libraries and exploring the skills and education levels of the AAS library
staff. This group was the only one to experience library cultural competency in the forms of
awareness and differences and to have revelations regarding the essence of librarianship.
The comments shared by the two semesters complete group (Figure 10) focused on
comparing the AAS libraries and US school libraries as well as the two different Russian cities
76

they visited and identifying professional competencies through professional insights and sharing
professional lessons they learned. These participants were the only ones to make explicit
comparisons between Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Tammy and Lynn commented on the people, environment, and their comfort in each city.
Tammy - I found the people of Moscow not to be overly warm and friendly, except
occasionally the people in their 20s especially guys that knew a little English were a lot
friendlier. Everybody else pretty much stuck to themselves. The people at the hotel were
definitely not in Moscow. However when you go to over to St. Petersburg where they
have to live on hospitality they were much more nice and friendly and warm.
Lynn - It was just a lot easier to navigate for me especially because of the signage and
that people spoke other languages. People seemed friendlier in St. Petersburg too. They
wanted to learn, they wanted to practice their English or learn about the US.
Other participants did share their experiences in both cities but it was only within this group that
participants provided a comparative analysis of Moscow having a more solemn feel versus St.
Petersburg tourism attitude.
Comments from the ten participants nearing graduation presented a more varied
experience (Figure 11). This group of participants developed their cultural competency through
increased awareness and observing cultural differences. They made comparisons between the

77

AAS libraries and US school libraries. They noticed the skills and education levels of the AAS
library staff and expressed judgments about the AAS library in Moscow.

Figure 11. Top five codes in point in the program’s nearing graduation group
This was the only group that focused on the cultural differences. Cultural differences
were noted in food, religion, customer service, and how people interacted with each other as well
as tourists. Troy found the differences in Russian religious life most different:
I’d never been in an orthodox service before, even Greek. The whole concept of the
iconostas and the heavenly door and all the special people, the priest and the celebrants,
are behind that door and everyone else is outside the door and they only come out every
once in a while to say what they want to say to you. There’s this real feeling of the
special people with the power and common folks.
Once again, Mary focused on social standards:
The fact that you can’t find a laundry mat on every corner was kind of perturbing. They
obviously don’t clean like we do. Very different standards in cleanliness I guess, I
noticed when people sat by me, the Russians always smelled like cigarettes and booze
and it was like yick.
Nancy felt the difference in her sleep schedule with this comment, “Even thought I had read
about the white nights it was still such a shock to adjust to it being light.” Julie found food to be
her difference indicator:

78

Everything was very fresh. In Moscow they seemed very health conscious by measuring
the grams per entrée. It just seemed like they ate a lot of vegetables too so it seemed like
they were very health conscious.
Perhaps this focus on cultural differences surfaced because these participants were further in
their studies than the first three groups and they had more time to focus on the country/location
of the experience.
Only two participants, Carrie and Glen, had completed their LIS degree at the time of the
experience. When they spoke about their experience, five different items were of highest
recurrence (Figure 12): their judgments about the AAS Moscow’s library, their professional
insights gained, a further developed cultural awareness, acknowledgement of the skills and
education level of the AAS library staff, and their suggestions for improvement for the AAS
libraries. It was unique that this group did not make any comparisons between the AAS libraries
and US school libraries within their top five categories. This could have been an artifact of the
small nature of this group and neither participant having worked in school libraries previously.

Although, Carrie and Glen did have many judgments for the AAS Moscow library like
other groups, they were the only ones to provide a balancing amount of suggestions for
improvement in their top five observations. Their suggestions focused on redesigning the

79

libraries’ physical space, making policy changes, and increasing staff and programs. Carrie
shared these thoughts on process:
“I would create a weeding schedule.”
“They had a system where you could only check out the books depending on how old you
are or what grade level you’re at. The three-four year old, I don’t remember the rule was,
in my opinion; let them check out what they want to check out.”
“I might create more open space too.”
“If it is a community library, then they need people from the community working there
just so that they can have some buy-in.”
There is a good probability that so many suggestions were generated because this group included
the only degreed active librarian on the trip.
Worked with People from Another Country (&o-:orker or 3atron)
The next attribute identified in the coding was working with people from other countries.
This attribute includes those that had worked with international co-workers as those who had
served international patrons. Group  included participants that had worked with and served
people from other countries. Group  included participants that worked with international coworkers but did not interact with international patrons. Group  participants had not worked
with international co-workers nor had they interacted with international patrons. Finally, *roup
 only had experience serving patrons from another country. Looking at these groups from the
perspective of the 12 themes (Figure 13), two data points were obvious. First, those who had
worked with others commented more on all themes. This suggested that prior experience with
different cultures encourages participants to speak up about new experiences. Second, there were
large differences between those that had worked with international co-workers and those that had
not, specifically when it came to comparisons, judgments, professional competencies, the overall
experience, and developing cultural competency.

Unfortunately, there were no pertinent comments from participants to shed light on this
difference. However, this difference between these two attributes may be accounted for by the
level of personal interaction participants had with those from other countries. At the level of coworker, a participant would have had to routinely adapt to variances in worldviews. At the level
of providing services to patrons, this adaption would be momentary if present at all. This
indicated that routine exposure to cultural difference may make participants more critical in their
observations of their environment.
Each group was then looked at separately. When examining *roup  (Figure 14), it was
clear their focus was on developing their professional competency and expressing insights
gained, noticing differences in AAS libraries when compared to US school libraries, reviewing
the skills and education level of AAS library staff, and becoming aware of Russian culture and
its differences.

Interestingly, across all groups’ coded responses, this group was the only one to make
comparisons of the AAS libraries and other international school libraries, as well as AAS
libraries to non-school US libraries. Once again, prior international experience may be at play.
Glen, who had been on a prior ISL trip, found that “the (library) in St. Petersburg at the school
was more of what I expected. More similar to Kyiv. In terms of I guess of the quality of the
collection the organization of the collection the amount of processing that need to be done with
the collection.” Additionally, Carrie, our active librarian, compared the AAS libraries to a public
library: “…You could walk out into the 4th floor of the Frisco [Texas] library and that’s what
(AAS Moscow) was like. There (were) open access stations, printing, all of it right there for use
by patrons.” Their prior experiences gave them a basis of comparison.
Within *roup , their top five most commented codes (Figure 15) included
professional insights gained, a sense of cultural awareness, judgments about the AAS Moscow
library, the skill and education level of AAS library staff, and their perceived value of the entire
experience. These codes were all educational experience related.

Perhaps this set of participants joined the trip more focused on the service learning experience
than the awe of an international destination. If so, then it would not be surprising that the data
showed *roup , unlike all other groups, expressed having no expectations of visiting Russia.
Group  did not stand out from the other groups in any specific manner. Their top
five interview responses related to the codes of professional insights, comparisons between AAS
libraries and US school libraries, cultural awareness, professional lessons they actually learned,
and the skill and education of the AAS library staff. However,*roup , those that had served
international patrons but not worked with people from other countries, showed many variances
from the other groups. First, their top five was widely disbursed over eight codes (Figure 16).
The largest area experienced by *roup  was cultural awareness. Perhaps this group was
looking for tips on how to provide better service to their patrons at home. Sherry was excited by
just this idea. She shared that “I actually had an experience (when I got home) where I had
someone who was Ukrainian and I just had to try to communicate and help him so he could
communicate with his friends and family back home.” Second, they did not provide commentary
on 13 codes that those that had any work related experience with those from other countries felt

were worth mentioning. Third, they did, however, experience personal growth, sensitivity and
helpfulness, on two levels unmentioned by the other groups. Specifically, Angie learned that:
Main thing, not specific at all… patience, working with different people from different
cultures, being sensitive to that. How you speak, try not to use a lot of slang, they may
not understand it. Sometimes you have to be careful about how you gesture. If you do or
don’t look someone in the eyes, should you try to make eye contact. It’s so interested in
helping them. Letting them know that they’re not wasting your time, that you’re there to
work it out and try to figure out what they’re needing.
This personal growth came from experiencing what it was like to be unable to communicate in
Russia and needing assistance themselves.
Time in Profession
The next attribute investigated was how long participants had been within the LIS
profession. Four groups were found, those that had not previously been in the profession, those
that had one to five years in the LIS profession, those that had six to ten years, and finally those
that had been in the LIS profession for more than 10 years. When looking at the themes in this
study (Figure 17), all groups provided the most commentary regarding the overall experience,
their judgments of the experience, cultural competency development, and comparisons worthy of

84

note. The only variance was that the participants with no prior experience in the LIS field
seemed to also focus on the skills and education levels of all they encountered.

Even though the groups were similar at the theme level, when looking across all groups at
the code level, several differences were seen. Each group focused on different aspects of each of
the themes. The group with no prior experience, possibly having no basis for professional
comparison, made more observations about the Russian people. Our mid-career group, those
with six to ten years’ experience, were the only ones that commented on their personal growth in
the areas of sensitivity and helpfulness to others. Another anomaly between groups arose in those
areas that they did not mention. The group with six to ten years of experience shared most of
their commentary with all three of the other groups, except judgments of the program. It is
probable that the mid-career participants were so engaged with the project itself that they did not
feel it necessary to pass judgment on the overall program. Lastly, the “no prior experience”
group showed the most difference by not expressing any expectations of the Russian people or
85

judgments on the AAS libraries, their accommodations, and the special Russian libraries they
visited. This group appeared to be the tableau rasa, just soaking in the entire experience.
All four groups were examined individually from a level of their top five codes.
Participants in the first group, those having no prior LIS experience (Figure 18), focused on the
skills and education level of library staff, cultural awareness, comparisons between AAS libraries
and US school libraries, judgments of the Russian people, and cultural differences. Most notably
this group focused significantly (39%) on factors of cultural competency within their top five
codes.

to Moscow, and the AAS school libraries to US school libraries. However, they seemed most
taken with developing their professional competency (Figure 19). They were struck by their
professional insights and complemented them with tangible professional lessons learned.
Together, early career participants expressed comments on professional competency in over 50%
of their top five codes.

Some learned about the profession itself. For example, Lynn learned that “Basically the
nuts and bolts of what runs a library are pretty much universal. To me it’s about the type of
resources that are available that made them different.” Whereas Kim, she saw that “Not all
libraries, not all the librarians, not all people are like you and not everything happens the same
way.” Others connected the need for planning and analysis to the process of completing typical
library tasks. Julie realized that “to be able to create an analysis of your system… you really have
to be able to analyze your patrons and their needs and how this information is going to be
presented to them because it’s so vital” At the same time, Laura felt she “learned about the
library culture and about the space planning. We learned some theories on how to bring the
library into the future. What patrons might need, a needs assessment thing”
Still others gained new insights into working with people. Laura and Kim developed a
new level of flexibility. When dealing with the administration, Laura saw that “You have to be
flexible in the library because most libraries are never in control of their own space so they
always have to go along with whoever is making those decisions. We can try to change their
minds but ultimately we have no control over the library at all actually” Kim was surprised to
find the extent to which flexibility ruled a librarian’s life.

87

What I think I learned, especially for big projects such as like changing the layout of a
library, how much other staff, school staff, and how much your crew really needs to
really cut through red tape to get a project moving or start something. I worked some
place where you have to go through all these layers of finance, and have to get the city
manager to ok things. But I never really thought about this is a big part of what a librarian
has to do as far as planning. You don’t really think about it.
Whereas for Lynn, working with others meant learning how to work as a team. She realized that
age does not equate to qualifications. During this experience, Lynn found that “you can’t just say
I’m going to go to this person because they’re older and therefore they have more experiences”.
She learned first-hand that “You might be working with a 25 year old that’s been working in that
library as a paraprofessional since they were 18 and they are going to know stuff that you know
nothing about”. But regardless of age and experience levels, Lynn’s strongest lesson about
teamwork came from watching another team’s troubles. “I saw groups that did not function as
well and they were able to still go a good job but it always makes me wonder how much better of
a job they could have done if they would have put all of the personal crap aside and concentrated
on putting #1 getting the task done”. Last, Laura pointed out from working with other librarians
that “It’s important to create the library culture, not just for the staff, but we have to share it. We
have to share the value that we offer.” For this group, being sequestered with other librarians for
three weeks provided the catalyst for professional competency.
Similarly, professional insights made the top five codes for participants employed within
the field for six – ten years and those for over ten years. The mid-career participants expressed
only 30% about professional insights with the remainder comprised of cultural awareness, the
skills and education level of the library staff, specific judgments of the Moscow AAS library,
and their perceived value of the overall experience. Those with more than 10 years’ experience
presented a more balanced approach with only 20% insights and other responses falling within
cultural differences, noticing unexpected items, acknowledging the skill and education levels of

88

the library staff and comparing the AAS school libraries with US school libraries. Consequently,
it appeared an international service learning experience provides the most professional
development for participants in their early and mid-career years.
Prior International Experiences
As can be seen in the graph below (Figure 20), the basic curve for the groups, travelled
and lived outside the US, seemed to hold across themes. The most obvious anomalies were in the
group who had not left the US. Amongst other variances, this group exhibited the most
pronounced development of library cultural competency, provided the greatest judgments, talked
about their overall experience and developed professional competency.

As library cultural competency is the combination of cultural and professional competency
development, it was not surprising to see the related spikes. However, this group was actually a
group of one, Angie. Thus, the difference suggested may be simply more of an outlier than an
indicator and was disregarded for the code level analysis.

89

Additionally, when looking at all codes versus the two groups, a couple of items stood
out. Those that had previously travelled outside of the US remarked on seven (7) codes which
the other two groups did not: personal growth in sensitivity and helpfulness, judgments of
church/religion and other participants, expectations of special libraries and the Russian food, as
well as comparing the AAS school libraries to other international school libraries. Those that had
lived outside the US commented on all of the codes with the exception of making judgments of
the special libraries and expressing expectations of the Russian people.
Participants who had travelled outside the US expressed many of the same types of
comments as their counterparts who had lived outside the US (Figure 21). The largest part of the
travelled group’s top five codes recognized were in the areas of increasing their professional
competency through insights and developing or deepening their cultural awareness.

However, while those participants that had lived outside the US did focus on professional
insights, their second concentration was on comparing AAS libraries to US school libraries.
Since this last group had already lived in an immersion environment with its built-in feeling of

90

powerlessness, it was possible that they were less inclined to address cultural variation and more
comfortable discussing library variations.
Type of LIS Work Experience
Students begin the degree program with varying types of work experience. Some never
worked within the profession. Others spent years as a library volunteer. Still others have had paid
experience ranging from clerk to library assistant. The next attribute that was used to look at the
interview data (Figure 22) was “Type of LIS Work Experience.”

At the theme level, *roup  (Unpaid) showed less engagement overall through the
interviews. None of their utterances addressed personal growth. Additionally, they made fewer
comparisons between items and events on the trip and home as well as having much less to say
about specific libraries they visited. As the “underclass” of librarianship, perhaps their lack of
power with libraries conditioned them to keep silent on potentially contentious issues.

91

These themes were broken down further into codes. Groups were reviewed for unique
qualities – only group mentioning or not mentioning a specific topic. Additionally, each group
was examined to determine the top five areas they focused on. Group  (None) was the only
group to express expectations of the special libraries in Russia and compare the AAS libraries to
other international school libraries. Group  (Paid) was the only one to share their growth in
their professional competency through sensitivity and helpfulness. Those participants that had
worked in the LIS field in unpaid positions (*roup ) had little to say on many codes, most
notably within the suggestions, expectations, professional competency, and comparison themes.
Again, it was probably that this lack of input from *roup  reflected feelings of powerlessness
and fear to speak out.
Those that had no experience in the field (*roup ) referred the most to professional
insights, skill and education levels of the AAS library staff, comparisons of the AAS libraries
and US school libraries, and identifying cultural awareness and differences within their postexperience interviews (Figure 24). This group was the only one that appeared to grow in the area
of cultural awareness. The other two groups did not have cultural awareness within their top five
observations.

Only three participants were in the unpaid group. Their utterances were so diverse that
they encompassed eight (8) codes (Figure 24). Half of these eight codes were not present in the
top five rankings of the other two groups. Four codes (overall benefits of the trip, comparisons of
US cities to one or both of the Russian cities as well as the AAS libraries to US school libraries,
and professional insights) tied for fifth place. Three others rounded out the top four (judgments
of the Russian people, professional lessons learned, and overall communication).

Cultural awareness was the largest area and claimed 23% in this collection of comments. As
unpaid workers, it may have been safest to speak about their surroundings instead of the project
itself. Helen provided many of these cultural observations ranging from personal interactions to
the physical environment. She first addressed the reactions of Russians to a non-Russian speaker:
Sometimes people were kind of curt with you when they found out you couldn’t speak
Russian and they were trying to convey a thought to you or not want you to go a certain
way. They had to get a kind of loud when they had to direct you away from something.
Her next insight spoke to the expectations of Russians from tourists visiting attractions:

93

Some wanted to be paid, like the costume people right outside the gate in red square.
When I took their picture from a distance, they tried to cover up and not get their picture
taken in costume. They wanted to be paid to be with you.
Finally, Helen remarked on her surprise at the physical environment:
The Kremlin had those gold topped cathedrals and that kind of surprised me because … I
was thinking of one government building kind of walled off where the ministers are
talking about the fate of their country and ours and the rest of the world. But it turned out
that it was really a triangular area filled with several buildings including several
cathedrals, the interim palace and the armory. There were one or two buildings that were
government buildings but the rest was more historical.
The diversity in these codes may have been a result of their unpaid experience as initially
suggested, but more likely due to only three people within the group.
Lastly, although the themes graph showed the paid group as most prolific in their
commentary, participants did not comment on any unique codes. The codes most prevalent for
the participants having prior paid LIS experience were cultural awareness, professional insights,
expectations of the AAS Moscow’s library, the AAS library staff, and comparisons between the
AAS libraries and US school libraries. However, this focus on mostly work related codes may be
contributed to their empowered status as paid employees.
Part 2 – Individual Summaries
Post-experience interviews collected perceptions from six areas as experienced by the
participants: perceptions of Russia, impressions of the libraries, impressions of the patrons,
impressions of librarians and library staff, knowledge gained about librarianship, and feedback
for the program. These areas were the basis for looking at the different horizons within the
experience. This section provides commentary from the participants and integration of the
previously identified codes and themes. All participants were first time visitors to Russia. This
first area follows their challenges, adjustments, and wonders that they experienced.

94

Perceptions of Russia: The Russian People
Participants shared their expectations of the Russian people before the trip. The general
sentiment was the same, one of trepidation. Jill, under 20, said, “at first I didn’t know what to
expect, this being a new country. I guess my perceptions before I went over there was that I
didn’t think the Russians would be very friendly.” Julie, in her 20’s, said that “before I went
there I read that they were really xenophobic but I didn’t really get that, not towards myself at
least.” Kim, in her 20’s, was surprised: “I think they were warmer than I thought. I guess maybe
I assumed that with a colder climate they wouldn’t be as friendly.” Lynn, in her 30’s, had a
dimmer view: “I think everyone will be poor. I think people won't be friendly. I think people will
be strict.” Finally, Mary, over 40, shared that “everybody warned me that they wouldn’t be very
nice. But I found that to be the opposite.” Unfortunately, the pre-experience surveys did not
focus on participants’ worldview of Russia before the trip, thus, these utterances were collected
from their post-experience interviews. Despite this limitation of the study, we are able to see that
even though not all of these participants were not Cold War survivors, their initial concerns were
consistent.
After their time in Russia, participants expressed a wide variety of perceptions. Tammy
and Jane experienced a generational gap; younger Russians were friendly and older ones were
not. Tammy noted that “I found the people of Moscow not to be overly warm and friendly,
except occasionally the people in their 20s especially guys that knew a little English were a lot
friendlier. Everybody else pretty much stuck to themselves.” Jane was especially conscious of
the generational issue:
For some reason, the ones that were teenagers or the younger generation or my age 20’s.
They seemed nicer. If you tried to talk to the older generation, looking at them, they’re
not liking it. They don’t look like they could bend, when you try to talk to them, they
don’t seem very responsive, like rude. When you try to talk to them, they’re kind of hard

95

to talk to them. It was the language barrier; they didn’t speak English. Probably culture
shock for me.
Perhaps this friendliness they experienced from the younger generation was a result of not
growing up during the days of the Cold War. Whereas the interactions they had with older
Russians might have been colored by living life in competition with Americans.
Tammy, Carrie, and Glen expressed a geographical difference; those in St. Petersburg
were nice and those in Moscow were not. Tammy noted that,
The people at the hotel were definitely not in Moscow. However, when you go to over to
St. Petersburg where they have to live on hospitality they were much more nice (sic) and
friendly and warm.
Carrie supported this by saying,
And even between the people in Moscow and the people in St. Petersburg, they had, there
was definitely a different air in Moscow. They seemed more cosmopolitan like in New
York, more ‘we don’t really care if you’re here or not, I’m just going to keep living my
life’ kind of thing. Definitely didn’t seem as friendly as other places that I have been.
Like around here, but like I said it could have been the language barrier, like if I could
have said more, it would have been better communication, more friendly behavior. But
when I did ask questions, it was the minimal response. They answered what they had to
and normally, there was a piece of information that I didn’t ask and thus it didn’t get
answered. And I would do something and I would come back and say, well what about
this? And they would say oh yes, here’s the rest of the answer that you need. That
affected my travels several times.
Glen’s experience contrasted with Carrie and Tammy when he stated that
The lady at the reception desk at the Nevsky Breeze (St. Petersburg) was extremely
helpful in getting me to the ticket place in calling them and giving me a map and that sort
of thing. That was a good experience.
Perhaps this difference can be explained by the different roles each city has played in Russia.
Moscow has been the seat of power since the Czars. St. Petersburg has been more of a cultural
center.
Troy and Nancy focused on a particular economic sector, the service industry, as not
friendly. Troy said that

96

We really didn’t have much interaction with the people. The kind of interaction we had
was really if you went to a restaurant or a store. So there wasn’t really a lot of discussion.
So I really saw them mainly either anonymously as a group like in the subway or in a
restaurant. As far as the restaurant experience was concerned. They have a ways to go. I
can’t remember if anyone ever said thank you for coming or asked if we like the meal.
Sometimes… they were hostile, they were basically indifferent. The people in general,
my impression was they were kind of grim. You didn’t see a lot of people laughing. So
with the language and difference, there was a certain isolation. So I don’t know… it
would be unfair for me to comment too much on them. I would just say from a customer
service stand point, a service economy, they have a lot to learn. My favorite story is that I
went to one of the churches in St. Petersburg and I wanted one of the audio tours. I went
up to the booth and all I had was a 1000 ruble not and she says ‘nyet’, no change. It was
like ‘Really, I mean, what’s your purpose of being here’. It wasn’t like I wanted to get it
for free; I was willing to pay for it. They couldn’t be bothered to go get changes. It was
just little things like that.
Nancy noted what she perceived as hostility,
We discussed this a couple of times, this group of five people that hung out together.
Something we found about the people of Russia, since it was a socialist country for so
long, customer service is not really valued. That wasn’t true at the hotel but it was as the
restaurant. We found it not really hostile to us and that they were not really hospitable
except for just a couple times.
Participants recognized the current struggles being experienced by Russia’s tourism industry
with these comments. In fact, according to Maloletko, Kaurova, Kryukova, Pochinok, and
Gladko (2015) who looked at the tourism industry in Russia from 2008-2012, they found many
significant issues which might affect travelers including “low quality of service in all sectors of
the tourism industry due to a lack of professional staff” (p. 26).
Lynn’s view was somewhat different from Nancy and Troy. She felt that her interactions
with Russians didn’t change her perceptions, but instead, changed her.
When we were first in Moscow and when I was in Moscow, WOW these people are
really not friendly because they don’t smile they seem like they are always in a rush to
get some place. I had kind of heard from a friend that not many people would speak
English. So that made me shy to even to go up and ask somebody, even with gestures for
even to ask for information. As I was there in Moscow longer a lot of my perceptions
stayed that same but I think I changed, really more than they did. I didn’t really see,
people were still not smiling and still didn’t speak English. I just felt that the longer I was
in Moscow. I started to adjust to their culture…ok I’m in a hurry don’t ask me questions
…and you learn how to crowd onto the metro, you learn how to help people line up for
97

things. You just learn little tiny things about how locals do things and you just
unconsciously do those same things. Then it doesn’t feel as weird.
Whereas a remaining majority found Russians to be either “normal” or truly friendly and helpful.
Ann felt differently about her experiences with the Russian people, saying “They seemed like
normal, lovely people. I didn’t speak Russian so I didn’t really talk with them or anything. I
don’t know what I was expecting going into Russia but they seemed like normal to me.” Julie
also noted that “I want to say they weren’t too different from the people here in America. It
seemed there was a lot of diversity. I felt like they helped me a lot.” Sherry especially
particularly enjoyed the people there:
I actually really liked the people of Russia. I had a couple things with the cashiers with
the money because they wanted the exact change. But I found some of them to be very
nice, very helpful. I have had really good experiences. One was when we were going to
the pharmacy and you got that one gentleman that took us physically to a pharmacy and
showed it to us and translated for Bev. I remember at the Pushkin museum of art Cathy
and I were trying to find the modern art and the security guide said she was trying to
convey how to find the modern art and where was it. He realized we didn’t speak Russian
and he didn’t really speak English and we just had to follow him all the way outside and
with his gestures where to go. And even though we didn’t speak Russian, we go it. And I
thought they were friendly and in a big city. People are just going to be big city people
anyways. They aren’t going to be overly friendly when you’re all strangers with 1213million people. On the whole I thought they were great and I liked them. So minus the
cashiers where I bumped heads for exact change and the hotel restaurant staff.
Laura also noted the language barrier, but felt that the people were nice.
Well, I couldn’t talk to very many of them because I didn’t speak and Russian and most
of them didn’t speak English. But the people I did meet, they were super nice, SUPER
nice. I talked to one woman at the market in St. Petersburg and then I talked to some guy
on the train in Moscow and both of them, I thought they were going to be mean but they
were super nice. They didn’t care that we were Americans.
Mary concurred with Laura, stating that
I thought everybody was really nice. They went out of their way to help us. I didn’t have
any complaints. Everybody warned me that they wouldn’t be very nice. But I found that
to be the opposite because I got my camera back and we got that guy to help us at the
pharmacy. I had an excellent experience. I enjoyed the people in Russia.
Helen had a positive set of experiences and saw age perhaps coming into play,
98

The majority of people were not speaking English and some were… some seemed very
friendly. I thought it was really nice that since I was older people would give me a seat.
Not everybody gave me a seat but that is something even here in the states you have less
people willing to give up a seat to an older person or a pregnant person. It seemed like the
Russian we more caring in that area. Sometimes people were kind of curt with you when
they found out you couldn’t speak Russian and they were trying to convey a thought to
you or not want you to go a certain way. They had to get a kind of loud when they had to
direct you away from something. I wasn’t mugged and I certainly was able to point to
enough things to be able to eat in the country and get through the subway line for
example, get my sandwich and my drink and get paid in rubles, so that was all available
without even having an interpreter a lot of the time. You could do all of that and a lot of
the people were friendly.
Angie: I thought that they were… I was under the impression that they would be
protective and keep to themselves, but I found they were inviting, welcoming. A lot of
the people that we met at the school but also in the presidential library, they were just so
excited to share with us, look what I did. I thought they were really cute, really sweet. I
thought overall everybody was like Texas, everybody was warm and inviting.
For these participants, it seemed that interacting with Russians was exactly what they needed to
see that people can be as friendly, despite their differences.
Perceptions of Russia: Russian Customs and Culture
Several participants commented on their experiences with the Russian culture. Many
comments mentioned Russians’ pride in their national heritage and a surprise at the prevalence of
church and religion in Russian society. Angie, in particular, found that national pride was strong.
I would say for culture, their history, it was very very interesting. I feel like we didn’t get
an in-depth look at it but just seeing Red Square, the Kremlin, the Hermitage and getting
to see all the items and see all the things it has overcome over time and it’s still standing
from the 1600s. They seem to take great care of it, all their historic sites, the archives and
the items/artifacts. I did see that they really do care about their past and where they come
from.
Helen also noticed this from those who were from former USSR countries as well.
I think they’re very proud of their Russian culture. If they’re from a country, about like
Estonia, that was part of Russia, and broken away, they’re kind of glad to be broken
away. They share their own customs and history and they really don’t want to be
associated with Russia anymore.

99

Troy, Carrie, Sherry, and Jill also saw this pride in Russian’s religious practices. Several
instances conveyed a deep respect for their beliefs, such as covering a woman’s head with a
scarf, crossing one’s self as they passed a church, superstitions, and their displays of devotion to
the Russian Orthodox religion. Troy and Carrie shared specific memories of their first times
entering Russian churches. Troy mentioned that
Going to the church, I’d never been in an orthodox service before, even a Greek, and the
whole concept of the iconostas and the heavenly door and all the special people, the priest
and the celebrants, are behind that door and everyone else is outside the door and they
only come out every once in a while to say what they want to say to you. So there’s this
real feeling of the special people with the power and common folks. It was also
interesting, the whole church thing was kind of fascinating and how it’s after three
generations as soon as the Soviets left, the church is back now. It probably doesn’t have
the power that it had during the czar’s time but they are certainly making their presence
felt on a cultural and a religious level. I don’t know how many people still believe. But it
certainly has at least culturally significance for them which was one the real surprises for
me was that the church has somehow been rebuilt and come back. I wasn’t expecting to
see that at all.
Carrie stated that
Going to the churches was neat, seeing the differences between Russian orthodox and
churches around here. I hadn’t seen people stand in the middle before like that and the
chanting. The Christ our Savior church that first Sunday that we were there, that was an
emotional experience for me personally, hearing the priest chant and the hearing the
people sing the chorus. I thought is that a CD and then I realized no it wasn’t a CD it was
actual people singing around you. It was really beautiful. It was an interesting mix of
Christ the Savior where the women were covering their heads because that’s what you’re
supposed to do in that particular church and then there are women cutting through the
square in their Daisy Duke kind of stuff, hot pants, and tight tight shirts and they do the
sign before they walk through the square. A very interesting mix.
Participants were surprised to encounter both the number of churches and the vibrant religious
community that survived Soviet rule. Cold War Russia had been believed to be an atheist
country.
Social customs also stood out. Participants remarked on everything from interpersonal
behavior, social norms on the metro, the shopping game, and personal hygiene. They also

100

mentioned public drunkenness, homelessness, and pet treatment. Several specifically remarked
on the treatment of “babushkas;” the elderly, grandmother-type women. Troy for example said:
It was interesting the way they treat the babushkas, because they really cut them a lot of
slack. For a country where if you’re standing in line they think of nothing of going to the
front and cutting in front of you, it’s a contrast from when you’re sitting on a train and a
babushka gets on and several people will stand up and off their seat. So there’s kind of an
interesting tension or contrast there.
Treatment of babushkas was not the only norm observed on the metro. When riding on the
metro, Carrie noted an “interesting thing that when you sit down, the people who are standing
don’t put their butt in your face, they turn towards you. Everyone faces towards the doors.”
Additionally, no one except our group appeared to talk on the metro. Lynn observed the
demeanor of the regular passengers.
It seemed to me that Russia has a lot of readers. Every time I was out and about I saw
people reading on e-readers on their cell phones. I didn’t see a lot of people making eye
contact so besides the not smiling it wasn’t even like they were looking up. Even people
you could tell knew each other didn’t seem to talk with each other, at least loudly and
boisterous like Americans tend to do, like we did when we were all together. That did
make us stick out when we all happened to be in one subway car. Everyone was looking
at us as if wow you guys are loud.
Although an important observation, the study is limited EHFDXVH,did not inquire further WRVHH
if the participant had any thoughts on why Russians might behave this way on the metro.
Participants also found that in the open air markets, Russians took pride in bargaining and
salesmanship. As noted in a study on bargaining at U.S. garage sales, Russians were strong
bargainers and typically did so to “reduce their potential losses from being cheated” and build
trust (Herrmann, 2003, p. 247). Tammy remarked that bargaining was treated as a game. She
learned that respect was derived from it and vendors became friendlier and nicer once you played
along and shared that “in one case there was a lady, a jewelry lady, that gave us all kinds of gifts
after we bargained her down really far. That was an interesting cultural experience.” This sense

101

of bargaining for goods appeared to flow into the world of entertainment as well. Helen pointed
out how performers in public spaces also played the role of salesmen.
Some wanted to be paid, like the costume people right outside the gate in red square.
When I took their picture from a distance, they tried to cover up and not get their picture
taken in costume. They wanted to be paid to be with you. But like the Spiderman guy at
Red Square, he was willing to chat and well… that one fellow in the outfit with you was
willing to make a deal. He was very very friendly….
These two approaches to selling were a cultural variance to socio-economic norms held by
participants. Lynn characterized the main difference in selling practices as remnants of Russia’s
history of economic communism, an economic policy which had the effect of massive food and
product supply shortages for the common man (Caplan, 2008).
As far as their culture, I can kind of see parts of communism still there. When I was in
elementary school, I had a teacher that went to Moscow during Soviet times. She talked
to us about shopping at GUM and there was no selection. If you wanted a thing of soap,
there was one kind of soap. And you had to pray that the one kind of soap that there
would be enough for you when you went shopping that day. Other than when we went to
the markets, I kind of noticed the same thing. There were lots of different things available
but as far as numbers of things it was really small. Maybe there would be 2-3 kinds of
dish soap where in the US there are whole shelves of different brands, scents, strengths,
all these different factors. I’m thinking that’s part of communism where they maybe now
just starting to develop a consumer culture than what they used to have.
Despite these examples of Russian pride, Mary, our participant who had the worst experience,
did not see it in Russians personal care and shared some of her assumptions.
The fact that you can’t find a laundry mat on every corner was kind of perturbing. They
obviously don’t clean like we do. Very different standards in cleanliness I guess. I
noticed when people sat by me, the Russians always smelled like cigarettes and booze
and it was like ‘yick.’
Finally, Nancy addressed her thoughts on how Russians appeared to cope with social problems.
I found it very interesting that there were no open container laws that people throughout
the day were walking around or sitting in public areas drinking alcohol. Even in
Wyoming we don’t see that very often, typically it’s just in bars or on the 4th of July they
open up the streets and let people drink alcohol during the parade or in the park. But I
never saw the next day and typically people were real good about the garbage, putting it
next to the garbage cans if they were filled up. But the next morning it was all cleaned up.

102

The streets were swept. I thought it was very clean for a city of 9 million or 11 million
people. I was quite impressed of the cleanliness.
Speaking about the homeless, Nancy noted that
I didn’t see a whole lot of homeless people and if I did I didn’t recognize them as such. I
did notice in the subway stations a couple of them there were elderly women selling
things to raise money. And someone mentioned that if you notice the lilac bushes up to
their height all of the branches had been snipped off and were being sold in the public
metro areas. One incident in the metro it was in the morning and there was a person that
was, either homeless or drunk, I don’t know, but they were stretched out across several
benches and I know that our group, the few of us that were there, we skipped back away
from them. I did notice the look of disgusted the locals were giving to that person so I
think maybe some of the same issues that we deal with.
She mentioned that people were good to their animals,
As far as taking care of pets, I didn’t see a lot of dogs. The ones I saw looked healthy and
with owners and were out walking with their owners enjoying the park. Only one time
did I see a dog that I saw was elderly and sick. It was on its own, I didn’t know if it had
been left in the metro and was on its last days. I’m a dog person so it broke my heart and
when we came back from wherever we had been and got back to that metro stop. I told
the group that I can’t walk through the park because if that dog is there and dead, I will
lose it. So we skirted the park and the next day my roommate told me that she had walked
through the park and the dog was up and he was fine. Obviously the dog was with
someone and I didn’t see them. It says something about a culture that actually does take
care of its pets.
Lastly, participants shared their cultural experience through remarks on fine art,
architecture, and cuisine. Laura enjoyed the ballet, while Carrie learned about Russia through its
art. Carrie said she
was particularly interested in the art of Russia, because I didn’t have… especially during
the communist period, I didn’t have an idea what it was like. What the art movement was
there. So when we got to St. Petersburg and we got to go to the Russian state museum, it
was neat to see, ah yea, there was. Because in the United States, it’s not very well
represented in my opinion. So it was neat to see that in the 1800s this is what the Russian
art looks like and then in the 1900s and then during the communist period when there was
the iron curtain, it was neat to see that there was art there. Even though it was very
secular. It’s interesting too because you have your idea of what people are like based on
the politics of the country and the economy, but people are just people there. So there’s
remnants of their history but that doesn’t necessarily define who they are just like the
remnants of our history have brought us to where we are now but doesn’t say that I am
who I am because of my ancestors, that kind of thing.

103

For Julie, architecture spoke loudest. She said, “It was a very colorful culture and they definitely
do like to blend the old with the new. Remember when we went to that market, right next to it
there was the hotel and the metro right next to it. It seems like they mix the modern with the old
Russia.” Russia was a mosaic of new and old architecture with women in high heels and latest
clothing trends striding along over the cobblestones of years past, showing the clash of the
country trying to move forward.
The last facet of cultural experience explicitly addressed in the interviews was the food in
Russia. Reaction to the food was positive for 69% of the participants including exclamations of
“oh my god amazing!” from Angie and “everything I ate was good” said Laura. Overall, they
were surprised by the ease of getting their dietary requirements met and eating healthy. In fact,
there were a couple of vegetarians on the trip and the amount of options available were sufficient
even for them. Sherry said,
For me it was a little more difficult because of my dietary restrictions. But the stuff that I
found I was able to do good. The Georgian restaurant, what I could eat of it, was great. In
St. Petersburg though we found some kebab places and I could get veggie kebabs. At
times I would just get some bread and ate that every once in a while at night. I did that
more in Moscow than St. Petersburg. I thought the food was fine.
Nancy shared her experience with helping out one of her vegan classmates.
This person that was a vegan, I don’t think she ever had a situation where she went
without food. As a matter of fact, in St. Petersburg we ate at a Chinese restaurant where
the food was listed in Russian and the waitress didn’t speak English but one of the people
at the table wanted to know what one of the dishes, she went and found someone that
spoke English and brought them back to translate and told us that it was squid. She was
just very concerned that might night be something that the person wanted. I thought the
meals were fantastic. I thought the meals that the instructors choose were good and the
meals we found on our own were good. One of the guys in our group that we hung out
with, he was very cognizant that one of the people was vegan and he went and searched
out a couple restaurants for her. When we went to a restaurant in Moscow, he always
made sure that there was something that she could eat. We did well. A couple times we
went to two or three restaurants before we found something but they were so closely
situated that that wasn’t an issue. Beyond dietary restrictions, participants commented on
the availability of healthy foods.

104

Kim felt that “There was a good variety of food. Also I guess any of the baked goods that we ate
seemed to have a lot less sugar and that’s good, so they weren’t as sweet as we were used to in
the US.” Julie appreciated the food quality saying,
They really seemed to put an emphasis on making good food, much like in Paris, dinner
was close to two hours just because of prep time. Everything was very fresh. In Moscow
they seemed very health conscious by measuring the grams per entrée. It just seemed like
they ate a lot of vegetables too so it seemed like they were very health conscious.
Helen explained that this focus on real/fresh foods held true at the schools as well.
And when we were at the school, I thought the meals we had there was such a variety.
There was the salad bar and really a better lunch than the kids get in the public schools
here in the US that I’ve seen. They did have pizza for example. They also had meat and
veg and potatoes and much more variety than you get in a regular public school lunch. So
I thought those were great. I wouldn’t mind having that lunch every day.
Even without being able to speak or read the language, they were able to point to items and were
generally pleased with the results.
Some specific treats included when Jill tried the fresh salmon,
I remember one in particular that I really enjoyed was that on our last evening group meal
together at the Bazaar restaurant. I ordered the salmon. Now I had heard of course that
fishing is really big in Russia so I wanted to try the fish there. And of course I chose the
salmon and it was delicious. I still think about it.
Laura was surprised by her reactions to the local cuisine. “I ate borsht. I ate their pickled
vegetables. I ate pickled herring and I didn’t die so that was good. What else did I do, culturally,
honey cakes. Russian culture, honey cakes, done. That says it all – honeycakes”. Helen raved
about the fruit teas. Carrie was surprised by the ice cream. “… (I)ce cream is a big player there. I
wasn’t expecting ice cream to be as big there.” The last night in Moscow, the group went to a
Georgian restaurant and overwhelmingly enjoyed the khachapuri (Georgian Feast Bread). Ann
said, “that Georgian place that we went, it was so good. I was so happy. I didn’t even know what
it was but I was like ‘it was so good.’”

105

For those that did not enjoy the dining options, the main complaints were the blandness
of the Russian diet. Ann felt that “the food was surprisingly bland. The food was good but…I’d
have chicken and potatoes and rice and it was completely normal food for me, but the Russians
don’t eat a lot of flavor.” Troy agreed, “I think by and large their cuisine is pretty one note. All
the vegetables are pickled and it just old after a while.” Mary was unhappy that “They eat
everything warm.” Kim was baffled by the occurrence of particular foods. She remarked on “the
presence of cucumbers at really odd times. I wasn’t thinking ‘hey I want cucumbers for
breakfast’ or obviously cold cuts in the morning.” The greatest concern for Lynn was not the
blandness but the expense of the Russian diet. She believed that “there is no way I could gain
weight in Russia because I couldn't afford to eat the amount of food it would take to eat in
Russia”. Despite these challenges, everyone was able to eat and continue their experience as
tourists.
Perceptions of Russia: Being a Tourist
Participants were asked about their thoughts on being a tourist in Russia, including their
reactions to the accommodations. The most common challenge expressed by participants was not
having a familiarity with the language and in particular the Cyrillic alphabet. Specifically, in
Moscow, few people spoke English and all signage was in Cyrillic. Carrie explained that the
challenge was “Not only not knowing the language but also the script was completely different,
Cyrillic alphabet too so that made travel and just going places a little more difficult than I was
used to.” Jane and Julie had similar experiences, as did Tammy who said,
the difficult thing about being a tourist in Russia which I managed to get around
eventually was the Cyrillic writing, not the language so much but the writing. Once we
all started to figure it out, how to decipher the letters it was much easier. They don’t
really, at least in Moscow; they don’t really go far out of their way in Moscow. When
you get to St. Petersburg though, they start putting things in at least English writing and
that helps out a lot. Yet in twenty years they haven’t gone very far out of their way for

106

their tourists in Moscow, I don’t think. They still have to figure out how to, I don’t think
they really care about tourists in Moscow, where they really do in St. Petersburg, because
that’s their living.
Noted Jane, “There was culture shock and the language barrier. That was hard because if you
needed something not a lot of Russian knew English. I felt out of place for a couple days trying
to get used to the surroundings and environment.” Julie offered that
It was really the language that got me. In Moscow not a whole lot of things were in
English, not even in the metro. But I felt like I adjusted very quickly compared to the
other students. Sometimes I felt really unsure of myself because we didn’t know the area.
So I did ask the locals a few times how to get to where we were going.
Communicating, for some, required pointing at things.
Helen: I enjoyed being a tourist. I had people stop me especially when I had my little
scarf on, I think they thought I was a Russian. They would ask me some question in
Russian and I would say “no speaka Russian”. They would seem kind of surprised and go
off. Like I said, you could communicate through pointing and they were receptive to that.
There were some English menus in the restaurants and some waiters that could take it in
English. And I like said, I got us all the way through the subway, when neither one of us
could understand each other as far as speaking. So I thought the experience was real
good.
Although a few participants adjusted quickly, Carrie expressed one common view that
participants had a constant awareness that they were seen as outsiders.
I know I, we stood out because people would stare at us. I don’t know if it was because
we were a herd or because if there was something different about our demeanor or where
our eyes were looking. But I know we definitely stood out as a group because when we
would ride the subway, people would look at us or at me, I never really felt like I was… I
felt like I looked like them, but I felt like they knew I was an outsider. Or I could just be
me pushing my perceptions out on them and they could have just been looking around
and just happened to look at me.
Unfortunately, some viewed Moscow as not being a tourist-friendly city and there were
tourist traps everywhere. Adding to this feeling, as Kim explains below, was a noticeable police
or military presence demonstrated by metal detectors encountered at the Kremlin and Red Square
and security forces stationed in public spaces with rifles.

107

I guess I wasn’t expecting like the second time we went to red square when we were
going to see the Kremlin, that there would be metal detectors. I guess at museums here in
the US they don’t have metal detectors. At least the presence of law enforcement or the
military or police, they seemed to like to show the public their presence and that they
were there. I guess that might seem like they were more controlling, so that I don’t think
that much effect on me as a tourist, it didn’t scare me or anything. There a lot more coat
checks and stuff like that and I wasn’t used to that. But with the colder climate, there
were a lot more people carrying their coats around and possibly make it easier to steal
stuff.
Finally, the population lacked ethnic diversity and unexpectedly felt very European. As a result,
Ann and Sherry felt a disconnect with how they felt and what their surroundings said they should
feel. Ann said,
Once again I didn’t know the language so I felt like an idiot, like a dumb tourist that
didn’t know anything. Going in I didn’t know what to expect of Russia, but it was fun
and the people were pretty nice. I just couldn’t understand their culture could feel so
European and white, there was something wrong around that.
Sherry’s disconnection was evident when she said,
I think as Americans we really take it for granted that we expect people to understand
English when we’re in another country. So that makes me a little bit more aware when
I’m here to be more sensitive to people who do not have a grasp of the English language.
That was one thing I found.
Despite these challenges, most students overcame these hurdles and enjoyed themselves. Several
positive moments were noted by participants. For example, Jill noted
I really enjoyed visiting the Red Square in Moscow and seeing not only the outside of St.
Basil’s but also the inside. Also visiting the Kremlin and getting to go inside the Kremlin
was really awesome. And in St. Petersburg I enjoyed going to the presidential library not
just for a tour but for being able to go in and listen to all the presentations from all our
distance colleagues to learn about their perspectives. And of course I really love
museums, so visiting the Hermitage was also really cool. Those were some highlights as
myself as a tourist.
Nancy described what she enjoyed,
I appreciated the fact that many of the sites were open without charge to people. I think
that’s a holdover from the socialist days. I truly enjoyed that. There are not many
countries that I’ve been in that you can just go into these big parks and walking around
without having to pay some kind of admission fee. I found that to be very nice. On the
other hand, paying to get into churches was different than what I had experienced in other

108

countries. Typically it’s vice versa, you don’t pay to get into the churches and cathedrals
but you do pay to get into the other sites. And it was just the opposite in Russia, all the
churches and cathedrals charged and many of the sites did not.
Additionally, Lynn commented on how easy it was to get around using the metro in Moscow and
Nancy thought it was great having everything within walking distance in St. Petersburg.
Most participants also reported a positive experience with their accommodations. Sixtythree percent liked the Moscow hotel and 69% liked the hotel in St. Petersburg. To Lynn, the
Moscow hotel felt “like an American-style hotel” and the “perfect business hotel.” Jill felt the
front desk staff was willing to answer all kinds of questions pleasantly. Angie specifically shared
one example:
I really thought the hotel in Moscow, the Aerostar was very nice. They spoke English
which helped you; you could ask questions without looking in a book to try to tell them.
The funny thing was I tried to tell them remote control or remote and they had no idea
what I was talking about which was kind of funny. I thought “oh my god, he doesn’t
understand a thing.” And I had to do the clicker movement with my thumb and hand…
and then they were like ‘oh we can replace that for you’ because had lost ours at one
point. So it was nice that they spoke English and then you realize you had to watch some
of the slang because some of those words they may never have heard of in their lives. It
was very funny.
Whereas the Moscow hotel provided a number of amenities including a money exchange
machine, thick blackout curtains, and a lot of space to sit, the St. Petersburg hotel, Tammy and
Lynn noted, “was nicer than Moscow.” Lending to this experience was its location and as Jill
said, “We could walk anywhere from it!” and the hotel also had free Internet and a small
refrigerator in the rooms, all hotel staff were nice. There were newer, more comfortable rooms,
and a “beautiful view” and Kim compared of the two hotels.
The Aerostar (Moscow) was a lot bigger. It had more amenities. I don’t know that we,
everybody, that we used all of the sauna, or pool, or work-out room even though I had
intentions of doing. They offered a better breakfast. As for comfort, I would say the bed
and bathrooms, I liked them almost equally. The hotel in St. Petersburg could have used
some better curtains especially at night, I had a mask to sleep in but I know some people
were complaining it didn’t block out the light very much. But definitely the Aerostar
seemed to be a pricier place and the restaurant being so expensive.
109

Each of the hotels provided different features which were attractive to different participants.
Being a tourist in Russia was a unique experience for the group. Laura explained the key thing
that made Russia a comfortable tourist location when she said, “The Russians didn’t seem to
mind. They knew we were tourist and they tried to help you a little bit. I thought it was great. I’ll
definitely go again.” Although trepidation about visiting Russia was real for some of the
participants, this section showed that participants learned a lot about Russian culture and
customs, while enjoying themselves.
Impressions of Libraries Visited
Participants interacted with four libraries. These were the

The two Russian libraries were examined first and then the school libraries were
addressed in significant detail.
Impressions: Russian Libraries
Participants visited two Russian libraries, the Russian National Public Library for Science
and Technology and the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library in St. Petersburg. Each library had a
different goal and a distinct feel. The Russian National Public Library for Science and
Technology, according to their website, was described as:

a comprehensive collection of scientific and technical publications in natural and
applied sciences, technology, and economics
the state depository of Russian and foreign Sci-Tech publications
the federal center of information and telecommunication technologies, which
provides access to foreign and Russian resources on the Internet
a scientific, methodological, and training center
the developer of IRBIS, library automated system, which has become very
popular in Russia and the CIS (about 1500 libraries)
the holder of the Russian Union Catalog of Sci-Tech publications

(NPLS&T Russia, 2011, General Information section)

However, participants described this library generally as in vast need of renovation. It had leaky
HVAC units, having to go through a lot of security to only see a conference room, with no tour
of the physical premises. The main frustration was not getting to see behind the scenes or where
the patrons would use retrieved materials. The presentation focused on the librarians talking
about their technology and records management. Despite this, participants had some positive
library impressions. Nancy “liked the fact that it was this old building, walking up the steps that
were worn away with years and years of use, just going into that room and having them talk
about their digital projects and … more about cataloging. They were very engaged and very
professional.” Sherry thought “it was interesting to hear about their policies, what they’re doing
and everything.” Finally, Carrie gave an account of her entire visit, saying
We went to the National Sci/Tech Library. It’s closed stacks from what I understand; so,
we didn’t’ really get to see the reading room area if there is one or the place where the
patrons use the materials inside the library. But it’s a neat institution. There was a talk
from the administration there. It was neat to hear how different it was. Most of the public
libraries were under the ministry and they had this one outlier over here underneath a
different ministry so it made me think about the bureaucracy involved. Then I thought
about this massive country and all these different libraries that they’re trying to organize.
Here we have our regional library associations, where you kind of have school librarians
that can meet, public librarians that can meet and special libraries. Even here we don’t all
work together. It’s more like a web. But the science library was neat. It would have been
neat to see the stacks but it wasn’t a big deal since it wasn’t what we were there for.
Unfortunately most of the other participants found the experience lacking both in the library
itself and the presentation provided. Tammy remarked that “we all expected to see more than just
a conference room and with the amount of security we went through it would have been nice to
see a bit more.” Regarding the physical state of the building, Laura and Mary were the most
vocal. Laura noted

111

The science library was terrible. I thought we were going to go get to see a library not to
get a lecture. I was really disappointed because I wanted to see a library and I didn’t
understand the lecture that they were giving me because it was in Russian and there was
water dripping on my arm the whole time.
Mary was disappointed, saying
I thought it was a dump. But I understand that they’re moving so it wasn’t so bad. If
they’re moving I don’t see it’s a big deal. I can understand why they let go in disarray.
The a/c dripped on me the whole time so that wasn’t any fun.
However, the main disappointment appeared to be not being able to see how the library
functioned. Julie described this best:
We went to a public library, it was supposed to be a public library but there was a guard
outside who had to check your paperwork before you could go in and not just anybody
could get a card. It was mainly just students that could even though it was a public library
for their idea of public access was very different too. I didn’t really get to see they
interacted with their public/their patrons.
This was echoed by several of the other students and Jane said, “They had the talk about and we
didn’t actually get to see the bookshelves or anything like that.” Jill commented that “we were
given a small tour and had a question and answer session with the head of collection. I was a
little disappointed that we didn’t see physical books, but I understand that they were under
construction.” Nancy felt “disappointed that we weren’t offered the opportunity to tour at least
one floor or one section of it.” Kim “didn’t get to see much at all of the Sci/Tech library. I was
interested to see how that was laid out but we just spoke to a couple of people who worked
there.” Glen, also expressed this appointment but gave a possible explanation for the situation.
“In the technological library, I kind of expected closed stacks. We didn’t get to see much of the
collection but I was impressed with how big the collection was from what they told us and the
breadth of the collection.”
Participants left the National Public Library of Science and Technology generally
disappointed and offered a few salient points. Even though it was a “public library” not everyone

112

was admitted and not all residents were allowed borrowing privileges. Concerns for security
were more important than the physical environment for the collection. Lastly, Russian librarians
would rather talk about their accomplishments than show their operations.
In contrast, the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library amazed the participants. Many
described it as very different from their assumptions of a presidential library. Nancy’s reaction
was typical:
The Boris Yeltsin library was great to tour it. It was somewhat surprising that it was not
quite our perspective a library. It was a presidential library (that) in the fact doesn’t have
artifacts and memorabilia of a past president. It is a digitization project meant for a
national library. … I don’t even think a James Bond movie could come up with
something that is that wonderful. I was quite impressed. It’s quite an eye-opening
experience to think we are not the top dogs in technology.
The library caused so much dissonance to participants that many remarked on it. “The
presidential library was really a surprise because it didn’t really have any books in it. …
Everybody thinks that is what a library still is. It was definitely 21st century, not arcane or old,”
said Angie. Carrie explained that “(it) wasn’t really a library either. It was, if it was in the US,
more of an archive or digital archive center or that kind of thing. It was neat though to see the
different interpretations of the libraries.” Helen remarked on the resources. “I was surprised
about the Boris Yeltsin Library that there were basically no books that it was an all-electronic
library. Apparently the Boris Yeltsin links all of the Russian libraries together and has eBooks.
They had only about 12 books there lying on those tables where they had the exhibits, but that
was a surprise.” Glen made the difference more explicit and he
was kind of intrigued by the fact that it wasn’t necessarily Yeltsin’s papers. It’s not like
the libraries here. You go to the Nixon library and Nixon’s papers are there. Johnson’s
library you get Johnson’s papers. Reagan same thing, Bush same thing. It seemed more
of an archive than a library, more of a meeting space and a conference space.
Participants encountered a new world in library technology at the Presidential Library. They
were truly challenged in their expectations of libraries with this visit. Mary said, “they could
113

have locked me in there and I would have happily stayed. It was an IT person’s dream. I wanted
them to put me on the design team.” Lynn said she
questioned (herself) if this was really a library or if it was just a conference hall. It
seemed that it was setup really well for international conferences. They had the
technology and it was incredible and they could do simultaneous translation which was
great. There were monitors so that you could get close up shots of the people presenting.
Sherry found also that it
was really interesting because not only did we learn about what they were doing in the
library world out there in Russia which was totally amazing to me, but we actually got to
have somewhat of a tour. I really appreciated getting to see how their access to
information for people using the library. I thought it was really interesting, that floating
book (Figure 25) they had. It was digitalized so that you could turn the page digitally and
then look at it all around the whole entire thing.

Figure 25. Floating/3D book
From Julie’s perspective the library
was so grand but I was like where’s the books? I guess it was just called the presidential
library. It was all digital for the presidential library. They did provide access to the public
but again you had to have certain things to be granted access. They had the 3D book
(Figure 25) where you could turn the book around on your computer. It was very neat and
different. But the library seemed like more a museum than a library. More of a meeting
place, but it was a very beautiful building.
Jill shared the main learning element in visiting the presidential library.
It was actually, a little bit shocking because it wasn’t just your normal library that you
think of with shelves and shelves of books, but it was more a library of technologies and
advancements for the community and bringing together like our different library
colleagues and professionals to give conference there. I really just enjoyed that new take
of what I thought a library was.

Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Expectations
Before seeing the school libraries, participants expressed their expectations of them
through the pre-experience survey. Some aspects the participants agreed on. They imagined that
the school library in Russia would be large, with one area for the younger children and one for
the older children. On the whole, Helen suggested it would be a “helpful, friendly place” and
“clean and well-maintained” from Angie’s perspective. Overwhelmingly, participants predicted
the layout of the library in Russia as a “traditional school library setting,” as Jane described, with
a reference desk, shelves, desks, and chairs. Ann believed it would be “well stocked.”
With other aspects, the group was split. Kim and Glen felt it would be “well-funded” as it
serves the primary school library for the US, UK, and Canadian embassies, whereas Tammy
believed it would reflect the nature of the current political climate. Although all seemed to
believe computers would be present, how plentiful was in debate. Meg, Nancy, and Lynn
speculated that there would be a computer area with lots of computers and Tammy believed it
would have relatively few computers. Jill, Sherry, and Nancy believed it would have an “open”
layout whereas Troy believed it might be “crowded or disorganized.” Carrie and Sherry
speculated that the library would have different sections for different items, either reading,
homework, fiction, or non-fiction collections. Lynn and Kim expected “very modern” libraries
while Mary projected that the library would be “empty” or “not on par with the US.”
Participants also expressed three different ways they expected usage would be different.
The first way reflected the amount of usage. Six participants believed that usage would be strong
or high. Lynn said that “I imagine that the library will be well used because it will be a place for
the school community to access foreign language materials.” Four students thought there would
be moderate to average usage, whereas only one responded that it would be minimal. The second

115

way was type of usage. Those activities participants believed would happen at the library
included school projects, reading, class visits, check outs, database usage, research, and library
assistance. The last way was attitudes towards usage. Glen believed that the library patrons
would be enthusiastic in their usage.
Overall, many participants expected there would be little difference when comparing the
host library to a US school library. Those that granted there would a minor difference believed it
would be in regards to language – both the one used and as a collection focus area. Others
expressed wonder about the availability of wireless Internet, priorities and protocols, national
library policy, historical/cultural expectations, the classification system used, having open/closed
stacks, as well as the quantity and types of resources available. One comment explicitly proposed
that “Russian libraries may cater to certain populations (whereas) US libraries (are) more helpful
to general populations.”
Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Initial Impressions
Participants faced their predictions as they worked at two different campuses of the
Anglo-American Schools in Russia. Participants reviewed each of these libraries from the
perspectives of layout, collection, technology, patrons, library staff, and a general comparison to
US school libraries. The participants found these libraries had many of the same policies and
systems in place as an US school’s library. Carrie, who worked in a public library, expressed that
they “were more like American libraries in Russia.” The libraries appeared to function much as a
school library in the US. The catalog system was Destiny. Students had access to computers,
databases, DVDs, electronic books, e-readers, as well as traditional media. This similarity
allowed participants to see the libraries with more of a critical eye and provided feedback on
what worked and what challenges the libraries and librarians faced.

116

Initial impressions: AAS Moscow. Jill explained that “they did divide the library into two. One
for upper level and there was the library for middle/elementary.” Initial reactions were
enthusiastic, positive responses.
Troy: “That was a lot nicer facility than I had expected. The collection in Moscow was a
lot larger and in a lot better shape than I had anticipated.”
Lynn: “I also noticed that they had a pretty foreign language section especially in the
elementary library. They had materials in many different languages many more than I would
have thought of on the face.”
Tammy: “Fantastic!” “I wish I could have sent my kids to that school.”
Angie: “Beautiful!”
Troy: “It was like a high dollar private school in Dallas.”
Nancy: “The support for the library was amazing.”
Glen: “I was surprised with the Moscow library. How similar it was... I haven’t been in a
HS library in forever, but comparing to public or academic libraries here. It didn’t seem the least
bit different.”
The libraries were located on the fourth floor and Troy “learned that historically when
they drew up the plans for the school, they forgot to put a place for the library”. To construct it,
several classrooms were combined to make two libraries on different corners of the 4th floor.
Several participants expressed concerns with the resulting layout. Both libraries, the elementary
and the high school, were small and in need of room to expansion. Carrie, Kim, Julie, and Mary
remarked on the high school library having a slanted roof, which was one factor that made
furniture placement difficult. Another challenge this layout had was noted by Julie.
Normally, all the libraries in schools that I have been in were this very nice open square
and the way the books are arranged around that square. There was a backdoor at the

117

library and the bookcases were in the way. You couldn’t see the kids; you couldn’t see
who was coming or going through that back door. That was really awkward.
Despite the layout challenges of the upper level library, Jill felt that they
had a large selection of books and it was just larger in size (than the elementary). The
upper level also had separate rooms off to the side where students could go in and maybe
have a study session or a quiet place to work. (The library) wasn’t just for the school; it’s
also for the community. It did have more of an adult section and they also have little
areas for reading, kind of like reading nooks for people to come in and use.
This made for a conducive space for the entire community.
The elementary library tried to create separate spaces for the collection, group work, and
story time. Sherry liked some of these spaces, “they had the little space chairs with the bean bags
and stuffed animals. I liked how they really portrayed one world, captured faces of people from
different countries all holding hands in the elementary. They had the computers all in the one
spot and then separate areas for each.” Unfortunately, it lacked the physical room to adequately
accommodate all of them. Angie felt that “it was definitely small. They had outgrown their space
by a long shot.” In spite of this, the librarian had worked hard to provide book displays but
according to Carrie,
their decoration was a little much with the puppets everywhere, like no table top could be
left uncovered. I know that I’ve learned when you put books out to be seen, they check
out better. So it makes sense to let the kids see the front page of books and see the cover
because they’re going to check out more if they can see that rather than the spine label,
but having every flat piece of space in the library covered isn’t necessarily a good thing.
It kind of makes it looked cluttered.
Most of the participants were impressed by the school library in Moscow. “For the libraries at
the Anglo-American School of Moscow and St. Petersburg there was no limit to their financial
support so we were able to suggest procedures that smaller libraries might not be able to
support,” said Laura. However, it may have been exactly this organization and affluence that
contributed to participants not having as rich of an experience as they wanted.

118

Initial impressions: AAS St. Petersburg. Unfortunately, the consensus regarding the St.
Petersburg library was not as favorable. Participants believed that it needed a more work;
specifically, Mary felt “it was a real disorganized mess” and not well designed. Further, the
quality of the collection and the amount of processing outstanding were subpar, and overall it
was very small with a lot of problems and “the librarian there was nice enough but obviously
wasn’t an educated librarian. So she was somewhat grateful for everything we did, but she didn’t
really know what she was doing either.”
Mary and Nancy also expressed concern about the layout of the libraries. Nancy said, it
was tough “having these two different libraries on two different floors with one librarian running
back and forth and sometimes a paraprofessional filling in the time at the other location.” Mary
“didn’t care for them being on two different floors. There’s a lot of running up and down. And
the bottom one didn’t have anything in it so I wasn’t really worried about it. I just thought that
the libraries seemed to be an afterthought.”
The staff member attempted to decorate the elementary library, but participants
commented that the high school library looked more like a conference room with little thought to
study or relaxation spaces for the students. Sherry said,
The walls were blank. Even if they are stuck in those little rooms, they could have more
things in there to make it more user friendly including not just a table but lounge or bean
bag chairs, put stuff up on the walls and do not leave it blank and make it look like a jail
cell.
However, at least two participants felt that it was because of these issues that the St. Petersburg
library met their expectations. Glen compared the library to his previous international
experiences and determined that
The (library) in St. Petersburg at the school was more of what I expected. In terms of I
guess of the quality of the collection the organization of the collection the amount of
processing that need to be done with the collection […] St. Petersburg was kind of what I
had anticipated going into the whole project.
119

“The library in St. Petersburg was much more like I had expected going in,” Troy said,
“something that was, had some assets, some collection but needed organization badly.”
Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Collections
When the participants looked at the collections for the two locations, much of the same
disconnect surfaced. When describing the Moscow libraries, Lynn exclaimed, “I thought the
collection was amazing.” Others used the words “awesome,” “pretty up to date,” “enticing,” and
“phenomenal.” Particularly, several were amazed at the quality and availability of subcollections. Sherry and Julie mentioned the graphic novels. Whereas Carrie mentioned the depth
of the world languages collection. At the same time, Lynn showed appreciation for the library’s
professional development reading room and Carrie, Lynn and Angie found the travel collection
to be extensive. However, it was the items for the local adult ex-patriate community such as
contemporary DVDs, books, magazines, and newspapers that solicited the highest amount of
praise. The Moscow collection “function(ed) as a public library for the greater English speaking
community” according to Lynn. It was best described by Sherry as one that had “a variety that
could encourage lifelong reading.” The only concern being the need for weeding the sciences, as
expressed by Carrie and Kim.
By contrast, although the collection provided the essentials to support the curriculum at
the St. Petersburg’s school, the remainder of the collection suffered from the younger sibling
syndrome. Kim commented that “obviously they were getting a lot of books from Moscow. It
seemed like they were getting a lot of hand-me downs. I don’t know if that’s necessarily what
they needed.” Sherry’s comment provided the best example of what participants felt:
It kind of seemed hit and miss. I didn’t seem like a complete collection, especially not for
students. They could have a little more popular series too. It didn’t seem like what they
had really encouraged reading for pleasure, reading for fun, and creating readers for life.

120

With school libraries, it’s not just about having school and doing research for school but
also to provide a place where can learn to read for pleasure.
Participants posited two reasons for their disappointment with the collection. The first was
presented by Troy was that “it’s just so startup. The books need to be organized and the
collection needs to be expanded.” Even though, the school had just moved into a larger building,
the library did not have enough space for a decent collection. Second, it was proposed that it did
not receive the same significant budget that Moscow was allotted. Sherry had the impression
from the pre-experience chats that “it (was) a private school with a large budget.” But according
to Kim, “the (St. Petersburg) school was a lot smaller and had fewer students and probably a
smaller budget. Especially with sharing one librarian, it seemed hard.”
Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Technology
When asked about their expectations of technology availability and integration at the
library prior to visiting the school libraries in Russia, responses were divided. Half expected the
technology levels to be similar if not slightly higher than a US school library, because they
visited a private school with a large budget, including items such as an online catalog (OPAC), ebooks, and databases. Glen, who has participated in previous programs, believed that this library
would have more advanced technology than other sites. Kim said, “We went into expecting
(technology availability) to be similar or high just because of the resources that they had. They
had a healthy budget and that a lot of the kids were tech savvy.” A couple of students expressed
no awareness of what they were walking into with Kim specifically citing a dichotomy of
possibilities. “I think technology will either by readily available OR hardly present because many
of the student have their own computers/laptops or e-readers.” The remaining group believed that
although technology may be present, it would be less available than at a US school library and
may be as minimal as computers with Internet access.

121

Both of these possibilities provided true once the participants visited two campuses,
Moscow and St. Petersburg. The impressions of Moscow’s technology were overall positive.
Mary: “The one in Moscow was really nicely setup.”
Nancy: “Very few libraries I have been to have a setup as nice as that.”
Helen: “We came to a pretty wealthy (library). I think they probably had the latest
technology.”
Sherry: “They have the cream of the crop. I was really impressed.”
Lynn: “(Availability of technology was) very very very high. I cannot use the word
VERY enough.”
Troy: “Moscow, again, that was top of the line. There are a lot of schools in the states
that would have liked to have that setup.”
Participants’ comments focused on overall technology resources available, the amount of
network security encountered, Internet and wireless access, and the students’ level of technical
competency. Participants observed a wide collection of resources (Table 9) beyond computers
and Internet access that were available in Moscow.

Glen even compared it to his local public library with its open access stations and
printing capabilities. Nancy also expressed appreciation for their on-site tech support:
I was quite impressed with the tour and the comments by the IT departments. They took
quite a bit of time getting the IT group, the tour of the facilities, the services, what’s
being done, what has been done, what will be done. It was quite comprehensive. I think
they are probably primo. It says something for an IT department when the youngest
person has been there three years and everyone else has longevity. I think that says a lot
about a group. And they were all young and energetic and happy and one day they got a
new iPad when we were touring and the next day we were outside, Mary and I were
walking we saw them with the iPad trying to fly some robo-helicopter. And they were all
just typical IT guys entertaining.
Also, participants also remarked on the students’ technological competency. Kim felt that “a lot
of the kids were tech savvy.” Lynn, who has worked as a teacher, explained that “the kids at
AAS (were) much more knowledge savvy than kids I have dealt with in the US.” The students
were “doing their projects on the computer and presentations” observed Angie.
Finally, only Tammy seemed to express disappointment in Moscow’s technology:
I think state side we have more than Robert had even though his was adequate. And with
the country itself there’s a lot of blocks. To just check it out, I tried to order a book on
amazon while I was over there and it said you couldn’t do that. I could order it just fine
but I had to come back to the US to have it show up on my kindle.
The only comments regarding the St. Petersburg’s library’s technology were that they saw very
little and what they did see was it was low-key compared to Moscow. Additionally, it was in St.
Petersburg that participants ran into the most network security. Although they appreciated
Internet being available all over the school, the firewall being was locked down and there were
many rules to Internet access for visitors.

123

As shown, the comparison between the two campuses was stark. Moscow had greater
resources and organization. St. Petersburg wanted for everything. Again, by going to Moscow,
what Mary said, “I think that we got spoiled and we probably didn’t gain as much knowledge as
we could have,” may actually have been a larger factor than the project team realized.
Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Patrons
When considering the patrons before going to Russia, participants expected that library
patrons would be predominantly students with some library services also being provided to
parents, school staff, and the general public. Most believe that these patons would be
international (non-Russian) from many countries, including US ex-patriots and the children of
diplomats. Participants provided a number of descriptors for what traits they expected patrons to
have:

From direct observation, participants learned that students, teachers, and some adults visited the
AAS libraries. Little was said about the teachers, except these comment from Angie, “Teachers
were definitely using it. I would say patrons were very involved.” As far as adult patrons, there
was one incident of note. Apparently a parent wanted to buy the book from the library and the
staff managed to tactfully inform her that this was not how libraries worked. only Carrie
mentioned the incident between library staff and a mom. “It was all positive besides that one
124

kind of not real negative thing about the woman that wanted to keep the book.” Participants did
make a significant number of observations about the student patrons which included areas
ranging from their competency, interactions with staff, and confidence using resources. Nancy
shared
I never saw any issues that you might expect… What I saw was a good interaction
between the librarian and the patron. There was always just "Hi. How are you? Here are
my books. Here are the books I want to check out”. There always seemed to be an
interaction between the patrons and the staff. There didn’t seem to be just a kid slapping
the book down on the counter, getting it stamped, and leaving the library. There was none
of that. I think they had a good relationship with their patrons. And I think the patrons
show that with their interactions.
Likewise, Mary commented that
In Moscow I saw a lot of patrons just hanging out in the library, using the facilities, and
playing on their laptops. They were polite but I think that’s just their general culture at
the school to be polite. I was thoroughly surprised when they (library staff) told us that
they don’t have any drug or alcohol problems in their students. That was surprising. So
maybe those children are cream of the crop and have nice manners.
The focus of comments about elementary and high school students did vary however.
As participants watched elementary students in the library, most comments were about
the students’ level of interaction. Jane saw that “they liked the story time, getting their books,
and checking them out.” Laura caught them using some of the tools the librarian had put in place
for the students to interact with the library such as “a cool system of a yardstick to mark their
spot so they could reshelf the books themselves which I thought was awesome instead of putting
them aside and (the librarian) having to reshelf them all herself. I mean they loved it. They (also)
had their little book passport things for stamps.” Jill saw that “in the lower library, which were
younger kids, they tended to interact more and ask more questions. Also, they just talked a little
bit more, and not only about the library, but also about the classes they were in or teachers they
had. So it seemed more of a friendship with the librarians.” Perhaps this was a result of what
Tammy observed “in the elementary, they seem(ed) to have a lot of confidence in what they are
125

doing, which (meant) they are being taught well.” Finally, Carrie and Angie both commented on
the enthusiasm the elementary students bought to their library experiences. Carrie said,
The elementary school kids were all excited about the books, the puppets and the story
time. They (were) excited to see, read the story. They liked to explore the collection. At
times they got a little bit loud I guess because they were shushed.
Angie also noted,
I would say they really enjoyed it. I would say that the little kids of course they’re kind of
herded in, they loved story time though were always excited, sometimes overly excited
they wanted to talk and not listen. But that’s an age thing. Always, I even saw kids help
other kids find a book “I’ve read that and it’s great!”. And be really excited about the
item that they were checking out or the subject that they were to read about.
In addition, Glen said that high school students, “seemed to show ownership. I didn’t see anyone
who was kind of sulking around or nervous or looked like they didn’t need to be there. Everyone
who was there just seemed to naturally go about their business. They seemed relaxed and in their
element.” These students did not interact with the staff as much and viewed the library
differently than their younger counterparts. Two recurring sentiments about the students were
how they used the library’s resources (Table 10) and how they used the library’s space (Table
11).

Jill

They didn’t really tend to interact with the librarians as much as the students in the lower level
library. This could be from experience, already knowing what they wanted in material or
resources…
The upper level library had of course a larger area, in some instances a larger collection of certain
materials, such as maybe DVDs or other resources that students felt comfortable going in and
using.

the kids in the secondary library, most of the kids knew to go to the computer, pull up the catalog
and they were able to manipulate the catalog like nothing I’d ever seen. Better than many adults
that I’ve seen. They were able to look at the screen and could figure out what they knew and use
what they knew to figure out what they didn’t know. They were able to pretty quickly determine
key words that would be most helpful in helping them find the information that they were looking
for. It wouldn’t have surprised me if these kids could do advanced searches with Boolean and
truncation in their searches. I wish the students that I work with would be able to search with good
vocabulary. My students their website of choice is Wikipedia. If it’s not on Wikipedia then it
doesn’t exist. I tell them don’t use Wikipedia for research.

Angie

Definitely always asking questions though, looking for something, putting something on hold.

I remember seeing a lot of kids studying. ... It seemed like a well-used space. Even if they weren’t
there looking around or checking things out, they were using the couches to read books and study
and things like that.

Carrie

the teens were typical teens in that they wanted to use the computers, they wanted to study at the
tables kind of loud, the library is a place where you hang out and be yourself.

Laura

The older high-schoolers used the library more as a place to get together. They really weren’t
attacking the books as much as the younger kids. They were there to talk and not have to be in the
lunch room or wherever they were supposed to be. They could go to the library and chill instead of
the cafeteria or something..

Angie

With the older kids, I would say they like it as a social space. They get their items, their books, but
they really like it because of what it offers, the space, the quiet, or get online or go in a corner with
their homework and get it done. Or just sit and talk for a little bit.

Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Library Staff
In the pre-experience survey, participants were asked to describe the staff they might
encounter. Among participants, minimum expectations of the education and experience levels of
AAS library staff ranged from high school, bachelors or more, to “top notch” or “highly
educated” (expressed as masters or more). Other participants believed the requirements would be
the same as for US school librarians and that those requirements would vary by the staff
member’s position.
127

Library staff: Moscow. Assisting students in Moscow was a collection of two librarians,
Robert and Jennifer, and several library assistants. When asked, participants did not appear to
have a consistent understanding of the educational level held by staff members. Most believed
that the two librarians had a Masters in Library and Information Science and teaching
experience. As for the paraprofessionals, most felt that they all had at least a Bachelor’s degree
in something. Regardless of education level, overall participants expressed that all of the staff
were not only “very knowledgeable with their job but also with interacting with patrons,
welcoming and available to answer questions, adaptable, knew their systems and environment.”
Several observations were made regarding our hosts, Robert and Jennifer, in particular.
Carrie had several comments about the AAS library staff. When talking about the staff as
a whole, she said “it was good to see that the same kind of customer service thing happens there
as it does here.” She felt that Robert underestimates his work. “He would be like “this little
thing? It’s not really that great” and then he gives you this document of his work plan from the
previous year and it’s wonderful. He’s excellent at conveying his strategic plan in a sense just for
himself and his goals and what he wants to do in the next year.” Also, “at one point I asked to
talk to teachers and student and Robert was like ‘they won’t have anything good to say.’ That is
Robert and he was self-deprecating…but in the hallways I would say hi to students and what do
you think of the library and they were like it’s good and no one had anything negative to say.”
Carrie saw a difference in personalities between Robert and Jennifer. Where Robert was more
welcoming and humble, “Jennifer was much more reserved and more watchful as to what we
were up to.” Her style focused on retaining control and Carrie
saw a little bit of her interacting with kids, but it was much more strict or structured with
her view of how kids should act in a library. But it can’t be chaotic at the elementary age
if you don’t keep the order so it makes sense…I thought her tone was a little bit harsh at

128

times, but I understand if you’re around that many kids all day long, your patience can
wear thin perhaps, but that’s just a little thing.
Beyond her demeanor, Jennifer appeared to be successful at her job.
I saw Jennifer do a story time and it just happened to be after I had just done the story
time presentation. So it was neat to see her doing the voices and stuff that I had talked
about…it was neat to see what she had learned in library school and through her
experiences was the same thing I was bringing to the table.
Several others echoed Carrie’s observations:
Laura: “Jennifer was super nice. She was always great with the kids and Robert was
trying to be everybody’s buddy. They were not like the librarians where I work where
they shush me every five seconds for laughing. My voice carries but they were going
with the flow. They were trying to be super helpful and very relaxed with (patrons).”
“Robert’s trying to sell his library; he was doing a really great job with the TVs and
trying to get movies and stuff. In the part when I’ve been to the library, that hasn’t been
the case for most school libraries. They haven’t tried to create that culture like he was
trying to do.”
“Robert has really had a high level and knows what he’s doing. He’s trying to create a
culture there that will help all libraries in the future because the kids that go there are
going to learn how to value the library.”
Nancy: “(The library staff members) were engaged; they were friendly; and they were
welcoming. They were everything you would hope librarians would be. Their customer
service skills were excellent. I thought they were very good libraries. Very very good
librarians.”
“I thought they worked well with the students. They presented the information on their
levels. They did not talk down to them.”
Angie: “I would say they’re very versatile because you have to be able to work with
different ages, different ethnicities and be able to answer the questions and get some
items they’re requesting and trying to looking for. I know that I saw Robert go from
talking to a 10-year-old to a 45 year old and was able to talk to that age group
appropriately.”
Jane: “Jennifer showed good search methods and children’s literacy skills.”
Glen: “I thought Robert and Jennifer did a good job in terms of merchandising and
making materials accessible.”
Kim: “As far as being organized, organizational skills, Jennifer she already had a
curriculum of the coming year of what the teachers planned to teach in the fall and so that
could help her think about what she needed to do with them for the upcoming school
year. So I thought that was really good.”

129

Overall, participants exhibited a high level of admiration for the work that the AAS Moscow
librarians did. They were pleased at the level of service and attention the librarians provided to
their patrons.
Library staff: St. Petersburg. The library staff in St. Petersburg highlighted the
differences between professionally trained librarians and other library staff. According to Lynn,
I think what distinguished the librarians vs. the library staff was just where to go to get
information. I think if library staff would have known where to go they were all capable
of explaining to the students in a way they could understand. It’s just a question of they
didn’t know where to go. They are not aware of the vast resources that are out there
besides books.
Overall, library staff at both locations were not very technical and needed some additional
automation and cataloging skills. This seemed particularly true at the AAS St. Petersburg library.
Participants repeated mentioned her lack of previous library knowledge. In fact, Sherry said that
I know that the librarian at St. Petersburg, she was the librarian because she was the wife
of somebody there. That’s not how you choose a librarian. She was nice and everything,
but is that really how you’re going to choose someone to take care of a collection? She
had no library experience what so ever.
Tammy internalized this difference by expressing that she now "understands why they are
making all of us get masters; that there was a big difference, even in her self-confidence.” These
differences showed up in skill level and professional ability several times between
Robert/Jennifer and the woman in St. Petersburg.
Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Compared to US 6chool /ibraries
Lastly, participants were asked to compare the AAS libraries to a US school library. The
resounding answer said best by Lynn was that “those libraries were just like walking into any
school library that I’ve ever been to in the US.” Many of the processes similar for Glen as he said
“cataloging was cataloging; circulation was circulation.” 71% of the participants felt that the
AAS student patrons reflected US students directly.

130

There were three areas that participants did express difference were: technology, budget,
and the population served. Participants focused on the budget available to the AAS librarians.
According to Sherry, “we just don’t get that kind of funding. You have to fight for every dollar
here.” The budget appeared to support a variety of resources and programs. Carrie, who works in
public libraries, said,
they had more money than I expected so they had good materials and even materials
beyond books. They had their story time extenders like big books and they had their
puppets and they had great technology. They had a print release station which was really
nice. A lot of schools around here don’t have that.
When comparing the populations served, Jane observed that “in the US it seems like there’s not a
whole lot of (patrons) taking advantage of what’s in the library”. Whereas it seemed that the
AAS libraries were revered as English speaking havens. They served a grateful ex-pat
community as libraries providing materials for more than just the students. Carrie felt “they were
more like a public library. They get things for the entire community rather than just the students
and that’s unique.” These libraries served English speaking adults unable to use the Russian
libraries, families of the student population, and had programs for three year olds.
Anglo-American Schools of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Constructive Conclusions
Finally, participants were given an opportunity to provide compliments and constructive
criticism for the AAS libraries. At the Moscow library, the main suggestions for improvement
revolved around space and layout. Participants expressed a hope that the school would look into
allotting more physical space for the library. Jill remembered that
they were talking about expanding. I actually agree that would be a good option, just
because they were a multi-type library not just for the school but also for the community.
They needed more room for collections, more room for materials, and also just more
room to help with the computers.
Angie went a little bit farther providing some explicit ideas.

131

In Moscow the elementary needed to expand. They needed their own meeting room for a
multipurpose room with computers in it where they could do presentations, whether for
classes, admin, or faculty. Study rooms, they were my main, number one thing. Study
rooms for the older kids or just study rooms for everyone to use. Study rooms for
teachers to do testing for kids with special needs, a quiet space kids can use for an hour or
two…Maybe more plugs for kids to plug up their laptops or iPads or phones that they are
using. Then of course the elementary school needed at least one more room of space to
move the computer stuff back a little and just breathing for all the items they have.
The only technology suggestion in Moscow was to investigate a change in the catalog system
which would allow the libraries to check-in books from the other locations.
Suggestions for the St. Petersburg libraries were more basic in nature. The recurring
concerns were that they needed more materials and that it needed to be more inviting. Troy said
that “It looks like a startup. The books need to be organized, the collection expanded and there is
a lack of technology.” Sherry had a stronger opinion,
Anything they did would be an improvement. Because that, to me, was more of a storage
room not really a library. … The walls were blank. Even if they are stuck in those little
rooms, they could have more things in there to make it more user friendly. It could
include not just a table but lounge or bean bag chairs, put stuff up on the walls, and not
leave it blank and make it look like a jail cell.
To various degrees, all of the participants expressed the need for changes with the St. Petersburg
library these two areas.
Constructive support: Both libraries. Several conclusions offered addressed both
libraries. Participants mentioned favorably existing signage, book displays, and the careful
customization of the libraries’ website. Other specifics were praised such as when Jill, Troy,
Glen, and Kim liked having different spaces for the lower level and Carrie noted upper level
grades not using lexiles to categorize students, and creating an environment that inviting enough
for students to hang out afterschool as noted by Kim, Julie, Angie.
Participants also provided a few suggestions that focused on policies and procedures. For
instance, participants were mixed on their thoughts about the catalog system used. Some felt that

132

it was excellent and in need of only a few adjustments. Others said did not meet the needs of the
libraries at all. Regardless, there were several suggested work flow processes to be changed that
their system should accommodate. Many of these suggestions were expanded upon by Carrie.
I would create a weeding schedule. … It’s the librarian’s job to do the evaluating and
only offer information that should be used, that’s the most current, the most accurate, and
written by the correct authority. … Also, they had like a system where you could only
check out the books depending on how old you are or what grade level you’re at. The 34-year-old, I don’t remember the rule was, in my opinion; let them check out what they
want to check out. That’s probably the public library rather than the school library in me,
but if you’re going to encourage reading, you encourage reading. You don’t make them
pick one book…Maybe, I don’t know how often they work with the PTO but definitely
having more of a volunteer presence. (Robert) said that with the culture there it wasn’t a
glamorous thing but I would definitely encourage it just for the community’s sake. If it is
a community library, then they need people from the community working there just so
that they can have some buy-in.
Lynn suggested “in a perfect world, I would want all of the classroom readers/texts in a central
location. I would want teachers to have to be able to come to the library staff to check it out so
there would be accountability of who has what. So at any moment in time we know who has
what and what there is so that we are not duplicating orders year after year.” Finally, Kim felt the
catalog system might be adjusted to allow the check-in/out of materials from all collections
despite physical location.
Constructive conclusions: Library staff. The last group of suggestions participants made
were constructive things that would help the library staff accomplish these tasks and changes.
Participant comments broke down into two categories, training and support. Tammy, Jane,
Sherry, and Lynn all agreed that library staff would benefit from additional education, in the
forms of database training, internal professional development with presentations between staff
members and to instructors, and access to online training such as webinars and workshops. Three
keys areas of support were identified. First, Ann, Glen, Laura and Angie commented that
additional labor was needed. Angie believed Jennifer was in the greatest need whereas Laura

133

believed it was the person in St. Petersburg. In either case, Angie felt that the biggest help would
be “more people to either volunteer unpaid or paid staff members to come in and provide
assistance.” Second, the librarians needed support from within the schools. Laura observed that
Robert was
creating the library culture and I think what he needs is the administrators at the school,
or the board or whoever they are, to get the library culture themselves. They need to get it
because the poor librarians say ‘we need this’ or ‘the library is good for this’ and it is
going to go unheard. If the administrators take it up, they could go to the teachers, and
then they could go to the students. It’s got to be more than one person. I know he is
working really hard to get more than one person on his bandwagon. If just the principal
would just jump on it with him and go, I think it would make his like a whole lot easier.
Third, participants felt that international librarianship could be isolating. Carrie suggested
interaction with other librarians through conferences and exchanges would allow these librarians
to “have the opportunity to get energized about what they do and feel community.” Overall,
participants believed that training and support would make the lives of the AAS library staff
much easier.
Impressions of the Overall Experience
The third part of the interviews encouraged the participants to move from looking
externally and their surroundings to looking internally at the group experience, their role in it,
and any personal growth as a result of it. Each participant self-evaluated what they learned
during the program with the interviewer. They reflected on what they learned from the
international library staff and their fellow participants and about how they would provide library
services in an international setting and interact with patrons/colleagues from other countries.
Additional observations were provided regarding any changes in perspective they noticed.
Overall experience: Group work. The participants spent two weeks at the AngloAmerican School in Moscow. During this time, they were broken into five teams to investigate
different aspects of the library’s operations. Participants had been forewarned in their online
134

chats that their work days at the school were going to be intense. Not only was each participant
to work actively within their group, they would be given opportunity to work with other groups
to see what each team was addressing. To aid with team expectations, each group had an
assigned support person and performed somewhat independently. The whole group successfully
completed its defined goals: perform an analysis of the AAS libraries. Individual groups had
their own challenges during the course of the week.
Group work: Policy team - The policy team’s member had a broad range of experience.
Cindy said, “I have not worked in a library, and aside from visiting them frequently and an
amazing practicum experience, I have not experience with them as a career;” on the other hand,
Carrie had worked as a professional librarian for several years. Their task was to compile all of
the policies regarding the operations of the library and with such a wide range of experience, the
team spent a lot of time talking about what their project was and exactly it should encompass. It
was through this constant conversation Cindy found an understanding of “what it takes to access
a library’s needs, as well as its users, and what it takes to run it from the technology side of it to
whether drinks without lids are permitted inside the library walls.” Tammy, also relatively new
to the field, felt that the mixed experience levels strengthened their group. Each person was
given the opportunity to do something a little out of their comfort zone. Tammy was pleased
when given the opportunity to present the final policy document to the group.
Group work: Space planning team - According to Angie, initially “the space planning
team objectives were to make plans for a remodeled space, setup interim services, and delivery
services around campus.” However, similar to the experience of the other teams, what was
initially understood did not transpire. Troy provided an interpretation for how this confusion
developed. “I believe that this was due, in part, to the cooperation, or lack thereof, on the part of

135

the two different school administrations as well as the two school librarians involved.” The
ending work project this team produced was two options for library relocation or expansion with
justifications as to how they would benefit the school as a whole. This change of mindset
affected all of the team. As a result, Laura felt she learned was how “the pressure of working
with a team to finish a project on a short timeline. I learned how it affects me and what I can do
to not let this get in the way of finishing the task.” The space planning team completed not only
their task, and their change in focus allowed them to help other teams, such as cataloging and
classroom collections.
Group work: Cataloging team - Denise, Kim, and Jane comprised the cataloging team.
This team accomplished an immense amount of work while also experiencing its own level of
confusion. According to Kim, “the cataloging team did not have one leader for the project.”
Although she felt that was confusing at first, “the lack of a leader worked to our advantage in the
end.” Denise had another perspective. She not only believed they had a group leader, but also “I
found the team leader greatly contributed to the success of the work we did as a group.” Jane’s
main concern had been with communication within the group as “it seemed like one individual
working on one thing by themselves instead of all members working together on all projects.”
This confusion went beyond group membership. Troy, a member from another group,
heard about the changing nature of the cataloging team’s goals. He said, “through our
conversations with Robert, we learned that while the entire catalog needed to be reviewed and
revised, due to time constraints we would have to focus our resources on a particular area of the
collection.” The team worked with the elementary librarian to identify what part of the collection
posed the highest need for clean-up.

Once the team was clear of their objectives, they created documentation for the other
participants to assist with the project as well as for the librarians on-site. Other participants were
involved in completing this team’s task. The cataloging team created documentation, however,
not all participants were familiar with cataloging. Jane felt that “the guidelines kind of helped in
a way except for those who are really new to cataloging.” So being available to answer questions
was important. One of those new to cataloging was Cindy. She felt that “finding something in a
catalog is something I’ve always taken for granted; the work it takes to create a good record is
quite a feat.” Unfortunately, this team also encountered the challenge of location. Initially, all of
their work had been scheduled to take place at the computers within the elementary library.
However, Kim lamented that
an unscheduled class interrupted one of our slots, and Jennifer decided to let us take out
books back to the classroom without checking them out. I preferred working in the lab
because the books were close at hand. Also, I found it easier to help students with
cataloging questions. It was more distracting in the project headquarters classroom where
multiple things could be going on.
All of these processes, identifying records, creating documentation, and helping others complete
the task, provided a depth of learning for the cataloging team. Denise explained that
when creating the procedures, there were many decisions made and we had to justify
them and explain why we had made those decisions. Learning what we had to do and
then explaining it to others served to be a great way to fully grasp what cataloging is all
about.
The cataloging project successfully addressed the subject headings of over 2000 science records
(500-599).
Group work: Classroom collection team - This team was responsible for the barcoding
and cataloging of those items housed in classroom. This group did see its share of challenges.
Only one of the participants on this team had prior experience cataloging. Jill, feeling less than
confident, believed “that some additional preparations and possibly initial training before the trip

137

could have increased the knowledge and capabilities of the students prior to the project.” Helen’s
focus was on having insufficient time. She lamented that “there was not enough time to instruct
students, teachers, or librarians on the system” and that “there is still more to do.”
In addition to time and training, there were organizational hurdles which lent to not
completing the project. It took the group a couple of days to iron out their workflow. This lack of
organization was felt by those outside the group that were additional assistants. Laura, a
participant from another group, mentioned that scheduling would have significantly helped this
group’s efficiency. In fact, she “(knew) the teachers were not exactly happy to see us come
through their classes.” Mary, another participant from another group, also expressed her
challenges with assisting this team, but felt that “because I was just helping out, I didn’t feel that
I had much of a voice in the process and resorted to getting the job done.” Feeling this confusion
themselves, the classroom catalog team altered their process to barcode everything first before
cataloging which they felt lent to a much smoother process. Cindy, from the policy team, felt that
“the teachers didn’t always look at us in a favorable light. There were a few times when they
weren’t aware of what we were doing or they were expecting us at all.” Additionally, Ann
pointed out that this “miscommunication or a lack of communication entirely led to many rooms
being left alone.” The vast amount of these unaddressed rooms housed world language
collections which most of the group, mentioned as a frustration. This sentiment was noted by
Lynn that since these resources were in other languages, “we often ran into periods where we
couldn’t proceed any further.” Despite all of these comments, Lynn captured the group’s sense of
pride with their accomplishment by remarking “we entered over 8,000 resources.”
This group, with the assistance of other groups, was able to achieve amazing results.
However, the enormity of this group’s task left them unable to participate in other groups. Each

138

of the team members expressed some level of disappointment as a result. The big loss was
expressed by Jill, “several students did not get a change to work within each group and I did not
have the opportunity to connect with everyone on the project.” Whereas being isolated in a
foreign country was part of the design of the entire experience, being isolated within the work
may have been an unintended consequence, at least for the classroom collection team.
Group work: IT team - Of all of the teams, the IT team appeared the struggle the most.
The IT team was charged with reviewing the existing IT infrastructure at the AAS Moscow
library. At the outset, most of the team members expressed the frustration and disappointment.
Nancy’s comment, “at the Anglo-American School (AAS) in Moscow, the project was
completed prior to our arrival by the previous librarian and IT staff,” was echoed by Julie and
Sherry. Mary was more explicit in her thoughts:
…there was little for our team to do. … As far as actually getting to do hands on work,
we didn’t get the opportunity. To me that was a disappointment. I really wanted to get to
work in the ‘trenches with them.
Thus what was left for the team to do was learn what had been put in place. The team broke up
the work and scheduled interviews with the appropriate people at the school. The interviews
were compiled, edited and presented to the policy team. Sherry mentioned that the group had
some personality difficulties. It was her suggestion that for future project each team be assigned
“a group leader from the start and (take) about ten minutes to get to know everyone in the group
such as backgrounds and interests.” Mary addressed this same theme regarding the work in St.
Petersburg: “… one of the biggest things I saw was the lack of leadership. We got instructions on
what needed to be done but no direction on who was doing what.” Overall Sherry did feel that
“the experience gained from hands-on work is some of the most valuable work experience.”
Unlike Sherry, Mary, and Julie, Nancy did not actually address how the project went. She
spoke about how a project should be designed; but, her lack of addressing the question, in the
139

face of her teammates’ commentary, has been interpreted to reinforce the frustration and
disappointment expressed by others in the group.
Overall experience: Lessons learned. Many lessons were learned about librarianship
during this experience in Russia. Having spent the two weeks working in the Moscow school,
participants came away with an expanded understanding about what it takes to be a librarian.
Some lessons came from interacting with the AAS staff and were about librarianship in general
whereas others were specifically about international librarianship.
Lessons learned: From AAS staff - Participants lessons about librarianship from
interacting with the AAS staff seemed to address a gap some felt in their Master’s program. By
coming on this experience, Glen saw that "the theoretical procedure of ‘this is how we do it’ that
we learn in library school is not necessarily how we do it in the real world.” Additionally, Glen
explained that:
Librarianship is kind of a mercenary job, in that you have a million things you need to do
and you only have so much time to do it. So you have to kind of have to pick and choose
what to do by what’s important right then. And that may change in a month, two month,
and three months.
Tammy seconded this sentiment by sharing her surprise at the amount of work school librarians
performed. “School librarians are underappreciated, unpaid, and overworked. (Also),
librarianship is not just helping people, reader's advisory, and maintaining the collection; it's
cutting through red tape to make projects go all of the behind the scenes.” Jane focused on the
amount of coordinating librarians conducted. They “have to collaborate with other departments,
teachers, staff, administrators to get the job done and interact with the patrons to find out how
they use the library.” Even Carrie, the active librarian, remarked that “organization just doesn't
happen by itself” and how “training and experience is very important when you are developing a

140

library.” Ann gained “a better view of exactly what it takes to work in a library.” Jill expressed
her new view of librarianship as a result of the experience this way:
It definitely helped me to see the variety of the library profession and also helped me
understand a different culture, specifically in this case Russian culture and different
customs. In a way that helped me understand patrons more to know that they do have
different cultural beliefs and different customs.
Finally, Julie learned that you “have to mold self to environment, be flexible because you're
constantly changing gears.” She summarized these new perceptions by her and her colleagues
with her revelation that “our business isn't really books, it's information - information and the
way it's being retrieved now.” Many of the participants had not worked behind the scenes at a
library before. This opportunity allowed them a glimpse into the everyday world of a librarian.
On a personal level, these experiences with AAS library staff seemed to stimulate
participant’s reflection on their role within the profession. To Lynn it was a moment or
reassurance.
Before I went on this trip I didn’t really know… I thought that I liked libraries and I’m
going to have this degree and what am I going to do with it. Basically this trip cemented
an idea and gave me an idea for a whole new possible career path where I can really take
multiple things that I love and earn a living with it. I don’t think there are very many
people in their life who can say that about their jobs, unfortunately. But I think because
I’ve had this experience that I know what I want to do that’s going to make me very
happy professionally for a long time to come.
For Kim, Laura, and Angie, it was a new found excitement for their future career. Kim
excitement came from the idea of interesting work and couldn’t decide if it was
the traveling aspect or the different culture, or the different environment. But the
experience and everything we took in, it made me more interested and excited about
finally working in a library or finally getting a professional job. I do not think necessarily
that every job is going to be like in Russia or be the same sort of challenge, but I think it
makes me anticipate new experiences and looking forward to doing different things a lot
more.
Laura’s enthusiasm was realizing that change can happen within libraries.

141

My library here, most librarians are older, they’re not willing to embrace the stuff that
(Robert)’s embracing and I think that’s important to stay current and survive. We have to
embrace the things. If (Robert) needed TVs to do that, my library wouldn’t do that, he
took the leap to be a little more flashy to get people in. Sure, we don’t want to do the
whole ‘make it pretty and then not offer the services’ , but we have to do both. We want
(patrons) to come, so whatever we have to do to get them is important.
Seeing that she was now part of a larger world community gave Angie a vibrant perspective for
her nascent career.
It definitely broadened my scope of what a librarian can be, where they can be, and what
their background can be. It just confirms that I’m glad I did this. I’m glad I’m in the
profession I chose. There’s likeminded people like me. We were all experiencing the
same excitement to work with the collection. (We) listened to the Russian people at the
different conferences and how excited they were about how they were able to increase
literacy or attendance, how many items had been checked out. (The librarians) were so
excited to talk about it and they were so excited to meet us. So it was very encouraging.
‘Alright! I am in a community; we’re all in this together. We’re all going for the same
goals’, and it was very affirming that I’m in the right place.
These personal realizations are the core of library cultural competency. Not only did the
participants learn more about librarianship but they developed some awareness so to their space
within it.
This awareness deepened for some of the participants. Several, prior to this experience,
did not know international librarianship was a career path option. As a result, working with the
AAS staff stirred many insights about alternate career paths for librarians and what it might take
to pursue them. Jill
learned that there is a larger variety of positions available - international librarian,
working at a presidential library, and working with technology. Being a librarian isn't just
about library science skill but also working and adapting to a different environment, a
different community, whether that is internationally or locally. Libraries are really based
and focused on their patrons and who they are serving.
Where Lynn felt that this transition would be easy because “what it takes to run a library is
universal, only the types of resources change,” others saw a cultural difference in international
libraries that they would need to address. Ann “never had considered working internationally

142

before. I would have to bring my US library culture of openness with me. I didn’t know there are
different library cultures.” Sherry believed that to address the differences in different countries
“you would need to be well trained in librarianship to provide the best service possible.” These
observations by participants begin to acknowledge the concept of differing library cultures.
Perhaps, with a solid foundation or competency in library culture, these students may be
successful anywhere.
Lessons learned: From other participants - Insights about the profession also occurred as
a result of working with other library graduate students. By interacting with fellow participants,
participants learned that communication, organization, adapting to multiple personalities, and
professionalism were crucial to successfully complete a project with a diverse group of
librarians. Several participants expressed the importance of learning to work as a team and to put
personal issues aside. When reflecting on the range of personalities and traits that librarians have,
Sherry felt that
personalities don’t always get along but you still have to make it work. You still have to
get through a project. You can learn from each other also. It’s not just my way or the
highway. Everybody has something that they need to input and should because you learn
from others too. Librarianship isn’t just something that happens in a vacuum. You know
in order to work with people that’s all part of it is teamwork.
Tammy realized that “matching people to their abilities is important in teamwork. When dealing
with different personalities, you have to be patient.” In addition to patience, Jill and Angie
expressed a new level of respect for their colleagues. Jill “gained a different perspective on
dedication. It takes a lot to go back to school later in life and get your Master’s degree.” Angie
learned that “everybody’s experience is valid and is something that you can learn from.” Despite
the variety of personalities, the teams were able to come together through their professionalism.
This professionalism was strong in some participants and allowed for an enjoyable group
project. For example, Lynn learned that professionalism could be fun.
143

We were able to have fun but we didn’t get off on weird random tangents that would be
embarrassed about if someone had walked in on us. But it was clear than we were all
having a good time while we were performing our task. That was my definition of
professionalism. You get the job done but you can have fun doing it. If you have to
choose between the two, work comes first. … It surprised me that I learned so much
about professionalism from people that were 10 years younger than me or even more than
10 years younger than me. That was the other big thing that I learned was that I can learn
from anybody and that’s important because you’re not always going to know all the
answers.
However, Carrie saw differing levels of dedication, work ethics, and temperaments. She could
tell those that had “chosen this field because they have a certain amount of passion about it.”
Unfortunately, not all were like that. She felt that some worked hard and some had “no real
interest in learning, kind of doing this more as a vacation.” She was saddened to see some
“falling asleep during conferences.” Regardless of these individual levels of professionalism, all
participants were able to provide some ideas for improving US libraries as a result of their work
in Russia.
Overall experience: Changes to implement at home. To address a level of professional
growth as a result of the experience, participants were asked what improvements they observed
which would serve US libraries as a whole and in their own delivery of services. Over a third of
the participants agreed with Carrie and did not believe that any changes would need to be made
because “there are certain core values that transcend geography especially in a school library
setting…(and although) our libraries may be difference but it's all about meeting the needs of our
users.” However, others expressed several aspects that could be changed to enhance their current
processes and thinking.
A major suggestion to enhance the patron experience was to focus on communication and
interaction. Jane felt that “being willing to be able to talk or communicate (with patrons) even
though there’s a language barrier would help (her) to be able to adapt to different cultures.”

144

Laura focused on making sure that all different patrons groups were assisted. She found at the
school that they served parents and the ex-pat community. This meant
you had to do a lot with communicating. You had to get the word out explaining the
services you offer to the people that will come. If you just have flyers to everybody then
the people who are going to need it aren’t going to get that information. The people who
speak Russian aren’t going to use your library. I mean they can’t. If they get the
information to the people who can use, they will use it.
Interactions needed to cross the language barrier in Russia and participants found a need for that
in the US as well.
Several participants felt that an increased cultural awareness would help them be
successful in their own libraries. Kim experienced this awareness as a need to “learn to be
flexible. (She) learned that it’s good to be really observant. It’s important to figure out how your
perceptions differ, your perception of the need versus the need, and to be willing to learn new
things or to do things in a different way.” Glen cautioned about keeping cultural awareness
present when cataloging that “things don't necessarily translate. Local understanding of the
concepts can be vastly different. … (And) Just because you know something is a certain way
doesn’t mean that your users are going to think of it in the same way.” Jill turned this cultural
awareness inward and found that
it really helped me to kind of broaden my expectation of serving the community and
providing information. I guess it helped me to think about information, in my own
library, and to help me be more diversified in how it helps the community. I guess even
looking at it in a way that it respects people’s different customs and different cultures.
That could also be helping to look at my information in a different way and the different
services that could come from the information that my library provides to my community.
Next, in order to make one’s collection more accessible and attractive to international patrons,
Jane and Ann shared their thoughts. Jane felt that in addition to expanding her knowledge of
information sources that she needed to increase her comfort level in talking to someone with
different language skills. Ann found that “in a school library like that, we struggled with the

145

world languages.” She felt that it would be important to “provid(e) a collection that is culturally
diverse and has a lot of different narratives. ... Helping cater to everyone’s needs is very
important and as is learning what those needs are.” Sherry found this idea to true, firsthand.
By the time the interviews were conducted, Sherry had already had an opportunity to put
these ideas into practice. She was excited to share that experience.
Right after I got back there was a gentleman that came in that really couldn’t speak a lick
of English, but I did find out he was from the Ukraine. He was trying to write but in the
school over there they had the keyboards with the Latin alphabet like a regular keyboard
and they had the Cyrillic alphabet. We don’t have any with Cyrillic; we only have our
ABCs on there. So he needed to type in Russian. So I did a Google search where he could
use a keyboard on the screen that would match so that he could type in Russian.
I actually had an experience where I had someone who was Ukrainian and I just had to
try to communicate and help him so he could communicate with his friends and family
back home. So it is different. What you’re mainly trying to do is to cut down, limit the
barriers, and help them be able to communicate the best they can and find the information
that they need.
Overall, participants seemed to believe that keeping the patron base in mind when providing
service, creating records, or presenting programs was essential to helping diverse populations.
While wrapping up each interview, participants were asked three questions to help
identify perceived value from the trip: would they recommend the experience to others, could
they have learned everything they did by another mechanism, and if they had any additional
feedback regarding the program. Almost unanimously, participants agreed that they would
recommend the experience to other graduate students.
Overall experience: Recommending to potential participants. Participants were asked
unconsciously to quantify the value of the program through the question of whether they would
recommend the experience to other graduate students and librarians in the field. Amongst the
reasons given to encourage graduate students were cultural awareness, personal growth, and
career placement/professional development. Taken all together those reasons, meet the tenets of

146

library cultural competency. Sherry came to the experience having been told by friends and
family that Russia was a mean and unfriendly place. But, after the experience, Sherry said
I wouldn’t have traded it for the world! I’m glad I went and I’m glad I can report back
that Russia was amazing. If anyone ever got a chance, they should go and do that. Those
others (friends/family of participant) were just plain wrong about their perceptions, like
Russian people are just mean or that kind of thing. It’s not true. You guys are wrong! I
would recommend it to anybody and I would do it again in a heartbeat. You just can’t
teach something like that in a classroom.
For Jill and Laura, their emphasis for potential participants was one of development of self. Jill
shared that “working overseas in an international library, is really (an experience that) can never
be replaced. It’s very valuable not just in a working sense and different work experience, but
expanding myself, personally, not just as a working student but also as an individual.” Whereas
Laura put it simply: “where else to do you get to travel with people like-minded to yourself, who
understand you, what you’re trying to study, and what you’re hoping to accomplish in an
experience like this.” Last, Kim and Lynn each presented a vision for the future for the program
which tied to career placement and/or professional development. Kim envisioned that the
program could be conducted at different types of libraries.
I think that the trip, as a learning environment by itself, should be suggested or
implemented in more places. I think a lot more people could benefit. I can imagine more
settings not just schools that could benefit from trips like this. I think there could be other
libraries, maybe public libraries are better funded but not necessarily depending on the
country they may not be. I think there can be other types of trips. People can be very
creative and do a lot of good for other libraries in the world.
Lynn’s thought was more sweeping and yet closer to home.
If I was the chair of the library school at UNT, I would almost make this a requirement
for anybody. That they had to do a semester in a different country because you gain so
many skills that you can’t really gain any other way. The reason I say that is I think that
experiences like this help you to find your center within the program. I don’t think very
many people come into the Masters program knowing exactly what kind of librarian they
want to be. With this experience you get to try so many different things in a relatively
short period of time and it can help you to focus sooner on what you want to do versus
someone who is 1 semester away from graduating and struggling to find their home
within librarianship.
147

When the focus was shifted to active librarians, nearly half also agreed that they would
recommend it. Most believed it would address the need of librarians to see how others tackle the
same day to day problems in a library. The only negative presented was one of logistics: time
constraints, funding, and difficulty showing relevance to their current job.
When considering other ways they could have gained the information learned through
this program - international school librarianship, policy creation, systems, catalog maintenance,
collection development, and space planning - participants posited several potential methods. The
ideas included reading other’s experiences, interviewing professionals who had those
experiences (potentially by Skype), webinars, guest speakers, read articles, write papers, take
classes in the particular skills learned while also taking a class on international librarianship and
how libraries function in different countries. Despite this list of alternatives, all participants
included this recurring theme from Laura, “you can't just read it in a book.” Jill felt productivity
came from being able to be physically present and active in the location.
There is only so much you can read or can learn in your own local setting. But to really
go over to a place and actually physically use and physically work with library systems,
library staff, in the library itself internationally, I think that is the best way to familiarize
yourself and learn about it. I don’t really know how else you could learn about it so
productively.
Nancy emphasized that by being in situ, every moment ended up being a learning opportunity.
I don’t think I could have experienced in any other way. I was just an amazing
experience. It was so much more than I anticipated. I loved every minute and every day
of it. Even in a situation when we had a tense situation in our group when our group
seemed to disintegrate and unravel at one point. I mean it was still a learning experience,
even that.
Similarly, Julie shared that knowing “why” choices are made comes from seeing a process or
culture first hand.
I guess you do it online, but it wouldn’t have been the same. Not actually going to it
seeing the culture for yourself, seeing the country, the language, and the people. You
would have never gotten that kind of experience in a classroom setting, strictly here in the
148

US. You have to understand what they’re trying to do and why they’re trying to do it.
You have to be placed within that environment too.
Participants extolled the virtues of the experience being not just service learning but specifically
an international service learning experience.
Program Feedback
Lastly, participants offered all manner of feedback for the program ranging from
choosing participants and choosing a venue to the functioning of the project in situ and the
project leadership. Currently, each semester the call of participants is announced and those that
can afford the trip and are willing to enroll in two summer classes define the experience co-hort.
Participants had some additional thoughts for the selection process. When choosing participants,
Carrie felt that students should
have a good attitude about what they’re going to see here. Because they’re not going to
be in the US, the accommodations might not be 4 stars which is completely acceptable.
The school is going to do what they can for you, but that doesn’t mean that you’re going
to have free reign, carte-blanche to do whatever you want.
In fact, the instructor has an established policy regarding a group of three, making sure that if
someone was injured, one team member could go for help while another could stay with the
injured person. Mary felt strongly that participants should be able to adhere to this policy. “(One
participant) needed to stay with the group. The three of us found her numerous times wandering
around by herself and we told her that she needed to stay with us. If you have that kind of
attitude, you probably shouldn’t be on the trip.” She felt it was a drain on the other participants.
A lot of planning goes into choosing a venue and arranging all of the logistics to take a
group of graduate students overseas. The instructor, typically, coordinates all arrangements long
distance with the help of the host contact. As such, each semester’s venue is selected sight
unseen. This makes each experience a unique situation. In Moscow, as participants have

149

previously said, the libraries were well funded and organized. Although this might be cause for
relief for the typical tourist, Jill expressed the challenge it presented for this group.
I think we could have learned a lot more like the people who went to Peru. I know they
had to deal with a lot of issues that we didn’t even consider being in Russia being as
comfortable as we were. We had it easy in comparison to other international trips. I think
it would have been very enriching had our experience had been like that because we
would have to start from the ground up. We didn’t even get to see really limiting factors
like other international trips have.
The only possible solution for this would be for the instructor to visually inspect the venue a year
ahead. Unfortunately, even in that case, the projects tend to evolve right until the participants
arrive.
Program feedback: Functioning of the project. Through the course of the trip, there were
several instances where different people were frustrated. In this part of the survey, participants
were encouraged to express their thought on what might have made those hurdles smoother or
other activities they would have liked to have done. Most provided constructive feedback, such
as Ann, who said, “I kind of wish we had seen a public library to see how the public library was
in Russia. I would have liked to see what the regular people have to use instead of the
presidential or a private school.” Likewise, Carrie provided a reassuring comment about the
various presentations that participants attended.
I don’t know how other people felt about the presentations, because I heard a lot of
negative about how other people felt about the presentations. But I actually got quite a
bit. I enjoy going to presentations and conferences so that was probably one of the more
interesting parts for me. Because I was hearing other professional librarians in Russia and
hearing about what they’re dealing with and their thoughts on things and that was very
nice for me.
Tammy provided her concerns about the St. Petersburg of the project along with a more neutral
comment regarding planning.
And then St. Petersburg, the school seemed ok but the library seemed it needed a whole
lot more work and we all did a lot more work than any of us thought we would do. It was
almost enough to throw us out of the profession I think. Considering a lot of it had to do
150

with, it wasn’t the professor’s fault but it was never clear what we were going to do. So
one moment we were told we weren’t going to do anything in St. Petersburg except relax
and tour and the next minute it was the death march over to the school and then working
like crazy people for a whole day. That needed to be improved or changed up a bit…I
think the planning was difficult…because when you go into a totally unknown factor
with unknown people you do the best you can.
Lastly, Mary addressed her frustrations regarding the breakdown of coursework, communication,
and her expectations for project leadership. She experienced some inequity in the work groups.
I thought that the actual work it wasn’t a very diplomatic. I was on the IT team. I felt I
didn’t get to do as much as some of the other people did. Their IT system was awesome
and they had a great staff. So I would have liked to have gotten to have a few days
working with the staff because my interest isn’t in cataloging. So to me that was just
something to do. I felt that in many cases, I was just filling time in the class. Once we
realized that the IT didn’t need help with now, it was like ‘now what are we going to do’.
At the same time, she also believed that there should have been more direction to the
assignments.
I think there should have been more leadership. I realize that we’re adults but it was a
class. We should have had some direction from the instructors, some leadership, some
organization. It was like “here, here’s what’s going on... go!”
When working with others, Mary felt a more direct approach would have been helpful.
I think there were some issues that should have been nipped in the bud. That same goes
for your team partners. Instead of letting if fester, you should just lay it out on the table
and get done with it. ... And when it came to the groups, there should have been more
leadership. Some “sit down, shut up, let’s do the job” and I think that would have been a
little bit more help. Maybe not leadership but assertiveness.
Mary concluded by suggesting that towards the end of the trip, the instructors were most likely
tired of the group and at their wits end. It was the only rational she could devise to counter her
thoughts on the lack of organization while visiting the St. Petersburg school.
Mary’s experience, however, was not the norm. Considering the participant group was
nineteen members, to only have one strong outlier on an international trip with everyone out of
their comfort zone, the overall program review provided by participants was encouraging. The

151

majority of the participants not only enjoyed themselves but also saw enough value either
personally or professionally to recommend it to future groups.
In this chapter, the interviews were examined first by establishing relationships between
participant attributes and themes/codes. Then, the study data was presented by comparing preexperience perceptions of participants and their answers to their post-experience interviews. Both
levels of analysis aimed at providing a narrative of the lived experience of these participants. In
the following chapter the prior worldviews and resulting worldviews will be compared to derive
findings for and present the interpretive-re-interpretive moment for this experience.

Question : How Goes Experiencing Another Culture Affect LIS Students?
Before the experience, participants held a limited view of what to expect from their time
in Russia. Most were focused on concerns of survival, language, food, security, and cultural
mores. These feelings subsided after some time in Russia as Nancy noted:
I was surprised that the age group was between 19 and 67 was all interested in going to
Russia and being a part of this program. I just, it was actually heartwarming that there are
so many people that even didn’t feel as comfortable in the beginning that they were still
able to become part of a group and provide their skills and knowledge to the rest of the
group.
Angie went from having never travelled to being excited about future opportunities to do so. In
fact, she said, “I really want to share Moscow with (my husband) and go somewhere else. I
actually had a dream about going somewhere. I went somewhere else, so obviously I want to do
that. I want to get out there and see something different. It was just amazing.” For Cindy, born in
Pakistan, it was like going home.

153

On the drive from the airport to the Aerostar hotel, I was amazed by how the scenes
reminded me of Karachi. The cities may not have much in common politically but certain
things were the same. It was the same vibe. Strange writing on colorful billboards and on
the mismatched assortment of shops. The hodgepodge vehicles, delivery trucks, and cars,
all that were parked every which way. Crazy drivers that seemed to have their own rules
that are completely unfamiliar to us. The green that slowly faded to the concrete urban
areas that were the outer parts of the city. I remember seeing similar sights and feeling a
similar feeling in the pit of my belly. A strange combination of intrigue, excitement,
anxiety, nausea and curiosity.
Sherry was able to combat the fears of her friends and peers.
…a lot of people, I got to say, were weird about me going to Russia. There was some
weird thing where you know ‘you have to be careful and don’t make sudden moves’. And
there’s this certain misconception that Russia was a certain way and it made me a little
nervous. But then I go over and find that well it’s not. I think it straightens out people’s
perceptions about other countries. We live in a bubble where we think it is really so bad
elsewhere and that’s not necessarily the case. Every place has problems but in order to
understand, it’s good to understand other countries and other cultures it’s good to break
down some of these barriers. It’s ridiculous. Ya, (sic) you wouldn’t believe, I had one
guy tell me ‘be careful, you might wake up in a bathtub without a kidney’. And I think
this just erases some of these negative perceptions.
Even Troy, who grew up in the Cold War era, changed his mind about whether Russia was a
place that others should visit. “(Initially) it had no particular allure to me. That said, I’m glad I
went because I saw things and learned things I otherwise wouldn’t.” Each of these experiences
were a direct result of personal observations and visiting another country. None would have
developed in situ, taking a class on international librarianship at a Texas university.
More specifically, participants experienced a broadening of both their understanding of
Russia. First, participants found interacting with the people and navigating the language barrier
were much easier than expected. Kim, who expressed “fear about not being able to communicate
with others or getting lost because alphabet is foreign” in her pre-experience survey, found that:
It didn’t really feel like a foreign place except for a language different and obviously an
alphabet difference. Once we were there for less than a week, it felt like a normal
environment. I had expected to feel like a fish out of water because I couldn’t read
everything and communicate, but we were traveling all together and we could rely on
each other to help each other.

154

Likewise, even Tammy, a woman in her 40s, overcame her concerns about communication. She
shared that:
The difficult thing about being a tourist in Russia which I managed to get around
eventually was the Cyrillic writing, not the language so much but the writing. Once we
all started to figure it out, how to decipher the letters, it was much easier.
Second, participants expressed surprise when their personal Russian stereotypes were confronted
or confirmed. Nancy noted that “travel opens your eyes to the fact that no matter what you think
we are not the center of the universe as the US. Other countries have issues. Other countries are
proud of their country. They’re proud of their accomplishments. They don’t all want to be us.”
Troy, unexpectedly, found this pride in their spiritual life too.
It was also interesting, the whole church thing was kind of fascinating, how after 3
generations as soon as the soviets left, the church is back now. It probably doesn’t have
the power that it had during the Czar’s time but they are certainly making their presence
felt on a cultural and a religious level. I don’t know how many people still believe. But it
certainly has at least culturally significance for them which was one the real surprises for
me was that the church has somehow been rebuilt and come back. I wasn’t expecting to
see that at all.
Having never seen displays at US art museums, Carrie happily countered the idea that art did not
exist in Russia during the Cold War.
… in the United States, it’s not very well represented in my opinion. It could just be that
the art museums I’ve been I haven’t said “ah yes, this is Russian art and this is what it
looks like.” So it was neat to see that in the 1800s this is what the Russian art looks like
and then in the 1900s and then during the communist period when there was the iron
curtain, it was neat to see that there was art there.
Seeing all these differences even led Mary, our participant with the worst experience, to say, “I
think one thing I learned was that Russia was not as backwards as people think it is. It’s pretty
sophisticated. I think they’re more technologically right up there with any other nation.”
However, not everything was different than participant’s expectations. Kim felt the control of the
state and law enforcement through the presence of the state police/military milling about in
public areas and metal detectors at Red Square, while Nancy remarked on the lack of “open
155

container laws (and) that people throughout the day were walking around or sitting in public
areas drinking alcohol.” Going on this experience allowed participants to see Russia in its own
light not through an ingrained American worldview. Overall, participants found they were able
to enjoy the culture despite their initial survival concerns.
Question : How does Studying Librarianship in Another Country Affect LIS Students?
Although not necessarily an artifact of location, being surrounded by all of the aspects of
running a library and making a direct contribution to its functioning seemed to have a significant
impact on the participants. Younger participants, Jill and Ann, realized that librarianship was a
worldwide convocation. More experienced participants were affected by seeing that different
countries do things differently. For example, Julie shared that:
We went to a public library… it was supposed to be a public library but there was a guard
outside who had to check your paperwork before you could go in and not just anybody
could get a card. It was mainly just students that could even though it was a public library
for their idea of public access was very different too.
Through these library visitations and presentations by local librarians, participants learned that
local libraries in Russia maintained a great deal of security, a closed stacks system, and a limited
definition of whom the “public” was that could use the libraries. It may have been the historical
restrictive nature of Russia which explains how these libraries evolved.
However, participants also visited the presidential library which, being relatively new,
was at the other end of the spectrum. Not only was it not the US definition of a presidential
library, Glen felt “It seemed more of an archive than a library, more of a meeting space and a
conference space.” This high level of library technology was unexpected to find in Russia. Jill
expressed that it
was actually, a little bit shocking because it wasn’t just your normal library that you think
of with shelves and shelves of books, but it was more a library of technologies and
advancements for the community and bringing together like our different library

156

colleagues and professionals to give conference there. I really just enjoyed that new take
of what I thought a library was.
Participants learned first-hand how international school libraries run and experienced the impact
that international school librarians make to their communities. A eye-opening lesson for
participants was that not only did the libraries for AAS Moscow and St. Petersburg serve their
school population but their immediate ex-pat community. As a result, the international school
libraries felt like an English-speaking haven for many of the participants. Nancy explained that
there were “a lot of similarities I think probably since a lot of the librarians are either British or
from the US.” But no matter where the librarians come from, Robert and Melanie, the two
librarians at AAS Moscow, demonstrated three key attributes of an international school librarian.
First, one has to be well-trained to thrive. Jane saw that “It’s not just about a library science skill
but also working and adapting to a different environment, a different community, whether that be
internationally or locally. Because libraries are really based and focused on their patrons and so
they are serving.” Sherry learned about the isolation of international librarianship and “that it’s
very important to be well trained in librarianship in order to provide the best service possible.”
Second, an international librarian must be patient and flexible but travelling can be rewarding.
Angie, our participant that had never travelled internationally before saw that:
It can be a real adventure. You can experience a lot of different things from culture to
personalities. To be patient, I think that’s the number one thing. Not just from them but
that you just have to be able to be flexible for whatever comes at you – and difficult
patrons, happy patrons, problems with the catalog, problems with books on the shelf,
even maintenance from the people to the items, patience, always wearing a smile, being
able to be ready for anything that life changes, things change immediately and being able
to adapt to those. … You don’t have to just stay in America as a librarian if you really do
want to travel if you really do want to experience something else, if you want to
experience another culture, you really can go into that culture and it can be really
rewarding.
Third, one has to be ready to do it all to serve the community well. Kim, Glen, and Julie saw the
librarians work hard at this each day. Kim had not expected that a school librarian’s job would be
157

so varied. She learned that “the job is really varied, especially in a school where they don’t have
a lot of other staff members. Like processing the materials and cataloging, they kind of do a lot
of that themselves.” Glen found that librarians had to adapt their academic understanding of
librarianship to serve their community.
What you learn is not always what you need to know. The theoretical procedural of this is
how we do it that we learn in library school is not necessarily how we do it in the real
world. And that’s true of any field of endeavor. There’s the way it’s supposed to be done
and then the way it IS done.
Julie understood this level of adaption as flexibility. She said:
You definitely have to be able to mold yourself and be flexible especially with the
environment being different. And part of librarianship is that, to be flexible and be able to
mold yourself into whatever environment you’re thrown into. We’re constantly changing
gears.
Finally, Tammy came to this conclusion about libraries in Russia, “there’s a lot of factors we
don’t have in the states like the politics. I mean we have some but we don’t have the blocks. The
same kind they have in different countries. Every country is different.” It was these politics and
historical barriers that led Glen, a recent graduate and prior experience participant, to provide our
summary answer to 4uestion . Studying librarianship in another country illustrated that US
concepts do not always translate and in another country it may be necessary to come up with new
methods of providing service effectively. Just as every country has its own bureaucracies,
policies, and procedures, so does every library.
Question : How does Participating in a Library Focused Service Learning Opportunity
Affect LIS Students’ Knowledge of their Profession?
Participants expected to gain valuable work experience, develop some cultural awareness,
and make contacts as a result of the experience. Their comments illuminated the many areas this
experience touched their understanding of the profession. First, as mentioned in the data analysis,
participants had not seen a school library serve those outside of the immediate school
158

community, teachers, staff, and students. Several remarked on the inclusion of the greater ex-pat
adult community as part of the service community, which seemed to challenge their world-view
of the typical school library.
Second, the old adage “money is power” was alive and well in Moscow. Nancy said,
I was amazed. It was more than I expected. It was just, I knew that this was a fairly well
to do school just by the budget that (Robert) had mentioned on one of our chats. Just the
facility itself, having a chef on campus, the facilities itself was top notch, the staff was so
engaged.
Over half of the participants were as surprised as Nancy to see that an international school library
could be just as modern, if not more so, as a US school library. Budgetary comments ranged.
Carrie felt that their collection reflected a hardy materials budget and was surprised that they
“even had materials beyond books”. As far as technology availability, Mary said “I think that
they have nicer systems over there than we have here but then again the school has a lot of
money so that makes a lot of difference”. The one place Nancy expected to find budget shortfalls
was in staffing levels, but she did not even see that challenge affecting them. It was unclear as to
whether these comments came from a worldview of Russia being historically impoverished or
the worldview of low library funding levels in the US as described by Tammy.
[…] especially in the state of Texas where they think they don’t need librarians, they are
absolutely out of their minds. There’s a reason we go through all of this. I think they
would completely fall apart if they didn’t have somebody who at least knew what they
were doing AND had help. I know in our district they took away the assistants for all of
the elementary librarians and no elementary librarian can get a substitute, they have to
close the library.
Third, their experience allowed them to see all the tasks/processes necessary to make a library
function and realized a number of key points. Hands-on learning in a library is different than the
classroom. Ann expressed the relief of finally being taught “how” to be a librarian. “I kind of
have a better view of exactly what it takes to work in a library. I definitely feel better about it.
…It was kind of like they taught it to us.” This experience gave the participants a microcosm of
159

the real world to learn and practice in. School librarianship was described by Tammy as “a whole
lot more work and you really need to have enough staff to cover it.” In fact, for her, “It was
almost enough to make me decide ‘I don’t know if I want to be in a school library. I think I’d
want to be some other kind’. Underappreciated, unpaid, and overworked.” The work level also
gave Jill a new respect for her colleagues.
I learned a lot from those people who were returning to school and returning to get their
masters in library science. That gave me a different perspective on the dedication and
type of education for people who were returning to school in pursuit of a goal they really
wanted to achieve to become a better librarian in some cases or just to really try
something new.
Last, participants learned how important communication and team construction, placing the right
personalities and skills sets together, can be to a successful project. Carrie explained,
(Participants are) coming from all different walks of life, different perceptions of what a
study abroad should be. It’s the same thing. I’ve been on two of these now and there’s
different personalities. That’s what it’s like and you have to get along. It’s like in the real
world, even if you don’t agree with what they’re doing you play nice or communicate this
isn’t right or that kind of thing.
Sherry agreed that “personalities don’t always get along but you still have to make it work. You
still have to get through a project. Also that you learn from each other also. It’s not just my way
or the highway.”
By having all of these different personalities at play, Lynn saw that
there were so many individual skills I didn’t know before I went on this trip. I wouldn’t
be any means say I’m an expert but I know a little bit about each and that just I kept
saying on the trip sometimes you have to have experiences in order to learn what you
don’t already know. It needs to be cemented in your head.
But it was Angie that reminds us the whole purpose behind taking a group on such an
experience. “We all had different passions; we all had different interests and reason that got us to
be librarians. But everybody’s experience is valid and everybody’s experience is something that
you can learn from.” This sentiment tied together the last point about learning to get along.

160

Seeing a unique library purpose, challenging library culture beliefs, hands-on experience, and
getting along were the major lessons participants learned from a library-centric service learning
opportunity.
Question : How does Being Immersed for Three Weeks in a Foreign Culture with 2ther LIS
Students and LIS Professionals Affect Knowledge of Librarianship?
By spending three weeks engaged with other librarians and library students, participants
confirmed a number of expectations. They saw that being available and approachable, providing
patron assistance and curriculum support, and having a set of developed policies and processes
helped make the library run smoothly. Additionally, because of the length of the project, Jane
had time to learn this lesson, “in order to see what the problems are within a library, you have to
dig deeper, you have to go to different areas to find the problem. Even though you ask in
interviews of the librarians themselves, you also have to do an additional research investigation.”
The project length and the intensity of being unable to go home provided the next lessons.
Working with their teammates, participants found that everyone has something to contribute.
Additionally, Lynn found that even dreaded tasks such as cataloging and professionalism can be
fun with the right mix.
I learned that to get the silly thing out of the way that cataloging and entering multiple
books can actually be a lot of fun. I had done something similar before but all by myself
and I got so tired so quickly. But I think we did so much so quickly and it was because
we made it fun for each other. From my other group mates, I definitely learned about
professionalism. We were able to have fun but we didn’t get off on weird random
tangents that would be embarrassed about if someone had walked in on us. But it was
clear than we were all having a good time while we were performing our task. That was
my definition of professionalism. You get the job done but you can have fun doing it. If
you have to choose between the two, work comes first.
Lastly, several participants realized that librarianship and the skills needed are universal that
merely the available resources change. In effect, for Lynn, all librarians are trying to do the same

161

thing only with different resources, reflecting the culture of their patron base. Mary made this
simpler:
If you work in a library it seemed pretty universal, what we were studying over here and
what they were integrating over there. I don’t know if that’s because that we were
studying or because that’s how they do it over there. I mean cataloging is cataloging.
Simultaneously, she made one counter point, working internationally it would be important to
keep in mind that librarians may have less access to physical resources and thus to provide a high
level of service, one must really know their Internet resources.
Question : Where are this Experience and Previous Ones Convergent or Divergent and
Why?
Three of the participants, three of the faculty-staff, DQG,had participated in DSUHYLRXV
experience. All of them agreed there was something substantially different about this WULSWKDQ
prior ones. While not all of them provided recorded input on this particular question,
particular findings can be suggested. One of the big differences all experienced was the affluence
of the current setting. Going into prior experiences, the participants, instructor, and researcher
had encountered project settings which lacked for funds, manpower, and/or organizational
structures. Another difference was the focus of the participants. The instructor and the research
both commented that it appeared the group that went to Russia were more motivated to apply for
cultural reasons than educational ones. Although, a policy document was successfully created,
the service learning aspect of the trip seemed secondary. Lastly, faculty-staff participation played
a larger impact in the leadership of the experience. On previous experiences, participants had
evenings to themselves and weekends were for sightseeing. This trip program faculty and the
host librarian provided evening opportunities for participants to explore Moscow and St.
Petersburg. Perhaps it was this continual structure that added to the dependence of participants
on the staff for leadership.
162

Questions through Themes
Thirteen themes emerged in the process of this study. When examining these themes,
three of them specifically aligned with the five research questions. Cultural competency was
found in questions one and four. Library cultural competency appeared in two, three, and four.
Personal growth spanned questions one through four. Thus, these themes were specifically
reviewed to see what findings could be derived for each attribute.
Themes: Cultural Competency
Cultural competency factors were 12% of the comments made by participants. While
looking at cultural competency development in participants, several similarities came to light.
First, Carrie, Sherry, Lynn, and Angie, who had served patrons from another country, exhibited a
higher sense of cultural competency on all three aspects, awareness, expectations, and
differences. Second, those who had completed their degree, Carrie and Glen, and coincidentally,
had also been on a service learning trip before, consistently voiced a heightened cultural
competency in all three aspects, awareness, expectations, and differences. Third, the 30-40 age
group, Carrie, Glen, Lynn, and Angie, exhibited the highest level of cultural competency within
all three aspects, awareness, expectations, and differences. It was interesting to see that most of
these participants showed up in at least two of these categories. Seemingly, Carrie may have
been the most culturally observant participant, with Glen, Lynn, and Angie in second billing.
Once again, it may have been the previous interactions with other cultures that attuned these
participants to reporting cultural competency concepts.
Then, looking at distribution curve patterns, three unique situations appeared. Participant
groups for the attribute of type of work experience each displayed a similar curve (Figure 26).

Participants, regardless of group, exhibited low expectations of the culture, a higher level of
observed cultural differences, and raised cultural awareness as the largest factor.
However, when it came to looking at how long participants had been working within the
LIS field, each group was different in their cultural expectations, cultural differences, and
cultural awareness levels (Figure 27).

Nancy and Mary, who had been in the field longest, experienced a cultural awareness and
dissonance at that the same levels. Whereas, Jill, Jane, Carrie, Sherry, and Angie, the six-10
years within the profession group, were the most dominant participants to experience cultural
awareness. These two observations showed that participants with more time within the
profession were able to concentrate more on developing cultural awareness than their colleagues.
Finally, participants varied greatly in the cultural competency development when viewed
from the amount of time they had spent outside the US. (Figure 28). Angie, the only participant
to have not previously travelled outside the US, exhibited the highest level of awareness.

Those with time living abroad, Tammy, Kim, Cindy, and Julie, were most focused on cultural
differences they experienced. Having experienced the differences in country politics and
economies, these participants had more life experience to compare to their time in Russia.
Themes: Library Cultural Competency
The second theme present within the research questions was library cultural competency,
the development of library specific cultural and professional competencies through interacting

165

with different library settings. As a nascent concept, , had hoped it would be VWURQJO\
represented in the findings. Unfortunately, only 6% of observations made by SDUWLFLSDQWV
in the post-experience interviews were related.
Even so, this theme produced some interesting results. Depending on the attribute
examined, participants reported experiencing different aspects of library cultural competency.
Within interactions with people from other countries, all groups reported awareness,
expectations, and differences in library culture. The participants that worked with people and
served patrons from another country, Lynn, Angie, and Carrie, exhibited the highest instances of
library cultural competency, which suggested that having already encountered general cultural
competency adjustments in their lives, they could focus on library culture. However, the
remaining attributes varied considerably.
Two groups at different points of their program experienced high levels of differing
library cultural competency aspects. Those participants within their last semester of the program
exhibited the highest amount of library cultural awareness of all four groupV. In fact, all groups,
except those halfway through their program, made observations regarding library cultural
awareness. Whereas those halfway through the program, focused more on the differences in
library cultures.
Interestingly, those with no time in the profession and those with less than six years in the
profession (Figure 29) had a similar experience with library cultural competency. Likewise those
with six-10 years of experience and those with more than 10 years of experience had a similar
distribution of experiences. When comparing the two however, the group with less experience
tended to focus on library cultural differences whereas those with more experience were able to
share their observations of library cultural awareness.

variables, expectation, differences or awareness.

Figure 30. Library cultural competency by type of work experience and time outside US
Those with unpaid work experience expressed very little library cultural expectations and
difference and no acknowledgement of library cultural awareness. At the same time, those that
had not previously been outside the US exhibited high levels of library cultural awareness but
expressed no expectations. There were no obvious reasons why library cultural competency

167

would make such a low showing in participants’ experiences. Perhaps this was influenced by
some of the limitations presented at the end of this chapter.
Themes: Personal Growth
The last theme relating to the initial research questions addressed personal growth of the
participants. Carrying only 2% of all commentary, not all attributes provided interesting results.
Those that did, however, appeared to be most directly related to prior experiences in life and in
work.
Eleven participants with prior experience working with people from another country all
mentioned developing self-awareness and a greater level of assertiveness or confidence. Jane,
Jill, Ann, and Troy, who had no experience in a work setting with people from another country,
did not. Instead, perhaps in reaction to their powerlessness to control cross-cultural interactions,
they learned that flexibility was the key to working well with others. Flexibility, unsurprisingly,
also showed up most frequently amongst the younger participants, those under 30. As for those
participants 30-40, Angie, Lynn, Carrie, and Glen, not only did they express the most personal
growth factors in the cohort, but they felt that their perspective of the profession was impacted
most.
The last attribute examined in relation to personal growth was type of work experience
(Figure 31). Those having worked in paid positions experienced growth across the spectrum.
However, those with unpaid experience only, Jane and Helen, did not claim any personal growth.
Once again, a power differential may be at play for those with unpaid experience. They may
have focused on their professional growth during this service learning experience to make the
transition to paid opportunities.

Additional Interpretations
Participant :orldviews
This study was hermeneutic to allow H[SORUDWLRQRIthe worldviews of the
participants as they changed, developed, and grew. As a result, there were other findings fitting
that description that are important to mention. First, , had hoped that participants ZRXOG
receive both cultural and educational benefits from this experience. Tammy confirmed
this by saying that the trip “was a whole lot more learning than just a group tourist experience.”
Jane mirrored this sentiment by explaining that “there’s so much you can learn from it, going to a
different country. Not just experiencing the different culture but also experiencing the different
ways of how they do their libraries.”
Second, many comments from participants illustrated they were firmly rooted in their
ALA-centric view of librarianship from having used US libraries and being enrolled in a US LIS
program. Nancy’s very telling response exemplified this ALA-centric view of librarianship.
“Same standards should be maintained around the world (emphasis added): privacy, access to
materials, (and a) lack of perceived prejudice.” Having these standards were a positive to the
project at points. To their credit, participants used these standards to craft an excellent policy
169

document that the host believed could be acted upon. Additionally, they started inventory of
classroom collections and initiated the catalog record clean-up project. Denise, a member of the
cataloging team, felt that “hands-on experience showed importance of cataloging theory
previously learned.” Participants strongly appreciated this opportunity to act as experts.
Value
In the first chapter, ,introduced the concept of value. Throughout this study, PDQ\
ideas were captured to show inferentially the value of the experience. However, RYHUZKHOPLQJO\
participants also expressed the value of this experience directly. These FRPPHQWVFDPHDPLGVW
the challenges and issues they personally experienced.
This value took a number of different flavors. Tammy expressed the value of this specific
project in that “you’ve helped somebody. You were useful.” Jill presented a broader value by
sharing that “working overseas in an international library is really (an experience that) can never
be replaced. It’s very valuable not just in a working sense and different work experience, but just
expanding myself, personally, not just as a working student but also as an individual.” Lynn felt
so strongly she had a message for the school’s dean:
If I was the chair of the library school at UNT, I would almost make this a requirement
for anybody. That they had to do a semester in a different country because you gain so
many skills that you can’t really gain any other way. The reason I say that is I think that
experiences like this help you to find your center within the program. I don’t think very
many people come into the Master’s program knowing exactly what kind of librarian
they want to be. With this experience you get to try so many different things in a
relatively short period of time and it can help you to focus sooner on what you want to do
versus someone who is one semester away from graduating and struggling to find their
home within librarianship.
Most of the remaining value statements addressed helping others or experiencing an expansion
of libraries’ place in the world, and thus their own. Angie said, “it was very encouraging.
‘Alright! I am in a community; we’re all in this together. We’re all going for the same goals,’
and it was very affirming that I’m in the right place.” Kim realized that “not everybody, not all
170

libraries, not all the librarians, not all people are like you and not everything happens the same
way. I don’t really think you can put a price on that honestly.” Lastly, Nancy said, “I believe that
travel opens your eyes to the fact that no matter what you think we are not the center of the
universe as the US. Other countries have issues. Other countries are proud of their country.
They’re proud of their accomplishments. They don’t all want to be us.”
As with everything in life, there is always room for improvement in education. The
participants provided some suggestions for improvement and thoughts for designing future
projects. The most common request made from participants was to have gotten to see a
functioning Russian library. They were interested in seeing the stacks and learning about the
processes and policies of running Russian libraries first hand. Although many explained that they
did get to go to one library, they were dismayed by being engaged in a lecture with
uncomfortable environmental factors (constructions, A/C leakage, etc.) and “not provided with a
tour of the library.” One participant expressed it this way, “The library (sci/tech) in Moscow that
was kind of disappointing. I think we all expected to see more than just a conference room and
with the amount of security we went through it would have been nice to see a bit more.”
Suggestions for Communication
According to Tammy, “The biggest problem in the whole thing was communication.”
Participants continually remarked on communication issues at different levels: within the host
organization, between the host and program leadership, between the program leadership and
program participants and amongst program participants. Specific examples were provided by
participants. Carrie sensed there was an internal communication issue at the host location from
the start. She pointed out the uneasiness by the host librarians as a result of the team’s presence.
You could tell they were both kind of intimidated, but when anybody comes into your
library, you’re like, wait a second, this is MY library, and that was definitely more of a

171

feel for that with (Jennifer) and (Robert), but (Robert) was the one that invited us.
(Jennifer) was much more reserved and more watchful as to what we were up to. I could
see that it is somewhat threatening for lots of people to be coming to your library and
saying this is how you should be doing things, if that’s how you want to perceive it.
The next issue arose within the project team members. Nancy shared her feelings about
significant personality and philosophical differences in one project team. “Even when we had a
tense situation in our group when our group seemed to disintegrate and unravel at one point. I
mean it was still a learning experience, even that.” Although, Mary was in the troubled group,
she mainly focused on other communication hurdles within the UNT classroom, in Moscow and
at St. Petersburg.
(Moscow) I think there should have been more leadership. I realize that we’re adults but
it was a class. We should have had some direction from the instructors, some leadership,
some organization. It was like “here, here’s what’s going on… go!”
(St. Petersburg) I think all hell broke loose and the instructors only gave us minimum of
instruction and when we had to figure out our own niche. I prefer a more structured
environment I think.
These structural communications were mentioned at the project level too.
Members of the space planning group, Glen, Troy, Angie, and Laura, mentioned their
difficulties adjusting to the project scope changes. They had expected that AAS Moscow would
be relocating its library but upon their arrival the plan no longer included a physical redesign.
Tammy also mentioned the lack of an advance plan for interactions with the St. Petersburg
school.
It wasn’t the professor’s fault but it was never clear what we were going to do. So one
moment we were told we weren’t going to do anything in St. Petersburg except relax and
tour and the next minute it was the death march over to the school and then working like
crazy people for a whole day.
At some point or other, every participant mentioned communication as an issue.

172

Disappointments
Beyond communication challenges, several disappointments were commented upon by
both the participants and the program leadership. The largest leadership’s perspective was that
students seemed to focus on the international piece more than the service piece of the experience.
This was substantiated by the students each time they expressed being more interested in being
tourists than getting something out of the coursework. For example, Julie felt that “we were
working all the time” and Mary expressed her boredom with the continual stream of churches
and museums when activities were planned. The instructor and researcher noticed that students
fell asleep in cross-cultural exchange activities.
Participants expressed consternation at not being more involved in a hands-on project in
Moscow and not feeling needed because of the level of affluence of the school. Also, most
participants had hoped they would be able to learn multiple skills. However, unfortunately, Lynn
remarked that she “would have liked more time to cross-train.” The technology group, especially
Mary, felt that they did not have much to do in the way of technology. “I thought that the actual
work it wasn’t very diplomatic. I was on the IT team. I felt I didn’t get to do as much as some of
the other people did.” Finally, Ann shared that “I kind of wish we had seen a public library to see
how the public library was in Russia. I would have liked to see what the regular people have to
use instead of the presidential or a private school.”
Limitations
There were several incidents that occurred during the experience that may have played a
part in obscuring some of the findings in this study. The initial limitation was the construction of
the pre-experience survey. Although it did examine the backgrounds of participants, it did not

173

address their perceptions of Russia. This made comparing the initial worldview of participants to
their changed state, on this topic, nearly impossible.
Another limitation resided in the role ,played during data collection. ,ZDVDIXOO

from the project for unbiased observations. Additionally, ,suffered from jet ODJWKHLQLWLDO
weekend of the experience and may have missed some crucial observation time ZLWKWKH
participants.
The next limitation involved the host location. Although apparently typical for this
program, as mentioned in the instructor’s prior worldview, the hosts kept changing their
expectations of what they hoped the project would accomplish. It is possible that this fluid nature
contributed to the participants’ ability to focus intently on the project at hand.
Group dynamics contributed to the next limitation. Overall the group appeared to depend
heavily on the faculty and staff for direction both in the classroom and for leisure activities. At
the other end of the spectrum, during a few of the touring events, students were noted to have
wandered off thus causing distraction and consternation for those having to wait. These
dependent and deviant behaviors may have contributed to the challenges expressed by the
instructor.
Finally, there was an environmental factor. One of the hotels exhibited contrary ideas of
customer service than the participants were expecting. Female companions were welcome to
entertain bar customers. At the same time, participants were removed from the restaurant/lounge
area because they were using the Wi-Fi in a large group. Several participants mentioned that this
colored their views of their stay in Moscow.

174

Despite these limitations, the study does meet its intended purpose. It was meant to
provide a snapshot of how LIS graduate students might evolve during their participation. This
study was never intended to be generalized to a larger population or other international service
learning experiences. The last chapter provides suggestions for further study of the topic as well
as future international service learning experiences hosted by UNT.

175

CHAPTER 
CONCLUSION
This study was just the beginning of the story. ,began the study with the H[SHFWDWLRQ
that students would have their worldview’s challenged. It originated from personal H[SHULHQFH
as a result of international librarianship and service learning. David Lynch (2008), a EXVLQHVV
reference librarian who recounted his own adventures in working internationally, H[SODLQHG
the worldview eloquently in the Journal of Business and Finance Librarianship.
Many people cannot begin to even try to see something from a perspective other than the
one constructed by their upbringing. As a young adult, I always thought I was progressive
and open-minded, but I realized abroad that I typically limited my understanding of an
issue to a rather narrow American perspective. Far too often, Americans have little
respect for perspectives that do not already match their own, almost as if they are not
worthy, or even a real point of view that someone is experiencing. (p. 425)
To capture how students evolve beyond this perspective, this hermeneutic study set out to report
the lived experience of the participants. Through the course of the data analysis, it has
established the pre-experience worldview of the participants, instructor and P\VHOI It has
also collected the stories from after the experience to provide for a point of comparison. ,
illustrated this comparison through a horizon analysis. In this final chapter, ,SUHVHQWVRPH
implications for this program and others like it, their continued need to H[LVWDQGVXJJHVWLRQV
for improvement for future projects are presented. The paper concludes ZLWKVXJJHVWLRQV
Ior additional directions of study. These include new aspects to consider, GLIIHUHQWPHWKRGV
for data collection and, as this work was meant to capture a particular moment LQWLPH
various time-lapse studies.
It is P\belief that integrating an experience, such as the one studied in this GLVVHUWDWLRQ
into the education of professional librarians can only make them well-rounded, more DWWXQHGWR
diversity issues, and raise their consciousness of the different aspects involved in

176

librarianship. While the participants expressed having received some value from this experience,
there are a number of implications from the study that this or any department seeking to improve
their ISL program may be interested in considering.
Pre-experience Implications
Taking the recommendations chronologically, the first area to be address is the preexperience time period. The implications for this time period break into two categories:
participant selection/preparation and project planning. First, the makeup of the cohort is
everything. In general, those with less world and work experience benefited most in expanding
their cultural and library culture competency as well as personal growth and finding their place
within the profession. Concurrently, those with more experience were able to see their trip in a
critical light, making comparisons between home and abroad to bring back to their careers.
Having a group of participants that are excited about both the adventure of foreign travel and the
chance to learn about international librarianship while affecting change (service learning) will
create a successful experience for all involved.
The current program was structured to afford the opportunity to all who applied which
may stem from the requirement from the Study Abroad office to have a minimum of 10
participants to approve the courses. However, there are several reasons to implement some form
of participant selection process. In order for the courses to provide a successful international
service learning experience, the host and the participants must benefit. By selecting participants
that would be engaged in the course work, had a wide variety of skills, and an appreciation for
different cultures, the course would be most productive. From the study, , was able WR
construct a participant profile which reflected the most engaged students on this trip and may
provide a baseline for future projects. The profile shows those participants (Table 12) that

177

provided the most commentary in the areas of judgements, cultural competency, professional
competency, library cultural competency, personal growth, and comparisons.

Had travelled internationally
Were early in their MLIS, having not completed more than 3 semesters
Had previous paid library work experience
Had worked with people from other countries and served international patrons
Were between 30-40 years old, and
Had been in the profession for 6-10 years.
Older participants and those further in their program were more engaged in cultural

opportunities. They tended to be more alert during lectures and focused on the work of the
experience. Additionally, adjusting to cultural differences appeared easier for those who had
extensively traveled or lived abroad which afforded them the ability for focus more on the

178

service aspect. Although others did benefit, i.e. younger participants, both in age and in their
length of time in the program, gaining an understanding of self and the culture of libraries, they
may be less likely to benefit from future experiences. As such, it is recommended that instructors
keep in mind that these participants may need extra mentoring and motivation when they arrive
onsite.
Next, more preparation of the cohort is recommended. Currently, the two courses are held
over the summer semester with the three week trip placed between the spring and summer
semesters to afford the maximum participation. The program provides several online meetings or
chat in the weeks leading up to departure before the courses officially open. Mainly, they are
focused on trip logistics, tips for travel, and an introduction to the host. Little time is available to
prepare students on skills they may need onsite for the project or study of the country’s customs
or culture. On this particular experience, students were going to a country that not only spoke
little English, used a non-Roman alphabet, and had a long adversarial history with the US.
Several participants expressed initial concern for communication, getting lost, and their personal
safety. As the data showed, those with cultural context, having worked with those from other
countries and having lived abroad, were able to focus on professional growth while enjoying the
cultural experience. It is proposed to include some cultural study of the country and its customs
prior to departure to eliminate or address concerns ahead of time and allow students to focus on
the service aspects of the experience while in country. This pre-experience course time may also
allow for participants to establish project expectations and develop a working relationship with
their work group before travel. Several of our participants were most interested in the tourism
aspect of the trip and when they encountered having to put in a full work day and sometimes an
extra-long work day during the week, they were disgruntled. Preparing students for the amount

179

of effort expected while on the project and providing specific example assignments to each work
group before they have to work together in an unfamiliar setting would make the experience
smoother. The last participant preparation suggestion is regarding connectivity. Although it is
mentioned in the online chats, participants should be made aware that by going on this
experience, there is no guarantee for reliable internet access. Their days will be filled with work
at the host school, their weekends with tourism, and possibly their evenings. As a result,
participants will have less access to friends and family and may experience some internet
withdrawal. All of these suggestions and recommendations imply the need for this particular
program to open the semester prior to the experience with the travel piece concluding their
course enrollments. Finally, many of these suggestions rely on the adequate conveyance of
program details. It might be appropriate to devised a mini-contract between the professor and the
participant reiterating all of these ideas, including an outline of a typical day and expectations for
participation both at the school and after hours.
Implications for project planning also were evident from the data. UNT’s program is
unique in that each year a team visits a different location and the project performed directly
relates to that site’s needs. Other international service learning programs have an established host
site to which they send students to each year. As such, all of the programs to date at UNT have
been different, even those that returned to the same host location. Having a clear understanding
of what the host is expecting, what the facility looks like and needs, and how far everything is
from each other goes a long way towards planning an experience. While hotels, transportation,
and touring logistics can be decided from a far, planning the service learning piece can be more
challenging. Instructors work to acquire as much information as possible from the host before
departure but a solid plan really only evolves once the team is at the school. This challenges the

180

instructors to troubleshoot issues and redesign their project while also trying to be of support to a
group of students in unfamiliar surroundings. The primary suggestion here is to have an
advanced scout go to the location before the trip. This would allow for travel/environmental
factors to be settled and for a face-to-face discussion of the scope of the project. Although the
scope may still change once the entire cohort is onsite, the chance of the host maintaining its
originally agreed to ideas is higher and may reduce the amount of complete restructuring.
Implications while In-situ
This study offered a few implications for the time in-country. The first was a need to
have additional staff. Currently, the Study Abroad office sets an instructor/student ratio at 10:1.
For your typical study abroad trip which does not include a service learning component that may
work well. However, with a service learning experience, a detailed hands-on project with
multiple work teams is being conducted during the work week as well as the cultural and tourism
activities on the weekends and in the evenings. On this experience, the professor became the
focal point for the entire cohort keeping her on-call 24/7 during the experience. Several instances
led to this. First, during the work week, each work group needs a leader. Sometimes there is an
obvious one – a student with a particular skill set can fill that role. However, when this does not
pan out, the instructor has to fill more of that role, and in this case, for multiple groups. This left
moments when something not covered, either communication with the institution, or being
available as the group mentor. Second, during the non-work time, participants find themselves
leaning on the professor as they cope with cultural differences, navigate sightseeing excursions,
and resolve travel related or personal issues. Even with more than one UNT staff member on this
trip, students tended to look towards the professor as the “everything” person affording the
professor very little personal downtime to recharge for the next day’s events.

181

Having multiple staff members on the experience is only part of the resolution. The staff
members present have to be specifically positioned as “interchangeable”. Participants must know
that all issues can be addressed to anyone on the team. This can be instilled in two ways: at the
school, by ensuring each work group has its own dedicated leader and alternating responsibility
between staff for the daily wrap-up meetings and, in the evenings, by setting up an explicit
alternating on-call schedule. This affords the professor an opportunity to refresh occasionally,
prepare for the course instruction the following day, and to always be available to the host for
issue resolution.
The use of evening time on this trip provided the next set of implications for future
projects. During the online chats, participants had been told that there may be a few outings in
the evenings but that generally it would be their free time to explore. However, once they arrived
at the school in Moscow, participants learned that the host had graciously organized various
faculty members to guide evening opportunities to sightsee. Initially, participants felt obligated
to attend all of the functions. For the more social, this was an excellent offering. For those more
of an introverted nature, having spent all day with the entire group and then to also spend each
evening was a struggle. This situation organically righted itself after the first week as the large
group dispersed into smaller ones. Unfortunately, these smaller groups did not use the time in the
spirit it was intended – individual sightseeing. Instead, participants spent many of their evening
hours on the internet, preferring to connect with those at home than have a new experience. It is
not known whether this was a generational difference from prior years or whether it was
reflective of the hotel’s location.
Several recommendations are offered to address balancing participation and personal
time. First, participation in the experience can be encouraged through dedicated time to complete

182

daily reflection assignments, allowing participants to process their experience from the day
before. Second, each year’s project could create some social media presence. This would allow
for participants to share what they have been doing and seeing with those at home while also
allowing for the creation of something for the group. Third, when possible, a regular time access
to email/skype/social media should be provided as part of the work day, to allow participants the
freedom to take part in evening activities. Fourth, if funding permits, hotel locations should be
close to the cultural or city center. In St. Petersburg and in other previous trips, the hotel’s
location allowed for easy walking access to food, sights, and relaxed exploration in the evenings.
Moscow’s hotel, although relatively close to the metro line, was located in the
convention/business district and offered little in the immediate area.
Post Experience Implications
The courses completed several weeks after participants returned home. In the interim,
participants wrote their final reports, submitted their photo journals, and optionally shared their
pictures with the group. No follow-up conversation or post-mortem sessions are normally held.
As a result of this study and the amount of information and feedback derived from participants
through the post-experience interviews, it may be a practice to add to the program. By having a
final online chat, participants and the professor would be provided a time to share what they have
integrated into their world upon returning home as well as share ideas and suggestions for the
next project.
Further Research
A recurring theme that arose during the course of this study was that the experiential
outcome “depends on the make-up of the participant group,” which provides fertile ground for
further study. If this study were to be replicated, at least one attribute should be included, team

183

assignment. Each project contains a series of work teams and including that attribute may lend
some additional insight into the cohort’s lived experience. It could be compared within and
across groups. Also the age attribute could be further expanded to look for cross-generational
differences in participation levels. Another method would be to include quantitative measures
solicit an overall satisfaction level of the experience (work, sightseeing, interactions with host,
host staff, host students, host patrons, and locals) as well as excitement levels of participation
pre/post. Other possible areas of study within this domain to still be explored are multiple-year
comparison of groups as well as a long-term effects project reengaging prior participants.
Finally, several standardized instruments, such as the Cultural Competence Assessment tool
(CCA) which examines cultural awareness and sensitivity and cultural competence behavior
(Green, Comer, Elliot, & Neubrander, 2008), could be employed to quantifiably assess cultural
awareness.
Beyond replication of this study, it provokes several possible paths of research within the
field of LIS specifically, but also within service learning as a whole. Some of these are derived
directly from these results whereas others are theoretical concerns or comparative analyses. For
example, how does American librarianship LIS education bias one’s services? What are the
tenets of American librarianship? What is the philosophy of librarianship in different countries?
How does the US philosophy of librarianship bias or influence providing services to patrons of
different cultures? At what point does comfort with a foreign culture happen? What is cultural
competency? Each of which may be the foundation for projects such as a comparative analysis of
National Libraries, such as the Library of Congress, National Library of South Africa, and the
Lenin Library or conducting a similar experience within the US to see if the same amount of
cultural competency is experienced.

184

Overall, this international service learning experience provided many key points for
learning both from the students’ viewpoint and the designing of the experience. It has
successfully provided valuable insight into increasing the impact of subsequent projects.
Although not generalizable to all international service experiences, this study has made it clear
that each experience is indeed unique. When looking at the H[SHULHQFHDVDZKROHDQGWKH

*Syllabus Revisions*
This syllabus is subject to revision during the semester at the instructor's discretion. The
syllabus does not represent a contract between the instructor and the student.
*Code of Conduct for UNT Study Abroad*
*A. Safety and Security. * The safety and security of university students and faculty
participating in programs outside the United States is a primary consideration in the planning and
conduct of study abroad programs. While the Study Abroad Center (SAC) is responsible for
collecting general information on safety and security issues related to locations, travel and
logistics of study abroad programs, participants are equally responsible for taking appropriate
safety and security measures. These measures include, but are not limited to, personally
researching the international threat level and safety and security concerns in the host country;
attending all study abroad orientation sessions; and taking appropriate personal safety
precautions en route to and upon arrival in the host country.
*B. Travel and Laws.* The university student travel policy applies to all travel en route
to and while in the host country. All participants in the study abroad program are responsible for
following the student travel policy as well as all traffic safety and other laws of the host country.
Faculty, staff and students are personally responsible for sanctions imposed by the host country
for violations of its laws and all legal costs incurred as a result of the violation(s).
*C. International Health and Accident Insurance. * All participants in a University of
North Texas study abroad program must have approved international health and accident
insurance that includes coverage for emergency evacuation and repatriation of remains.
*D. Code of Conduct. * University students must abide by the guidelines set down by
the faculty leaders in reference to what is expected of them while studying abroad. Faculty
leaders may set guidelines intended to impact the academic integrity as well as safety and
security as they deem necessary. Violation of these guidelines can result in repatriation, loss of
academic credit and other penalties as assessed by the Center for Student Rights and
Responsibilities.
*Code of Conduct for all LIS study abroad courses*
University students are expected to demonstrate respectful and responsible conduct
throughout their study abroad experience. We expect everyone to display conservative and
courteous behavior and attire. We are acting as representatives of the UNT COI, the University
of North Texas, and the United States. Appropriate conduct and attire is compulsory. Displaying
respect and consideration for a culturally diverse work and travel environment is mandatory.
Violation of these guidelines can result in a failing grade and dismissal from the course.
*Accommodation of Students with Disabilities*
If you have a disability and require accommodation under the terms of the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you must present a written accommodation request to
the instructor by the end of the first week of the course. You should submit a request even if it is

189

possible that accommodation may not be necessary later in the semester. You should register
with the UNT Office of Disability Accommodation (ODA; http://www.unt.edu/oda/ or 940-5654323), which provides many kinds of support services. Procedures are explained in the Disability
Accommodation Policy in the UNT Policy Manual
(http://www.unt.edu/policy/UNT_Policy/volume3/18_1_14.html)
*Course Goals and Objectives*
GOAL: Prepare students for roles as knowledgeable and competent automation library
systems project planners, implementers and assessors.
Course Objectives:
Upon completion of this course, students should be:
1) Familiar with the basic concepts and components of automated library systems.
2) Able to identify the resources and services needed for automated library systems.
3) Able to identify and address the automation needs of the library users and staff.
4) Able to plan, manage, and implement a sustainable integrated library system
automation project.
5) Able to assess the integrity of an operational automation system and address shortfalls.
6) Able to assess the effectiveness of an automation library systems project.
*Course materials support*
Readings, research support and periodical articles are available from the UNT Libraries.
*Writing Style and Guidelines for Submitting Assignments*
1. All assignments are posted as attachments in a discussion forum.
2. Use MSword processing for all papers submitted for this course. No other file formats

Russia to assess and optimize library automation and assist with the introduction of an
automation system to the school in St. Petersburg, Russia. We will discuss appropriate options
and assist with an automation system for each school library. The project involves organizing the
school library, completing the migration of all bibliographic records and patron information,
adding new resources to the OPAC, and providing training to the school librarian and teachers.
*Requirements and Grading*
It is expected that students will follow all online lectures and prepare for discussion and
the field experience by reading the suggested texts and periodical literature, and previewing the
automation system software. Students are required to use E-mail and discussion postings to
correspond with the instructor and other students.
1. *System preparation*
Students will access a demonstration version of the Destiny software system.
*Assignment:* Students will work in teams (Cataloging, Circulation, Technical and
Policy) to complete 7 automation assignments that address system selection, users, testing,
operability, record enhancement, etc.
*Due Friday, May 25th, 2012*
*10% of grade.*
*Assignment:* Students will work in teams of 2 or 3 to assess specific functions in the
automated library system. A review of documentation may result in the need for written quick
reference guides for system users to operate the automated library system. The documentation
will be submitted as an attachment to a discussion posting so all class members can review the
instructions and provide feedback for potential revisions. The documentation will include:
* screen shots
* process steps
* examples where required
* First draft due Thursday, May 24th, Final edition due: Monday, May 28, 2012*
*20% of grade.*
Any revisions will be made before the field experience and finalized on location.
2. *Field experience*
Students work in a school library that will be used as a case study. On location the
students will verify the catalog records through examination of the books and resources,
correcting MARC 21 records according to bibliographic standards. Students will also participate
in the preparation of the collection on location through classification, weeding, book repair,
shelflist analysis, barcoding, and labeling. Students will participate in the assessment of the
automated library system installation, training of staff, and evaluation of the project.
*50% of grade.*

191

Students will complete a peer assessment of individual contributions to the team process
using the Project Team Evaluation form, linked on the homepage. Hardcopies of the form will be
supplied during the field experience and collected on *Thursday, May 31st, 2012*.
*10% of grade.*
3. *Final evaluation*
Students will individually demonstrate an understanding of the project process in a 500 to
1,000 word written paper that:
* identifies individual learnings
* discusses the project process, including
o project management
o project steps
* identifies what worked, what didn't work and why
* identifies what could be done differently
*Due midnight of Sunday, July 1st, 2012. The final evaluation paper MUST be submitted
to ensure a grade for the course.*
*10% of grade.*
/Assignments turned in late will have points deducted in proportion to the time delayed,
normally 5% per day./

APPENDIX B
PRE-EXPERIENCE ONLINE CHATS

195

Chats with Instructor and Host Manager
Details were provided to the students before they travelled to Russia that may have
influenced the participants’ expectations and worldview of the program. One participant
provided justification for a survey answers she gave about the host library, explaining that it was
influenced by the online chats held before the trip and reviewing the library’s website. To
provide additional detail about the impact of these chats, the following composite summary of
the four online dialogues function as part of the rich-text for analysis.
To prepare students for the experience, these chats were conducted the two months prior
to departure. During each chat, the instructor, Amanda, covered a wide variety of topics:
program history, the current project’s details, daily schedule, lodging/transportation/meals, tips
for packing, and money considerations. She also explained that the program had taken students
to Thailand, Albania, the Ukraine, and Peru and that “each time is different.” This experience
was described as hard work that Moscow had two libraries in their school. To help mitigate any
issues in technology availability, students were asked to bring their own laptops if possible and
assured that they would have wireless Internet access capability and a dedicated workspace.
Participants were also reminded that while traveling abroad, they were not only representing
their university but also their country. Amanda spoke of cultural concerns, especially the current
political climate. President Putin had been sworn in again in 2012 and subsequently, there was a
large protest of his inauguration, two weeks prior to the experience. The US, in addition to
expressing its growing concerns of Russia challenging the sovereignty of the Ukraine, criticized
the treatment of protestors. Whether in response to this or his stated response of needing to focus
on domestic issues, Putin announced he would not be attending the G8 summit scheduled for the
end of May. As a result, students were cautioned to keep their political comments to themselves.

196

Culturally and environmentally, they were prepared to expect that most people smoked
cigarettes and that the temperatures would be in the 70s. She emphasized that the university takes
cultural sensitivity seriously and would not tolerate any behavioral difficulties. To illustrate,
participants were told that they had indeed sent someone home for their lack of cultural
sensitivity on a previous trip. Resulting from knowledge gained on prior trips, participants were
asked to make sure they had the emergency numbers for the school and the host. Students were
asked not to explore on their own and to abide by the rule of three, which was a safety measure
devised to ensure that if someone was injured that there would be not only be someone to get
help, but someone to stay with the injured person. This would be especially crucial on this trip as
the ability to communicate in English outside of the classroom was limited.
The project particulars were also discussed in these chats. First, participants would
receive two scholarships to help offset program costs, one from the UNT Study Abroad office
and one from the College of Information. The program fee would include entrance to the
Kremlin and Hermitage, as well as the high-speed train to St. Petersburg. Second, the experience
encompassed working nine days at the Moscow school with two weekends touring Moscow and
three days in St. Petersburg. The instructor warned that participants the work schedule would be
high energy and demanding, including a possibility of running over an hour each day to
accommodate the work load. Participants were also told by the instructor that “this is a service
learning experience. Expect that it will be heavy on both the service and learning and we want
you to benefit from both.” Additionally, the instructor passed along the message from the Host
Librarian, Kevin, that “I want participants to walk away with some real world experience and a
feeling that they made a difference.” Amanda shared that she was encouraged that Kevin wanted

197

the group to be as involved as possible and was happy to be working with us. He was excited and
had dedicated a space for us to work.
Last, the hands-on experience was described as encompassing two LIS courses:
Automation & Policies and Procedures. To successfully address the work, the instructor
explained that the group would be divided into five teams: policies, space planning, technology,
classroom collections/textbooks, and cataloging. Each team was comprised of four students and
one support member. Students were assigned to their team based on course history and
experience. No one was expected to be an absolute expert and, although each would be assigned
to a specific team, each was expected to have an opportunity to learn different aspects of the
project. The policies team was responsible for updating and creating procedures for changes that
may be made including a remodeling project, two self-checkouts, space planning, and scheduled
delivery service from the basement. The space planning team was responsible for designing
changes to be made and directing the group in their implementation. For example, in Kyiv, this
team had split the library into two entities, redesigned each, and moved stacks, computers, and
furniture. Participants on the technology team were responsible for simulating the installation of
an ILS and reviewing the existing technology available. When dealing with the classroom
collections and textbooks, this team was to barcode these collections and the bookroom, thus
preparing all books not housed within the library for inventory. Finally the cataloging team was
charged with working on data clean-up. Records needed to be standardized as they were
described as “a fright” and having “sad” subject headings. This clean-up was instrumental for
running an inventory. Additionally, there would be two doctoral students on the trip doing some
research and had surveys and interviews for the participants. The instructor impressed upon
participants that “It is important that we learn from your experience as you learn how to figure

198

out all of these tasks and hopefully build some good skill sets.” At the same time, she prepared
the participants that “Whatever we carve out as the project, we will not be able to complete – we
can certainly equip everyone to carry on after us” and your efforts “will make a difference!”
Preparing the schedule. The typical daily schedule in Moscow was presented. Starting
the morning after arriving, work days would be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The day would begin with
roughly an hour or two of organizational time and a mini-lecture. Then participants would break
into their project groups for most of the day working on team assignments. Students were
expected also to compile a photo journal using Blurb.com, which is an online site to create online
books, to capture their stream of consciousness experience within the country and within the
project. Time and computer access would be afforded for students to contact home during the
day. At the end of each day, groups would report out on the day’s progress.
Upon completing the project in Moscow, the group would take the train to St. Petersburg.
Participants were told that plans for working with the school in St. Petersburg had not been
finalized. The school was described as small and lacking room to house all 24 participants.
Whatever could be done in Moscow remotely to prepare for working with that school would be.
Thus, in comparison to Moscow, the instructor was not anticipating that the teams would be
working flat out. It was not expected that all participants would go to the school each day.
A number of outings were preplanned. Students would have an opportunity to see the
Kremlin and the Hermitage. The Russian School Library Association (RuSL) had arranged for an
academic exchange with the group while visiting the Google Center in Moscow and the
Presidential Library in St. Petersburg. The host and various teachers had signed up to take small
groups out in the evenings. Additional sightseeing ideas were solicited from the group, such as

199

shopping, visiting Lenin’s tomb, touring the Lenin library, visiting Borodino, the last battle site
of Napoleon’s March, going to Red Square, and stopping at the Vodka Distillery/Museum in St.
Petersburg.
The third chat was special as the host was able to join the group online to talk about the
project and answer specific questions from participants. Participants asked several questions of
the host about the library.

APPENDIX F
PROFESSOR’S WORLDVIEW

211

INITIAL
The following are excerpts of comments made by the professor illustrating her
expectations and worldview in conducting this program.
When asked about the origin of the program, she explained that the whole program grew
out of personal and professional contacts.
x

“It’s a small network but it’s a pretty powerful one in terms of interest. I think that the
idea the we’re willing to come in and do really anything that they need is a big motivator
for the schools to sponsor us and we don’t ask for payment. We only ask for lunch.”

x

“It was started with two very clear objectives. One was to provide a total library
experience, because you’re in a small library. A school library is a small library and a
school librarians does everything. … The other one was to provide a cultural experience
that would enlighten students to not only appreciate difference cultures but to think about
how the different cultures need different library services.”

On previous projects, students paid attention to how the host library was different from
libraries in the US. She felt participants “asked questions, listened, and integrated that into their
repertoire of what is librarianship and what it was like.”
In response to prompting on why run a service learning experience instead of a typical study
abroad program:
x

“In a lot of study abroad experiences, it does not have to include service learning at
all. … They are specifically there as observers and doing it in a cultural context. …
Many have a little mini-infrastructure setup to receive and guide them which lends a
different sour of a platform of comfort because they have this established relationship

212

where they go. … We are trying to provide a service in exchange for an opportunity
to learn how the library works.”
x

“I’m a very strong believer in constructivism and experiential learning. I think we
create learning through the experiences that we allow ourselves to be involved in, that
we go out and seek for ourselves. That therefore means if you are less inclined to do
that, then you need someone to mentor you and encourage you and guide you. If you
are more included to do that, you need less in the way of hands-on.”

x

“My hope is that even though the project varies, they gain a sense of how interrelated
the different aspects of librarianship are. … And my hope is that by doing the project
and taking the course in this smaller environment that students gain some skill sets
around that kind of understanding. … but also that they develop some skills in some
really practical skills in how to communicate with each other and across all the
different kinds of boundaries that we have profession. That they have to work as a
team and, librarians, I think, don’t typically get those kinds of opportunity. They get a
change to put themselves out there in ways they might not have done of tried at home.
… What I hope for them personally is that they gain a sense of cultural awe and
wonder that we are all so different and yet all so much the same.”

Overall she wanted to encourage critical and reflective thinking. “I imagine people are
going to think about what they are experiencing, think about what they’re doing and be
introspective. I hope they almost do that out of body experience where you watch yourself going
through stuff and think, well isn’t that interesting.”
RESULTING

213

“That group in Moscow was very limited in that type of motivation. They were very
happy to just sit and not really do a whole lot.”
“The other thing that I found that was very disappointing was coming back in the evening
and they were just sitting on their laptops. And I didn’t know if that was because they really
missed home and wanted to be on facebook or emailing or if they were working on things like
the focus questions (which they obviously weren’t) or if where the hotel was located didn’t
encourage them to get out and walk around.”
“But one of their major findings that they received a lack of faculty support. I was kind of
taken back by that because I actually thought I put more into the teaching. … I tried to keep on
that trajectory of increasing that contact and whatever.”
“Geez? Really? I mean so much was done for this group in the organizing for the
evenings and the weekends and the problem solving stuff. I just thought wow! What more could
we have done?”
“But these guys I think had an expectation. The .iev group I think were a lot more
independent, individually. And a lot better at teaming up with each other and seeing if anyone
wanted to go somewhere and do something. There was a different level of enthusiasms there.”
“So when you think about faculty support, you have to look at who are these students in
the first place. It may not be that you’re providing an inadequate level of support for all of them.
It’s very individual. There’s going to be a continuum there where some are going to need an
extraordinary amount and some not at all. But I think it hinges on their motivation. Why are they
going in the first place? If they only wanted to go so that they could see the sites and say they’d
been to Moscow. Then whatever we do during the school day doesn’t matter for beans. I think

214

that with kiev, we did have a high percentage of people that were as interested in learning the
library stuff as they were about learning the cultural stuff.”
“We have to do a bit more on the assessment side up front so that maybe we can figure
out who we’ve got and why they’re coming. Maybe we need to talk about that a little bit more
and see if that doesn’t make some kind of a difference. Of course you get a different group,
you’re going to have different results anyway, even if you don’t alter your teaching style or the
social style or cultural piece. It’s an interesting challenge. I think maybe that that’s what we learn
from it. What we bring to it is as important as what we experience.”
“As librarians, particularly school librarians, one of the models we’re trying to establish
to prove our value is that guided inquiry model. That means that the instructor./librarian is
inserting herself in appropriate points in identifying teachable moments and introduce those
opportunities for reflection. To think about why it isn’t going as well as you wanted it to. Why is
it going so well and how does that feel? To acknowledge the cognitive and affective aspects of
whatever you’re doing, so that it’s not just a task but an understanding of the process so that you
start to think about what learning is all about.”
“In Moscow we were able to get into other libraries, the SCi&Tech library and hear about
how they plan and do things and then we had the interchange with the other school librarians.
And no we didn’t see one but we got the opportunity to talk to them . most of the people were
asleep for all of that. That was the professional side that they didn’t get. I mean they were
tickled about the Google center, in that it was the GOOGLE center and they could have their
picture taken with the word google. But beyond that in terms of how is google interacting with
the Russian society, industries, the libraries… nobody had any questions like that. And that’s
where they kind of epiphany or wow factor starts to develop, but you have to be even interested.”

215

“What are their motivations for seeking this kind of experience? And we tried to get
some idea of that when they apply, when they express interest, but… they’re not always
forthcoming. It’s just so… people will tell you what they think you want to hear. So I don’t
know. Maybe we’ve just been so lucky that we’ve had such great groups so that to have last
year’s experience is just so hard to make sense of it.”
When asked to reflect on the group’s demeanor, the instructor shared disappointment in
their levels of motivation for learning and service.
o I’m inclined to think that so much depends on the students…who they are and why
they come on these trips. Unfortunately, I think for a percent of them, a significant
percent, want to come because it is an adventure, exciting to see a new place with a
group of people that will offer you some security and take the worry of organizing
everything away from you and not so much that this will be a great learning
opportunity in a professional sense…The group in Moscow was very limited in that
type of motivation.
o “I think the piece that they really missed was the whole service learning piece and I
don’t think that was our fault. I wonder whether they came into the experience with
the thought of it being more of a traditional study abroad experience.”
o “It was the professional side that they didn’t get…Nobody had any questions about
Google’s interaction with Russian society, industries or libraries (when at the Google
Center) and that’s where the epiphany or wow factor starts to develop, but you have
to be interested.”
o “I didn’t see that kind of exploration (asking questions and trying to integrate their
experience of what librarianship is) going on.”

216

o “I’m not sure that I can say confidentially that we met (the two objectives) this last
time for the majority, sadly.”
She also hypothesized on ways to mitigate these hurdles in the future.
x

“The assessment of who these students are ahead of time may be more important than
we really thought of before.”

x

“I think maybe what we learn from it is what we bring to it is as important as what we
experience.”

APPENDIX G
RESEARCHERS WORLD-VIEW

218

INITIAL
Before entering the PhD program, I had the opportunity to participate in the Guadalajara
Book Fair. My main task was to collect information for developing a Spanish language
collection at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. In additional to this, I gained both
professional knowledge and cultural knowledge of how the world of librarianship operates in
another country. The first few days the fair was only open to professional. I interacted with
publishers and librarians from many countries. I learned librarians attend these fairs yearly to be
able to purchase their Spanish collections in person because 1) many of the publishers in that
culture produce very limited runs of books, 2) to considerably reduce the cost of delivery, 3) to
learn what is new in the acquisition process, and 4) to establish an acquisitions plan with foreign
publishers.
The enlightening moment of the trip came on the 1st day that the public were allowed at
the fair. There were lines outside and crowds inside that equated to popular music concerts I had
attended. It was then that my literary/library cultural assumptions of Mexico were challenged. In
the US, I had experienced challenges with getting the Hispanic populations to read and into the
library. My world view was that they just didn’t or weren’t interested in reading. This moment
was truly culture shock. Thousands of people from all walks of life were vying for their chance
to buy the latest books. Several seasoned librarians explained to me that in Mexico and many
other Latin American countries reading was a large piece of their culture. However, their
libraries were not like ours. Libraries did not lend books. Patrons requested materials and then
were required to review them while at the library. In order to have a book at home or
recreationally, they had to buy it. Sometimes, this was possible at the library. So, my library
cultural awareness from that trip was an understanding that different cultures may have a passion

219

for reading but not come to the library because in their home country, libraries were a very
different experience.
A couple years later, as a manager of continuing education and consulting at a southern
state library, I became familiar with issues public libraries and librarians faced with the changed
demographics of patrons. As one of my employees became involved in ROSA (Reaching Our
Spanish-speaking Audiences, an initiative from OCLC Webjuction), I learned that there was
more to serving patrons from another culture than language skills and collection development.
These two experiences planted a seed that there may be a need for cultural competency not only
to interact with patrons but to function fully within the library profession.
My “teachable” moment came through a trip to South Africa. It was through that trip that
my eyes were opened to how librarianship was practiced and what “library” meant to others
outside of the US. I had never thought to think of my profession past what I learned during my
LIS program and what I had experienced in my resulting work life. Granted that in and of itself
is significant. I learned about providing service. I learned a philosophy of “information wants to
be free”. I learned a passion for ensuring that everyone has equal access to information. I learned
that information was the great equalizer. I learned toleration for other people’s beliefs, an ability
to defend the rights of others to have those opinions, and to provide assistance to others even
when I didn’t agree with their goals for having the information. I learned the balance between the
need for secure computer networks, the desire of parents to protect their children, and the right of
adults to privacy. I never realized until that trip that these lessons were not universal or at least
not universally practiced. It wasn’t until I stepped outside of what I knew that I learned there was
so much more to learn.

220

This learning experience transpired in 2009. I was invited to participate in a LIS
professional delegation to South Africa through the People-to-People (P2P) program. P2P,
originally founded by the Eisenhower administration to provide international good-will, provides
for ambassadorial trips to other countries to expand one’s world view and encourage growth in
becoming a global citizen. This particular trip took a delegation of 40+ librarians, including me,
to Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Pretoria, South Africa. During this trip, the group visited a
community library, a public library, University libraries, the township library of Soweto where
Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mendela studied, and the National Library of South Africa. Time was
also provided for touring and an afternoon of professional exchange with host librarians. The
experience itself made an impact on my understanding of the world and specifically
librarianship. However, there was an additional confluence of events that I believe turned that
experience into a transformative one.
The same semester that I went on this trip, I was enrolled in a qualitative analysis course.
We were given an assignment to conduct a sample study. It occurred to me that I had no idea
whether libraries in other countries functioned the same way they do in the US. So, I chose to
study how librarians from the US would react to seeing librarianship in another country. In this
small scale qualitative study, I sought to “first learn what biases western librarians have, as the
researcher is a member of that group as well; second, to learn whether these biases are uniform
across the US and types of librarian, and third, whether they can be mitigated through
international exposure” (Walczyk & Schultz-Jones, 2010). Through an observer-participant
perspective during the experience and conducting interviews with three participants upon
completion of the trip, I noticed six recurring items: influences affecting the trip, items better
than expected, items surprisingly not all that different, departures from US practice, personal /

221

professional stereotypes, and changes in attitude or behavior of the participant. Lasting
realizations from that experience were multidimensional. For some of my participants, they saw
how counter to ALA’s stance, not everyone serving as a librarian had to have a Masters degree.
They marveled at the National Librarian extolling a sense of pride and support for his direct
reports to participate in professional organizations at the local and international level – as
opposed to the constant struggle at home to prove their worth. They commented on the novel
idea of using cell phones as a means of routine information delivery. The demographics of the
library user surprised some – 20-40 year olds everywhere. It revitalized their belief in the ability
to be effective and provide a real impact in everything librarians touch. On a personal level, it
had never occurred to me that a whole segment of a population would be excluded from the right
to use or even have a library. I saw firsthand how revered the access to a library was. I was
amazed at the commitment of the catalogers at the National Library to provide records and
access to all materials in 11 languages to meet the need for an educated populace. I saw the
haven provided by libraries for those needing sanctuary from daily life. I could see a spirit of
independence and equality in the eyes of the children in the libraries. I learned that libraries
could spring from community centers as opposed to the current trend in the US of turning
libraries into a 3rd space. I saw all of my “universal truths” about libraries challenged and gained
a new sense of dedication to providing equal access to all. It was my own experience on that trip
plus studying the experiences of others that sparked my interest into researching how viewing
international librarianship has the potential to affect US librarians.
My interest in studying librarians’ reactions to international librarianship was provided a
more formal opportunity for research in 2010. As a result of the South Africa trip, I believed that
it was being exposed to another culture that caused such a profound shift in my world-view. I

222

applied for and was awarded a student/faculty grant to conduct “An Assessment of Cultural
Competence Factors in Relation to a Study Abroad Experience with Library and Information
Science Students”. The research was based on Montiel Overall’s Cultural Competencies Model
which illustrated the three factors, cognitive, interpersonal, and environmental, which make up
cultural competency. This model was one of the few that had been explicitly applied to the LIS
profession. The study’s research question was whether this model, which had previously only
been employed to study seasoned librarians, could be used to also develop cultural competency
in LIS students. The setting for the study was an international school library in Kyiv, Ukraine.
Students enrolled in two 10-week courses, one in Automation and the other in Special
Collections, spent three of those weeks engaged in a library redesign project at the QIS Library
in Kyiv. As part of their working experience, students were broken into five teams and provided
consultancy services as well as physical labor for collection development, cataloging, technology
issues, space planning and library policy development. During their evening and weekend hours,
students participated in coordinated sight-seeing, exploring downtown Kyiv with other
participants, and a group excursion to Lvov, a city on the border of Poland.
Within 3 weeks time, working together with the host library staff, the participants
transformed the library space from a basement that someone decided to place a library in, to an
inviting learning, reading, and social space. Host staff members were trained in copy cataloging,
running collection development repost, and several facets of their relatively new library catalog
system. Policies were developed and codified. A faculty survey regarding the library, it’s
effectiveness, and suggestions for enhancement was conducted. The majority of textbooks were
barcoded and entered into the system for the 1st time. An overwhelming sense of pride,
accomplishment, and gratitude from the host prevailed.

223

This qualitative study’s methods included collecting pre-experience surveys, in-situ
observations of the researcher and participants, and post-experience semi-structured interviews.
Initially, participants were surveyed regarding their previous experience within librarianship and
in travelling internationally, their expectations for participating in the experience, their existing
perceptions of libraries and librarianship, and their expectations of the library they would be
visiting, the library staff they would be engaged with, and the patrons they would see. The
surveys were analyzed and provided a baseline for comparison. The in-situ observations captured
real-time impressions and reactions to working within a library in another country/culture to
serve as supporting data. Upon participants’ return to the US, they provided for phone interviews
addressing their perceptions of libraries, librarians/library staff, and patrons in the Ukraine. The
final interviews were coded, analyzed, and presented 15 themes. These resulting themes were
evaluated in the light of Montiel Overall’s Model and the three domains of cultural competency.
This study found that 46% of all development for this cohort resided in the interpersonal domain.
It seemed that growth stemmed from the intense interaction with others, both in the host country
and within the cohort. Additionally, the content area most affected was overall “librarianship
assumptions” – a self-reflection of what the participants has previously known about
librarianship in light of what they had seen in the Ukraine. This last piece of information was an
unforeseen outcome. It appeared that going to a foreign country to work on a library project
could affect LIS student’s professional acculturation and development.

RESULTING
Reactions to the Host School
x

I am amazed by how great the AAS Moscow library was.

x

As for Russia, the site was more impressive than any US school library I've ever heard of. It
already had all its systems and structures in place and had 2 great librarians (one lower house
and one for the upper students). When we arrived we learned that what they really were
looking for was a complete review of where they currently stood and recommendations as to
where they should be going. The school administration was wanting to do away with
everything and go e-books and didn't really understand what the value was of a library. So
our teams did an analytical review of their respective areas and compiled a detail report
linking it to the mission statement and strategic plan for the school as a whole.

Reactions to the Lenin Library/Russian librarianship.
x

We have entered and there are security guards at the front gate. I had to get a pass and let go
of my backpack at the front door. Technically I’m not supposed to take pictures in here but I
just came up to a big huge marble staircase and oh my god the card catalog! Oh my god the
card catalog! Wow!

x

Some of the biggest differences… I’ve never seen a completely closed stacks library before.
There is nothing, absolutely nothing that you are allowed to take out of that building. The
word “borrow” means something completely different in that library then I’ve ever thought
of before. I’ve never thought of “borrow” to mean you can take it over there to that desk and
look at it. That just kind of hit me very odd.

x

… it felt like people weren’t allowed to get to the books and everything was being controlled.
The other side of it for me was the reverence and the want for protecting the materials … (I)
225

was there was thinking about myself as a patron and not being able to take the books home,
about having to go the library and sit there for hours and hours on end, about having to go
back day after day after day to look at the books, about waiting for hours for books to be
pulled off the shelves and about not knowing whether or not the books would even come
back off the shelves until a pile showed up. All the security was interesting as was the
enormity of the card catalog and trying to understand the numbering system.
x

It’s (the library’s) just massive, the great study hall with the busts of the Lenin and all of the
intellectual minds looking down on you was phenomenal. It had a sense of “you are here to
study and this is a place of intellect” and that “this is what this institution is for and that has
purpose”.

x

There were vacuum tubes and the dumbbell carts for bringing the books back and getting the
messages to the actual other building where the books are stored in another building, the
book depository building. So the big huge library is not really… it’s just where the people go.
It’s not where the books are. The books are stored in another building and when they get the
message, they are pulled and they are wheeled on carts through tunnels from one building to
another and then put on dumbbell carts and brought upstairs through them. They are then
called by card number of the patron’s card and given their stack. But it’s just amazing. It
reminded me of the system in South Africa in the new national library except they had the
pneumatic tubes system which was quite a bit update as that was a brand new building.

x

All the desks were manned but there were only maybe 2 of the reference desks or
information desks that were unmanned at any one time. At least for us, everyone was very
helpful. I only saw one instance of a reference person talking to another Russian where it

226

seemed as if they were being bothered. So the stories I’d heard of people being treated poorly
did not hold true.
x

Here are your cards. (Oh my god – me). These are the spine labels. if there are any older
cards they look much more like this… (But what does that mean? – me) I have no idea. I
think unless you go to library science or if you get a special tour they will explain to you but
regular people are not supposed to know what this means. you’re just supposed to copy this
on your request sheet and you would hand it to them. (so you would put that where? – me)
Not here. You go, take separate sheets and when you’re requesting this you’re supposed to
put all of this code, the author, and title, when it was published and where. so you would
have take your stack of papers. we do also have some books in English and german but most
of the foreign language is in the back further down. There’s also the electronic catalog but
I’m sure they’re still in the process of updating. this is one of the forms. you would put your
card number, date, the code number. This is for one book. you would have to fill out a form
for each book. so this is where the attendants are supposed to sit and that is why everyone is
standing around.

Reactions to the Participants.
x

I talked with someone on the Metro this morning and asked him what was the farthest out of
his comfort zone. He said it was the first time they came down to the metro. It was just you
had no clue where you were going. It was so dark and foreboding. Also going to the
restaurants on Friday where instead of a maître d’ that welcomed you there was a guard at the
door. You pushed a button and he came to you and asked if you had a reservation. He had to
say “yes we have a reservation made by” someone and the guard said “yes I know her, you

227

may come in”. It was all very controlled. It was just very... It wasn’t mean. It was just all
very solemn. It was very Russian, what you would think of as Russian.
x

I also asked someone what was the farthest thing out of her comfort zone. For her it was
definitely the food. The food was what was out of her comfort zone. Just the certain things
that you would eat and the things you wouldn’t eat here. She just couldn’t get beyond certain
things.

x

Someone jokingly made the comment about the Cyrillic alphabet about how wouldn’t it just
be easier for all of them to just learn our alphabet. It wouldn’t take that much for them to just
learn a few of our letters because it’s almost ours anyway. You just have to change the C to
an S and the pi to a p and it would be much easier for them to do then for us to do.

x

I was hoping to see if going on the experience would deepen students cultural competency.
What I found out was that it really didn't but what that particular cohort experienced was a
deepening of LIS professional competency from being with other professionals for 3 weeks
in effective isolation working in a library (isolation due to being completely out of not only
their own element but their own country's way of "doing" librarianship).

x

What I found in this study was "it depends".... it depends on the interest and dedication of the
students to the project itself and not "site seeing".

x

They don’t seem to get how different real Russian libraries are from US libraries, but they
didn’t see what I saw at the Lenin library.

Personal limitations.
x

I had physical challenges with stairs and jet lag.

x

I felt that when people to out in big groups, there are people who know how to go out in big
groups and people who don’t know how to go out in big groups. There are people who are
228

good about making sure that everyone in the group is still there and then there are people
who run off and don’t.
