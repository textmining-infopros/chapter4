Abstract
Sense-making theory involves a sociological/communications science approach to the
need of students to make sense of their environment and the information they are seeking
to find. With many digital resources to choose from, non-traditional students often have
difficulty finding the best resource for their assignments, opting for the easiest path to
information. Students must have the skills needed to find and evaluate information. Skills
based on the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education from the
Association of College and Research Libraries Division of the American Library
Association include the ability to determine the nature and extent of information needed,
access needed information effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and sources
critically, understand legal, social and economic issues of information and ethically use
that information. A lack of self-confidence to conduct quality library research, and the
absence of prior library experience and other factors, weave into the fabric of nontraditional students who need to conduct digital research. Characteristics of nontraditional students may include, being over age 26, working outside the home, first-infamily to attend college, and/or have not had access to digital resources The nontraditional adult student may also experience library anxiety. Exploration of students’
research behaviors exists; however studying the behaviors of the non-traditional student
has not been isolated. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how
non-traditional students prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg. A phenomenological approach attempted to discover
how students draw on resources in an attempt to develop an approach to a research

3

assignment. This study conducted in-depth interviews to capture student experience. The
inclusion of think-alouds captured the verbalized thought processes of students as they
worked on their assignment. The target population was non-traditional college students
enrolled in a university in South Florida.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Due to the growth of online databases and sources such as Google Scholar,
students are increasingly accessing materials for assignments from Internet sites
(Garoufallou et al, 2008). Questions arise related to the information seeking skills and
behaviors of students, such as how and where they seek, and how they make research
choices. Students typically emphasize efficiency over thoroughness, preferring resources
found easily and quickly, without regard to the quality or relevance of the data (Asher &
Duke, 2011; Head & Eisenberg 2010; Robinson & Gilliam, 2014). Students often begin
research on the Internet, especially with Google, rather than physically visiting the
campus library (Gauder, 2011; Head & Eisenberg, 2010; Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Tseng,
Liang, & Tsai, 2014).
Reliable information is available on the Internet through subscription databases
and other sources. Students must have the skills needed to find and evaluate information
(Asher & Duke, 2011). The skills required for academic pursuits are often overlooked or
underused prior to admission to college (Staines, 2011). Topic selection, searching,
evaluation and ethical use are critical thinking skills developed by using tools referred to
in the Big Six Model (Eisenberg & Berkowitz, 2010), Purpose Location Use SelfEvaluation (PLUS) model (Herring, 2004), Information Skills Process from the New
South Wales Department of Education and Training (NSW DET, 2012 ), Bloom’s
Taxonomy, and the Digital Information Fluency Model (Information Fluency, 2013).
Skills based on the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education
from the Association of College and Research Libraries Division of the American Library
Association include the ability to determine the nature and extent of information needed,

9

access needed information effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and sources
critically, understand legal, social and economic issues of information and ethically use
that information (Cameron, Wise & Lottridge, 2013).

Background
The National Center for Educational Statistics defined non-traditional students as
men and women students older than 26, often working outside the home, who are
economically and culturally challenged (Aud, Wilkinson-Flicker, Kristapovich, Rathbun,
Wang, Zhang, 2013). The definition is used as a foundational description in continuing
research (Ross-Gordon, 2011). The majority of students born prior to the proliferation of
desktop computers, or who have not had adequate access to computers, hindered by a
lack of familiarity with computer information, digital fluency and Internet access, are
categorized as non-traditional students (Overall, 2010). Many students are premillennials, that is, people over the age of 26, who have not had access to digital
resources or the opportunities of more affluent students; they may not have had
experience with computers for academic purposes (Overall, 2010). Among issues facing
non-traditional students in higher education are their self-perceived skill level, anxiety
with technology and the Internet, and comfort using digital resources for academic
pursuits (Bolliger & Halupa, 2012; Peou & Lwin, 2011; Smith, 2011).
Library anxiety, based on a lack of self-confidence to conduct quality library
research, the absence of prior library experience and other factors, weaves into the fabric
of issues facing college students who need to conduct digital research for assignments
(Platt & Platt, 2013). This anxiety permeates society among certain societal groups, such

10

as the working poor, immigrants, and returning adult students interfering with their
access to information (Overall, 2010; Ross-Gordon, 2011). The non-traditional adult
student who may experience library anxiety is at a disadvantage due to a lack of
resources, exposure and training in information literacy (Tury, Robinson, & Bawden,
2015).
People in Western society are familiar with email and Google, but this does not
mean they are ready for serious academic inquiry (Staines, 2011). Access to information,
including the skill to find appropriate resources, is paramount for people to achieve
personal goals (Ally & Samaka, 2013). Sense-making theory involves a
sociological/communications science approach to the need of individuals and students to
make sense of their environment and the information they are seeking to find (Argawal,
2013; Dervin, 2012). With many digital resources to choose from, non-traditional
students often have difficulty finding the best resource for their assignments, opting for
the easiest path to information (Asher & Duke, 2012; Peou & Lwin, 2011).
Statement of the Problem
Students are often in need of research skills for academic research as well as lifelong learning (Staines, 2011). The specific problem is that older adults and returning
students defined as non-traditional students often do not possess the skills and resources
needed for the rigors of college-level academic research (Ascenuik, 2012). Isolated data
on information literacy skills of the non-traditional student have been difficult to obtain
(Ascenuik, 2012; Dawson, Charman & Kilpatrick 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2010;
Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis 2006; Wang 2006).

11

Academic information is available digitally, through a variety of platforms and
Internet sites, which channel students through specific venues to databases and scholarly
material. This channeling feeds students to and through proprietary products, thus
controlling and influencing how, as well as what, pre-college students learn (Chen, 2012).
A need exists for developing life-long research skills in students and faculty alike
(Staines, 2011). These skills involve the integration of online technology and resources
with proficiency in topic selection, searching and evaluating the existing research (EltonChalcraft, et al, 2008). Wheeler (2012) refers to the skills involved in using online
resources as digital learning skills. Students may face a multitude of issues with the onset
of their higher education careers, including a mismatch between their perceived and
actual information literacy competency (Latham & Gross, 2013). Exploration of students’
research behaviors exists (Ge, 2010; Gross & Latham, 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2009,
2010; Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis, 2006; Wang, 2006), however
studying the behaviors of the non-traditional student has not been isolated.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how non-traditional
students prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg (2009). A phenomenological approach attempted to
discover how students draw on resources in an attempt to develop an approach to a
research assignment. A phenomenological study captured student experience with indepth interviews (Eberle, 2014; Patton, 2002). A survey captured demographic
information. Think-alouds captured the verbalized thought processes of students as they

12

worked on their assignment. The target population were non-traditional college students
enrolled in a university in South Florida. Non-traditional students are defined as students
who may be over the age of 26, working outside the home, first-in-family to attend
college, and / or who have not had access to digital resources; they may not have had
extensive experience with computers for academic purposes (Overall, 2010, Robinson &
Gilliam, 2014). Participants of this study consisted of seven non-traditional students from
an institution of higher education in South Florida. Student participation was confidential
and voluntary. Student participants was taken from classes that had in their syllabus, an
assignment to write a paper using library resources, such as print and electronic books
and electronic subscription databases. Participants had an assigned research paper by
their instructor prior to inclusion in the study. Using the institution-wide email system,
students were invited to participate by email. Students were interviewed as to their
experiences with conducting the initial stages of their assignment. Data was interpreted
and analyzed.
Research Questions
Embracing the framework of social constructivism, the central theme of the study
concerns itself with the experiences and critical thinking skill attainment of nontraditional college students in their ability to begin academic research using digital
resources (Mabry, 2010). Studies specifically focusing on the library and digital research
skills of non-traditional students at private universities in the United States are not
available (Dawson, Charman & Kilpatrick 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2010; Kayongo &
Helm, 2010; Peou & Lwin, 2011; Shen, 2007; Wallis 2006; Wang 2006). Open-ended

13

interviews with non-traditional students will be included to collect reflective
conversations (Williamson, 2014; Yin, 2012).
Q1. What are the experiences of non-traditional college students as they begin the
first phase of online research for a course related research assignment, identified
by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big Picture?
Q2. What are the perceptions of non-traditional college students as they begin the
first phase of online research for a course related research assignment, identified
by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big Picture?
Nature of the Study
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how non-traditional
students prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg (2009). A phenomenological approach attempted to
discover how students draw on resources in an attempt to develop an approach to a
research assignment. A phenomenological study captured student experience with indepth interviews (Patton, 2002). The target population were non-traditional college
students enrolled in a college or university in South Florida. Non-traditional students are
defined as students who may be over the age of 26, working outside the home, first-infamily to attend college, and / or who have not had access to digital resources; they may
not have had extensive experience with computers for academic purposes (Overall,
2010). Participants of this study consisted of a minimum of seven non-traditional students
from an institution of higher education in South Florida. Student participation was
confidential and voluntary. Students were invited to participate by internal institutional

14

email. Students were provided with a consent form and asked to participate in the study.
There was no incentive to participate in the study other than the opportunity to discuss
their experiences regarding library research. Participants were recruited from classes that
had an assigned research paper to write. Students were interviewed as to their experiences
while conducting the initial stages of their assignment.
Significance of the Study
Students are often in need of research skills for academic research as well as lifelong learning (Staines, 2011). The specific problem is that older adults and returning
students defined as non-traditional students often do not possess the skills and resources
needed for the rigors of college-level academic research (Ascenuik, 2012). Isolated data
on information literacy skills of the non-traditional student have been difficult to obtain
(Ascenuik, 2012; Dawson, Charman & Kilpatrick 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2010;
Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis 2006; Wang 2006).
Academic information is available digitally, through a variety of platforms and
Internet sites, which channel students through specific venues to databases and scholarly
material. This channeling feeds students to and through proprietary products, thus
controlling and influencing how, as well as what, pre-college students learn (Chen, 2012).
A need exists for developing life-long research skills in students and faculty alike
(Staines, 2011). These skills involve the integration of online technology and resources
with proficiency in topic selection, searching and evaluating the existing research (EltonChalcraft, et al, 2008). Wheeler (2012) refers to the skills involved in using online
resources as digital learning skills. Students may face a multitude of issues with the onset
of their higher education careers, including a mismatch between their perceived and

15

actual information literacy competency (Latham & Gross, 2013). Exploration of students’
research behaviors exists (Ge, 2010; Gross & Latham, 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2009,
2010; Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis, 2006; Wang, 2006), however
studying the behaviors of the non-traditional student has not been isolated. A study of
non-traditional students’ information-searching behavior will provide the academic
community with a window into the perspectives that non-traditional students embrace as
they conduct academic research, and provide insights for a pedagogical pathway to
develop tools and learning experiences to successful information-literate experiences.
Definition of Key Terms
The following terms are identified as critical to understanding the research study:

Authoritative source. An authoritative source is a managed repository of valid
or trusted data that is recognized by an appropriate set of governance entities and
supports the governance entity’s business environment (Westman, 2009).
Big picture context. The Big Picture Context is the first stage of research where
a student gathers the background materials for defining and selecting a topic. It is the
stage where a student determines what is needed to begin research (Head & Eisenberg,
2009).
Big Six™ model. The Big6 ™ skills provide a systematic approach to
information problem solving that relies upon critical thinking skills. The Big6™ skills
can be used by librarians, teachers, and information specialists to help learners attain
information literacy and provide a full understanding beyond merely being able to locate
resources within a library. It involves a systematic approach to information problem

16

solving, six broad skill areas necessary for successful information problem solving, a
complete library, and information skill curriculum (Eisenberg, Johnson & Berkowitz,
2010).
Bloom’s Taxonomy. Bloom’s Taxonomy is a heuristic for studying,
understanding, and solving educational problems (Krathwohl & Anderson, 2010).
Concurrent protocol analysis. Concurrent protocol analysis is also known as
think-aloud protocol. It is a method of gathering qualitative information from participants
by asking them to verbalize their thoughts while performing a behavior (Baldacchino, et
al, 2014).
Context. Context, as used by Head and Eisenberg in their studies on information
seeking behavior, refers to how students operationalize and prioritize the task of a
research process (Head & Eisenberg, 2009).
Critical theory. Critical theory refers less to theory than to the examination and
critique of society. It is part of the history of the search for knowledge and, with enriched
understanding, the improvement of the human condition. This quest to understand has
advanced from superstition to mythology to religion, to science and to social science
(Mabry, 2010).
Critical thinking skills. Critical thinking, or higher order reasoning skills, are (a)
application, the ability to apply the basic concepts to real-world problems or situations;
(b) analysis, the ability to recognize and explain major underlying assumptions; (c)
synthesis, the ability to build simple models based on principles; and (d) evaluation, the
ability to compare and contrast the costs and benefits of simple models and explain why
one is better than another. Although not all of these skills need be well developed

17

simultaneously, reasoning skills must advance to at least the level of application for the
student to engage in independent lifelong learning that achieves goals beyond selfimprovement projects or leisure activities (Dynan, Cate & Rhee, 2008).
Cultural relativism. Cultural relativism is an attempt to be as unbiased and
objective as possible, when studying people from diverse cultures. It is the ability to
reflect on his (our) culture without passing judgment (Johnson, 2007).
Digital fluency. Digital fluency is a set of skills required to competently find and
evaluate online materials that combines critical thinking skills with the mastery of
Internet technology (Bartlett & Miller, 2011).
Digital learning. Digital learning is defined as any set of technology-based
methods that can be applied to support learning and instruction (Wheeler 2012).
Google Scholar. Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for
scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources:
articles, theses, books, abstracts, and court opinions, from academic publishers,
professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites. Google
Scholar helps you find relevant work across the world of scholarly research (Sharkey,
2013).
Guided Inquiry. Based on the studies of Kuhlthau, guided inquiry is a process of
investigation and analysis for students, which, when coached by teachers and librarians,
reduce anxiety and assist students in the complex process of information searching.
(Kuhlthau, 2010).
Information and communication technologies (ICT). ICT includes the physical
telecommunications equipment, such as computer hardware and peripherals, as well as

18

the systems and services needed for use, such as software, processes, storage and
networking for the transmission of information. ICT is seen as a tool to support education
and knowledge dissemination in a student-centered setting (Sarkar, 2012).
Information-gathering context. The Information-Gathering Context is the stage
at which the student locates full text journal articles and other relevant scholarly material
for the research topic (Head & Eisenberg, 2009).
Information literacy. In its most simple definition, Information literacy is the set
of skills needed to find, retrieve, analyze, and use information. The Association of
College and Research Libraries, an arm of the American Library Association, has
developed a set of standards that assist libraries in providing the level of service needed
to achieve literacy for their users. Information literacy forms the basis for lifelong
learning. It is common to all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of
education. It enables learners to master content and extend their investigations, become
more self-directed, and assume greater control over their own learning. An information
literate individual is able to determine the extent of information needed, access the
needed information effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and its sources
critically, incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base, use information
effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, understand the economic, legal, and social
issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and
legally (ALA 2013).
Information Search Process. The information search process is a model of
inquiry, providing a holistic approach to the process of gathering information and
developing research assignments. It was first designed by Kuhlthau in 1985, consisting of

19

six stages: task initiation, topic selection, pre-focus exploration, focus formulation,
information collection and presentation. In 2007, Kuhlthau added a seventh stage,
assessing, which provides reflection on the process (Kuhlthau & Maniotes, 2010). More
recently, the stages were renamed and an eighth stage was included. These stages are now
called, open, immerse, explore, identify, gather, create, share, and evaluate. The
information search process is widely used throughout the world and it can be adjusted for
use by a variety of cultures. (Kuhlthau & Kasai, 2013).
Information-seeking behavior. Information-seeking Behavior is an individual’s
way and manner of gathering and sourcing for information for personal use, knowledge
updating, and development (Ajiboye and Tella, 2007). In the context of higher education,
it means those behaviors and characteristics that are used to find, gather, understand, and
use information for educational or personal needs.
Library Anxiety. Library Anxiety is a term created by Constance A. Mellon, a
professor of library science at East Carolina University in 1986, where she developed a
construct based on grounded theory to explain the behaviors of college students when
confronted with a research assignment (Gremmels, 2015). Mellon’s study and subsequent
articles published in academic journals have opened the paths for ongoing
phenomenological study on the subject.
Library Anxiety Scale. The Library Anxiety Scale was developed in 1992 by
Sharon L. Bostick, based on Mellon’s construct of library anxiety, to provide a testing
instrument to measure library anxiety in undergraduate college students (Gremmels,
2015).

20

Millennial. A millennial is loosely defined as those people born from 1981-2000.
More specifically, this cohort shares the following: they are the most ethnically and
racially diverse cohort of youth in the nation's history. Among those ages 13 to 29: 18.5%
are Hispanic; 14.2% are black; 4.3% are Asian; 3.2% are mixed race or other; and 59.8%,
a record low, are white. They are starting out as the most politically progressive age
group in modern history. In the 2008 election, Millennials voted for Barack Obama over
John McCain by 66% to 32%, while adults aged 30 and over split their votes 50% to
49%. In the four decades since the development of Election Day exit polling, this is the
largest gap ever seen in a presidential election between the votes of those under and over
age 30. They are the first generation in human history who regards behaviors like
tweeting and texting, along with websites like Facebook, YouTube, Google, and
Wikipedia, not as astonishing innovations of the digital era, but as everyday parts of their
social lives and their search for understanding. They are the least religiously observant
youths since survey research began charting religious behavior. They are more inclined
toward trust in institutions than were either of their two predecessor generations -- Gen
Xers (who are now ages 30 to 45) or of Baby Boomers (now ages 46 to 64) when they
were coming of age (Keeter & Taylor, 2009).
Language context. Language Context is the stage of research where a student
determines the words and terminology associated with the topic to be researched (Head &
Eisenberg, 2009).
Non-traditional student. The National Center for Educational Statistics, Institute
of Education Sciences, provides an authoritative definition of the non-traditional student.
Non-traditional status is based on the presence of one or more of seven possible non-

21

traditional characteristics. These characteristics include older than typical age (over 26
years old), part-time attendance, being independent of parents, working full time while
enrolled, having dependents, being a single parent, and being a recipient of a GED or
high school completion certificate (Radwin, Wine, Siegel, Bryan, 2013).
Phenomenology. Phenomenology, as it relates to research in the social and
educational sciences, is the study and analysis of experience, and is used as a
methodology for qualitative research, collecting the participants’ subjective observations
and experiences in a real world environment (Eberle, 2014).
Project Information Literacy. Project Information Literacy is a national study
begun in 2007 by the University of Washington’s Information School to study the
research habits of younger adults (i.e. Traditional students). To date, they have collected
data from over 13,000 students enrolled in community colleges, colleges and universities
(Head, 2016).
Sense-making methodology (SMM). A methodology based on Dervin’s theory
of sense-making, involving understanding people’s sense-making processes in various
situations involving gathering and using information. (Reinhard & Dervin, 2012).
Situational context. During the Situational Context phase of Head and
Eisenberg’s construct, a student determines the depth and breadth of the research to be
conducted, based on the surrounding circumstances, including time issues, guidelines,
and rubrics set by instructors, and the student’s expectations for grades (Head &
Eisenberg, 2009).
Subscription database. A subscription database is a database (information stored
in computer files, assembled and marketed by commercial firms, with fee or subscription

22

based access. These are not internet sources) for which a library or other organization
pays a subscription fee to have access to the materials in the database. These databases
are not available to the general public on the open market, or freely through open access
(Middle Tennessee State University, 2010).
Think-aloud protocol (TAP). A strategy whereby participants are asked to
vocalize their thought processes as they are deciding how to answer questions or conduct
an operation (Van Someren, 2003); this provides detailed information on how students
approach learning tasks (Winne & Perry, 2000). Responses can be recorded and
transcribed.
Summary
Data isolating the online research gathering and using skill-sets of
undergraduate and graduate students at proprietary online and ground institutions have
been difficult to collect (Wang, 2006; Wallis, 2006; Shen, 2007, Kayongo & Helm, 2010;
Head & Eisenberg, 2009 and 2010). A study, using non-traditional students at a private
university, will elucidate the skills that are used or lacking by students at a proprietary
university. Including university librarians in the study to discuss their findings, training
programs, and their own readiness to assist culturally and socioeconomically diverse,
students will be enlightening.

Chapter 2: Literature Review
Documentation
A review of existing literature was conducted using databases found in the
Northcentral University library collection, as well as those found using electronic
resources from public libraries, Internet sites, and the American Library Association. Key
terms, such as information-seeking behavior, non-traditional student, information
literacy, library anxiety and digital fluency were used to search for professional, peerreviewed articles in AACE Digital Library, Ebrary, EbscoHost, ERIC, Gale Academic,
OCLC, ProQuest, Sage Journals, and World Cat databases. These searches provided an
understanding of the issues, history, and current research in the area of information
literacy as well as providing a theoretical framework to direct this study.
Background
Higher education is largely conducted with an emphasis on using technology as a
tool to read both required and suggested reading and to gather research materials for
research papers. Even students who participate in the face-to-face classroom experience
often have difficulty with online library research (Bolliger & Halupa, 2011). This
requires students to have familiarity and proficiency with the technology (Bolliger &
Halupa, 2011). Students who either believe they lack or actually do lack the skills often
report feelings of frustration and anxiety (Bolliger & Halupa, 2011; Duncan &
Holtslander, 2012).
Studies culminating with Gauder’s (2011) report on users’ perceptions of libraries
revealed that students, as well as the general population often prefer information that is

24

easy and quick to obtain, and which appears to be relevant. (Shen, 2007; Head, 2010
Gauder, 2011). The users would prefer finding and using seemingly appropriate data
quickly, rather than laboring over time-intensive research even though the latter may
provide a higher sense of authority and perspective of the material. Users, whether
students or the general public, are looking for quick answers, not necessarily the best
answers. Metaphorically, most users prefer fast-food style research to the more gourmet,
labor intensive style in-depth, robust enquiry. Gauder observed that 82 % of traditional
American students often begin their research with Google or Wikipedia, despite their
instructors’ counsel to avoid them (Gauder, 2010). Further, students in the study were not
yet ready with the skills needed to be digitally literate. Only 7% of the respondents
indicated that they consulted a librarian to assist with digital research (Gauder, 2010).
The correlation between lack of professional instruction or assistance and the inability of
students to quickly and easily search for appropriate information for assignments is
profound and necessitates further inquiry.
Much research has been conducted for years, dating back to the latter decades of
the 20th century, regarding information-seeking behavior of students (Ajiboye & Tella,
2007; Bhatia & Rao, 2011; Chow, 2012; Chung & Newman, 2007; Duke & Asher, 2012;
Joseph, Debowski, & Goldschmidt, 2013; Mavodza, 2011; Medaille, 2009; Pelligrino,
2012; Rupp-Serrano & Robbins, 2013; Sahin, Balta, & Ercan, 2010). Librarians and
information providers wanted to determine if their efforts in assisting users with digital
fluency were valuable and useful (ALA, 2000). The Association of College and Research
Libraries, a division of the American Library Association, after thorough study,
determined that due to continually changing technology, a set of criteria must be

25

developed to set standards in information literacy. Information literacy is defined as the
attainment of a set of skills enabling users to search for and find accurate, relevant and
appropriate information (ALA, 2000). Society must be able to stay abreast of new
information, in whatever form it may take. These criteria were written, adopted, and
endorsed in 1999. The resulting document was entitled, The Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (ALA, 2000). Beginning in 2000, the
standards began to take shape in the form of a new set of library instruction outcomes for
information seekers. The Information Competency Standards contain five distinct, yet
related progressive skill sets. The first set of skills involves the ability to search for
appropriate information. Some of the questions a student must ask are: What is my topic?
What do I need to find? Where can I find it? Will this information be acceptable to my
professor?
Shen (2007) studied a small group of faculty in the field of sociology and
established that, in most cases, the faculty used the sources they frequently used as
students, and with which they are most familiar, rather than the most authoritative. The
experienced information seekers, it was found, worked within the framework of a
process, which consists of a series of stages, from determining the information needs, to
discerning their strategies for information seeking, evaluating the relevance of the
material, and then using the information (Shen, 2007). The study indicated that the
appropriate skills have not been learned, even by the academics often conducting
research.
Kuhlthau and Maniotes (2010) studied elementary and middle school students
while they thought and searched for information based on what they refer to as guided

26

inquiry. Guided inquiry grew out of Kuhlthau’s earlier work with high school students,
their research assignments and the anxiety that the students exhibited while conducting
their research (Kuhlthau, 1991). Using the qualitative results from her studies, Kuhlthau
designed the information search process to understand the distinct stages the students
passed through while developing their research papers (1991). The information search
process (ISP) identifies six stages which provide a framework for understanding how
students feel while they seek and use information (Kim, 2015). Kim (2015) applies
Kuhlthau’s framework of ISP to a group of high school English language learners to
determine the anxiety levels of the students before and after the applying the framework.
Her study indicated that students using Kuhlthau’s framework of guided inquiry
expressed much lower levels of anxiety while searching for information, revealing that
students using the framework throughout their assignment, and especially at the
beginning stages, were more satisfied with the searching process (Kuhlthau, 2015). The
first stage of Kuhlthau’s ISP model, initiation task, can be closely aligned with the Big
Picture context described in studies by Head and Eisenberg (2009).
Head & Eisenberg (2009) identified four types of contexts based on their research
into the information seeking behaviors of college students at public and private colleges
and universities: (a) the Big Picture, (b) Language, (c) Situational, and (d) Informationgathering. Students must pass through each context in the same order, but, depending on
various factors, may spend different amounts of time in each (2009). The Big Picture
relates to the initial stages of choosing a topic, from selecting it and defining its scope. It
is often at this stage where students begin to use the Internet and libraries, both at the

27

physical campus and online, to obtain the subject specific information needed for their
assignments (Head & Eisenberg, 2009).
At the same time Shen was studying faculty, Dr. Alison Head, then of Saint
Mary’s College in California gathered a team of faculty and librarians to study the
information literacy skills of college students in 2007. This project grew in depth and
breadth, moving to the University of Washington in 2008, where Head and Eisenberg
created the Information Literacy Project to study all aspects of information literacy. Head
and Eisenberg’s first study (2009) explored the context in which students operated. The
findings indicated that students were challenged and frustrated in their failure (Head &
Eisenberg, 2009) to locate the research they need for assignments. This study was the
impetus for further qualitative exploration into the skills required to successfully and
critically find, evaluate, use, and understand online research materials.
Georgas (2014) has conducted a study on the comparison of students using the
Google search engine and a Library federated search engine to conduct academic
searches. Federated search engines have been designed to discover journal articles and
other scholarly information -- such as author, title and publication -- via a strict set of
stylized keywords and symbols, and not natural language keywords, as those used by
Google (Georgas, 2014). Students overwhelmingly (69%) used natural language more
consistently and in more searches than keyword or Boolean phrases when conducting a
research query (Georgas, 2014). Even when students were using library databases to
access materials, they used natural language over the use of synonyms or keywords, as
frequently suggested by librarians (Georgas, 2014). Students expected the library
databases to work just like a Google search engine (Georgas, 2014). Students have a lack

28

of knowledge or understanding about how the library database is structured so they often
do not obtain the results they anticipate in a timeframe that is acceptable to them
(Georgas, 2014). Librarians are urging the database providers to become more intuitive
and Google-like in their searching so that the learning curve may be shortened and results
would be more reliable, accurate and expedient (Georgas, 2104). Progress has been
noticed in this area, as some databases are being redesigned and are now equipped to
anticipate spelling inconsistencies, for example, similar to the Google, did you mean…
(Georgas, 2014).
Ge’s (2010) study of graduate students at one university in Tennessee had already
found that doctoral students and faculty in the humanities and social sciences might begin
their research with the less authoritative sources, thus agreeing with both Shen (2007) and
Head (2010). However, because the students in this study were graduate students and
specializing in their particular fields, the students were found to move onto more
research-based, scholarly materials as they continued their searches. Non-traditional
students in Ge’s study were not designated. Ge concluded that the eight types of
electronic resources used by the students in his study influenced their informationseeking behavior (2010). In other words, the students were limited to information based
on their ability and skill to search for, find and use the digital information. Many of the
participants discussed the obstacles faced when attempting to use electronic resources,
such as a lack of availability, lack of accessibility, and issues with usability. Ge
concluded that with librarian- guided training, the obstacles might be reduced (2010). All
users, whether students or the public, who are attempting digital research can benefit
from professionally guided training (Ge, 2010).

29

Non-traditional Student and the Digital Divide
The digital divide is the issue of the disparity between the haves and have-nots.
Complex factors influence both the access to information and the skills required to find,
evaluate and use information (Starkey, 2013). Both forms of inequality compound the
digital divide as it pertains to the non-traditional student (2013). Access to information is
the ability to be able to find and sit at a working computer that is connected to electronic
resources (2013).
Although more than 87% of the United State population (Pew 2014) now have
Internet access, the digital divide continues to persist (Gonzales, 2015). There has been a
shift in definition regarding the digital divide. It is no longer meant to simply mean the
gap between those having and not having access to a computer with Internet capability.
This is an insufficient definition, which must be broadened to include other factors of
Internet access. Having access, whether at home, in school or a public location is just one
aspect of access. A more complex and layered understanding of the digital divide
embraces having initial access to the technology, maintaining stable access and the
motivational attitude to sustain and take advantage of the access (Gonzales, 2015).
The most basic factor in obtaining access may still not be easy or convenient for
the lower socioeconomic strata; cost of purchasing a computer and monthly Internet fees,
transportation to the place of access if outside the home, childcare needs to sit alone to
study, read or complete job applications, hours of operation of the facility, and time
constraints on the part of the user as well as the facility. Just because a coffee house or
library is wired for Internet, does not constitute access. Does the user have the ability to
get to and from that location during operating hours; are the computer terminals available

30

at the library? Does the user rely on public or inconsistent transportation? Just having the
computers physically at the library does not constitute access. Many libraries have
waiting lists for use and restrict the time permitted by each user (Gonzales, 2015).
Another part of the access equation is the ability to maintain stable access.
Computers at public stations fall into disrepair. Technology malfunctions. Software
programs require upgrading or updating to stay current. In poorer communities, public
facilities may not have the resources to maintain dependable access, thereby restricting
on-going and stable use (Gonzales, 2015). At home, those who do have computers must
maintain the physical equipment in working order and also have consistent stable
electronic online access. When equipment fails and needs repair, those without sufficient
expendable income may consider repairs less important than other things, such as rent or
food (Gonzales, 2015). In older, poorer communities, malfunctions and disconnections
are more frequent and go unresolved for longer periods than in more affluent
communities (Gonzales, 2015). Even those who own smartphones have issues with
maintaining phone service consistently, reporting that their phones were turned off for
non-payment, hence, no Internet access (Gonzales, 2015).
The third factor that comes into play regarding access is the attitude of the user
toward technology in general, and the Internet in particular (Gonzales, 2015). It has been
noted that there is a perceived lack of relevance, a fear of the technology, and cultural
norms that interfere with increasing use of the Internet (Gonzales, 2015). Although many
see the Internet as an important means toward employment (completing applications
online) and education (homework), there are mixed feelings as to the relevance to their
daily lives (Gonzales, 2015). Considering that maintaining a computer and Internet

31

access is costly, the negative attitude toward personal computer use may be a defensive
tactic due to a dearth of finances (Gonzales, 2015) rather than a disdain for the
technology. Age of the user is also a motivational factor in perceived relevance
(Gonzales, 2015) with the older generation showing less interest in computers due to the
speed of the changing digital landscape and their perceived inability to keep up with the
changes (Gonzales, 2015).
Factors which may influence access are geographic constraints, socio-economic
conditions, physical disability, English language proficiency and cultural differences
(Harlan, 2014; Overall, 2010). Poor infrastructure in rural areas of the United States
presents students with a disadvantage over their urban counterparts (Harlan, 2014). Even
when online access is available, it is often by a slower, Ethernet-wired connection,
increasing the time it takes to download information, adding to the students’ frustrations,
possibly even causing them to give up altogether (Harlan, 2014). Some students must
travel to community-based centers, such as schools, public libraries and youth centers to
obtain online computer service (Harlan, 2014). Some of these considerations affect
students’ ability to successfully conduct online research (Brown, Hard, Hughes, Keppel
& Smith, 2013). A study of first year college students in a rural area of Australia found
that the first year distance (online) students did not engage with or seek the assistance of
support services, such as the librarians, when attempting to complete assignments at
home. This led to what the researchers called the lone wolf approach, often concluding
with poor results, even to the degree of becoming at risk of failure in school (Brown et al,
2013). This is especially true for the non-traditional student (Ascenuik, 2012; Bolliger &
Halupa, 2012; Peou & Lwin, 2011; Smith, 2011). In the United States, access to

32

authoritative resources for serious academic study is often confined to colleges and
universities, making it a resource for those who can afford to attend an institution of
higher learning (Ally & Samaka, 2013).
Public libraries do maintain subscriptions to electronic databases, which may be
useful, but their focus is not on serious academic research. In addition, public libraries
filter access to information due to federal laws to protect children, restricting full and
complete access (Dolan, 2016; Harlan, 2014). Although access to the Internet at home
has increased, homes in the lower socio-economic groups report much lower numbers
(Dolan, 2016). Minorities are more highly reported in this group, with homes of African
Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanic Americans report home computer Internet
access to be at 49% (Dolan, 2016). Schools in the United States now report that they all
(100%) have student online access, yet, there still exists a divide (Dolan, 2016).
Schools in rural and lower socio-economic districts report that the ratio of onlineaccess computers to students is greater (4:1) than in urban and higher socio-economic
districts (3.8:1) (Dolan, 2016). Although all schools and most libraries may have student
computers, there still are constraints due to the age of computers and the ratio of
computers to students (Black, et al, 2011; Dolan, 2016). Some schools reported having
desktop computers more than ten years old (Dolan, 2016). In the instance of public
libraries, filters, firewalls and wait times affect the ability of students to conduct
academic research. Filters and firewalls restrict free Internet surfing. Socio-economic
status also affects how students use technology (Dolan, 2016).
Cultural bias is another area that can foment a divide or disconnect. Along with
the field of education, the majority of library school students in the United States are

33

white and female, while the country is becoming more and more culturally and ethnically
diverse (Kumasi & Hill, 2011). It is not only politically correct to be sensitive to the
differences of students from other countries, but for librarians, it is necessary to
understand the differences and needs of those from other countries in order to provide the
best service to that population (Overall, 2010). For generations, the American and
European educational systems were considered the norm, necessitating those from other
cultures to adapt or struggle (Kumasi & Hill, 2011). English is the most widely used
language on the Internet, as it is in finance and other global business concerns
(Ananiadou, McNaught & Thompson, 2012). English, the co-official language in 53
countries is the third most widely spoken language in the world (Ananiadou, et al, 2012)
only following Mandarin and Spanish and is considered the lingua franca of the world.
The growth of English as a dominant world language developed from the British
imperialism of the 17th and 18th centuries as well as the dominance of the United States
after World War Two (Ananiadou, et al, 2012). It can be suggested that this sense of
power and authority may be associated with the dominance of Europe, reaching back
even further in European history, setting the stage for the ascension of the white man and
his culture as preeminent.
Cultural and language bias is not only an issue in the United States, where there is
great diversity and influx of immigrants; it exists in countries where minorities mix with
the general population (Nijenhuis, Willigers, Dragt & Flier, 2016). Certain minorities,
those of African, Caribbean and non-Western societies tend to score lower on
standardized tests, than Whites, Northeast-Asians and Jews (Nijenhuis, et al., 2016). In
the Netherlands, language bias produced a negative effect on test scores of ethnic

34

minorities from Morocco, Turkey, Suriname and the Netherland Antilles (Nijenhuis et
al., 2016). In higher education, students learn in the predominant language of the country
in which they attend class (Nijenhuis, et al., 2016). Demonstrated proof of language bias
exists in the intelligence tests of many countries, including the Netherlands, skewing tests
results and promoting the idea that the minority populations are somehow inferior or less
intelligent (Nijenhuis, et al., 2016). This is all the more evident in test scores of nonWestern students (Nijenhuis, et al., 2016). Their studies showed a discrepancy in the
degree in which language bias has been a contributing factor in measuring intelligence of
minority students (Nijenhuis, et al., 2016). To offset language bias in higher education, in
the United States, most classes are taught in English; however, there is a growing cadre
of colleges, most particularly career colleges, that is teaching in languages other than
English, where a large proportion of a minority group speaks a common language, such
as Spanish (Nijenhuis, et al., 2016). There is yet no consensus as to the extent that
cultural bias plays in the educational success of students in the Netherlands; however,
studies have found that cultural bias is prevalent enough in testing to disaffirm the value
of the assessments (Nijenhuis, et al., 2016).
Access to digital information is by no means limited to students in the United
States, although international students may have the additional challenge of conducting
research in other than their native language. The pervasive elitist attitude that the white
way is the right way has been well documented in studies of standardized testing (te
Nijenhuisa, Willigersa, Dragta & van der Flierb, 2015). The same attitude exists in
academic areas as well, as evidenced by American English being the language of choice
in the world of technology, computers and the Internet, where it is known as Standard

35

English (Yang, 2016). Even though much of the English-speaking world is based on the
King’s English, American English has superimposed itself as the language of technology,
and therefore, research (Yang, 2016). Standard English is the language of the Internet
(Ananiadou, et al, 2012). The use of American English vernacular is biased toward the
native English speaker in the design, structure and layout of traditional online research
databases, thus having a negative effect on the ability of non-native speakers to access
and use the information available (te Nijenhuisa, et al, 2015).
Students of immigrant parents often face challenges relating to cultural bias based
on their proficiency with the English language and acclimation with American culture,
and also the cultural beliefs regarding education that they and their families carry with
them from their home country (Janese, Free, Križ1 & Konecnik, 2014). Lack of
experience with the culture of the American educational system also hampers students’
ability to succeed (Janese et al, 2014). Students who are unfamiliar with navigating the
system, such as a library database, or a university website, are at a disadvantage. Couple
this with language and communication issues, low self-esteem, and lack of financial
resources, and the ease of access and use of library databases is confounded (Janese, et
al., 2014). Children who are raised in homes with immigrant parents should possibly be
viewed in the context of children of immigrants as their upbringing, values and culture
would be that of their parents (Schwartz, Waterman, Umaña-Taylor, Lee, Kim, Vazsonyi,
Huynh, Whitbourne, Park, Hudson, Zamboanga, Bersamin, Williams, 2013).
Non-traditional students enrolling in higher educational institutions in the United
States has risen by 47% in the past ten years (Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci, 2016). Many of
these students are Hispanic or of Hispanic heritage (Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci, 2016).

36

Non-traditional students are faced with challenges and hurdles not experienced by the
traditional 18-26 year old full time student, grounded on the definition of the nontraditional student, many of whom are working full time outside of the home, being older
than 26 when attempting a college education, family and financial pressures and possibly
language obstacles (Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci, 2016). In addition, the students may
operate under customs and cultures of their native country and be unfamiliar with the
policies and procedures of the higher education system of America. Colleges and
universities must be sensitive to the needs of this population and prepare support systems
and programs to assist the non-traditional student toward a successful college experience.
Hispanic students develop social relationships with their peers based on culture that affect
their learning outcomes (Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci, 2016). Offering support, advisors
and peer counselors who understand the culture help Hispanic students adjust. (ArbeloMarrero & Milacci, 2016). Family is very important to the Hispanic culture and support,
or lack of support from family members greatly influences Hispanic students’ success in
their educational endeavors (Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci, 2016).
Non-traditional college students who are also parents want better lives for their
children (Peterson, 2016). To be successful students, they strive to succeed in their
educational endeavors, not only as role models for their children, but for themselves
(Peterson, 2016). Many factors are responsible for the success or failure of the studentparent, including engagement, motivation and relevancy (Peterson, 2016). Successful
student-parents are highly motivated and make the effort to be engaged in the
schoolwork, often being resilient and creative in finding times to study (Peterson, 2016).
Some indicators of engagement are meeting with faculty, working with classmates in

37

teams, and being diligent with their coursework (Peterson, 2106). Another strong factor
in the success of student-parents is maturity. Being older than the traditional student
provided student-parents a level of life experience, which gave them insights, and selfknowledge to be competent (Peterson, 2016). These students are better able to prioritize
and handle the added stress that pursuing a college education adds to an already full plate
of family and personal obligations (Peterson, 2016). Although student-parents have the
added demands of daily child-rearing, finding childcare and the welfare of children to
contend with, student-parents understood the long-term benefits afforded to individuals
who obtain higher education and persisted (Peterson, 2016). Although many of the
student-parents had strong family support, in her study, Peterson (2016) found some
student-parents dealt with negative attitudes from their families as to their abilities to be
successful college students and their misperceptions about family obligations.
To assist student-parents in their desire to be successful college students,
instructors have an obligation to be very clear with class assignments, due dates and
opportunities to ask for assistance (Peterson, 2016). Instructors can bring in relevant
examples and life experiences that this specific group of students will find germane
(Peterson, 2016). To help themselves, students can communicate their issues with the
faculty, asking for clarification, assistance or extra resources (Peterson, 2016).
Hispanic students are not alone in having dreams and goals for a better life for
their families; however, the non-traditional student is more likely to consider improving
their life condition for the sake of their children, rather than for personal ambition
(Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci, 2016). They also want to be an excellent role model for their

38

children by showing they can surmount life’s challenges (Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci,
2016). This is a major factor in the Hispanic students’ desire to succeed in school.
Learning a new language is not usually easy for adults, but the added burden of studying
and taking exams in a second language poses additional challenges for Hispanic students
(Arbelo-Marrero & Milacci, 2016).
The United States used to be referred to as a melting pot of cultures, where each
culture brought its unique flavors to a big pot, mixed them together and assimilated to
become a stew of blended ingredients, an American stew. Today, this is no longer the
case (Booth, 1998). America should rather be viewed as a salad; each component
retaining its identity, structure and flavor, yet joining together to create something that
does not lose the essence of each of its components; each ingredient is diverse. Diversity
is the word that is heard throughout the country, not assimilation. Teachers are instructed
to respect and be sensitive to the diversity in the classroom; to be aware of the cultural,
societal, language, intelligence and other differences of each student (Linares, 2016).
Students and instructors all must see themselves as “others” and also inclusively as “us,”
so that each is viewed as unique and without prejudice, yet belonging to the group
(Linares, 2016). Viewing oneself as an other removes stereotyping because everyone that
one meets is both an other and “us” at the same time (Linares, 2016). Barriers fall away
when elitism dissolves (Linares, 2016). Students who had previously been marginalized
and labeled as lazy, arrogant or difficult are seen in the context of their culture, not
removed from it and flourish in an environment of “us” (Linares, 2016). Cultural
awareness brings with it a dissolution of barriers to education (Linares, 2016). Allowing

39

each student to be “living in their culture” celebrating their “other-ness” promotes the
learning of the English language for foreign-born students (Linares, 2016).
The Internet is one of the wonders of the Age of Information, and a chief
manifestation of information and communication technology (ICT) (Sarkar, 2012). ICT is
a collection of technology (hardware and assets) developed to “generate, distribute,
collect and administer information” (Sarkar, 2012). Regarding higher education, ICT has
made it not only possible, but also efficient to provide education and information all
around the globe. There is great international support for ICT as a tool to increase
education for those diverse populations who may have found it difficult or impossible to
participate in ground coursework in the past due to many variables (Sarkar, 2012). The
proliferation of ICT became a goal of the United Nations’ World Summit on the
Information Society (WSIS) in 2003 (Information Society, 2015) with the objective to
increase ICT to break down barriers, increase educational levels in society, reduce
poverty, and provide health related services to secluded and remote parts of the world
(Sarkar, 2012).
The demand for higher education is growing in the United States and around the
world (Sarkar, 2015) and the use of communication technology; especially the Internet is
seen as a tool to bridge the gap of the digital divide. In higher education, ICT serves the
previously underserved populations with geographical challenges, such as those in rural
areas and remote parts of the world. ICT is blind to race, creed or color, minority
populations or the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Women, who are forbidden to
obtain an education due to cultural mores and impediments, can study online (Sarkar,
2015). The disabled can study from the comfort of their homes.

40

An educational system faces challenges with ICT due to cost and sustainability
(Sarkar, 2015). The costs of initially purchasing and installing the equipment can be
exorbitant. Educators must be trained to properly use the resources and equipment in
ways to enhance education, while students face a learning curve when they first
encounter the technology or its updated features and must be trained. There is also the
cost of maintaining the equipment and infrastructure. Financial resources must be
designated and ongoing to purchase and maintain the equipment and software. It is
critical to plan appropriately to be sure the curricular is relevant and appropriate for the
students at their level of technological understanding and readiness (Sarkar, 2015).
A thought-provoking concept regarding the use of information and
communication technologies (ICT) and the Internet is that of flexibility (Cruz-Jesus,
Vicente, Bacao &Oliveira, 2016). People with more education are apt to adjust and be
flexible to complex technological challenges and adapt accordingly (Cruz-Jesus et al,
2016). Thus, those with greater education are able to cope with issues and life challenges,
navigate systems more easily and move up the socioeconomic ladder more effectively
(Cruz-Jesus, et al, 2016).
A robust definition for digital divide evolved, which included not only owning a
personal computer, but attainment of high speed Internet connections to be used for
distance education, social media, banking, personal health education and finding
employment (Cruz-Jesus, et al., 2016). Level of education was determined to be the most
influential factor in ICT (Cruz-Jesus, et al., 2016). Their study, which measured the
digital divide between countries as well as within each of the twenty-eight European
Union countries, found disparities within each country due to the varying degrees of

41

education of their respective populations (Cruz-Jesus, et al. 2016). In a study of the
twenty-eight countries in the European Union, it was found that factors influencing the
digital divide as it related to computer technology and the Internet were heavily
influenced by the educational level of the individual and that those countries which had a
larger percentage of educated populace also had higher use of computer technology
(Cruz-Jesus, et al, 2016) and greater flexibility in thwarting obstacles in their lives. The
country with the highest concentration of Internet use, regardless of educational level,
was Finland; Denmark and Sweden have the lowest digital divide gap between highest
and lowest of education of their populations (Cruz-Jesus, et al., 2016). The countries
showing the largest disparity in education and also the largest digital gaps were Malta,
Portugal and Spain. (Cruz-Jesus, et al., 2016) providing insight into the educational needs
of these populations. The United Nations sponsored a World Summit on the Information
Society in 2003 and 2005, where they declared a global challenge “where everyone can
create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals,
communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable
development and improving their quality of life” (WSIS, 2005, in Cruz-Jesus et al, 2016).
Their study was an attempt to measure the digital divide within the countries of the EU,
as well and among them.
The digital divide, whether economic, geographic, cultural or other, fosters the
unfortunate situation of students who fall into the classification of the non-traditional.

Library Anxiety
The term library anxiety was coined by Constance Mellon (Mellon, 1986,
Gremmels, 2015) in her study of undergraduate college students and library research. She
found that first year college students became apprehensive whenever they were instructed
to use the college library for a research assignment (Sinnasamy & Karim, 2014). There
were many reasons that students offered to explain their anxiety, such as lack of
knowledge of the topic and how to begin the research (Sinnasamy & Karim, 2014). To
quantify their anxiety, a scale was devised by Bostick (1992), which is now known as the
Library Anxiety Scale (LAS) (Sinnasamy & Karim, 2014). The scale is widely used and
is considered the standard scale to capture library anxiety. It consists of five areas of selfmeasurement: barriers to staff; comfort with the library; knowledge of the library;
affective barriers; and mechanical barriers (Sinnasamy & Karim, 2014).
Library anxiety and the stress experienced by students interfere with becoming
comfortable and familiar with the library and library staff, restricting student usage of
library resources and student success (Foote, 2016). This is especially the case with nontraditional male students who feel intimidated by library staff and falsely determine that
the staff is unapproachable, thus creating a barrier to communication and service (2016).
Students who are insecure about their ability to navigate through library resources,
developing issues of inadequacy can benefit from introductory workshops with library
staff either in the classroom or in the library (Foote, 2016). Although libraries are often
considered a place of refuge in the public eye, some students may feel threatened because
they are not familiar with the physical environment, which can be easily ameliorated by
providing non-threatening, informational guided tours to the library (Foote, 2016).

43

Foote (2016) found that including the instructors in the development of relevant
coursework which included using library resources provided the faculty with greater
insight into the holdings of the library as well as developing collegial relationships
(Foote, 2016). Instructors were unfamiliar with many of the resources in the library so
that working with the faculty in a non-adversarial environment helped faculty discover
valuable resources to use in their own classes (Foote, 2016). When instructors were able
to include the use of the library into their lessons, students used the library more (Foote,
2016).
Non-traditional students, students from lower socioeconomic communities and
non-native speakers of English appreciate activities that can engage and empower them,
building confidence and developing relationships with library staff, thus reducing anxiety
(Foote, 2016). Students use smartphones and computers for social media, but fall short
when it comes to the skills required for conducting academic research (Foote, 2016). It is
necessary for faculty and library staff to build on the digital skills the students possess by
adding practical, structured real-world activities, such as setting up adult email accounts,
opening LinkedIn accounts and developing career related portfolios and resumes (Foote,
2016).
Platt and Platt (2013) discuss the physiological makeup of library anxiety as
exhibited in undergraduate students. Their study looked at the symptoms of anxiety, such
as an increase in heart rate, change in respiration, and heightened blood pressure, as well
the emotions of apprehension and frustration, and even panic (Platt & Platt, 2013). Their
study involved the work of Kuhlthau (1991) and her methods to reduce library anxiety in
elementary and middle school students (Platt & Platt, 2013). Kuhlthau believed that

44

providing tools to help students organize their thoughts and tasks would reduce the
anxiety levels of the students and simultaneously develop critical thinking and
information literacy skill development in the students (Platt & Platt, 2013). Based on
Bostick’s Library Anxiety Scale, the Multidimensional Library Anxiety Scale (MLAS),
Platt measured a significant reduction in library anxiety for those students who
participated in organized library information instruction and research methods
instruction, with the greatest change in knowing where to find library resources (Platt &
Platt, 2013).
Based on the accepted understanding that English is the language of the Internet,
in 2011, the LAS was revised and modified for non-native speakers of English, and used
in studies at non-U.S. based universities, where students must use English to conduct
library research (Sinnasamy & Karim, 2014). The results of these studies indicated
students had concerns regarding library confidence, language discomfort, barriers to
resources, user education and psychological barriers to the use of the library (Sinnasamy
& Karim, 2014).
New students at both small and large institutions may have library anxiety. The
size of the library and its resources does not affect the level of anxiety a student possesses
(McPherson, 2015). The factors influencing library anxiety are related to prior experience
with library resources, lack of self-confidence, and a general sense of confusion or lack of
understanding of the assignment (McPherson, 2015). Students with library anxiety often
avoid the library, delaying the beginning or completion of an assignment, (McPherson,
2015). Delaying, or avoiding beginning an assignment are signs of library anxiety, further

45

examined by Head and Eisenberg in their multi-phase studies on student information
searching behavior (2013).
Another study using the Multidimensional Library Anxiety Scale (MLAS) was
conducted with graduate Education and Psychology students at a university in Iran
(Erfanmanesh, 2011). He noticed differences in results in students among the different
fields in Education and Psychology, with those students studying Special Education
having the highest level of library anxiety (Erfanmanesh, 2011). He also found, contrary
to other studies, that male students in his study exhibited higher levels of anxiety than
their female counterparts (Erfanmanesh, 2011).
Gremmels (2015) suggests that student perception of libraries and librarians has
changed greatly since Mellon’s library anxiety study. Due to the explosion of online
access to library resources, many students never step foot in the physical library. Students
do not have to come into a campus library to find printed material for their research. They
are often unaware that the databases they are using for their research are subscriptionbased through the university library. (Overall, 2013). She describes current students as
unaware and disinterested in the library, not knowing or caring there are librarians
available at the university library, and not using the professional librarians for research
assistance (Gremmels, 2015, p. 269). A dichotomy exists in that students still see the
campus library as the warehouse of books and knowledge, or a sanctuary for quiet study,
but not as the source of the myriad collection of electronic databases it now supports or as
a source of expert advice and assistance. Students have a disconnect between the physical
campus library, the online resources and the professional librarians. (Gremmels, 2015).

46

Studies suggest that some of the factors influencing library anxiety in students
may be related to demographics and culture (Blundell & Lambert, 2014). Gender and the
ethnicity of the student were the two major factors affecting anxiety levels in their study
of second semester freshmen (Blundell & Lambert, 2014). Females were more likely to
have higher levels of anxiety than males; they were unsure how to begin the research
process and felt less comfortable approaching a librarian (Blundell & Lambert, 2014).
Regarding race, Caucasians were less likely to approach a librarian or find value,
thinking that nobody was available to help; Hispanic-Americans were the most
comfortable searching on their own, without assistance; and African American students
felt the library and the librarians were helpful and useful in their quest for information
(Blundell & Lambert, 2014).
Administering a Chinese version of the Library Anxiety Scale (C-LAS), with
modifications based on language and cultural differences to students at a university in
China, researchers found that library anxiety existed (Song, et al, 2014). Further
investigation determined that library anxiety was due to students having little or no
information literacy instruction, making the students uncomfortable about coming to, or
using the campus library. The highest anxiety score (.71) was for anxiety in finding
resources. They did not know how to conduct an effective search (Song, et al, 2014).
Similar studies have been conducted in other countries (Kumaran &Chipanshi, 2015;
Mills, Knezek & Wakefield, 2013; Omidian, & Maleki, 2013; Tury, Robinson &
Bawden, 2015; Smith, 2011). There is no universal agreement as to which aspects of
library research provides the greatest anxiety to students (Sinnasamy & Karim, 2014;
Song, et al, 2014).

47

International students tend to approach librarians with high anxiety, preferring to
ask friends and fellow students, thinking that they were disturbing the librarians, or that
their questions were not important enough; they did not understand the role of the
reference librarian (Koenigstein, 2012). Using the data collected from studies of library
anxiety of students in universities in countries outside of the United States, it was found
that cultural differences could have an adverse effect on a student’s understanding of the
role of a librarian (Koenigstein, 2012).
One of the areas of information literacy covered by librarians revolves around the
issue of ownership of information. Students in the United States and Europe are taught
about citing the sources they use in their research and giving credit to the original author.
In China, there is a basic philosophical difference regarding intellectual property rights
and ownership of information which is consistent with the Communist philosophy;
students are taught that information cannot be owned by an individual and therefore need
not be cited. This is in obvious contrast to Western thought where all works are the
property of the author and must be cited. Many Chinese students fear and have anxiety
regarding plagiarism because it is such a foreign concept (Koenigstein, 2012). Cultural
differences vary by many factors, within the United States and internationally, as
evidenced by the above studies, so that defining a non-traditional student becomes quite
complex.
There is an increasing awareness of the effect that library anxiety has on the
ability of students to become successful in conducting research (Naveed, 2016). Library
anxiety is ubiquitous and widespread in every facet of academia (Naveed, 20160. In his
study of postgraduate students in Pakistan, Naveed (2016) found a majority of students

48

experienced varying levels of library anxiety, which he classified as low, mild, moderate
and severe. The first incident of students exhibiting anxiety was at the beginning of the
information searching process (Naveed, 2016). Over 87% of the students reported fear
and anxiety at the outset (2016), which is consistent with other studies by Kuhlthau in her
studies as far back as 1988 (Naveed, 2016). Over 77% of the participants felt anxiety
about where to find information and how to proceed, with anxiety about information
overload at 68% (2016). Although all postgraduate students, the participants reported
being unfamiliar with the resources of the library, how to search for scholarly texts and
using appropriate keywords (2016). Library and research anxiety interferes with a
student’s ability to think clearly and effectively (2016). Some students reported that the
resources on the library website were difficult to navigate or deficient in some way,
especially when links to full text articles were non-existent or costly, causing them
anxiety (2016).
The physical library also caused the participants anxiety, as they were unfamiliar
with physical layout of the library as well as library procedures, such as reserve reading,
interlibrary loan and borrowing materials (Naveed, 2016). Over 26% of the participants
reported feeling incompetent and inferior in some manner as it related to the information
search process (Naveed, 2016). To aid in the development of information literacy
curricula, it is important to factor in areas that cause students anxiety in the library
(Naveed, 2016). Although all the participants were fluent in English, 14% reported
feeling inadequate in English and angry they had to read scholarly works in English,
rather than their native tongue (Naveed, 2016).

49

When asked about seeing assistance from others, most participants reported
seeking out friends and other classmates for help, rather than faculty or library staff
(Naveed, 2016). Some expressed lack of access to faculty, due to scheduling issues,
however, others were intimidated by their faculty and told they were do conduct the
research themselves to develop research skills (Naveed, 2106). The interactions between
the participants and library staff was lacking (Naveed, 2016), neither requesting
assistance nor visiting the physical library because they believed the library staff would
not be responsive to their needs (Naveed, 2016).
Library anxiety is one component in a subset of research anxiety (Merc, 2016). A
study conducted in Turkey of 81 English language graduate students studying to be
teachers of English found high levels of research anxiety, despite the fact that the
participants were accomplished graduate students with high levels of competency in the
English language (Merc, 2016). It was determined that the more the students delved into
their subject, the more likely they were to exhibit anxiety, so that those students working
toward a Master’s degree exhibited higher levels of anxiety than the PhD students (Merc,
2016). The study found that the greatest anxiety causing element was the fear of
conducting research, with a 3.02, and the fear of libraries at 2.88, on a scale of 2.05
through 3.02 (Merc, 2016). Gender has no significant bearing on the scores at it related to
overall research anxiety (Merc, 2016).
Although much research on library anxiety has been conducted with
undergraduate college students, evidence suggests that the anxiety previously developed
and studied may persist and still be present in graduate students (Katapol, 2012). In her
study of African-American graduate students, Katapol enlarges the definition of library

50

anxiety to include information anxiety, electronic (computers) anxiety and human
(librarians, fellow students and faculty) anxiety (Katapol, 2012). She studied female
Black graduate students who were all in the final stages of completing dissertations in
Education (Katapol, 2012). Her study revealed four areas of concern to the graduate
students: tasks, the information search, use of electronic media, and race (Katapol, 2012).
Tasks refers to specific items or deliverables that were required of them, such as creating
bibliographies, taking exams and finding information (Katapol, 2012). The issue that
often concerned the students related to time constraints to accomplish the tasks. The
second area of concern to the students was the information search. They became
concerned, anxious and fearful about whether they were spending enough time, and
gathering enough or correct material (Katapol, 2012). Wariness of electronic media was
the third area illuminated by the research (Katapol, 2012). This included using electronic
library resources remotely, instead of coming into the library, Google and other search
engines. Students reported not contacting librarians for assistance, yet also not finding
what they wanted through the sources that they were using (Katapol, 2012). The fourth
area of concern related to their belief that white students were given preferential
treatment by the librarians, even though they did not ask the librarians for assistance
(Katapol, 2012). They also believed that the information they provided to their professors
would be deemed insufficient, based on their race (Katapol, 2012).

51

Information Seeking Behavior
Students are in need of scholarly information. Electronic databases now provide
access to an almost limitless body of literature previously only partially available within
the walls of a university library. Whether in print, or available through electronic sources,
students have developed behaviors to seek out and find the resources they need for
assignments. Studies of information seeking behavior proliferate the library information
studies field (Asher & Duke, 2011, 2013). Students are familiar with search engines such
as Google and Yahoo and expect the library resources to work in the same manner (Asher
& Duke, 2011, 2013). However, the subscription-based databases available through the
university library are complex and not constructed like a simple Google search engine
(Asher & Duke, 2011, 2013). The tactics to find information are different because the
databases are organized by keywords, subjects and Boolean operating strategies (Asher &
Duke, 2011, 2013). Skills locating accurate, timely and appropriate information are
developed by using information seeking behaviors developed by experience and acquired
by instruction. The Ethnographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries (ERIAL)
Project at Illinois State University studied the information seeking behaviors of college
students at five universities and found that the students had difficulty finding and
accessing relevant academic journal articles because they expected the scholarly
databases to function similar to familiar search engines, such as Google (2011, 2013).
Studies from universities around the world on information-seeking behaviors of
international students are consistent with findings in the United States, suggesting that the
behaviors are universal and have no bearing on language, culture, or society within the
country of the university (Garoufallou, Balatsoukas, Siatri, Zafeiriou, Asderi, and

52

Ekizoglou, 2008). Garoufallou, et al, (2008) conducted a study in Greece to gather
opinions from academic librarians’ on the use of Google, and especially Google Scholar,
as a viable research tool. The librarians in Greece were satisfied with the ease of use and
the reliability of the information they found on Google Scholar (Garoufallou, et al, 2008).
Student use of other digital resources was not included in the study. The study did not
obtain satisfaction results from the students using Google Scholar as a resource, therefore
the study was lacking in definitive data regarding use of electronic resources. Another
study conducted in Greece by Korobili, Malliari, and Christodoulou (2009) gathered
information about the type of information-gathering tools students used in the
information technology department of a university in Greece. This study was conducted
to determine if students in the field of information technology possessed the skills needed
for proper research.
Siddiqui (2011) conducted a study of information searching behavior of medical
and technology students at a university in India. Concentrating on obtaining information
as to why students seek information, Siddiqui found that the students’ first priority is to
find information to assist them with exams, and then with their own curiosity (Siddiqui,
2011). Use of journals were ranked third, after textbooks, and reference books, as a tool
for finding relevant information (2011). Only 29% of the students reported requesting or
obtaining assistance from library staff (2011). Siddiqui’s study confirms that students,
without regard to geographic location of the university, are consistent in their use of
library staff and library resources when confronted with the need to obtain scholarly
information (Siddiqui, 2011).

53

In Turkey, Sahin, Balta, and Ercan (2010) gathered data from students in the
hospitality field to determine their information seeking behaviors and assess the level of
competency of the students to find needed materials. They found that as the intensity of
the coursework increased, the students became more serious about the quality of their
research. A majority (73%) of students, although inexperienced with Internet resources,
found reliable information for research papers online. This finding corroborates the
findings of Shen (2007) as stated above, who found that serious academics tend to
become familiar with the needed resources for their studies and how the database or
collections operate. The participants in the study were taken from only one department at
the university, the hospitality field, which may be perceived as a narrow field and does
not represent the social sciences or the humanities. As a very narrow field, the students
would tend to become more familiar with the body of knowledge in their area. It is not
known if these students are capable of high quality research outside of their specific field.
A cross section of students working from a variety of programs may have provided data
that are more robust.
Tirado and Penagos (2011) have published results of an exhaustive study on
information literacy skill development in Colombia. Their findings were based on data
gathered from many participants, students, instructors, librarians, and the public. Tirado
and Penagos found that all Internet users, those with and without training, searching for
information, struggled with their searches (2011). The participants in this study were not
isolated to college students. Previously published data from the OCLC study of the
Perception of Libraries (Gauder, 2010) suggested that the public is not well acquainted
with the electronic resources available in their local public libraries and have not enlisted

54

in training or substantial guidance to equip them to use the resources effectively. As such,
their conclusions are too broad to be of substantial value to the field. The data suggest
that much more training is needed for users to become proficient in using technology in
Colombia.
Continuing with studies of students outside of the United States, Duncan and
Holtslander (2012) conducted an exploration of the information seeking behavior of
senior nursing students at a university in Canada. They conducted their exploration based
on a belief that nursing students did not have the confidence required in their skills as
information seekers and finders to prepare them as nursing professionals (Duncan &
Holtslander, 2012). Using a resource template provided to the participants with prompts,
students were asked to search for and find reliable full text journal articles relevant to
their study. Interviews were conducted to detail once participants concluded making
entries in the templates. Interview questions were designed to elicit information regarding
the search process, such as how students chose specific resources, issues with barriers
and frustrations and if they asked for assistance from librarians. Although all participants
succeeded in finding the information they sought, the most frequent comments were
regarding frustration in many areas in the process, such as choosing a topic, selecting
databases, selecting keywords, navigating through resources and finding the full text of
journal articles (2012). Conclusions from this study suggested reinforcing searching
strategies and continued practice with relevant library databases (2012).
Library usage stymies well-intentioned librarians as they search for reasons and
solutions to lack of usage by college students (Komissarov & Murray, 2016). Because
convenience is uppermost in the minds of college students, most research projects begin

55

with web searches on the Internet, rather than the more time consuming tedious searches
through scholarly databases (Komissarov & Murray, 2016). Students are aware of the
value of peer-reviewed journals, and use them to some extent, but not as a starting point
for their assignments (Komissarov & Murray, 2016). Deviating from results found in
other studies (Beisler & Medaille, 2016; Leeder & Shah, 2016; Rieh, et al., 2016) of the
information searching behavior of college students, Komissarov and Murray (2016)
found that 42% of students at the University of Wisconsin began their information search
process with the library website or databases, with Google coming in a close second at
39%. The high preponderance of use of Google.com aligns with studies discussed herein.
They found that although many students begin with Google, they eventually move onto
the more scholarly resources available through library (Komissarov & Murray, 2016).
Although students reported their most popular point of contact was Google, they
also claimed that scholarly journals were very important (Komissarov & Murray, 2016).
Two thirds of the students reported using scholarly resources most often; second most
frequently used resource was Wikipedia and other websites, followed by books
(Komissarov & Murray, 2016). The factors determining specific database usage by the
participants in Komissarov & Murray’s study are inconsistent with the body of
knowledge on information search behavior, leading this researcher to have doubts about
the efficacy of their study. In fact, the researchers themselves indicate evidence of
response-bias to various questions about which tools the students value.
In response to questions about the value of various resources for serious academic
work, the students value relevancy above all else as a determining factor of usage
(Komissarov & Murray, 2016). The second–most important factor was whether the

56

material was available in full text (2016). Of least importance to students was whether the
items were available in the physical library (2016). An adjacent study with the same
students regarding their parents’ level of education found that over 50% of the students in
the study had at least one parent with a four-year college education (Komissarov &
Murray, 2016). The study also noted that instructors were instrumental in increasing
usage of legitimate databases when they provided lists of approved sites and databases to
the students, and that library instruction in the classroom also led to increased use of
subscription based scholarly resources (Komissarov & Murray, 2016).
Whether viewed as “learning to search” or “searching to learn,” college students
must conduct information searches to identify material for research papers (Rieh, CollinsThompson, Hansen & Lee, 2016). Students are charged with developing the skills and
capturing the tools to appropriately and adequately find, evaluate and use information
(Rieh, et al., 2016). Students are no exception to the general populace when it comes to
searching for information and they begin their searches by using the common search
engines such as Google, Yahoo or Internet Explorer (Rieh, et al., 2016). Students’ use of
keywords or search terms is dependent upon the level of knowledge about a topic and
their communication skills, although they often begin with simple terminology (Rieh, et
al., 2016).
Recently, the perspective of the information search process it not necessarily to
find the relevant information, but rather to develop the strategies of exploration, learning
how to navigate and understand the searching process (Rieh, et al., 2016). It had been
noted that students who conduct exploratory searching spend more time gathering,
reading, judging, and evaluating information, rather than stopping at the most likely piece

57

of information relevant to their topic (Rieh, et al., 2016). This aligns well with both
Bloom’s Taxonomy and the ACRL Information Literacy Standards of Competence (Rieh,
et al., 2016).
Given the emphasis on ICT and computer technology in today’s academic
environment, the ability to develop the skills to gather, evaluate and use appropriate
information is paramount. Information literacy instruction provides the foundation for all
methods of lifelong learning a necessary tool that is critical in today’s interconnected
world (Rieh, et al., 2016). Rieh, et al., (2016) confirm that students with such skills tend
to have positive attitudes when it comes to conducting academic research. There is
however, a disconnect in students’ perception between web-based search engines and
scholarly databases, believing that similarities exist where there are none (Rieh, et al.,
2016). Students often start the research process with Wikipedia or a generic search
engine, rather than directly to library subscribed scholarly databases, although librarians
have instructed students to be wary of websites, and to critically evaluate them for
authorize and accuracy (Rieh, et al., 2016). Students who begin researching a topic with a
typical search engine interface have indicated that it is easier and faster for them, even
though the information is of lesser quality, leading researchers to ponder redesigning
scholarly subscription databases to support sense-making queries (Rieh, et al., 2016).
Because many students begin their research using generic web search engines,
such as Google, it is vital that students learn to evaluate the information they find (Leeder
& Shah, 2016). Students are not overly interested in the quality of the material they find,
but rather the speed in which they find it, and move on (Leeder & Shah, 2016).
Evaluating information, whether on the web, or any other media, is a critical skill that

58

students find tedious and not especially accurate (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Students tend to
judge websites based on irrelevant characteristics, such as the speed a page loads, the
number of charts and graphs, and the design of the page (Leeder & Shah, 2016)
obviously not elements which critically evaluates authority, accuracy or validity of the
information presented.
Several theories exist as to why students are not grasping the skills required for
quality information searching. The Principle of Least Effort proposes that students obtain
whatever is more easily available, even if of lesser quality, accepting the first result as
adequate because it is easy and fast (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Satisficing is a theory that
suggests that students stop at the first satisfactory result, using a minimum amount of
effort, quality not being an issue (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Competency Theory holds that
students are unaware of their lack of information literacy skills, so do not know they
should seek out assistance in attaining the competencies (Leeder & Shah, 2016).
Competency Theory is more prevalent among lower functioning students who often
believe they already possess adequate skills (Leeder & Shah, 2016).
Leeder and Shah (2016) posit that information literacy instruction based in the
classroom, with librarians embedded in classes, using relevant to student assignments that
require online research will have a positive effect on the development of competency
skills needed for student success. Students will have improved search experiences with
better outcomes (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Integrating librarians and information literacy
instruction into the classroom provides librarians with more frequent access to students,
increasing the face time with students (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Students become more

59

familiar and comfortable with the librarians, developing positive relationships, and will
seek them out earlier in their assignment process (Leeder & Shah, 2016).
Real and perceived deterrents contribute to the reluctance of students seeking
information searching assistance (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). The 21st century has offered
modern society many short cuts, conveniences and easily accessible solutions, so that
when it comes to the perceived tedious labor of searching library databases, students
resist (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). Library websites are not easy to navigate, even for
those who are motivated and engaged, and professional library assistance may not be
available when students are actually conducting their research, such as in the early hours
of the morning (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). Students tend not to seek out assistance from
librarians or other faculty members when it comes to conducting research, despite
invitations to do so (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). Students do not expect that the librarians
are experts in specific areas, and tend to fall back on their childhood memories of
librarians at the public or elementary school library (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). When
they do ask for assistance, it is most often from other students or from informal sources,
choosing speed over quality. (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). Students prefer quick answers
to their questions, instead of either learning how to conduct searches themselves, or being
provided with a robust list of resources to search (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). Those
students who tend to seek out assistance usually are mid-range students, those who have a
moderate amount of motivation and experience, as those with greater need often are less
motivated, and the ones with greater experience and skills have less need to request
professional assistance (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). The types of information seeking
assistance that students do request fall in to the areas of where to locate databases, how to

60

navigate research databases, and how to develop keyword searches (Beisler & Medaille,
2016).
Information searching behavior includes the way in which students find and use
the tools they need for their assignments (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). In their study,
Beisler and Medaille (2016) found that 14% of the students in their study conducting and
information search for a research paper became distressed to the point of panic, with 36%
of the participants seeking help. Of the group who requested help 59% contacted friends
and family members, 23% contacted their instructors, with only one participant in 80
seeking out a librarian for information searching assistance (Beisler & Medaille, 2016).
Some of the students participating mentioned having participated in an instruction session
in class conducted by a librarian, which they felt was helpful (Beisler & Medaille, 2016).
Students admitted that poor study habits and procrastination were contributing factors in
waiting to seek help (Beisler & Medaille, 2016).
As to the point in time in the process in which students asked for assistance with
research papers, only 14% of the participants reached out to others before starting their
research and 30% after they had begun their research (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). Many
students found the initial stage of research difficult, such as in developing a topic or how
to get started, yet did not seek out assistance until they began to panic (Beisler &
Medaille, 2016). Many of the participants struggled with selecting, or finding information
to develop a topic, yet chose to wait until panic or exhaustion took over (Beisler &
Medaille, 2016).
Consistent with prior studies of students and faculty in the United States, (Head &
Eisenberg, 2009; Gauder, 2011; Ge, 2010) it was found that the students reached out to

61

familiar resources, finding the information required by their professors. They were given
the resources to use. Would these IT students have been able search for and find other
relevant information? Data was not collected to determine the skill level of the IT
students in searching for information without the assistance of their faculty, therefore this
study might be viewed as flawed, as it neither assessed the prior skills of the participants,
nor provide relevant data on the use of university librarians for assistance.
Head & Eisenberg’s Project Information Literacy Typology of Contexts
Growing out of a small study at St. Mary’s College in 2006, the University of
Washington’s iSchool, established the Information Literacy Project to study the
information-seeking skills of college students (2010), with Drs. Head and Eisenberg at
the helm. Head and Eisenberg (2010) continued their data gathering, broadening the
sample in size, but not in scope. They presented a series of studies of information-seeking
behavior of over 8,000 undergraduate college students, gathering data on how these
students search for, evaluate, and use the research they found on the Internet. Their
findings suggested that the students, similar to the faculty in Shen’s earlier study, used
resources that are familiar and easy to access, not necessarily the more relevant, accurate
or appropriate resources. Again, data specifically on non-traditional students had not been
gathered, leaving a large and ever-growing segment of the higher education population
untapped. This author proposes that gathering information from non-traditional students
attending a higher education institution will add to the body of knowledge about college
students’ information seeking behaviors.

62

Head & Eisenberg (2009) identified four types of contexts based on their research
into the information seeking behaviors of college students at public and private colleges
and universities: (a) the Big Picture, (b) Language, (c) Situational, and (d) Informationgathering. Students must pass through each context in the same order, but, depending on
various factors, may spend different amounts of time in each. (2009). The Big Picture
relates to the initial stages of choosing a topic, from selecting it and defining its scope.
This stage often stymied students because they were unsure how to begin the process,
causing them to procrastinate (Head & Eisenberg, 2009). Procrastination led the students
to rushing through the remaining steps, often skimping on the research and writing, just
to get the paper turned in on time (Head & Eisenberg, 2009). Language involves the
specific terminology or vocabulary relevant to the subject at hand. Students in the study
who were unfamiliar with the terminology, often found this stage frustrating, until they
familiarized themselves with the subject verbiage of what they were reading. Situational
context refers to specific features of the research assignment, such as the rubric being
used, and meeting the expectations of the professor. Depending on the information
provided to the student, or the prior experiences of the student at the college, a student
may find this phase of the process familiar or challenging. For example, if the student had
had the same professor for a previous class, this student may feel more comfortable,
knowing the expectations of the professor (Head & Eisenberg, 2009). The final stage of
the typology is the Information Gathering context, where students are locating the
relevant research (Head & Eisenberg, 2009) based on the assignment and the previous
four stages. It is often at this stage where students begin to use the Internet and libraries,

63

both at the physical campus, and online to obtain the subject specific information needed
for their assignments (Head & Eisenberg, 2009).
Head and Eisenberg continued their research into information seeking behavior of
college students with a study using only freshmen (Head & Eisenberg, 2013). Their
findings indicated students expressed excitement in the first steps of independent
research, yet also felt overwhelmed and intimidated, with some students even saying they
were terrified (2013). As of 2013, Google searching methods had become so ubiquitous
that students assumed all research is designed with Google strategies in mind (2013).
Many of the students were not familiar with the college library databases, as they either
were different from the resources in their high schools or had limited experience using
them. Databases subscribed to by university libraries were not designed to use the same
search strategies as Google. Head and Eisenberg found that as the first semester came to a
conclusion, many students were relying on assistance from librarians and faculty to guide
them to new resources, assist with structuring the research and developing new research
skills (2013).
The Big Picture context is a student’s perception of the understanding of the topic
to be pursued, and how it relates to the curriculum that is being taught in the course. It
helps the student evaluate where and how to start the initial research into the topic
(Polanka, 2012 ).The latest study from Project Information Literacy was a federally
funded two-year study completed in January, 2016 to study the research competencies of
recent college graduates (Head, 2016).

64

Library Schools / Librarian Preparation
Properly trained and certified academic librarians can provide students with a
roadmap to the almost limitless superhighway of scholarly information. Navigating the
path is only one aspect of the critical thinking skills that are needed by students.
Librarians are trained to navigate, drive and expertly use the electronic resources and to
share these critical skills with college students. The American Library Association
provides accreditation certification of Library and Information Studies programs for
universities in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico offering masters’ degrees in
studies related to librarianship (ALA, 2016). The ALA maintains a complete database of
over sixty accredited programs (ALA, 2016). The majority of library school students in
the United States are white and female, while the country is becoming more and more
culturally and ethnically diverse (Kumasi & Hill, 2011). In a demographics report by
Manjarrez, Ray and Bisher (2010), it was found that, as in education, an overwhelming
number of active librarians in the United States are women over the age of 55, and that
“Academic librarians have the lowest median age at forty-five years and a less severe
gender difference with 74.3 percent being women” (Manjarrez et al, 2010, p. 9).
Regarding ethnicity, 79.2% of librarians nationwide are White, 8.3% are Black and 5.2%
are Hispanic (Manjarrez, et al, 2010). The study indicates an increase in diversity over
the past few years, based on an increased awareness and recruitment of diverse students,
and an increase in Federal funding programs (2010). Forecasting the impending reliance
on technology in libraries, library schools have added many more specializations in
database management, meta data analysis, technology infrastructure and other related

65

courses to the curricula to prepare students for careers in upcoming fields within
librarianship (2010).
While library schools are adjusting their programs to be more relevant to the
potential needs of the future, library students’ perceptions of their roles are evolving as
well (Mansourian, 2010). Studies have found that first semester graduate students in the
field of library and information science did not enter with a realistic perception of the
field. (2010). Many of the students based their perceptions on previous experience in
their own school or town’s public libraries, and were not prepared for the rigor involved
in the program (2010). However, as the semesters ensued, students’ motivation did not
diminish and they became more aligned with the programs and its offerings (2010).
Studies on the expectations and preparedness of incoming students in graduate
programs of library and information science as it relates to general knowledge,
computing skills, programming skills, software skills, internet skills and assessment and
remediation found that students who did not come to the programs with adequate skills
struggled through the rigorous curriculum (Kules & McDaniel, 2010). Data gathered by
Kules and McDaniel on 57 ALA accredited programs, suggested that many
inconsistencies exist throughout the ALA accredited programs in the United States
(2010). Some students entering library school programs are not aware of the intense
reliance on technology that has penetrated the library the world and do not come prepared
with the skills to be successful (2010).
Buarki, Hepworth and Murray (2011) studied the information and communication
technology (ICT) skills of library and information science students in Kuwait, addressing
the students’ skill levels and the expectations of employers. The program in Kuwait is an

66

undergraduate degree taught in a four-year program. It was originally designed to prepare
students to be librarians in the public school system, but has since expanded its mission to
include all areas where librarians are in demand (2011). The university now offers
bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate programs for approximately 700 students because of
the increased need for employees with specialized technology and communication skills
(2011). Along with the technology skills, students are taught the core librarianship
curriculum. Even though there has been greater emphasis on teaching the ICT skills in
demand, it has been found that the graduates needed further on-the-job training in ICT, so
that more technology courses have been added into the curriculum (2011).
The emphasis on attaining the competencies in ICT and other technologies
overshadows the more humanistic skills required to help non-traditional students bridge
the gap between their current level of ability and the skills needed to adequately use the
resources that are more and more often housed within the technology. In addition to the
soft skills required in many offices and educations environments, such as writing,
developing presentations, problem-solving, and critical thinking, library schools teach
their graduate students technical services, such as acquisitions, cataloging, archiving, and
records management. They also prepare future librarians to develop interesting
educational and recreational programs, reference assistance and customer services. One
very important and increasingly relevant area of expertise needed in all libraries is that of
information literacy instruction (ALA, 2016).
Information literacy instruction is a field of library science that has been growing
exponentially along with the growth of online resources (Bryan, 2016). Academic
librarians are being asked to conduct lessons in information literacy and library research

67

without having had coursework in teaching or pedagogy (Bryan, 2016). Bryan’s study
captured the feelings and experiences of academic librarians who have been asked to
teach information literacy (Bryan, 2016). Her findings suggest that first career librarians
(those who have not had a career in another field before entering librarianship) were not
well prepared for the role of teacher and must self-teach or take after school courses to
gather the skills needed for this additional component to their role (Bryan, 2016). In
addition, their job titles at the time of hire, did not suggest they would be asked to teach
(Bryan, 2016). The study also found that the Master of Library Science degree program
did not provide graduating librarians with skill development opportunities in
administration, assessments, curriculum knowledge, instructional design, advocacy and
promotion or subject expertise (Bryan, 2016). The skills were developed later while on
the job or on their own (Bryan, 2016). Bryan (2016) suggests the library school
curriculum needs revision in order to be more in tune with the needs of the profession.
The perception exists that library schools are not preparing their future librarians
for careers in the real world (Davies-Hoffman, Alvarez, Costello, & Emerson, 2013).
Studies have indicated that many of the programs do not include required courses in
information literacy instruction, although there is great emphasis on instruction of library
resources in academic libraries once librarians are hired (2013). Students who do take
some of the courses on information literacy instruction feel unprepared for work as an
information literacy librarian (2013). As a result, the Library Instruction Leadership
Academy (LILAC) a pilot program was begun to train employed librarians and educators
in information literacy instruction, developing the skills and techniques to assist them in
their jobs (2013). The LILAC program was very successful in helping existing librarians

68

succeed as information literacy instructors, with some of the participating universities
working toward partnering with LILAC to offer similar courses to library school students
prior to graduation (2013).
The overriding characteristics of library school students in America place them
squarely in what had traditionally been referred to as the majority (Irvin, 2016). As
representing the white majority, most are middle class, neither culturally nor ethnically
diverse (Irvin, 2016) yet are asked to work in libraries whose students are often
multicultural and non-traditional (Irvin, 2016). Diverse students, and those of the lower
socioeconomic class may feel uncomfortable approaching a mainstream librarian, who
has not experienced the challenges and struggles they have and the perception is that the
library is creating barriers to equity of access and further separating the classes (Irvin,
2016).
Not preparing the incoming librarians with sensitivity and cultural awareness is
doing a disservice to both the library field and the library patron (Irvin, 2016). Instructors
of library science have the obligation to engage their students in collaborative activities
which will enhance their understanding and acceptance of otherness in a culturally
diverse society (Irvin, 2016). Including a reflective perspective in the library school
experience promotes self-knowledge and self-awareness, empowering the library student
to become more culturally aware (Irvin, 2016). Exposing library students to multicultural
literature and materials, increasing cultural awareness and proactively preparing students
for multicultural communities, by placing them in mixed ethnicity internships will work
toward breaking down barriers to library usage (Irvin, 2016).

69

At recent library conferences, library school faculty have been discussing the gaps
that exist between the library school experience and the practical real-world library
experience, finding that library schools are not adequately preparing students for success
in their field of librarianship (Abbas, Garnar, Kennedy, Kenney, Luo, Stephens, 2016).
Barriers exist between the academic side of librarian studies and the practical (Abbas et
al., 2016). Traditional library school prepares student-librarians for specific libraryrelated services, such as reference work or cataloging, yet do not prepare them for the
real world experience of sitting at a reference desk in an ethnically mixed community, or
dealing with disgruntled and emotionally distressed patrons (Abbas, et al., 2016). In
addition, practicing librarians often do not conduct scholarly research that is published in
peer reviewed journals because they have not been prepared to do so in library school and
because they are too busy being librarians in the field (Abbas, et el., 2016). Abbas, et al.,
(2016) assert that if more library school students were taught how to conduct scholarly
research, more librarians would publish scholarly works. Only 61% of library schools
include a research methods course in their curriculum, yet librarians are asked to teach
research methods to college students (Abbas, et al., 2016) putting the librarians at a
professional disadvantage.
The library field is in need of new leadership as its current leadership matures and
retires (Kimmel, Howard & Ruzzi, 2016). Library school must prepare librarians to
become great librarians and leaders among their fellow librarians (Kimmel, et al, 2016).
To accomplish this goal, library schools must create transformational programs to
develop the leaders of tomorrow (Kimmel, et al., 2016). Not only must they develop
transformational leaders, the library leader of the future must exhibit the characteristics of

70

a leader of change, people who take risks, and are proficient at fostering comradery and
community relationships (Kimmel, et al., 2016). Library students must have opportunities
to be exposed and immersed in a multitude of communities and varying types of library
experiences (Kimmel, et al., 2016). Following the examples of professionals embedded in
in other fields, librarians, too, will benefit from community service (Kimmel, et al.,
2016). Kimmel, et al., (2016) conducted a study of library school students placed in
community service projects. The study found that the experiences of the library school
students aided in their development as leaders in the field by enhancing leadership skills
and improving the individual dispositions of the students (Kimmel, et al., 2016). Students
had opportunities to be reflective and assess their personal and professional growth
(2016).
Information Literacy Instruction
Much scholarly literature exists in librarianship detailing the lack of
preparedness, lack of skills and lack of competencies regarding college students’ ability
to succeed in academic scholarship, and the need for the integration of substantial, high
quality assessed programs of information literacy instruction (Latham & Gross, 2013;
Mansourian, 2008; Spiranec & Zorica, 2009; Schilling &Applegate, 2012). This section
will put information literacy instruction in historical and social perspective, as well as
provide a platform for discussion.
As early as 1989, the American Library Association developed standards,
competencies and learning outcomes for information literacy (O’Connor, 2009).
Librarians have always been assisting their patrons in finding needed information. They

71

have the reputation as caring, helpful individuals. It is the assertion of the ALA that
information literate people guarantee an informed, and therefore, democratic society
(Sharkey, 2013). The old adage, that knowledge is power, is just as relevant today, with
information literacy a conduit to personal empowerment (Sharkey, 2013). Standing on
the shoulders of scholars in the field, the author contends that the integration of
information literacy instruction in all libraries will move the people to a more pluralistic,
inclusive and egalitarian society (Sharkey, 2013).
With the advances in technology and the vast array of resources available on the
Internet and in scholarly databases, the role of the librarian as the keeper of the gate of
knowledge has changed significantly (ACRL, 2013). Librarians’ roles have been
changing as a result of advances in technology and digital resources (2013). Every
librarian is a teacher in some form, whether or not the job title reflects it (2013). Now that
so many of the resources available from libraries are digitized and accessed through
computers, it is imperative that users have the skills and competencies to access, evaluate
and use those resources (ALA, 2016). Students have the need to learn how to find,
evaluate and use resources and librarians are key in providing instruction in this area
(2013). This report recommends the integration of information fluency instruction for
librarians to attain the skills needed to disseminate information literacy to their patrons
and students by developing new curricula in library science programs and promote the
value of information literacy instruction by advocating for librarians and by collaborating
and partnering with academic leadership (2013).
Students are in need of more than just memorizing dates and figures. The Three
Rs are not sufficient in preparing students to be productive members of the community

72

(Staines, 2011). Staines asserts that a fourth R, research skills, the ability to find, evaluate
and use information, is key (2011). Many librarians provide only a short introduction to
the library resources, known as the one-shot, which is inadequate because there is much
more to learn than can be taught in one short hour (2011). Students need to develop
higher learning, and critical thinking skills to be competent in finding, evaluating and
using appropriate resources (2011). Information literacy instruction must be integrated
into the coursework, and mapped into the curriculum, so that students find relevance to
their newly developed skills and will use and retain them (2011).
It cannot be denied that students must learn and develop skills to aid them in their
academic endeavors. However, given that many college and university students in the
United States are non-traditional, information literacy must take into account the diverse,
multi-ethnic complexity of language and cultures that is the 21st century student (Hicks &
Lloyd, 2016). The American Library Association and the Association of College and
Research Libraries developed their standards of competence, the Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education in 1989, based on English language,
American-centered education (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016). The document is neither neutral
nor unbiased in its perspective of universal academic competencies (Hicks & Lloyd,
2016).
There is a pervasive and apparent lack of regard toward the unfamiliar. NonWestern education is deemed inferior to Western, which is problematic (Hicks & Lloyd,
2016). The standards were designed based on the behaviorist approach to learning, which
places the burden of learning specific behaviors (information literacy skills) on the
student regardless of the cultural framework of the student (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016). A

73

behaviorist approach would consider the skill development as behaviors that need to be
learned and measures the degree in which a concept is learned by a student (Hicks &
Lloyd, 2016). The behaviorist approach fails international students in that it considers the
students as possessing certain flaws and inadequacies basic to their character simply by
being other than the norm, i.e. a traditional American (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016).
The authors contend that a constructivist approach to teaching information
literacy is preferred over a behaviorist approach in settings that are multi-cultural (Hicks
& Lloyd, 2016) because the constructivist approach treats the students as individuals,
without prejudice to ethnicity or culture. Students have difficulty succeeding with the
behaviorist approach and are often viewed as failures (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016). A
collaborative, community-centered approach, rather than an isolationist perspective on
learning is preferred (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016). Students develop strategies that adapt to
their own particular needs, within the framework of their own culture, language and
educational experiences (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016). The United Kingdom’s system of
imparting information literacy, the Seven Pillars of Information Literacy, develops levels
of skills based on a constructivist approach of achieving thresholds, which has had a
more positive effect on the success of international and non-traditional students (Hicks &
Lloyd, 2016). Within an intercultural or multiethnic environment, students are better able
to develop approaches to finding and using resources for educational purposes. However,
the constructivist is limiting in that does not bring in the social and cultural framework of
the student (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016).
The constructivist premise that the individual student process determines his or
her own progress through levels of information literacy knowledge must include an

74

understanding of the social and cultural background of a student to attain optimum
success (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016). Allowing multiethnic students an opportunity to process
information through the perspectives of their own cultures, language, traditions and social
context empowers and inspires academic growth (Hicks & Lloyd, 2016). The authors
contend a more robust methodology to information literacy, one which appreciates
instruction through a constructivist lens and incorporates a sociocultural framework is
most useful in engaging non-traditional and multiethnic students to attain the knowledge
to master the extensive and ever-changing landscape of scholarly information (Hicks &
Lloyd, 2016).
Theoretical Framework
Postmodern ideology believes power struggles create change; resolutions to
problems are determined by the powerful exerting control over those less powerful
(Shank, 2006). It will be valuable to view the knowledge gained from the study from a
perspective that the educational system in the United States is ethnocentric, and is
designed to favor the majority: urban, white, middle- and upper-middle class, English
language educated males. When designing educational services with diverse populations
in mind, for mechanisms such as research databases, the equity of access is a major
concern (Overall, 2010). If people do not understand the language, concepts, or ideas
because the material is displayed or available in a way that is not universal, there is no
equity of access. Designers must consider many points when designing for diverse
students (Young, 2008). The framework of cultural relativism can be described as an
attempt to be as unbiased and objective as possible, when studying people from diverse

75

cultures (2008). The recent growth in the higher education industry can be attributed to a
multitude of factors, not the least of which is the rapid growth of technology. Over 1
billion people worldwide are accessing information on the Internet (2008). Young
believes that it is imperative to design educational resources, or the paths to them, within
a framework, she calls internationalization, which she describes as a process, which has
at its core, the elimination of cultural bias (2008).
Summary
Data isolating the online research gathering and using skill-sets of undergraduate
and graduate students at proprietary online and ground institutions have been difficult to
collect (Wang, 2006; Wallis, 2006; Shen, 2007, Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Head &
Eisenberg, 2009 and 2010). A study, using non-traditional students at a private university,
will elucidate the skills that are used or lacking by students at a proprietary university.
Including university librarians in the study to discuss their findings, training programs,
and their own readiness to assist culturally and socioeconomically diverse, students will
be enlightening.
The purpose of this qualitative study is to assess how non-traditional students
prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the context
typology of the Big Picture, based on the research context typology of Head and
Eisenberg (2009). This study will examine the behaviors of the students in a holistic
manner, when conducting research on the Internet for research assignments given to them
by their instructors. The study will endeavor to learn how, where, and why the students

76

search for, locate, and evaluate information to use in their research and to determine the
skills used to be digitally fluent.

77

Chapter 3: Research Method
Statement of the Problem
Students are often in need of research skills for academic research as well as lifelong learning (Staines, 2011). The specific problem is that older adults and returning
students defined as non-traditional students often do not possess the skills and resources
needed for the rigors of college-level academic research (Ascenuik, 2012). Isolated data
on information literacy skills of the non-traditional student have been difficult to obtain
(Ascenuik, 2012; Dawson, Charman & Kilpatrick 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2010;
Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis 2006; Wang 2006).
Academic information is available digitally, through a variety of platforms and
Internet sites, which channel students through specific venues to databases and scholarly
material. This channeling feeds students to and through proprietary products, thus
controlling and influencing how, as well as what, pre-college students learn (Chen, 2012).
A need exists for developing life-long research skills in students and faculty alike
(Staines, 2011). These skills involve the integration of online technology and resources
with proficiency in topic selection, searching and evaluating the existing research (EltonChalcraft, et al, 2008). Wheeler (2012) refers to the skills involved in using online
resources as digital learning skills. Students may face a multitude of issues with the onset
of their higher education careers, including a mismatch between their perceived and
actual information literacy competency (Latham & Gross, 2013). Exploration of students’
research behaviors exists (Ge, 2010; Gross & Latham, 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2009,

78

2010; Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis, 2006; Wang, 2006), however
studying the behaviors of the non-traditional student has not been isolated.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how non-traditional
students prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg (2009). A phenomenological approach attempted to
discover how students drew on resources in an attempt to develop an approach to a
research assignment. A phenomenological study captured student experience with indepth interviews (Eberle, 2014; Patton, 2002). A survey captured demographic
information. Think-alouds captured the verbalized thought processes of students as they
worked on their assignment. The target population was non-traditional college students
enrolled in a university in South Florida. Non-traditional students are defined as students
who may be over the age of 26, working outside the home, first-in-family to attend
college, and / or who have not had access to digital resources; they may not have had
extensive experience with computers for academic purposes (Overall, 2010, Robinson &
Gilliam, 2014). Participants of this study consisted of a seven non-traditional students
from an institution of higher education in South Florida. Student participation was
confidential and voluntary. Student participants were taken from classes that had in their
syllabus, an assignment to write a paper using library resources, such as print and
electronic books and electronic subscription databases. Participants had an assigned
research paper by their instructor prior to inclusion in the study. Using the institution-

79

wide email system, students were invited to participate by email. Students were
interviewed as to their experiences with conducting the initial stages of their assignment.
Data was interpreted and analyzed.
Research Methods and Design(s)
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how non-traditional
students prioritized the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg (2009). A phenomenological approach attempted to
discover how students drew on resources in an attempt to develop an approach to a
research assignment. A phenomenological study captured student experience with indepth interviews (Patton, 2002). The target population was non-traditional college
students enrolled in a college or university in South Florida. Non-traditional students are
defined as students who may be over the age of 26, working outside the home, first-infamily to attend college, and / or who have not had access to digital resources; they may
not have had extensive experience with computers for academic purposes (Overall,
2010). Participants of this study consisted of seven non-traditional students from an
institution of higher education in South Florida. Student participation was confidential
and voluntary. Students were invited to participate by internal institutional email.
Students were provided with a consent form and asked to participate in the study. There
were no incentives to participate in the study other than the opportunity to discuss their
experiences regarding library research. Participants were recruited from classes that had
an assigned research paper to write. Students were interviewed as to their experiences
while conducting the initial stages of their assignment.

80

Research Questions
Embracing the framework of social constructivism, the central theme of the study
concerns itself with the experiences and critical thinking skills attainment by nontraditional college students in their ability to begin academic research using digital
resources (Mabry, 2010). Studies isolating and specifically focusing on the library and
digital research skills of non-traditional students at private universities in the United
States are not available (Dawson, Charman & Kilpatrick 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2010;
Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Peou & Lwin, 2011; Shen, 2007; Wallis 2006; Wang 2006).
Interviews with non-traditional students will be included to collect reflective
conversations. Think aloud sessions will add further breadth and depth to the responses.
The following questions were designed to provide useful information for university
librarians and faculty who are creating research assignments.
Q1. What are the experiences of non-traditional college students as they begin the
first phase of online research for a course related research assignment, identified
by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big Picture?
Q2. What are the perceptions of non-traditional college students as they begin the
first phase of online research for a course related research assignment, identified
by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big Picture?
Population
The target population were non-traditional college students enrolled in a college
or university in South Florida. Non-traditional students are defined as students who may
be over the age of 26, working outside the home, first-in-family to attend college, and / or
who have not had access to digital resources; they may not have had extensive experience

81

with computers for academic purposes (Overall, 2010). Participants of this study
consisted of a seven non-traditional students from an institution of higher education in
South Florida. Student participation was confidential and voluntary. Students were
invited to participate by internal institutional email. Students were provided with a
consent form and asked to participate in the study. There was no incentive to participate
in the study other than the opportunity to discuss their experiences regarding library
research. Participants were recruited from classes that had an assigned research paper to
write. Students were interviewed as to their experiences while conducting the initial
stages of their assignment.

Sample
A sample of two students was used to field test the interview questions prior to
obtaining perceptions from the actual study sample. The purpose of the field test was to
hone the design of the questions to provide clarity and closely mimic the intended study
(Esposito, 2009). Field-testing provided the researcher with insights into possible design
flaws in the survey questions (Esposito, 2009). The location of the field test should
approximate the intended site of the actual study, to be a close, but smaller copy of the
study (Esposito, 2009). Credibility is based on the intent of the study, not its intended
conclusions (Schram, 2006). See Appendix B for Interview Questions used. The
fieldwork must be rigorous; the data must be of high quality, gathered in a clear and
purposeful manner. Underlying the entire study is the researcher’s belief in the value of
qualitative research, which is communicated by the quality of the study (Patton 2002).

82

Sample size for this qualitative study was seven students, which was when data
saturation is achieved. Discussions on the appropriate size of a qualitative study
recommend varying numbers of participants, however, when exploring a cultural or
social population, the actual numbers of participants is not the critical issue (Trotter,
2012). Choosing the best participants, those who represent what was being explored, was
the primary goal of the study. No definitive number of participants is ideal. Trotter sites
the varied opinions of other researchers, showing their variance in size agreement
(Trotter, 2012). Williamson states that Qualitative research relies on the use of prudently
determined small samples (Williamson, 2006). Graduate students from a private
university in south Florida were selected. These students were taken from the population
that is designated as non-traditional, based on the National Center for Educational
Statistics definition of a non-traditional college student (2012). Non-traditional students
can be characterized with any or all of the following attributes: adults, over the age of 26,
the first family member to attend college, working, and with family obligations. This
student participant may also not speak English as a first language.
Materials/Instruments
The researcher utilized interviews to identify and study the first typology of
context, as discussed by Head & Eisenberg (2009). Based on a constructivist approach,
open-ended interview questions were designed to elicit responses from the student
participants. This format provided for the information-gathering perceptions and
experiences in the participants’ own words (Williamson, 2014). The protocol surrounding

83

the data collection maintained a chain of evidence and developed interpretations based on
critical thinking and skepticism (Yin, 2012).
The use of think-aloud concurrent protocol analysis provided for participants to
vocalize their thought processes as they were deciding how to answer questions or
conduct an operation (Van Someren, 2003); this provided detailed information on how
students approached learning tasks (Winne & Perry, 2000). Responses were recorded and
transcribed.
Data Collection, Processing, and Analysis
Data was collected from participating non-traditional students through openended interview questions, a survey instrument to collect demographic information and
think-aloud sessions. Participants were interviewed about the ways in which they
searched for digital information for an assignment, the tools they used, and their
roadblocks and successes they encountered. The researcher created a guide containing
specific questions to ask during the interview process, and standardized procedures to
follow during the interview process. The primary interviewer was the author of this
study. I used paper and pen to capture field notes in writing, noting the participants’
responses. In addition, the interviews were recorded to accurately transcribe data during
the data analysis phase. All interviews were face-to-face, and in person. Think-aloud
sessions were in the form of face-to-face, or over phone lines or Skype communication to
record and capture real time vocalizations by the participants. No other tools were needed
or used. Interviews lasted approximately 45-60 minutes, and ended with the mutual
agreement of both the participant and the interviewer. The interviews took place within
one semester, commencing after the third week of classes. Students had received their

84

syllabi and began working on class assignments. Field notes and recordings of the
interviews were transcribed. Detailed and robust note-taking, reflexive inquiry,
conducting carefully monitored member checking activities with participants, (Carlson,
2010) the objective voice of the interviewer and the overall rigor of the study were some
of the components provided a level of trustworthiness (Patton, 2002). To exhibit
integrity, it was also recommended that the researcher disclose potential bias (Cook &
Farmer, 2011). Behaving ordinary, sincere and authentic when working with participants
increased the trustworthiness of the researcher and helped to alleviate reticence on the
part of participants (Schram, 2006).
The data was collected and analyzed by the researcher, omitting any information
that may identify the participants. An alphabetical system was employed so that student
identities remained unknown. The goal of the data analysis software, such as Dedoose,
was not employed to assist with analysis of the collected data. Data analysis gathered
information regarding the information-seeking behaviors of non-traditional college
students while they were working on research assignments, using computers, the Internet
and library databases. Constant comparison of data was employed as a method to identify
similarities and differences in responses, creating categories of relationships and defining
concepts (McGrellis, 2013). Comparison of data continued until no additional concepts
contributed to the data collection, thus reaching data saturation (Holton, 2010). More than
two types of coding methodology were used, substantive and theoretical (Holton, 2010).
Substantive coding was used to develop categories of similar relationships of data, while
theoretical coding provided for the comparison of data until no new categories emerged,

85

reaching a point of saturation (Holton, 2010). Data analysis concluded when saturation
was reached.
The data was organized in a logical format, so that relationships and matrixes
were created (Yin, 2012). Charts were developed to capture the variety of responses from
the participants, synthesizing and summarizing similar responses. The purpose of
interviewing participants and analyzing the data was to suggest or clarify patterns of
behaviors (Patton, 2002) with the goal to describe the data, differentiate typical from
atypical responses, expose patterns, relationships and differences, and satisfy the research
question (Charles & Mertler, 2002). Interpretations were based on “logically matching
data with research questions” (Charles & Mertler, 2002, p. 135).
The intended audiences of this study were librarians who provide information
literacy instruction and reference assistance to students, and database vendors who design
and sell research databases. Vendors have an interest in improving the design of research
databases to be more user friendly and accurate for their users (librarians, students and
researchers). The interviews provided information as to how students looked for and
found information for assignments in such a way as to offer enlightenment to both
designers and librarians. Conclusions from this study may foster discussion and
innovation to redesign academic resource databases, or library websites, so that nontraditional students will be able to look for and find the information needed in a more
efficient and accurate way. Librarians are well aware that students will benefit from
improved databases and high quality information literacy instruction (Duke, 2012).
Librarians will find the data valuable in designing their information literacy instruction
pieces to improve student success.

86

Assumptions
The participating students were non-traditional, as defined above; therefore, they
may have exhibited some library anxiety in participating in a library related study. Efforts
to explain the purpose of the study, and their participation may have ameliorated their
reservations. Students had a research assignment that required use of print and digital
library resources, such as textbooks, e-books, journals, and databases. The assignment
was pre-determined by their instructors and in the course syllabus. The instructors were
not consulted or informed by the researcher which students participated in the study so as
not to bias the results. The students consented to participation and did not receive
compensation. Students were presented with open-ended questions and think-aloud
protocols, which allowed participants the depth and breadth needed for robust data.
Limitations
As not uncommon with small studies, it is critical to maintain a high level of
integrity and adhere to strict guidelines. In the case of this study, the researcher was also
the director of the library. The students have met the library director on many occasions.
In this case, anonymity of the researcher is not possible; however, this researcher made
every effort not to have bias by using pre-determined interview questions. The researcher,
however, assured the participants of confidentiality when conducting the interviews and
gathering data from the intended designated group of participants. All identifying data
was removed. Although faculty participation was required, the faculty had no knowledge
of which of their students were participating or of the data collected.

87

Delimitations
Participants of this study consisted of seven non-traditional students from a
private institution of higher education in South Florida. The participating students had a
research assignment that required use of print and digital library resources, such as
textbooks, e-books, journals, and electronic subscription databases. The assignment was
pre-determined by their instructors and in the course syllabus. The instructors were not
consulted or informed by the researcher which students participated in a study so as not
to bias the results. The students consented to participation and did not receive
compensation.
Ethical Assurances
To exhibit integrity, it was recommended that the researcher disclose potential
bias (Cook & Farmer, 2011). Behaving ordinary, sincere and authentic when working
with participants increased the trustworthiness of the researcher and helped to alleviate
reticence on the part of participants (Schram, 2006). The author/researcher provided
appropriate forms, such as details as to the purpose of the study, and information
regarding the confidentiality of the study to all participants. Credibility was based on the
intent of the study, not its intended conclusions (Schram, 2006). An IRB was sought and
approved prior to any data being collection.
Summary
The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to assess how nontraditional students experienced the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an
assignment within the context typology of The Big Picture, based on the research of Head
and Eisenberg (2009). Participants of this study consisted of seven non-traditional

88

students from a private institution of higher education in South Florida. The participating
students had a research assignment that required use of print and digital library resources,
such as textbooks, e-books, journals, and electronic subscription databases. The
assignment was pre-determined by their instructors and in the course syllabus. The
instructors were not consulted or informed by the researcher which of the students
participated in a study so as not to bias the results. The students consented to participation
and did not receive compensation.
The research method consisted of collecting data from participating students. The
data was collected by interviews, to capture the real-world environment of the student,
think-aloud protocols, and a survey to capture demographic information. The interviews
gathered demographic and related information as well as student reflections on their
research.
Interviews with participants provided a real world framework of the issues to be
studied, offering the researcher a close and intimate view from the perspective of the
participating students (Yin, 2012). Think aloud protocol was also employed to gather the
verbalized thought processes of the participants as they conducted research on the
Internet, adding an additional dimension to the data collected. The use of think-aloud
concurrent protocol analysis provided for participants to vocalize their thought processes
as they were deciding how to answer questions or conduct an operation (Van Someren,
2003); this provided detailed information on how students approached learning tasks
(Winne & Perry, 2000).
Using the Context Typology designed by Head (2009) interviews gathered
information. This approach provided for open-ended conversations, permitting student

89

participants the freedom to expand their thoughts and observations about research
assignments. No conversations and collected materials carried any identifying
information, however, demographic information was collected by a confidential survey;
responses were confidential. Student participants provided written consent to participate
in the study, without any form of monetary compensation.
Sample size for this qualitative study was seven students. Williamson stated that
qualitative research relies on the use of prudently determined small samples (Williamson,
2006). Students from a private university in south Florida were selected. These students
were taken from the population that is designated as non-traditional, based on the
National Center for Educational Statistics definition of a non-traditional college student
(2012).
Data was collected using face-to-face interviews, consisting of open-ended
questions, which allowed for a variety of responses, short, long, and open-ended, creating
a rich and robust collection of data, an a survey instrument which gathered demographic
information. Ghorbani and Alavi (1990) recommend that the intention of the study be
strongly considered when designing the interview questions to be used. The researcher
maintained field notes during the data collection phase of the study. A sample of two
students were used to field test the interview questions prior to obtaining perceptions
from the actual study sample. Field-testing provided the researcher with insights into
possible design flaws in the survey questions (Esposito, 2009). See Appendix B for
Interview Questions used. The fieldwork must be rigorous; the data must be of high
quality, gathered in a clear and purposeful manner. Underlying the entire study was the

90

researcher’s belief in the value of qualitative research, which was communicated by the
quality of the study (Patton 2002).
The data was collected and analyzed by the researcher, omitting any information
that may identify the participants. An alphabetical system was employed so that student
identities remained unknown. Data analysis was gathered information regarding the
information-seeking behaviors of non-traditional college students while they were
working on research assignments, using computers, the Internet and library databases.
Constant comparison of data was employed as a method to identify similarities and
differences in responses, creating categories of relationships and defining concepts
(McGrellis, 2013). Data analysis concluded when saturation was reached.
The data was organized in a logical format, so that relationships and matrixes

The intended audiences of this study wee librarians who provide information
literacy instruction and reference assistance to students, and database vendors who design
and sell research databases. Vendors have an interest in improving the design of research
databases to be more user friendly and accurate. Conclusions from this study may foster
discussion and innovation to redesign academic resource databases, or library websites,

91

so that non-traditional students will be able to look for and find the information needed in
a more efficient and accurate way. Librarians are well aware that students will benefit

Librarians will find the data valuable in designing their information literacy instruction

Chapter 4: Findings
Findings
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how non-traditional
students prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg (2009). A phenomenological approach attempted to
discover how students drew on resources in an attempt to develop an approach to a
research assignment. Participants of this study consisted of seven non-traditional students
from an institution of higher education in South Florida. Student participation was
confidential and voluntary. Students were interviewed as to their experiences while
conducting the initial stages of their assignment. The findings were derived using both
the one-on-one interviews and the think-aloud session transcripts.
A variety of coding methods was employed to code and analyze the data. The first
coding method used during the coding process was In Vivo, which identified natural
language used by participants, in an effort to capture the participants’ voices. An example
of In Vivo coding appears in Table 1, below.

Student Responses
“Well, the syllabus is
important because it’s going
to tell you like a rubric of it

rubric on the side. But if they
don’t, just look at everything
what that professor’s looking
for you to get from the paper
and then work your way up
with the book, with the
lecture notes because of
course, you’re going to get
the information from the
lecture notes and like that.”

Lecture Notes

The second coding method employed was Process Coding to identify specific
behaviors and describe processes used by the student participants. Process coding was
used as a method to gather broad concepts that were discussed by the student participants
during the interview sessions. An example of Process coding appears in Table 2.

Descriptive coding was used with the Think-Aloud sessions. The purpose of
Descriptive Coding was to suggest patterns of action taken by the participants as they
discussed their behaviors while conducting a faculty assigned research assignment. As
the aim of the study was to gather information on the behaviors of students while
conducting research for an assignment, Descriptive coding is particularly pertinent. An
example of the employment of Descriptive Coding is based on the response by
participant identified as, “D” to the question: “Think of a course-related research
assignment, either one that you’re doing now or recently. Give me a specific example of
the process that you went through in the beginning stages, looking for and finding
information.”
The student participant indicated the initial steps used and then followed with
using transitional wording such as if, but, then and so. The process described in Table
three can be sequenced as such:
Table 3
Examples of Transitional Wording Using Descriptive Coding

Student Responses
“So, the first step that I take when I get an
assignment is to look at my notes that are
given in class, to see the lecture notes and if
it’s mentioned there, to get an idea of what
information is covered and what I need to
expand on. So, looking at that and then I start
of course, searching. My first search will be
googling. I Google what I’m looking for, but
my main sources are articles, scholarly
articles. I use the library website to search

on databases, but some websites are very

great detail.\”

The researcher manually coded the seven interviews and two Think-Aloud
sessions, without the use of computer software. This was considered preferable due to the
small size of the sample and their use of both medical and library terminology, which
could more easily be defined and clarified manually. Manual coding also provides an
excellent opportunity for the researcher to become intimate with the interviews and
transcripts. Holistic coding was the final coding method used in the study. It was used as
a form of secondary coding to assist with developing broad topic areas, which would later
become themes. Themes highlighted the broader behaviors discussed in the study. This
chapter presents the key findings obtained from the seven interviews and two think-aloud
session. Following is a discussion of each finding.
Finding 1: All 100 % (N=7) of the students admitted using Google either as a first point
of contact, or soon after. Student D indicated it was the first online search she conducted,
however she first consulted her class notes. She stated, “My first search will be Googling.
I Google what I’m looking for, but my main sources are articles, scholarly articles.”
Student A indicated she does not initially go to Google because she is unsure of the
validity of the content, stating, “I didn’t want to go to Google first because I wouldn’t
know if the sources are legitimate.” All seven (100%) participants indicated going to
Google or Google Scholar to help define their topic prior to conducting serious research.
Participant C states, “What I’ll do first just to get a general idea of my topic is I’ll just

96

type it into Google and I would see what would come up first, the first couple of links
and I’d just get a general idea.”
Finding 2: Responding to the question of what resources they consult to begin an
assignment, the 85.7% (N=6) stated they turn to their textbook first. The students did
consult with more than one resource as they began to define their topic. The results were
split as to which additional items were used: 42.8% (N=3) indicating their lecture notes
(these are printed class notes provided by the professor); 28.6% (N=2) consulted the
rubric; their own handwritten notes and the class PowerPoints each only garnered 14.3%
(N=1). Based on the above numbers, it is clear to see that students use the textbook first
and then consult with an additional written source. Both of the two students who said
they referred to their syllabus said it was because it contains what the professor wants.
Student F said, “Because a lot of the times the syllabus has an explanation on what is
expected from you. You can also use the syllabus as a guideline to see, ‘Okay, this is how
far in-depth I need to go.’” Student G stated, “The syllabus is important because it’s
going to tell you like a rubric of it most likely.” None of the other 71.4% (N=5) students
mentioned the syllabus at all.
Finding 3: Students were of mixed opinion as it pertains to subsequent searching. As a
follow-up to where the students search online after their initial Google search, students
offered a wide variety of responses. The assignment was of a medical nature, so
searching resources that contain health related, medical information would be
recommended. Three of the students (42.8%) mentioned a library subscription database
collection called LIRN (Library Information Resources Network), two (28.6%) indicated
PubMed (which is a collection of medical journal abstracts published by the National

97

Library of medicine), and two (28.6%) others indicated they could not recall the name of
the resource but knew how to find it. Student C stated, “On the library website. I don’t
know what the name of it is; I just know how to get there.” One student reached out to
her sister and learned of a medical school student forum that she accessed.
Finding 4: Interesting comments were elicited by the students regarding the questions on
consulting people, such as professors, librarians, peers and others. Only one student
(14.3%) adamantly replied that she did not consult with faculty. Student A stated, “The
professors do not have much to offer. They refer me to the librarian.” Following this
with, “Dr. X is really difficult because he doesn’t respond to emails quickly. And he
doesn’t give direct answers. I’m just as confused after. I don’t understand his hints.” The
other six (85.7%) of the students indicated that they do consult with professors
throughout the research process, with mixed success. Student F also admitted some
frustration with professors, saying, “ This would be the correct whatever, and then I was
like, ‘okay’ and he just explained to me that yes, you were approaching it from the right
direction, but he didn’t point me where I could find a sources. It was just like that answer
is correct.” Of the other five students, they all stated that the professor would give them
hints, pointing them in a direction, but not stating outright if they are finding the correct
answers to the issues. Even though they did not receive direct answers, four of them
(57.1%) indicated that they understood this to be a learning exercise and did not want to
be given the answer. In contrast, only one student (14.2%) thought the professor to be the
first and best person to approach at the outset. Student G stated, “I feel like that’s the first
thing you should do when you want to do something good in school. When you need

98

help, you should talk to your professor. Your professor is going to be your best friend in
school, I feel.”
Finding 5: Related to the question about whom they most often went to for help, five of
the seven students (71.4%) chose the librarian as their first choice, professor as second
and classmates as third. One student chose librarian only and one chose professor only. In
all cases, a librarian was consulted only after students first used Google and attempted to
access scholarly journal articles independently. The students who approached a librarian
for assistance asked for help with finding resources, checking for proper citations and
avoiding plagiarism. Two students indicated they had anxiety about inadvertent
plagiarism and went to the library for assistance. Student G admitted, “So what you do is,
at least for me, I just try to read maybe a page or two, and then summarizing what I can
from it, and then in my own words, getting an idea of what they’re trying to say and then
writing that in the paper without – Again I say, making sure that you’re not plagiarizing
anything.” She adds that, “I’m Hispanic, so right off the bat when I first started in school
what bothered me the most was trying to find the correct words to put into the research
paper because there’s [sic] specific words that you have to use.”
Finding 6: Students discussed some of their frustrations and challenges in finding
material for their research papers. Only one of the students (14.3%) indicated that English
was a first language and that it was the only language spoken at home. Of the remaining
85.7% of the participants, two (28.6%) spoke Spanish, three (42.9%) spoke Arabic and
one (14.3%) spoke Korean at home. Students indicated some frustration in easily and
quickly finding the resources they needed for their research papers. Many discussed the
amount of time it takes to refine searches using the subscription databases. Student G

99

stated, “You do have to check a bunch of work journals and then every information is
different…I would reread every single journal and it would take so much time.” Student
F indicated difficulty finding materials, “You have to dig for articles that as assurance
you’re trying to find free articles….I usually have to find different ways – approach in all
different ways and try to find as much as I can.” Student A said, “I have trouble filtering
through what is a legitimate source.” Student C discussed his inability to find
information, “The biggest challenge was finding credible sources because for that topic
specifically it’s a lot of coincidental facts.”
Finding 7: All of the participants (100%) indicated that after participating in library
instruction, or consultation, they were better equipped to find resources more effectively.
Student E indicated that she went to the library, “Pretty much to give me the exact, I
guess, search engines to look under and help with formatting.” Student C stated, “To
point me in the right direction, let me know if the articles I’m using are good articles to
use and database as well, what databases would be helpful.” Student B said, “Whatever
you taught me here was helpful because I can more – the stuff I didn’t know you taught,
even though I learned it. You gave me more clearer version of how to use the scholar.”
Evaluation of Findings
Holistic coding was used as a form of secondary coding to assist with developing
broad topic areas, which would later become themes. Themes highlighted the broader
behaviors discussed in the study. Although the interview questions were not clustered
into like-minded questions during the interview process with the participants, they can be
grouped into three broad categories which intended to identify the information seeking

100

behaviors of the student participants. Rearranging the questions into the following
highlights the similarity of the questions:
Group 1: Personal strategies employed
Group 2. External processes used
Group 3. Personal reflections
The following table clusters the interview questions into three major categories, which
bring to light the information seeking behaviors of the student participants.

Regrouping the questions into three major categories provided the researcher with
a perspective about the responses of the student participants as three fairly defined, yet
occasionally overlapping categories. Some of the questions lent themselves to creeping
from strategy or process into reflection. The questions were not designed to be rigid, but
to elicit honest responses from the participants, so that reflection may become a part of a
strategy or process.
As a result of regrouping the questions that were asked during the interview
sessions, three themes evolved that all contribute to a clearer understanding of the
information seeking behaviors of non-traditional students. Students have already
developed strategies they employ when conducting research, whether online or while

102

using print materials. In many cases, they tend not to deviate from their strategies, despite
faculty recommendations to try alternate methods. Many students find it useful to consult
with their professors throughout the research-gathering phase, and then consult with the
library staff toward the end of the project. Many students tend to procrastinate when
given a research assignment, even though they are aware they should begin sooner.
Summary
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how non-traditional
students prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg (2009). A phenomenological approach attempted to
discover how students drew on resources in an attempt to develop an approach to a
research assignment. Participants of this study consisted of seven non-traditional students
from an institution of higher education in South Florida.
The primary finding was that all the participants used either Google or Google
Scholar either as their first choice or soon after to choose or clarify a topic for a research
paper. The findings showed that even though students have been instructed to use the
campus library or other respected, reliable sources for information, they all begin their
papers with a non-authoritative resource. There was some hesitation or anxiety about the
information in Google not being credible, but the students believed that they could
determine its credibility in other ways.
The second finding was a discussion on resources other than those on the Internet
the students were consulting at the beginning of a research assignment. Although the

103

majority (85.7%) of the students consulted their textbooks, many of the students used
multiple resources to help them gather initial information on their topics. Many of the
students felt that using the resources available through the course, such as lecture notes,
the syllabus, PowerPoint presentations and other course related materials were a good
initial contact point before or after an attempt on Google.
The third finding was about subsequent online searching. The students were of
mixed opinion. Three of the students (42.8%) mentioned a library subscription database
collection called LIRN, two (28.6%) indicated PubMed and two (28.6%) others indicated
they could not recall the name of the resource but knew how to find it. Student C stated,
“On the library website. I don’t know what the name of it is; I just know how to get
there.” One student reached out to her sister and learned of a medical school student
forum that she accessed.
The fourth finding was about consulting people, such as professors, librarians,
peers and others. Only one student (14.3) adamantly replied that she did not consult with
faculty. The other six (85.7.5) of the students indicated that they do consult with
professors throughout the research process, with mixed success. Student F also admitted
some frustration with professors. Of the other five students, they all stated that the
professor would give them hints. Only one student (14.2%) thought the professor to be
the first and best person to approach at the outset. Student G stated, “I feel like that’s the
first thing you should do when you want to do something good in school. When you need
help, you should talk to your professor. Your professor is going to be your best friend in
school, I feel.”

104

The fifth finding was about whom they most often went to for help. Five of the
seven (71.4%) the students chose the librarian as their first choice, professor as second
and classmates as third. One student chose librarian only and one chose professor only. In
all cases, a librarian was consulted only after students first used Google and attempted to
access scholarly journal articles independently. The students who approached a librarian
for assistance asked for help with finding resources, checking for proper citations and
avoiding plagiarism. Two students indicated they had anxiety about inadvertent
plagiarism and went to the library for assistance.
The sixth finding was about some of their frustrations and challenges in finding
material for their research papers. Of the majority of 85.7% of the participants, two
(28.6%) spoke Spanish, three (42.9%) spoke Arabic and one (14.3%) spoke Korean at
home. Students indicated some frustration in easily and quickly finding the resources
they needed for their research papers. Many discussed the amount of time it takes to
refine searches using the subscription databases. Students indicated difficulty in finding
materials, and trouble filtering through what is a legitimate source.
The seventh finding was that 100% of the students participating in library
instruction, or consultation, felt they were better equipped to find resources more
effectively. They discussed that they were more comfortable and confident after learning
about the resources available on the online library, how to identify credible sources and
how to format and cite references.
The evaluation suggested a regrouping of the questions that were asked during the
interview sessions, establishing three overriding themes. Three themes evolved that

105

contribute to a clearer understanding of the information seeking behaviors of nontraditional students. Students have already developed strategies they employ when
conducting research, whether online or while using print materials. In many cases, they
tend not to deviate from their strategies, despite faculty recommendations to try alternate
methods. Many students find it useful to consult with their professors throughout the
research gathering phase, and then consult with the library staff toward the end of the
project. Many students tend to procrastinate when given a research assignment, even
though they are aware they should begin sooner.

Chapter 5: Implications, Recommendations, and Conclusions
Students are often in need of research skills for academic research as well as lifelong learning (Staines, 2011). The specific problem is that older adults and returning
students defined as non-traditional students often do not possess the skills and resources
needed for the rigors of college-level academic research (Ascenuik, 2012). Isolated data
on information literacy skills of the non-traditional student have been difficult to obtain
(Ascenuik, 2012; Dawson, Charman & Kilpatrick 2013; Head & Eisenberg, 2010;
Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis 2006; Wang 2006. These skills involve the
integration of online technology and resources with proficiency in topic selection,
searching and evaluating the existing research (Elton-Chalcraft, et al, 2008). Without
conducting this study, the administration may not be able to address library anxiety and
isolate those critical thinking skills needed for success. Students may face a multitude of
issues with the onset of their higher education careers, including a mismatch between
their perceived and actual information literacy competency (Latham & Gross, 2013).
Exploration of students’ research behaviors exists (Ge, 2010; Gross & Latham, 2013;
Head & Eisenberg, 2009, 2010; Kayongo & Helm, 2010; Shen, 2007; Wallis, 2006;
Wang, 2006), however studying the behaviors of the non-traditional student has not been
isolated.
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how non-traditional
students prioritize the information-seeking behavioral tasks of an assignment within the
context typology of The Big Picture, the first step of the research context typology
designed by Head and Eisenberg (2009). A phenomenological approach attempted to
discover how students draw on resources to develop an approach to a research

107

assignment. A phenomenological study captured qualitative data of student experience
with in-depth interviews (Eberle, 2014; Patton, 2002). A survey captured demographic
information. Think-alouds captured the verbalized thought processes of students as they
work on their assignment. The target population was non-traditional college students
enrolled in a university in South Florida. Non-traditional students are defined as students
who may be over the age of 26, working outside the home, first-in-family to attend
college, and / or who have not had access to digital resources; they may not have had
extensive experience with computers for academic purposes (Overall, 2010; Robinson &
Gilliam, 2014). Non-traditional students may also speak a language other than English as
their first or primary language. Participants of this study consisted of seven nontraditional students from an institution of higher education in South Florida. Student
participation was confidential and voluntary. Student participants were taken from classes
that have in their syllabus, an assignment to write a paper using library resources, such as
print and electronic books and databases. Participants had an assigned research paper by
their instructor prior to inclusion in the study. Using the institution-wide email system,
students were invited to participate by email. Students were interviewed as to their
experiences with conducting the initial stages of their assignment. Data were coded by
research question, and then categorized by concept, interpreted and analyzed. The
findings were derived using both the one-on-one interviews and the think-aloud session
transcripts.
A variety of coding methods was employed to code and analyze the data. The first
coding method used during the coding process was In Vivo, which identified natural
language used by participants, in an effort to capture the participants’ voices. The second

108

coding method employed was Process Coding to identify specific behaviors and describe
processes used by the student participants. Process coding was used as a method to gather
broad concepts that were discussed by the student participants during the interview
sessions. Descriptive coding was used with the Think-Aloud sessions. The purpose of
Descriptive Coding was to suggest patterns of action taken by the participants as they
discussed their behaviors while conducting a faculty assigned research assignment. As
the aim of the study was to gather information on the behaviors of students while
conducting research for an assignment, Descriptive coding is particularly pertinent. The
researcher manually coded the seven interviews and two Think-Aloud sessions, without
the use of computer software. This was considered preferable due to the small size of the
sample and the students’ use of both medical and library terminology, which could more
easily be defined and clarified manually. Manual coding also provided an excellent
opportunity for the researcher to become intimate with the interviews and transcripts.
Holistic coding was the final coding method used in the study. It was used as a form of
secondary coding to assist with developing broad topic areas, which would later become
themes. Themes highlighted the broader behaviors discussed in the study.
The study was based on the following research questions:
Q1. What are the experiences of non-traditional college students as they begin the
first phase of online research for a course related research assignment, identified
by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big Picture?

109

Q2. What are the perceptions of non-traditional college students as they begin the
first phase of online research for a course related research assignment, identified
by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big Picture?
The use of the research questions enabled the researcher to gather information on
the behaviors of students conducting research for an assignment, while holistic coding
drew out patterns of student behaviors based on the discussions. Regarding the
experiences of non-traditional college students as they begin the first phase of online
research for a course related research assignment, identified by Head and Eisenberg’s
context typology as the Big Picture, it was found that all of the students used Google at
some point in the beginning of their assignment to assist them in a) choosing a topic, b)
defining a topic, and/or c) finding some articles relating to the topic, despite the
instructions by the professor to use only peer-reviewed scholarly resources in their
research. The students followed this initial step with a variety of methods to obtain higher
quality academic materials for their papers. Some consulted their syllabus, some their
class notes, some used the textbook, and others consulted with faculty. Chapter Four
provides details as to what they used, where they looked and how they used the
information they obtained.
The second research question pertained to the perceptions of non-traditional
college students as they began the first phase of online research for a course related
research assignment, identified by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big
Picture. Based on the interview questions and answers by the student participants, the
researcher was able to glean perceptions relating to a) the difficulty of assignment, b)
ease of use of resources, c) assistance from faculty, d) their skill level and abilities in

110

performing the tasks. In summary, students were concerned with the quality, accuracy,
and relevance of resources, and their ability to distinguish authentic over fallacious
information. Some students were particularly concerned with avoiding plagiarizing.
These concerns highlighted an uncertainty and lack of acumen in their own researching
skillset.
Themes emerged from the broader behaviors discussed in the study. Although the
interview questions were not clustered into like-minded questions during the interview
process with the participants, they can be grouped into three broad categories which
intended to identify the information seeking behaviors of the student participants.
Rearranging the questions into the following groups highlights the similarity of the
questions:
Group 1: Personal strategies employed
Group 2. External processes used
Group 3. Personal reflections
Regrouping the questions into three major clusters, above, provided the researcher with a
perspective about the responses of the student participants as three fairly defined, yet
occasionally overlapping categories. Some of the questions lent themselves to creeping
from strategy or process into reflection. The questions were not designed to be rigid, but
to elicit honest responses from the participants, so that reflection may become a part of a
strategy or process. As a result of regrouping the questions that were asked during the
interview sessions, three themes evolved.

The three behavioral themes that evolved contributed to a clearer understanding
of the information seeking behaviors of non-traditional students as a result of regrouping
the questions that were asked during the interview sessions. 1) Students have already
developed strategies they employ when conducting research, whether online or while
using print materials. These strategies have been used by the students for years, even
when alternates are suggested by faculty or librarians. In many cases, they tend not to
deviate from their strategies, despite faculty recommendations to try alternate methods. 2)
Students find it useful to consult with their professors throughout the research gathering
phase, and then consult with the library staff toward the end of the project. They were
advised by the faculty to seek library assistance at the outset, yet not one of the students
followed through with this recommendation. 3) Students tend to procrastinate when

112

given a research assignment, even though they are aware they should begin sooner. Only
one student began some preparation within the first few days of receiving the assignment.
Most of the students delayed onset until well into the semester.
Implications
Embracing the framework of social constructivism, the central theme of the study
concerns itself with the experiences and critical thinking skill attainment of nontraditional college students in their ability to begin academic research using digital
resources (Mabry, 2010). The results of the data collection from interviews with the
student participants revealed that, in answer to Research Question One, the students
attempted to gather foundational information regarding the assignment for the
development of the Big Picture, the first step in the context typology developed by Head
and Eisenberg (2009). As found in previous studies with traditional students, students
typically emphasize efficiency over thoroughness, preferring resources found easily and
quickly, without regard to the quality or relevance of the data (Asher & Duke, 2011;
Head & Eisenberg 2010; Robinson & Gilliam, 2014), the non-traditional students in this
study laid their groundwork by using tools easily at their disposal, such as Google, their
class notes, textbook and syllabi. Because convenience is uppermost in the minds of
college students, most research projects begin with web searches on the Internet, rather
than the more time consuming tedious searches through scholarly databases (Komissarov
& Murray, 2016). Students are aware of the value of peer-reviewed journals, and use
them to some extent, but not as a starting point for their assignments (Komissarov &
Murray, 2016). A need exists for developing life-long research skills in students and
faculty alike (Staines, 2011). These skills involve the integration of online technology

113

and resources with proficiency in topic selection, searching and evaluating the existing
research (Elton-Chalcraft, et al, 2008).
Regarding the second research question, the perceptions of non-traditional college
students as they begin the first phase of online research for a course related research
assignment, identified by Head and Eisenberg’s context typology as the Big Picture, the
study revealed that the students held mixed beliefs as to their own mastery of research
skills, agreeing with the findings by Latham and Gross (2013) of a mismatch between
their perceived and actual information literacy competency. In answering the question
regarding the ease or difficulty in finding material for their papers, students indicated
some frustration and anxiety in finding the resources they needed. Many discussed the
amount of time it takes to refine searches using the subscription databases. However,
when asked to quantify the difficulty, on a Likert style scale of 1-5, with one being very
easy and 5 being very difficult, the average was 3.85. Only one student answered 2; three
answered 5, therefore, the majority of the students perceived that finding appropriate
material for their research papers was difficult. The students understood that they must
find and use peer-reviewed scholarly resources for their papers, yet the majority had
difficulty doing so. As discussed in the findings in Chapter Four, the students wrestle
with the desire to find information quickly, and the diligence required to find the best
information. Several theories exist as to why students are not grasping the skills required
for quality information searching. The Principle of Least Effort proposes that students
obtain whatever is more easily available, even if of lesser quality, accepting the first
result as adequate because it is easy and fast (Head, 2013; Leeder & Shah, 2016).
Satisficing is a theory that suggests that students stop at the first satisfactory result, using

114

a minimum amount of effort; quality not being an issue (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Another
way of understanding satisficing is that students judge that the information it is “good
enough.” For example, students believe they have obtained the minimum required
number of references, or they have peer-reviewed journal articles to satisfy the professor
or the minimum requirements of the assignment.
Higher education is largely conducted with an emphasis on using technology as a
tool to read both required and suggested reading and to gather research materials for
research papers. Even students who participate in the face-to-face classroom experience
often have difficulty with online library research (Bolliger & Halupa, 2011). This
requires students to have familiarity and proficiency with the technology (Bolliger &
Halupa, 2011). Students who either believe they lack or actually do lack the skills often
report feelings of frustration and anxiety (Bolliger & Halupa, 2011; Duncan &
Holtslander, 2012).
Georgas (2014) has conducted a study on the comparison of students using the
Google search engine and a Library federated search engine to conduct academic
searches. Federated search engines have been designed to discover journal articles and
other scholarly information -- such as author, title and publication -- via a strict set of
stylized keywords and symbols, and not natural language keywords, as those used by
Google (Georgas, 2014; Ge, 2010). Students overwhelmingly (69%) used natural
language more consistently and in more searches than keyword or Boolean phrases when
conducting a research query (Georgas, 2014). Even when students were using library
databases to access materials, they used natural language over the use of synonyms or
keywords, as frequently suggested by librarians (Asher & Duke, 2011, 2013; Georgas,

115

2014). Students expected the library databases to work just like a Google search engine
(Georgas, 2014). Students have a lack of knowledge or understanding about how the
library database is structured so they often do not obtain the results they anticipate in a
timeframe that is acceptable to them (Georgas, 2014). This study affirms that students are
not comfortable with the subscription databases and prefer to use natural language over
stilted authority controlled vocabulary to find and access scholarly materials.
Libraries are in the process of changing focus from a repository of information to
a place for engagement and interaction. Students do not visit the libraries or consult with
librarians as they had in the past. Students tend not to seek out assistance from librarians
or other faculty members when it comes to conducting research, despite invitations to do
so (Beisler & Medaille, 2016; Gauder, 2011; Ge, 2010; Head & Eisenberg, 2009). As to
the point in time in the process in which students asked for assistance with research
papers, only 14% of the participants reached out to others before starting their research,
and 30% after they had begun their research (Beisler & Medaille, 2016). Many students
found the initial stage of research difficult, such as in developing a topic or how to get
started, yet did not seek out assistance until they began to panic (Beisler & Medaille,
2016). Many of the participants struggled with selecting or finding information to
develop a topic, yet chose to wait until panic or exhaustion took over (Beisler &
Medaille, 2016). The same information was imparted in this study as well.
So what can be done to help students become more successful? How can
librarians assist students with finding and using the higher level, peer-reviewed scholarly
information required of them in their studies? Integrating librarians and information
literacy instruction into the classroom provides librarians with more frequent access to

116

students, increasing the face time with students (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Students become
more familiar and comfortable with the librarians, developing positive relationships, and
will seek them out earlier in their assignment process (Leeder & Shah, 2016). Properly
trained and certified academic librarians can provide students with a roadmap to the
almost limitless superhighway of scholarly information.
Navigating the path is only one aspect of the critical thinking skills that are
needed by students. Librarians are to be trained to navigate, drive and expertly use the
electronic resources and to share these critical skills with college students. Revamping
the library schools to provide coursework and experiences in information literacy
instruction is vital for success.
Recommendations
Information literacy instruction is a field of library science that has been growing
exponentially along with the growth of online resources (Bryan, 2016). Academic
librarians are being asked to conduct lessons in information literacy and library research
without having had coursework in teaching or pedagogy (Bryan, 2016). Library schools
must prepare librarians to become great librarians and leaders among their fellow
librarians (Kimmel, et al, 2016; McKelvey, 2015). To accomplish this goal, library
schools must create transformational programs to develop the leaders of tomorrow
(Kimmel, et al., 2016; McKelvey, 2015).
With the advances in technology and the vast array of resources available on the
Internet and in scholarly databases, the role of the librarian as the keeper of the gate of
knowledge has changed significantly (ACRL, 2013). Librarians’ roles have been
changing as a result of advances in technology and digital resources (Sharkey, 2013).

117

Every librarian is a teacher in some form, whether or not the job title reflects it (Sharkey,
2013). Now that so many of the resources available from libraries are digitized and
accessed through computers, it is imperative that users have the skills and competencies
to access, evaluate and use those resources (ALA, 2016). This report recommends the
integration of information fluency instruction for librarians to attain the skills needed to
disseminate information literacy to their patrons and students by developing new
curricula in library science programs and promote the value of information literacy
instruction by advocating for librarians and by collaborating and partnering with
academic leadership (Sharkey, 2013).
Given that many college and university students in the United States are nontraditional, information literacy must take into account the diverse, multi-ethnic
complexity of language and cultures that is the 21st century student (Hicks & Lloyd,
2016). A constructivist approach to teaching information literacy is preferred over a
behaviorist approach in settings that are multi-cultural (Er & Er, 2013; Hicks & Lloyd,
2016; Kymes & Ray, 2012) because the constructivist approach treats the students as
individuals, without prejudice to ethnicity or culture.
Conclusions
The purpose of this chapter was to discuss the experiences of non-traditional
students at a university in south Florida as they began to conduct research for a facultyassigned research project. The interviews with students revealed when, where and how
they began their research, including various reasons for their actions. It offered insights
into their information seeking behaviors, suggesting some reasons for the students’

118

behaviors, based on the examples of the strategies students employed during the initial
phase of their assignment.
The undertaking of analyzing the findings was conducted to make sense of the
responses of the students as pertaining to beginning a research assignment. Although the
study sample was small (seven participants), it consisted of more than 50% of the eligible
student body in the college at the institution at the time of the study. As discussed in the
earlier chapters, non-traditional students may have challenges, educationally, socially and
economically that warrant separating this group out from the mass to gain insights that
will assist them in being successful students and graduates. Information literacy
instruction must be integrated into the coursework, and mapped into the curriculum, so
that students find relevance to their newly developed skills and will use and retain them
(Staines, 2011). It cannot be denied that students must learn and develop skills to aid
them in their academic endeavors (Tijaro-Rojas, Arce-Trigatti, Cupp, Pascal, Arce,
2016).
At the same time, librarians are obtaining the skills to teach information literacy
and critical thinking to college students, the vendors who develop the electronic
databases must modify the tools to find and access resources. Google searching methods
have become so ubiquitous that students assume all research is designed with Google
strategies in mind (Georgas, 2016; Head, 2013). Many of the students were not familiar
with the college library databases, as they either were different from the resources in their
high schools or had limited experience using them. Databases subscribed to by university
libraries were not designed to use the same search strategies as Google. Knowing that
most users are now familiar with natural language inquiry and “googling,” vendors must

119

adapt their products to be receptive to the multi-cultural, multi-ethnic ways students and
faculty search if they are to maintain relevance.
This researcher must acknowledge potential bias as being both the solo researcher
in the study and only campus librarian at the institution. The researcher is aware that
there could be limitations to the study. To minimize potential bias, the researcher
reminded the participants that their input and remarks were confidential, and would in no
way reflect on their grades in any of their courses. In addition, to maintain confidentiality
and limit bias, the researcher reflected on the discussions, data and experiences, journaled
and discussed findings with colleagues, but did not discuss the interviews, findings or
experiences of the study with the university faculty.

Appendix A: Interview Questions
(Note: As this study is based on the Project Information Literacy research by Head and
Eisenberg, for consistency and relevance, interview questions were taken and modified
from their studies.)
Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. We will be talking for about 45 minutes
about what you have experienced while doing research for an assignment required by one
or more of your instructors. I am particularly interested in how you search for and find
the information you need to complete course-related assignments.
As far as rules:
There are no wrong answers; feel free to share your opinion and experiences; all
of your responses are confidential, your name will not appear in the study or the
results.
Q1. Think of a course-related research assignment. Give me a specific example about the
process of looking for and finding information, what you did, where you looked, what
information were you looking for, etc. You can pick a recent or past experience. What
steps do you take, right from the beginning?
Q2. Do you tend to follow the same steps most of the time for assignments, or do the
steps vary from assignment to assignment? How do they vary? What is the same, and
what is different?
Q3. Do you consult the course readings (text, handouts, documents, syllabus, etc.) for a
research paper? Which ones do you consult and how?
Q4. Is there a person you turn to for help when you are conducting the course-related
research? What are your expectations from this person? How does this person help you?

142

Q5. Have you ever used the resources of the online campus library for research? Explain
where you looked and what you did. Again, no answer is wrong; it is your experience.
Q6. How is finding information on this campus different from what it was at your high
school or previous college? What is the single biggest difference between finding
information in college vs. high school?
Q7. How difficult would you say it is to find information for course-related research
assignments, on a scale of 1-7, with 1 being easy and 7 being very difficult?
Q8. Give me an idea of two of the biggest challenges you’ve encountered when doing
research for a course-related assignment.
Q9. Have you developed strategies to deal with looking for and finding this information?
Explain what you do.
Q10. Who are the three most helpful people on campus when it comes to finding courserelated information for research papers? Rank them as most helpful, second and third.
Q11. What is it like to get information from your professors when you have questions
about your assignment?
Q12. Are there any other comments or statements you would to include?

Appendix C: Think Alouds
Instructions for the Think Aloud for the Researcher
The researcher will have previously arranged a mutually agreeable time to call the
participant on the phone. The researcher will make the call at the agreed upon time. The
researcher will remind the participant that the call will be recorded and then turn on the
recording device.
The researcher will ask for confirmation that the participant is ready and able to
participate in the think aloud session at this time. The researcher will explain the purpose
of the study and give the participant and explanation of the think aloud protocol, and why
it is being used. The researcher will provide a sample exercise to practice verbalizing
their thoughts. (See example below.)The researcher will give the participant an
opportunity to practice thinking aloud.
Participants will practice until they understand and then will be given prepared
instructions on the research protocol. The researcher will read the script provided and
begin the Think Aloud session. The researcher will turn on a timer set for 30 minutes. At
the conclusion of the session, the researcher will thank the participant for their time and
for participating in the study. The phone call will conclude. The researcher will turn off
the recording device.
After completing the instructions, the researcher will ask participants whether they have
any questions. The researcher will begin the session by informing the participant the
session will n ow begin. The researcher will cue participants only when they are silent for

147

10 consecutive seconds. If participants verbalize infrequently, I will remind them to
“keep thinking aloud” or “keep talking.” While participants are thinking aloud, the
researcher will remain silent to avoid disrupting their thought patterns.
Sample Think Aloud

Let's see. I open the top of the coffee pot.

Appendix D: The Think Aloud Script

Script for the Think Aloud (to be spoken by researcher)
“I would like to start by providing you an overview about the study and this session in
particular.
“This study is designed to help me understand how easy or difficult it is to navigate and
find information on websites. In order for me to learn about what works and what does
not work on these websites, I will ask you to perform a task. I would like to stress that the
goal of the study is not to assess you or your abilities but rather to evaluate the usability
of the websites. I am not as interested in the answer you provide as much as how you are
thinking about the task.
“As the facilitator, I’ll be taking notes and will be recording your voice to make sure I’ve
collected accurate feedback. This data will be kept confidential and used for analysis
purposes only. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may discontinue at
any time. This session should last approximately 30 minutes. You recently signed an
informed consent form that stated you understood the purpose of this study, the
eligibility, risks, benefits and confidentiality. Do you agree that you signed the informed
consent form to participate in this think aloud session?”
“I am interested in what you think about when you work at finding material for a course
provided assignment. In order to do this, I’m going to ask you to THINK ALOUD as you
perform the tasks. What I mean by think aloud is that I want you to tell me
EVERYTHING you are thinking from the time I say “Start,” until the session is
complete. In other words, I’d like you to tell me what you’re doing, what you’re

150

expecting to see happen, what you’re going to do, and why. I’d like you to give me your
open impressions, both good and bad of what you see and experience on the website. It’s
most important that you keep talking. If you’re silent for any long period of time I’ll
remind you to talk. I’m not permitted to answer questions during the session. Do you
understand what I want you to do?
“Let’s take a moment to practice thinking aloud. Please think aloud as you answer the
following question. You are now going to tell me what you are thinking. “What did you
do today to prepare your breakfast?” You will think aloud everything you can remember
about your breakfast, starting with your first thoughts about breakfast today. I am going
to read a sample of a think aloud about making coffee. Please listen and let me know if
you have any questions.
Sample Think Aloud
“I’m ready for breakfast – first gotta make coffee
Let's see. I open the top of the coffee pot.
... hmm, there's still the coffee grounds in here from yesterday, so let's throw those
away...
I am removing the grounds and throwing them away in the trash
Alright, let’s get the filters
I am opening the cabinet and taking out a filter
I'll just put that into there
I am putting the filter in the tray
Now let's get the coffee
I remove the coffee jar from the freezer and place on counter, and unscrew the lid

151

OK, I'll just put some coffee in the filter. I scoop coffee into filter
Crap! I just spilled grounds on counter.
Now, we need some water
Where did I put the pot? I look around for the coffee pot.
I am checking drying tray near sink
Not there. I am opening the dishwasher
There it is! It must’ve been done earlier
Let's fill this up
I am filling the pot to the ten-cup mark
OK, now I have to put the water into the reservoir
I am pouring water from the pot into coffee maker, and oops, I just spilled some on
counter
I am putting the pot into the coffee maker
I am closing the lid down on the machine
Ok. I am pushing the button to turn it on.”
Now you try. Tell me all about your breakfast this morning. (Participant will do a
think aloud about their breakfast.)
“Do you have any questions about the think aloud process we’ve just practiced?
We are now going to begin. “Please put your phone on speaker mode and place it on
your work table next to your computer.”
“OK. Let’s start. For this session, please tell me the name of your course and the topic or
assignment that has been assigned to you. (Start 30 minute timer.)

152

You are now going to think aloud and tell me all the steps you take as you begin to search
for information for your assignment. Remember, I cannot answer any questions. I am
only permitted to remind you to speak if there is a long pause.”
“Time is now up. You may stop the think aloud. I want to thank you very much for your
participation in this study. I really appreciate your contribution. Thanks again. Bye.
