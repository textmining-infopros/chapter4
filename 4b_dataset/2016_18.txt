ABSTRACT

Stratton, James A. Ph.D., Purdue University, August 2016. An Analysis of the Current Strength
of the Academic Relationship with the Aerospace Industry. Major Professor: Richard Mark
French

The objective of this research was to discover which methods of technology transfer were
most commonly accessed within the Indiana manufacturing sector in an effort to best serve
companies in the Hoosier State. Previous work has explored the perceived importance of various
academic sources, but there has not been an investigation to identify the specific preferences of
industry professionals. If these preferences can be identified, university assistance programs and
other academic engagement programs will be able to predict, and hopefully influence how to
grow and develop the domestic manufacturing sector, ultimately strengthening the channels of
knowledge transfer between academia and industry. In order to properly assess the current
preferred methods of technology transfer and the industrial interaction with academia, a survey
was conducted with a highly technical company to establish the magnitude of the dependence
industry has on academia, as well as the magnitude of any partnerships that may exist. A five (5)
question survey was disseminated to R&D and engineering personnel at the Rolls-Royce facility
in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rolls-Royce was chosen as the focal point for this study due to their
large employment population, R&D capabilities, and the breadth of their manufacturing abilities.
The data obtained from the survey found that online encyclopedias are the most preferred source
of technical information among the participants. The results of this study were then used to infer
possible solutions to the shortcomings of the status quo, and to suggest what changes could be
made to strengthen the academic partnerships that most positively impact industry.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
This chapter establishes the scope and direction of the research conducted for this
dissertation. It also provides the basis for the research questions and the significance of the
research contained within. A list of assumptions, limitations, and delimitations is also provided.
1.1 Background
The Technical Assistance Program (TAP) at Purdue University is a state funded program
that provides technical assistance to any company with a physical facility located within the state
of Indiana. The goal of TAP is to stimulate and foster industrial growth by engaging university
faculty and students with the private sector through consulting activities. As a graduate student, I
was employed through TAP as a graduate research assistant for seven years during the course of
my studies. In my experience, the companies with which I consulted rarely interacted with
academia for technology transfer and knowledge adoption purposes. Activities, ranging from
simply accessing academic journal articles to engaging in fully developed research partnerships
were rarely observed during my travels. This observed lack of industrial participation in
academic resources led me to believe that this limited level of knowledge transfer could perhaps
be more pervasive among a wider range of industries.
It is my hypothesis that companies, of any size or level of technical complexity, do not
fully utilize the resources produced by academia. This hypothesized lack of information transfer
between the two entities is troublesome, primarily due to the fact that industrial research being
performed in academia is intended to supplement, and bolster the U.S. manufacturing sector
through the dissemination of technological breakthroughs. If the information is trickling towards

2
industry, then by which methods is the transfer occurring? What channels of technology and
knowledge acquisition are professionals using to innovate and develop new technology? It is
important to seek the answers to these questions to improve the effectiveness of technology and
knowledge transfer between academia and industry.
From a narrower perspective, it is important to gauge not only how companies are growing,
but also how companies are accessing the innovative technologies developed within academia. It
was determined that the most effective way to approach this problem was to examine the
academic relationship of a highly technical manufacturing firm. As per the criteria established in
Chapter 2, it was deemed important to investigate a company that was highly technical, had the
capital to perform extensive in-house research and development (R&D), and had a large
employment population of engineers. After being selected as a viable candidate, Rolls-Royce
ultimately agreed to participate in this study. Their Indianapolis location designs, builds, and
tests jet engines for both commercial and defense applications. With roughly 4,000 employees,
Rolls-Royce provided an excellent synergistic opportunity to serve as a focal point for this
investigative study. The contents of this dissertation will establish the framework by which this
hypothesis was examined, as well as develop a basis to further study the strength of the active
engagement between industry and academia.
1.2 Research Questions
The specific questions to be answered by this research are as follows:
1. What are the most influential academic channels for the dissemination of knowledge
within the aerospace manufacturing sector of industry?
2. What academic channels are professionals in the aerospace industry most likely to
employ while researching an unknown topic?
3. What, if any, barriers exist to accessing academic resources in a non-academic setting?

3
Academic channels being evaluated are as follows (in no particular order):


Recent Graduates



Current/Retired Faculty



University Partnership



Assistance Programs



Trade Shows/Conferences



Industrial Journals/Periodicals



Peer-Reviewed Academic Journals/Periodicals



Review articles



Online encyclopedias
1.3 Significance

By determining the most effective method for a company to be exposed to new
technological resources, we will be able to influence and exploit academic opportunities that were
once lost. Not only will this research be of substantial interest to industry due to the bolstering
nature of a symbiotic relationship with academia, but it can also guide academia to serve a more
fulfilling civic mission. Being that the proposed mission of academia is to foster societal growth
through innovation, it is important to uncover and gauge the primary modes of dissemination.
Until now, previous studies have only examined the importance of academic resources in
industry, rather than the actual usage of academic resources. Moreover, much of this previous
work was completed before the internet was considered a prominent and relevant source of
academic information. This work will provide much needed modern insight into the current
usage rates of academic sources that could potentially alter the methods by which academicians
disseminate information; methods of which have remained largely unchanged in an increasingly
dynamic academic environment.

4
1.4 Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this research was to investigate and strengthen the connection between
industry and academia by evaluating industry professionals to determine the methods by which
they access academic resources in a highly technical manufacturing environment. Through this
research, I hoped to not only determine which conduits for knowledge exist, but also what
conduits for knowledge were broken. By asking participants in this study to evaluate the extent
of their current usage of academic resources, I was able to gauge how well the current system of
dissemination is operating.
A hypothetical scenario was also presented, in which participants are asked to determine
their likelihood of choosing various academic resources for their employment duties. The
combination of these two questions should offer a glimpse at the strength of the current
relationship between academia and the aerospace industry, as well as offer insight on where
improvements can be made.
1.5 Assumptions
A list of assumptions is as follows:
1. There was a need to strengthen the relationship between academia and industry.
2. Peer-reviewed academic journals are the most common form of technology transfer
between industry and academia (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008)
3. Participants in this study were honest and truthful about their usage of academic and nonacademic resources
4. Participants were not influenced by predisposed notions of proper research methods.
5. Participants were actively involved in research and development (R&D) or engineering
roles for Rolls-Royce.

5
6. Participants were able to complete the survey in a complete, thoughtful fashion.
7. The sample size of the participants involved was large enough to draw meaningful
conclusions from the data.
1.6 Limitations
A list of limitations is as follows:
1. The study was restricted to Rolls-Royce and the divisions contained within.
2. The study was limited by the number of voluntary participants in the survey.
3. The study was limited by the number of R&D and engineering employees at RollsRoyce.
1.7 Delimitations
A list of delimitations is as follows:
1. Participants of this study were employees of Rolls-Royce.
2. Participants were employed in engineering and R&D departments at Rolls-Royce.
3. Personal contact for follow-up questions with participants will be prohibited for
anonymity concerns.
4. The list of academic resources presented to participants was not exhaustive.
5. A time period of one semester for data collection.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
This section will provide a review of the literature as it pertains to the dissemination of
technical knowledge to industry. Topics included will establish the historical aspects related to
academia, technology diffusion and significant legislative hurdles, as well as literature pertaining
to the current state of the field and potential gaps in the knowledge base of which this study
intends to fill.
2.1 Brief History of Academia
The primary objective of higher education, historically speaking, has been to promote the
widespread dissemination of knowledge. The word “university” was derived from the Latin
phrase, universitas magistrorum et scholarium, meaning simply: a collection of teachers and
scholars (Encyclopedia Brittanica, 1911). This fact has remained largely unchanged since the
inception of the university. The purpose of the university, however, has changed drastically.
What once was a communal philosophical think-tank has evolved into a corporate research
machine (Berbegal-Mirabent, Garcia, & Ribeiro-Soriano, 2015; Klofsten & Jones-Evans, 2000).
The evolution began in the late 1700s as universities turned to government sources for funding
just prior to the industrial revolution. This transition occurred largely over battles of the ego, by
which one university would claim prestige over another by claiming that their research warranted
government attention (David, 2004). As government sponsored research became mainstream, the
new policies now meant that the public needed return on their investment, mainly through the
form of economic improvement (Salter & Martin, 2001; Geuna, 2001). The fruits of this
evolution became what we now know as the university-industry partnership. Both the academic

9
community and industry alike rely on the research and breakthroughs produced in the academic
environment to push the world forward and provide that ever-needed economic boost (Van
Dierdonck, Debackere, & Engelen, 1990). While this was not necessarily a devolution of the
university mission, it was important that this connection to industry was nourished and exploited;
otherwise, the industrial economic implications can far outweigh the benefits gained from
academic research. According to the National Science Foundation, Purdue University, alone,
spent a combined 600 million dollars in 2014 on R&D (Academic Institution Profiles: Purdue
University, 2015). How do we ensure that this money is being invested wisely? We need to
ensure that the information developed with these funds is both accessible and beneficial to the
U.S. manufacturing sector. As of 2013, the total spent on R&D by U.S. educational institutions
topped 67 billion dollars, with roughly 13 percent of that coming from private industry (Britt,
2015). How does this investment trickle towards industry? What are the most influential
channels of dissemination for the academic-industrial relationship? The following sections of this
chapter will aim to uncover answers to these questions.
2.2 Diffusion of Innovations
To understand the dissemination of knowledge from academia to industry, it will be
imperative to uncover the underlying hurdles that exist with technology adoption in general. The
most logical place to begin this exploration is with Everett Rogers, an American scholar and
sociologist, who studied how technological innovations pertain to the social aspects of society.
His work, Diffusion of Innovations, is arguably the most important piece of literature when
discussing methods of technology adoption and the social barriers associated with adopting new
technologies. The reason his work was so monumental to the field was due to the fact that no one
had associated technology, diffusion, and the social aspects that tie it all together as a single
concise theory. This section will break down the three main components of the “diffusion of

10
innovation” theory: diffusion, change agents, and innovation. Also discussed will be Roger’s
theory of adopters.
2.2.1 Diffusion
The formal study of diffusion originated in the late 19th century, by a French sociologist
named Gabriel Tarde. During the course of his studies of social behavior, namely crowd
psychology, Tarde noticed that individuals within the crowd, or group, had a tendency to form
independent ideas which ultimately diffused to the rest of the group. This was contrary to the
current beliefs that change within crowds or groups happened simultaneously. His new theory
stated that many of these diffusions of knowledge were largely centered around technological
advances, or inventions, and appeared to be the underlying foundation of social change
(Kinnunen, 1996). Moreover, this theory stated that social interaction, on a macro scale, was the
driving force behind innovation, and that the interaction between members of a society bred
technological novelty. Tarde referred to this as the “law of imitation”, after which he named his
most notable work, published in 1890. Tarde stated that innovations likely spread through
imitation, or repetition, by members of a society observing the technological advantages of a
certain innovation. In the most primitive of examples, Tarde analyzes the domestication of
livestock for purposes other than food, namely horses. The realization that horses could be used
as a tool, or method of transportation, came long after their initial purpose as a source of
sustenance, and the diffusion of this technological breakthrough likely came from observation, or
imitation, of the horse being used as a utility (Tarde, 1903). Tarde argues than many other forms
of livestock domestication, as well as cultivars, can be attributed to imitation sparked by
“accidental” innovations.
However, this is where Tarde garnered criticism from both sociologists and anthologists
alike. How could two seemingly isolated societies come to the same logical conclusions despite

11
having never met? The opponents argued that these were merely coincidences, and that the
geographical distances between isolated civilizations could easily debunk his theory. Tarde
countered this with the notion that his opponents were assuming that time was irrelevant, when in
reality there existed a real possibility that the diffusion of these “coincidences” was the result of a
“gradual prolonged” imitation and that the “immense duration of prehistoric times” must be
considered (Tarde, 1903). For example, Tarde’s theory of imitation could be used to explain the
relationship between two civilizations that used flint to start fire, much the same way Darwin’s
theory of evolution could be used to explain the relationship between two remote species of
flightless birds. While both are separated by inconceivable distances, and time, their relationship
can be explained through a single common ancestral factor. In other words, diffusion, while
dependent on imitation, may not be as direct and instantaneous as previously thought, but was
nonetheless diffusion.
Everett Rogers expanded on Tarde’s work in the mid-20th century by studying the rate of
diffusion with respect to how quickly individuals adopt an innovation; and by empirically
confirming Tarde’s theories. Like Tarde, Rogers was a sociologist by trade who studied
technology adoption in rural communities. Born and raised in Iowa, Rogers was deeply rooted in
the agricultural community and noticed that innovations of any magnitude had a profound effect
on the day-to-day lives of people within the farming community. However, contrary to the
supposed benefits of these innovations, the diffusion of new and emerging technologies moved
rather slowly. One particular case study, performed by Bryce Ryan and Neal Gross (1943),
focused on the diffusion of hybrid seed corn between two rural communities in Iowa. Ryan and
Gross studied the adoption rates and diffusion methods of this new technology using data
spanning roughly 15 years. Their results, in accordance with Tarde’s theory, found that the main
mode of diffusion was realized through direct communication, and observation, between farmers
(Ryan & Gross, 1943). In the beginning, many farmers were skeptical of implementing hybrid

12
seed corn, fearing that such a drastic change in practices would be detrimental to their yield,
possibly harming their livelihood. However, a select few decided that the proposed benefits
might be worth the risk. Year after year, as word spread between farmers, new farmers gradually
began to adopt the hybrid seed varieties until the vast majority of farmers in the area had fully
adopted hybrid seed corn over the traditional strains. While not expressly stated by Ryan and
Gross, this theory of adoption was expanded upon, and ultimately became the basis for Rogers
work. Rogers studied the rate of adoption in relation to individuals’ willingness to assume the
risk, and assigned adopters into five categories: Innovators, early adopters, early majority, late
majority, and laggards (Rogers, 1983). He found that, contrary to his opponents’ beliefs, the rate
of adoption was independent of profitability, and rather based on a social construct of perceived
economic benefit (Havens & Rogers, 1961). In other words, the innovation required more than
just the upfront profitability in order to diffuse through a group. The perception of profitability
was just another cog in the social constructs of the theory of diffusion. Regardless of
profitability, farmers still adopted the innovation in a systematic fashion, adhering to the
categories of adopters. Definitions of these categories, as described by Gallaher and Wentling
(2004), can be found in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1
Descriptions of adopter categories proposed by Rogers (Gallaher & Wentling, 2004).
Adopter Category
Description
Innovators
Innovators are very eager to try new ideas. There are three primary
prerequisites for being an innovator: (a) control of substantial
financial resources to off-set the cost of unprofitable innovations,
(b) the ability to understand and use complex technical knowledge,
and (c) the ability to handle the high level of uncertainty about an
innovation when the innovator adopts. The innovator plays a
significant role in the diffusion process by introducing the idea or
technology to the social system.
Early Adopters

Early adopters are a more integrated faction of the local social
system than innovators. Early adopters are exceedingly ahead of the
average individual in innovativeness. Because of this, the early
adopter is respected by peers and viewed as a role model in the
social system. Prospective adopters seek out early adopters for
information and advice about an innovation.

Early Majority

The early majority adopt a new idea right before the typical member
of a social system. A lengthy period of deliberation may occur
before the early majority adopts an innovation. Consequently, the
innovation-decision period is relatively longer than that of the
innovator and the early adopter. The early majority make up
approximately one-third of the members of a social system.

Late Majority

The late majority adopts an innovation shortly after the average
member of a social system. Like the early majority, the late
majority make up one-third of the members of a social system.
Individuals that fit this category often adopt because of economic
necessity and mounting network pressure from peers. The
innovation must become part of the system norms before this group
will consider adoption.

Laggards

Laggards are the last few in a social system to adopt an innovation.
The only point of reference for the laggard is the past. Decisions are
based on the history of what has been done previously, they rarely
have any opinion leadership and many are near isolates in social
networks. When laggards finally adopt an innovation it has often
been displaced by a new idea that is already being used by
innovators.

In addition to these basic definitions of adopter categories, Rogers also proposed that the
rate of adoption resembled a bell-curve. According to this framework, the innovators are
represented as the first 2.5% of the population to indulge in an innovation. This is determined by

14
subtracting 2 standard deviations from the mean. The early adopters are calculated as being
13.5% of the target population and can be calculated as being between 1 and 2 standard
deviations off of the mean. The early and late majorities, which individually represent 34% of the
population, are calculated as the mean plus or minus 1 standard deviation. The laggards, which
make up the remaining 16% of the population, can be calculated as 1 standard deviation above
the mean or greater. Although the categories are not symmetrical, Rogers felt the distinction
between innovators and the early adopters was crucial, and therefore cumulatively represent the
same portion of the population as laggards. An illustration of this framework can be seen in
Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1: Illustration of the adopter categories as a proportion of market share, as proposed by
Everett Rogers (Diffusion of Ideas, 2012).
2.2.2 Change Agents
For any new technology to be adopted, there needs to exist the change agent. The change
agent is the entity that presents an innovation and can be a person, company, or in the case of this
research, an academic institution. According to Rogers, there would not be a need for such a

15
change agent if not for the barrier between the social and technological constructs of society
(Rogers, 1983). The social norm, or status quo, handles slow evolutional changes much better
than rapid revolutionary changes. Change agents challenge the status quo with innovations,
discussed in the next section, which are typically deployed at a much faster rate than they system
can handle, and therefore, are often faced with initial rejection and hesitation (Johnson, Gatz, &
Hicks, 1997). This requires the change agent to distance itself from its own social construct, and
either reinforce or recruit others to take initiative to adopt the innovation (Battilana & Casciaro,
2012). In the case of an individual acting as the change agent, this can mean abandoning one’s
personal social circle, which in itself can be a daunting task. When an institution acts as the
change agent, the issue lies more with creating the social constructs that allow for the acceptance
of an innovation. Using academia as an example, this could include the publication of research in
an attempt to gain traction for a given innovation (Gogan, Belanger, Patriarca, & O'Neill, 2010).
While there may still exist some interpersonal and political hurdles within an institution, the
academic environment was created by, and fostered with, the innovative mindset (Rusaw, 1998;
Comin & Mestieri, 2014). Therefore, with academia as the change agent, the task of technology
adoption requires macroscale social changes, whether they are economic, political, religious, or
scientific in nature (Godin, 2015; Johnson, Gatz, & Hicks, 1997).
2.2.3 Innovation
Innovation, as defined by Rogers (pg. 11) is “an idea, practice, or object that is perceived
as new by an individual or other unit of adoption”. Innovation is generally perceived as a positive
influence. However, this has not always been the case. Prior to the 18th century, innovation
carried a much more ominous meaning. While the definition was not entirely different than it is
today, the connotations meant significant disruptions to the powers that be, which at the time
were primarily the church and the government; arguably one and the same entity (Godin, 2015).

16
As with today, innovation typically arrived in the form of scientific, technological, and social
advances, all of which were the primary nemesis of the church, and in turn, the social hierarchy of
the government. Many associated the term innovation with revolution, which was perceived
result of change, or at least rapid change. These innovations violated the core teachings of the
church; fundamentals that had been created over centuries. As a result, society was much more
comfortable with slow changes, as these typically allowed for the church to adapt. This obstinate
social mindset was evident with the persecution of scientists, namely Galileo Galilei, who were
the outspoken change agents of the era (Robinson, 2010). Although accepted over time, many of
Galileo’s postulations were in direct conflict with the current knowledge base and teachings of
the church. In fact, the sentiment was so pervasive that this vilification of innovation would
continue for centuries.
It was not until the industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that
innovation was finally viewed in a positive light. This was the result of two factors. The first
being that society had begun to notice the prosperity, and utility, that emerged from scientific,
technological, and societal innovations. Although unknown at the time, this social change
reinforced the theories of imitation and diffusion proposed by Tarde and Rogers. Secondly, the
church, which was accustomed to slow evolutionary changes, had begun to adapt to the everchanging environment. Change had become so pervasive in everyday life that even the church
had begun to notice, as well as accept, the benefits and applications of innovation (Godin, 2015).
As society evolved, so did innovation. Technological advances in both academia and industry
fueled the industrial revolution, dropping the stigma once associated with innovation; yet, there
arose new barriers between academia and industry became in the form of intellectual property and
funding. These hurdles will be discussed in Section 2.3.

17
2.3 Notable Changes in Legislation
Globally speaking, prior to the 1980s the academic setting had primarily been a place for
training and educating the general populous. With the exception of the United States, largely due
to the scale of our educational system, global academic environments shied away from
collaborative research with industry due to concerns over the ownership of intellectual property
(Mowery & Sampat, 2004; Welsh, Glenna, Lacy, & Biscotti, 2008). Over the years, industry
slowly pushed their R&D duties towards academia for both access to resources and to save costs
associated with performing R&D in-house (Markman, Siegel, & Wright, 2008). Academia is the
breeding ground for basic research, and for all intents and purposes, the source of many
technological innovations (McMillan, Narin, & Deeds, 2000; Lin & Bozeman, 2006). It would
only make sense that industry would eventually capitalize on this resource. However,
determining ownership of these innovations needed to be addressed.
Due to the already established relationship between academia and industry, the United
States pioneered the movement for implementing national policies regarding the ownership of
intellectual property created by academic institutions for the private sector. By the mid-20th
century, the U.S. private sector had begun to transfer in-house research duties to academia
(Markman, Siegel, & Wright, 2008). While this switch in was great for the industrial bottomline, it did not fully account for the ownership of intellectual property. Before 1980, partnering a
university with a private company was difficult to accomplish. Patent laws ensured that the rights
to intellectual property created during the course of academic research was owned and maintained
by the financier of the research, which, in most cases was the United States Government
(Levenson, 2005). Additionally, these IP rights maintained by the U.S. Government were rarely
utilized, with roughly 5% actually being commercialized (Schacht, 2012).

18
Moreover, federal laboratories were also struggling to disseminate their research among
the private sector due to legalities concerning confidentiality, licensing, and commercialization
(Dorf & Worthington, 1987). Even though the research efforts at national laboratories had
peaked after World War II, during the height of the Cold War, the technologies that were being
created in these laboratories were not being commercialized (Lee, 1996). While the technologies
being created were most certainly groundbreaking, they rarely survived to fruition, let alone
commercialization. This was largely due to the fact that the national laboratories were not
intended to function as commercial entities, but rather as applied research institutions to develop
the technological foundations for classified government applications, often militaristic in nature.
Contrarily, industry specialized in commercialization, but not applied research, therefore lacked
the resources to conduct the necessary R&D to simultaneously develop similar innovations. The
barrier was that industry needed various aspects of these confidential technologies, which often
had non-military applications, but no mechanism existed to properly transfer ownership.
The first step towards bridging this gap came in October of 1980, in the form of the
Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. Named after Senator Adlai Stevenson III
(Illinois) and Congressman John Wydler (New York), the Stevenson-Wydler act required that
national laboratories must incorporate, into their budget, a way to transfer knowledge to the
private sector (Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, 1980). It was observed
that certain processes and products created for mission critical military applications might have
some relevance in the civilian market, but there did not exist a method to commercialize these
technologies. The Stevenson-Wydler Act ensured that these laboratories had an option, and the
funds, to properly transfer technology. The act also created the Office of Research and
Technology Applications, designed to serve as a fully staffed office dedicated to technology
transfer initiatives on a national scale.

19
Shortly after the enactment of the Stevenson-Wydler Act, congress passed the Bayh-Dole
act on December 12th, 1980; a bill sponsored by Senators Birch Bayh (Indiana) and Bob Dole
(Kansas). The bill essentially opened the ownership of intellectual property created using federal
funds to the university or company participating in its development. Not only did this protect the
intellectual property created during the research, but it also provided protection for confidential
projects, allowing companies to more freely engage with academia (Bayh-Dole Act, 1980). Now
industry could collaborate with academia without the fear of losing their intellectual property.
With these two monumental bills, there now existed two new pathways for the dissemination of
knowledge to industry: National Laboratories  Industry and Academia  Industry.
By the early 1980’s, it had begun to appear that the Bayh-Dole act had opened a
relationship between two seemingly incompatible entities. However, there was still much
skepticism, especially within academia, regarding the intentions of the research being performed
for industry. As mentioned earlier, the primary objective of academia is the pursuit of
knowledge: This is undeniable. But, industry relies heavily on the “bottom line” and might not be
motivated by the same pure intentions as academicians (Abelson, 1982). To further exemplify
this disparity, researchers in academia might be solely focused on the scientific method, with no
regard for a meaningful timeline, whereas their industrial partners are focused primarily on the
profits and expeditiousness of the products being developed by academic R&D (Hall & Scott,
2001). Neither views are fundamentally wrong; they just originate from a differing set of values
(Van Dierdonck, Debackere, & Engelen, 1990). As a result, there began to emerge a commercial
sector within academia, with the onset of faculty titles such as “associate dean for industry
relations” and technology transfer offices (TTO) (Andreopoulos, 2000; Van Dierdonck,
Debackere, & Engelen, 1990). These academic liaisons, and specialized offices, are employed to
interact with the private sector and develop industrial relationships for collaborative research.
While the original intentions were to foster widespread collaboration, they often resulted in

20
focused projects, where particular faculty members were performing specific research for their
industrial counterparts (Blumenthal, Campbell, Causino, & Louis, 1996). Although this
framework was not indicative of a widespread institutional symbiotic relationship, it has become
something transformative for both parties. Even though the projects are more specific, there has
been an increase in faculty participation with industry partners (Blumenthal, Campbell, Causino,
& Louis, 1996). In fact, a study conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado –
Boulder, found that of the 50 U.S. Universities that receive the most U.S. National Institute of
Health (NIH) funding, over 50 percent indicated substantial relationships with industry (WatsonCapps & Cech, 2014). Additionally, they found that many universities have moved away from
off-campus research parks, and have begun bringing industrial partners directly to dedicated
spaces on campus. In 2012, roughly 5,000 patents were granted to U.S. academic institutions by
the United States and Trademarks Office, a substantial increase over the mere 1,500 awarded in
1992 (National Science Foundation, 2015). This relationship with industry can be a great benefit
to the students through increased opportunities for internships, experience with research practices
and ultimately employment prospects (Lee, 2000). Additionally, it forms a bond of trust and coinhabitance for the university and the industry involved (Watson-Capps & Cech, 2014).
In Europe, similar shifts in academic R&D had been occurring (Geuna, 2001). The wake
of World War II had created a surge in academic enrollment, as well as an increase in the number
of firms seeking academic assistance for R&D activities. However, the laws pertaining to
intellectual property, especially if created in an academic setting, varied greatly between nations.
“Professor’s privilege”, as it is known in many countries, allows the professor associated with
innovative publicly funded research to maintain the rights to that research (Smith, Dahlstrand, &
Baines, 2013; Geuna & Rossi, 2011). In fact, in many cases, even the university forfeits their
rights to intellectual property in favor of the professor. Historically speaking, German-speaking
and Scandinavian countries had adopted the professor’s privilege approach (Geuna & Rossi,

21
2011). Many opponents have criticized the professor’s privilege as a biased policy, since private
sector IP laws differ in that ownership is maintained by the parent company, not the individual
who created the IP. Meanwhile, other countries have adopted policies similar to the United
States, where the ownership lies with the institution or organization that participates in the
creation of intellectual property. Additionally, in the United Kingdom, the policies on intellectual
property differ from institution to institution. While this does allow for greater competition
between universities, the ambiguity of IP ownership legislation may be damaging the industrialacademic relationship (D'Este & Patel, 2007). In some restrictive scenarios, studies have shown
that faculty would rather work independently of their institution than forfeit IP ownership,
ultimately neglecting their employment duties (Breschi, Lissoni, & Montobbio, 2007; Murray &
Stern, 2007). The validity of these concerns, as they pertain to this research, will be discussed in
Section 2.6.1.1. Regardless of legislative framework, Europe as a whole is slowly moving away
from archaic policies that protect the “professor’s privilege” in favor of policies that more closely
reflect the Bayh-Dole act.
According to researchers in Taiwan, the rapid pace of research in technological fields had
also forced Taiwanese universities to act as the change agent. Again, this shift from industrial to
academic R&D was largely due to the rising costs of private research (Lai, 2011). Lai’s research
findings show that nearly 70 percent of Ph.D. researchers in Taiwan work in Universities, mainly
due to the fact that government grants and funding for advanced research are often funneled
towards academia, as opposed to industry, with the hopes that the technology transfer will
eventually disseminate the findings to all players in a given industry, rather than just a single
entity. Likewise, researchers in Korea also found that private corporations were exceedingly
focused on using the universities as R&D centers for technological innovations (Kim & Normile,
1997). While beneficial for industry, Kim and Normile (1997) found that this shift in funding
sources was actually a source of friction among the academic community. A 1992 Korean law

22
gave funding priority to research projects that entailed collaboration with industry (Kim &
Normile, 1997). As a result, the funding for basic research began to stagnate. This became a
major source of contention for academics that felt that the purpose of the university was to fund
basic research, not applied research in collaboration with industry. However, the Korean private
sector saw the value of applied research and the benefits it could have on their growth and longterm success. The flow of new knowledge was much more direct; therefore the dissemination of
technology was expedited on a national scale.
These international trends show that during the last few decades of the 20th century, there
was a massive shift in not only the type of research being performed in academia, but also how
this research was being funded and credited. Various forms of legislation have bolstered the
industry-academia connection by creating smoother transitions for knowledge transfer between
the two entities. Now that these pathways exist, it will be important to study impacts of each
specific channel to determine the most efficient medium by which information transfers.
2.4 Technology Transfer vs. Technology Diffusion
In order to gauge the flow of knowledge from academia to industry, there needs to be
some insight into the interpretation and definitions of the terms technology transfer, and
technology diffusion. Many use the terms interchangeably, and apply them to a myriad of
concepts (Stewart, 1987). Liu, et. al. (2010), state that technology transfer refers to the macrosense of the adoption process, and are deliberate in nature, while technology diffusion refers to
the unintended side-effects of technology adoption (Liu, Fang, Shi, & Guo, 2010; Stewart, 1987).
For example, technology diffusion would be applicable to a product hitting the market, and
selling to the general public, whereas technology transfer would be the widespread dissemination
of the knowledge required to reproduce that product. This is further reinforced in Everett Roger’s
work, where he states that diffusion, unlike transfer, requires the cultural and social aspects of

23
society, in the form of adopters, conform to a new technology in order for the widespread
adoption of said technology to exist (Rogers, 1983). Rose and Joskow (1990) state that diffusion
is dependent on economic factors. For example, larger companies, or individuals who are
wealthy, will often be the first to adopt new technology for the simple fact that there is a greater
chance for expendable capital. Once a smaller competitor observes the benefits of the adoption,
their conformity with the new technology is inevitable, implying that the diffusion, or local
effects, are also greatly influenced by economic factors (Rose & Joskow, 1990). While this
relationship is not surprising, it should be duly noted since this research aimed to study R&D
professionals at a major aerospace firm: Rolls-Royce. Furthermore, the purpose of this study was
to gauge the strength of technology transfer by gauging the industrial-academic relationship. To
accomplish this, I will be examining which academic resources are most commonly used within
such a highly technical firm.
2.5 Types of Academic Resources
Being that the ultimate goal of this research was to gauge the relationship between
academia and industry, it was imperative that this literature review dissect, and investigate the
academic resources that are available to industry, which have been summarized into three broad
categories: people, programs and events, and literature.
2.5.1 People
Interpersonal relationships can be a tremendous source of information. One suspected
influential connection between academia and industry exists between former professors or recent
graduates and members of the work force (Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002). This relationship is
typically referred to as “academic engagement.” This channel has the potential to provide a more
direct source of information, where the person in industry would contact a member of the faculty
or recent graduate for information regarding a new technology or technique. According to

24
Rogers (2003), social learning can be a driving factor in technology diffusion. Social learning
theory states that humans learn and transfer knowledge quite effectively through interpersonal
relationships (Bandura, 1971). With respect to this research, this would include any direct
contact between employees of Rolls-Royce and people associated with an academic institution.
These personal relationships come in two forms: informal and formal (Bonaccorsi & Piccaluga,
1994). Informal relationships are those which occur outside of any formal written agreement.
This could include the direct communication (email, phone call, social media, etc.) or face-to-face
meetings between employees of Rolls-Royce and current/former faculty, students, or colleagues
(Bekkers & Freitas, 2008; Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002; Smith, Gopalakrishna, & Smith,
2004). Research shows that informal contacts often have the highest degree of potential
knowledge transfer between academia and industry (Meyer-Krahmer & Schmoch, 1998;
Ponomariov & Boardman, 2008). Formal relationships, in a similar fashion to informal
relationships, typically consist of direct communication or face-to-face meetings, but with a
formal written agreement between the two parties. This could include cooperative research,
consultancy, and the exchange of personnel (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008; Bonaccorsi & Piccaluga,
1994; D'Este & Patel, 2007). Often, due to the value of informal contacts, formal agreements are
often made between the private sector and academicians in an effort to secure the flow of
knowledge (Bozeman & Gaughan, 2007; Amara, Landry, & Halilem, 2013). Due to the
importance of these personal relationships, it is imperative that they are included in this study.
2.5.2 Programs and Events
This category is rather broad, but in the context of this research, programs refer to any
academic partnerships or assistance programs offered by, or employed in cooperation with an
industry counterpart, whereas events refer to an industry-specific trade show or exhibition.

25
Partnership and assistance programs are a great resource for the private sector. The most
common reasons for partnership were compiled by Lee (2000). This list concisely summarizes
the industrial benefits of partnering with a university.


To solve specific technical or design problems



To develop new products and processes



To conduct research leading to new patents



To improve product quality



To reorient R&D agenda



To have access to new research (via seminars and workshops)



To maintain an ongoing relationship and network with the university



To conduct “blue sky” research with no specific application in mind



To recruit university graduates

Utilizing either a partnership or assistance program is highly dependent on the scale and
duration of the needs at hand. Generally speaking, partnership programs are oriented towards
long-term, complex projects which require large amounts of capital and are focused primarily
towards R&D activities (Berbegal-Mirabent, Garcia, & Ribeiro-Soriano, 2015). Assistance
programs are reserved for short-term, small-scale issues that can be handled by a small team of
researchers. Research has shown that roughly 26% of faculty members participate in some
capacity with partnership programs, while 22% manage their projects through assistance
programs with consulting arrangements (Lee, 2000). Examples of these, as pertaining to Purdue
University, would be the Rolls-Royce/Purdue Research Aerospace District and the Purdue
Technical Assistance Program, respectively.
The Purdue Research Aerospace District was a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and
Purdue University established as an on-campus, long-term, aerospace R&D center (Purdue

26
University, 2015). Co-funded operations, such as this, are collaborative efforts designed to
incubate the latest aerospace technologies and companies in an active research environment. Not
only does it provide an active learning center for students and faculty, but it gives the industry
access to the latest equipment and resources, not to mention the added benefit of potential future
employees.
The Purdue Technical Assistance Program (TAP) specializes in managing compact, goalspecific projects on a short-term basis. As with many assistance programs, the client, or firm
working with the university makes little or no investment in the research being conducted.
Instead, as is the case of the Purdue Technical Assistance Program, funding is subsidized through
both the state and federal government in an effort to bolster local manufacturing operations. The
trade-off is increased economic benefit for the state. However, in addition to providing
manufacturing assistance, many assistance programs also offer training, education, and
certification courses at little or no cost to the client. Perhaps the greatest benefit of assistance
programs is the tendency for future work and engagement from the connections gained from pro
bono collaboration with industry.
Lastly, there are many events in which both industry professionals and academics can
engage and share ideas and information. Specifically, trade shows and exhibitions offer an allinclusive venue for industry professionals to view and engage with relevant industrial and
academic players to learn about emerging products and technologies in a given field. These
shows and exhibitions are often frequented by industry experts and academicians alike, creating
opportunity for technology diffusion, as well as technology transfer, due to the public nature of
the exhibition. Researchers from Sweden studied this diffusion, and ultimate transfer, using the
surge in digital signal processing (DSP) techniques in the 1990’s (Aspers & Darr, 2011). Being
that DSP was still an emerging technology, Aspers and Darr (2011) were able to study how trade-

27
shows facilitated the exposure of this innovation. They found, in accordance with their theory,
that the trade show environment provided the social interactions necessary to facilitate proper
diffusion (Aspers & Darr, 2011). Recall that, according to Rogers, social interaction is the
driving force behind the diffusion of innovation (Rogers, 1983). Trade shows and exhibitions
provide this on a much larger scale (Smith, Gopalakrishna, & Smith, 2004). While it should be
noted that these events do not offer the same frequent access as other academic resources, the
impact on the overall academic-industrial connection may be far greater but in a shorter amount
of time than other resources. For this reason, trade shows and exhibitions will be included in this
study.
2.5.3 Literature
Literature, in terms of published academic resources, is arguably the most abundant
resource produced by academia. According to the National Science Foundation (NSF), the
United States’ academic sector produced nearly three quarters of all publications related to
science and engineering in 2011, with the remaining quarter belonging to the federal government,
industry, private nonprofit organizations and local governments (National Science Foundation,
2015). Additionally, of the more than 800,000 STEM articles produced globally in 2011, roughly
one quarter were produced in the United States. Ten year trends show that the number of articles
produced increases approximately 1 percent each year. So where do we begin to determine what
literature to include in this study?
Published literature comes in many forms. In order to limit the scope of this research, it
was determined that the most likely used resources in industry would be industrial journals, peerreviewed academic journals, and review articles, which are often published in both industrial and
academic journals.

28
2.5.3.1 Peer-Reviewed Journals
Probably the most logical place to start is with the peer-reviewed academic journal. After
all, publishing in the right peer-reviewed academic journal can make, or break, an academician’s
career. The peer-review process adds a certain level of validity to a journal, or specific article, by
ensuring that professionals in the author’s field have reviewed and accepted the content of the
research as true and correct (Guerrieri, 2012). Most often, this process is conducted in doubleblind manner, meaning the author is anonymous to the reviewers, and vice-versa. However, some
single-blind reviews do exist. Another important aspect of peer-reviewed journals is their impact
factor. The impact factor is a simple calculation: divide all citations for a specific journal by the
total number of citable items in that specific journal over the course of a two year timespan. For
example, if the current year is 2016, the most recent impact factors would examine the ratio
between physical citations and possible citations for a specific journal for the years 2013 and
2014, but cited during the year 2015 (Holden, Rosenberg, Barker, & Onghena, 2006; Garfield,
1999). Since the ratio is calculated over the course of 2015, final results would not be available
until 2016, hence the delay. Developed by Eugene Garfield in the 1960’s, impact factors were
designed to rate scientific journals on their relevance to their field. Journals with higher impact
factors indicate that they are cited more often by experts in a given field, therefore that journal
must be highly relevant to that field. Some opponents argue that since impact factors only
account for the frequency of citations, not the quality of the content, that it is an unreliable metric
for judging the relevance of peer-reviewed academic journals (Holden, Rosenberg, Barker, &
Onghena, 2006; Lutz & Hans-Dieter, 2008). Furthermore, as the preferred media shifts away
from print, traditional calculations for impact factors are beginning to show some weakness.
Garfield suggests a variant of the original impact factor be applied to individual articles, as
opposed to the journal as a whole (Garfield, 2001). Regardless of individual opinion on impact

29
factor, the debate on their legitimacy does not pertain to this research; therefore this discussion
will be reserved for another study.
2.5.3.2 Industrial Journals
Industrial journals, occasionally referred to as trade journals or trade magazines, are
similar to academic journals in that they are a collection of articles that pertain to a specific area
of study. However, they differ in that they are typically geared towards a specific industry, rather
than a specific field of study. Like academic journals, there are many that employ a peer-review
process in an effort to guarantee the subjects being published, but this is not always the case.
These journals are often geared towards industry professionals, therefore they are usually written
using industrial jargon as opposed to highly scientific verbiage (Stankus, 2001). Furthermore,
authors can range from industry professionals to academicians. Perhaps the biggest benefit
offered by industrial journals is their ease of access. Many publishers offer their publications at
no cost, since most of the revenue comes from advertisements. Others, which are part of societies
or trade associations, offer their publications for free with a societal membership. Another
substantial benefit is that these resources offer industry specific information in a single concise
location. Industrial firms can keep tabs on their sector through a very small number of
publications (Stankus, 2001).
2.5.3.3 Review Articles
The last form of literature to be discussed is the review article. Review articles are often
published in both academic and industrial journals, so their inclusion compounds the literature
category. Review articles are simply literature reviews on a specific topic. Often composed by a
number of authors, the review article is a complete summation of the current body of knowledge
pertaining to the topic at hand (University of Texas - Austin). According to the University of
Texas Libraries, a proper review article will cover the following items:

30


The main people working in a field



Recent major advances and discoveries



Significant gaps in the research



Current debates



Ideas of where research might go next

Review articles are important because they serve as milestones for a specific area of research,
and serve as an unbiased entry point to new participants in the field; emphasis on unbiased
(Oxman & Guyatt, 1991). Since they are intended to act as the “current state of knowledge”, it is
imperative that bias has been removed from the authors’ stance, addressing only the necessary
information for an in-depth review (Oxman, 1994; Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). Moreover,
review articles can be useful in updating the old guard on new methods and techniques, serving as
a form of continuing education (Palermo, 2013).
Online encyclopedias, like Wikipedia, are essentially collections of unverified, crowdsourced, review articles (Konig, 2013; Guldbrandsson, 2014). Some other notable examples
might include Scholarpedia, Citizendium, and MSN Encarta. While similar in nature to websites
like Wikipedia, these examples have varying levels of content accuracy, as well as access fees,
but the overall premise is the same. Nevertheless, regardless of reputation, Wikipedia is by-far
the most popular of the options listed due to the amount of content and free access
(Guldbrandsson, 2014). Even though most of the content on Wikipedia has origins in academia,
and references are provided with each article, the content is not verified by any official peerreview panel; therefore it often is considered unreliable. The biggest success of Wikipedia has
been the number of content contributors. Since anybody can edit their articles, the amount of
unique contributors is part of the reason why Wikipedia has been so successful; content is always
refreshed (Konig, 2013). This is also a major reason why it has the reputation as an incredible

31
source. Unlike a peer-reviewed journal, anybody can alter the content; therefore each entry
cannot be screened for bias. This means that access to Wikipedia’s content requires in-depth
scrutiny of the information at hand.
2.6 Current State of the Field
As has been stated numerous times, the purpose of this research was to measure the
strength of the university-industry relationship; in particular, which academic resources have the
greatest influences on industrial professionals. In order to properly set the stage for this
argument, it is necessary to uncover current literature outlining this relationship, as well as the
predicating factors involved in fostering healthy collaboration. There appears to be a significant
gap in the literature. Much of the research thus far had been studying how direct contact with
industry enabled the flow of knowledge. This provided an important first-step to gauging how
academic resources are being used, as it established a framework by which to determine an
institution’s overall propensity for knowledge transfer. Using this baseline, we should expect
technical, engineering based industry to have a relatively strong connection with academia
through personal connections, partnership programs, and literature based resources (Bekkers &
Freitas, 2008; Shartinger, Rammer, Fischer, & Frohlich, 2002). The specifics of these key studies
are discussed in the following sections.
2.6.1 Commercialization vs. Academic Engagement
One of the most prevalent topics returned during literature searches in the field of
university-industry relationships is the debate between commercialization and academic
engagement. While both are technically forms of university-industry collaboration, they each
have unique characteristics that define their place in the academic relationship with industry.

32
2.6.1.1 Commercialization
In the context of this research, commercialization can be defined as an academic’s
incentive, or drive, to research and develop technology for the sole purpose of introducing a new
product to the market (Etzkowitz, Webster, Gebhardt, & Terra, 2000; Klofsten & Jones-Evans,
2000). This form of engagement with industry would be most synonymous with technology
diffusion, since the products being developed are being distributed directly to the consumer base.
Commercialization, as it pertains to the university-industry relationship, is fostered
entirely under an academic roof and then applied in industry, thus completing the connection
between the two entities. Typically, this process is achieved through the patenting of discovered
technologies in an academic setting. As discussed earlier, the practice of product
commercialization was largely introduced to academia through, and facilitated by, the Bayh-Dole
act of 1980. Commercialization in academia is actualized through two main channels: the results
of funded research or the collaboration with industrial partners. When evaluating both scenarios,
it can be seen that a plausible outcome of research, be it federally or privately funded, would be
the actualization of new or novel technologies worthy of patent recognition. While not a primary
goal, it is often the case that advanced academic research yields many breakthroughs that can be
exploited and commercialized, essentially making the academic setting a maturation chamber for
start-ups and academic entrepreneurs (Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008). Alternatively, collaboration
with industry can also lead to the commercialization of products, resulting in a shared patent
between the university, researcher, and private institution (Etzkowitz, Webster, Gebhardt, &
Terra, 2000). In essence, the university is acting as the R&D department for their industrial
counterpart, with the ultimate goal being shared commercialization (Berbegal-Mirabent, Garcia,
& Ribeiro-Soriano, 2015). In many cases, this type of symbiotic research is funded through nonconventional means, e.g., access to equipment or resources, which can be very beneficial for the

33
private firm. When collaborating with private industry, academics gain experience, connections,
and ultimately, albeit rarely, the opportunity for commercialization (Fabrizio & Di Minin, 2008;
Mansfield, 1995). This provides a significant advantage to the principal investigators, since the
risk of commercialization or starting a business based off of an awarded patent is divided
amongst all participating members. However, although the occurrence of a university-based
startup is rare, the survival rates are typically much higher. When compared to non-academic
start-ups, the survival rate of university-based startups is roughly 70 percent (based on data since
the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980), whereas non-academic startups survive only 10
percent of the time (Di Gregorio & Shane, 2003).
Some studies show that commercialization through the production of patents in an
academic setting has an inconsequential impact on technology transfer to industry and the overall
academic mission. (Agrawal & Henderson, 2002). In many cases, the options are simple: patent
or publish. Some argue that with a focus on monetary gain, the fundamental research in the basic
sciences become overlooked (D'Este & Patel, 2007; Breschi, Lissoni, & Montobbio, 2007).
Additionally, data has shown that faculty members who are focused on commercialization tend to
neglect their traditional academic duties (Crespi, D'Este, Fontana, & Geuna, 2011). One fear is
that if faculties merge their ideals towards commercialization, then the dissemination of
publicized research falls to the wayside (Louis, Jones, Blumenthal, & Campbell, 2001). This is
corroborated by a study conducted with 62 universities. Researchers found that 71% of
academically based inventions require long term participation on behalf of the faculty in order to
survive to commercial fruition (Toole & Czarnitzki, 2010). This prolonged attention to outside
entrepreneurship could mean less attention is devoted to basic research and teaching
responsibilities (Gulbrandsen & Smeby, 2005). Moreover, faculties might hesitate on publishing
new and relevant information for fear that the novelty of their research will be made publicly
available, thus diminishing their ability to secure a patent (Campbell, Clarridge, Gokhale, &

34
Birenbaum, 2002; Gulbrandsen & Smeby, 2005). This thought process creates a significant delay
in the dissemination of knowledge to industry and the general public since patent applications can
take years to process (Breschi, Lissoni, & Montobbio, 2007; Huang & Murray, 2009). Multiple
studies have found that entrepreneurial faculty, especially in technical scientific fields, publish
less and engage with industry on fewer occasions when pursuing patentable research; this ratio
also drops when private funds exceed two-thirds of the a universities research budget (Crespi,
D'Este, Fontana, & Geuna, 2011; Perkmann, King, & Pavelin, 2011). The connotations of this
interaction are debatable since both activities can be considered a form of engagement.
Nevertheless, the possible effects should be noted as a possible barrier to a successful universityindustry relationship through a decreased amount of publications.
2.6.1.2 Academic Engagement
Academic engagement, on the other hand, refers to the propensity of the faculty to
participate with industry from a number of fronts, one of which could be commercialization
(Perkmann, et al., 2013). With relation to technology transfer and technology diffusion, academic
engagement would be akin to technology transfer. That is, the university-industry relationship is
fostered simultaneously between two or more parties, rather than a single-sided entrepreneurial
endeavor. This would be exemplified by the dissemination of knowledge in a manner that allows
for the re-creation, or widespread understanding of an innovation as it pertains to the definition
established in Section 2.4.
Recalling the types of relationships discussed in Section 2.5.1, personal academic
engagement can be both informal and formal. According to Perkmann et al. (2013), the primary
formal engagement activities would include “collaborative research, contract research, and
consulting,” whereas the informal engagement activities would include “ad hoc advice” and
networking with industry (Bonaccorsi & Piccaluga, 1994). Specific example of formal activities

35
may include research parks, technical consulting services, and on-campus corporate sponsored
laboratories. Examples of informal activities may be as simple as contact with previous
colleagues, former students, and network connections with common research interests (D'Este &
Patel, 2007; Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002). Many universities, across the United States and
Canada allow for faculty participation with outside consulting activities, whether it be in the form
of formal or informal engagement; the theory being that these connections produce long-term
relationships with industry partners (Amara, Landry, & Halilem, 2013). These personal
relationships are the foundation of academic engagement.
Personal academic engagement activities are facilitated through specialized university
offices, briefly discussed in Section 2.4. Although the nomenclature varies, common examples
would include TTOs, offices for outreach and engagement, and the like (Van Dierdonck,
Debackere, & Engelen, 1990; Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008). At Purdue University, a specific
example would include the Office of Engagement and the Office of Technology
Commercialization. In many institutions, these offices are responsible for managing existing
university-industry partnerships, as well as developing and fostering the pathways to transfer the
knowledge created within the institution to various industrial and social partners (Perkmann, et
al., 2013). Academic engagement is considered to be the one of the most influential forms of
knowledge transfer between industry and academia (Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002). Therefore,
it is imperative that these personal relationships, and outreach entities are included in this study.
The specific association between commercialization and academic engagement will be discussed
in the following section.
2.6.1.3 The Relationship
While commercialization and academic engagement are interrelated, it is important to
evaluate the relationship that each has on the transfer of knowledge. Commercialization has been

36
coined by some as the “third-mission” of academia (Etzkowitz, Webster, Gebhardt, & Terra,
2000; Florida & Cohen, 1999; Martinelli, Meyer, & Tunzelmann, 2008). Therefore, in addition
to research and teaching, economic development would encompass the proverbial third pillar of
academia. While this academic entrepreneurial trend is being witnessed in many developed
nations, the primary focus of this literature review will focus on the impacts it has had on U.S.
universities (Rothaermel, Agung, & Jiang, 2007; D'Este & Perkmann, 2011). By incentivizing
faculty to produce intellectual property, the universities have been able to supplement research
costs through the commercialization of products discovered during these research activities, even
though the payoff is typically sporadic and unpredictable. Nonetheless, over the years there has
been an ever increasing push for economic development in academia. As discussed in the
previous section, this can be witnessed through the addition of specific academic offices related
to technology transfer, commercialization, entrepreneurship, and research development
(Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008). Without these administrative services, the opportunity for
engagement would land solely on the faculty, likely inhibiting any further engagement; the
exception being consulting services, which have been shown to be significantly self-supporting
(O'Shea, Allen, Chevalier, & Roche, 2005; Owen-Smith & Powell, 2001; Amara, Landry, &
Halilem, 2013). As a result, in accordance with the increase in commercialization-specific
offices, there has also been a sharp increase in the number of individual faculty listed on U.S.
patents over the past few decades (Azoulay, Ding, & Stuart, 2007; Markman, Gianiodis, Phan, &
Balkin, 2005). Not only do these awarded patents provide industrial outreach and engagement for
the faculty, but they provide a certain level of prestige to the university (Sine, Shane, & Di
Gregorio, 2003). Though, even given these advantages, not all faculties, across all demographics,
are participating in commercialization practices equally. In fact, some data show that the
majority of engagement is performed by a minority of academicians (D'Este & Patel, 2007).
Predictors for participation include: the individuals reputation, seniority, age, field of study, as

37
well as the institution’s reputation, resources for commercialization, and active participation in
research (Azoulay, Ding, & Stuart, 2007; Boardman, 2008; Boardman, 2009). Historically
speaking, institutions with specialized colleges in the STEM fields have the highest propensity for
producing intellectual property in the form of U.S. patents (Di Gregorio & Shane, 2003;
Martinelli, Meyer, & Tunzelmann, 2008). Land-grant institutions in particular are champions of
this endeavor due to a long relationship with the agricultural community (Welsh, Glenna, Lacy, &
Biscotti, 2008; Liu, Fang, Shi, & Guo, 2010). Furthermore, universities that emphasize
polytechnic and engineering research tend to show higher levels of knowledge transfer through
partnership programs, cooperative R&D and consulting activities than their liberal art
counterparts (Berbegal-Mirabent, Garcia, & Ribeiro-Soriano, 2015; Klofsten & Jones-Evans,
2000). While this does not come with much surprise, as a majority of patents are technically
based, it does offer some insight into the types of universities which show the greatest likelihood
of interacting with industry.
From a demographical standpoint, it was found that younger faculty members tend to
participate in commercialization, whereas the older faculty tend to engage with industry (Amara,
Landry, & Halilem, 2013; Klofsten & Jones-Evans, 2000). Though the specific reasons for this
are unclear, there have been some correlations that show that older faculty members are better
connected through professional networks and have more secure positions as a result of tenure,
therefore find it easier to connect with a wide range of industries and risk the time necessary to
foster those relationships (Haeussler & Colyvas, 2011). Although, some older faculty struggle if
they were hired as faculty before engagement was an institutional focus (Louis, Blumenthal,
Gluck, & Stoto, 1989). Contrarily, younger faculty who were trained with this entrepreneurial
mindset focus more on commercialization due to their relatively weak professional network
(Bercovitz & Feldman, 2008; D'Este & Patel, 2007). With respect to gender, it was found that
women generally contribute less to engagement with industry, although this is most likely due to

38
the fact that women represent a smaller proportion of faculty in STEM fields (Ponomariov, 2008).
Again, these trends are noted purely as a form of discourse, but should be noted nonetheless as
they help define the relationship between widespread academic engagement and the propensity
for faculty involvement.
2.6.2 Academic Resources in Industry
The most comprehensive study on this topic was performed by Bekkers and Freitas
(2008). In this study, the authors investigated various academic outputs, and their perceived
importance within R&D disciplines across four Dutch industrial sectors: pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology, chemical (excluding pharmaceuticals), electrical and telecommunications, and
machinery, both basic and fabricated (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008). These results were compared to
an identical survey disseminated to academicians in similar fields. Bekkers and Freitas (2008)
were trying to determine if industry professionals valued the same resources as academics. If
academicians value certain academic outputs that differ from the values of industry professionals,
then an important disconnect is directly apparent.
To establish a set of outputs, Bekkers and Freitas consulted the literature to determine the
most popular modes of knowledge transfer. Many sources agreed that the most important
academic outputs are academic publications and patents (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008; Narin,
Hamilton, & Olivastro, 1997; Nilsson, Rickne, & Bengtsson, 2010). Other sources deemed
important were collaborative and contract research (Meyer-Krahmer & Schmoch, 1998), and
informal contacts, such as current/former students, faculty or colleagues (Cohen, Nelson, &
Walsh, 2002; Nilsson, Rickne, & Bengtsson, 2010). It was observed, while examining the
various studies, that different industries appeared to value different sources of knowledge.
Bekkers and Freitas (2008) state that among the aerospace industry, the literature shows that
collaborative research is most valued, whereas publications, conferences and informal contacts

39
were found to be important across many specializations (Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002). Most
importantly, patents were only found be important in the pharmaceutical industry (Bekkers &
Freitas, 2008). Using this literature as a template, we were able to narrow down a short list of
resources to investigate. This list will be discussed further in Section 3.3.
The survey created by Bekkers and Freitas (2008) to gauge the importance of the various
academic resources asked two questions: (Q1) have you used this resource and (Q2) how well do
you feel it transfers knowledge? The responses were tallied to create a summary of which
academic sources were perceived to be most important. In descending order, industrial R&D
performers found the most important sources to be (1) scientific publications, (2) professional
publications, (3) patent texts, (4) personal contacts and (5) university graduates (B.S. and M.S.) as
employees. Likewise, academics found (1) scientific publications, (2) personal contacts, (3)
university graduates (Ph.D.) as employees, (4) conferences and (5) financing of Ph.D. projects to
be the most important, also in descending order. A summary of these results can be seen in Table
2.2.

It is interesting to note that the hierarchal order of the results from both academia and
industry do not match beyond the resource perceived most important. Additionally, according to

40
the raw data, the individual scores for each category were higher for all academic categories,
meaning that academicians perceive all academic resources more favorably than their industrial
equivalents. It should also be noted that the researchers did not account for any online academic
sources of information, which today may have scored much higher on the list of resources
perceived important by R&D professionals. When looking at the differences of perceived
importance, there are a few sources that drastically varied in importance between industry and
academia. The items which were ranked as having the lowest importance are summarized in
Table 2.3.

Patent text

Probably the most obvious difference is the discrepancy between the perceived
importance of patents between groups. Industry professionals ranked “patent text” as the 3rd most
important resource, while academia ranked “patent text” as the 19th most important resource. For
reference, there were 23 total resources evaluated. Bekkers and Freitas (2008) attribute this
difference to the fact that patent databases are often more accessible to industry R&D performers.
The difference in institutional goals might also explain this difference (Abelson, 1982). The

41
private sector is much more interested in commercialization, and competition, therefore might
seek competitors patents for ideas and inspiration.
Bekkers and Freitas (2008) concluded their study by stating that, in a general sense, the
sectoral categories studied did not have any significance on explaining which academic resources
were favored by each industry, therefore could not be used to explain the preferred flow of
knowledge. While there were differences between the perceived importance between industry
and academia, these differences were statistically insignificant. According to Bekkers and Freitas
(2008), for a company that relies on cutting edge research, or wished to act as an early adopter,
they should focus their efforts on obtaining information from academic publications and creating
informal contacts through university students and faculty.
2.7 Summary
Does this engagement, or collaboration with industry through commercialization, have a
significant impact on the transfer of knowledge between the two entities? How much of the
information created in academia supports industrial growth? One thing that none of the literature
has seemed to address is whether or not the information being transferred is being transferred
through an effective channel. For instance, a litany of academic resources were studied for their
perceived importance within R&D fields, both academic and industrial based, but the study did
not account for what resources are most frequently used or preferred by industry professionals
(Bekkers & Freitas, 2008; Mowery, 2004). The researchers found that both industrial
professionals and academics found peer-reviewed journals to be important, but to different
degrees. In fact, when comparing items solely based upon “high importance”, the researchers
found that industrial professionals found professional and industrial publications to be of highest
importance, while academics perceived peer-reviewed journals as the most important resource
(Bekkers & Freitas, 2008). While perceived importance does play an important role in

42
determining the most effective pathways for technology transfer, one cannot negate the fact that,
regardless of perceived importance, practical application will always persevere. For example, the
internet has been, and will continue to be, a great source for largely free information. In a world
of open access information, the peer-reviewed academic journal is slowly outdating itself (Martin
& Quiros, 2014). While academic journals may have a high perceived importance, the often
restrictive access may be a prohibitive barrier to actualization. Another example, as studied by
Cohen et al. (2002), shows that in many industries, a majority of the breakthroughs come from
within the industry or their direct supply chain, rather than originate in academia (Mowery &
Sampat, 2004). Additionally, the overall direct transfer of publicly funded research to the private
sector (with the exception of the pharmaceutical industry) was insignificant at best, and the
primary diffusion happens through third-party channels (Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002). By
conducting a study to determine actual usage rates, as well as preferred methods of gathering
information, this study aims to fill in an important gap in the technology transfer field by
determining which academic sources are most used, and most favored by industry professionals.
2.8 What Gap Needs to be Filled?
What is the most influential academic channel for the dissemination of knowledge within
the manufacturing sector of industry? What academic channels are professionals in the aerospace
industry most likely to employ while researching an unknown topic? What, if any, barriers exist
to accessing academic resources in a non-academic environment?
In accordance with the research questions, restated above, there needs to exist a gap in
the knowledge base for which these questions can answer. It is evident from the literature on this
topic that the gap exists in the context of which academic sources are most commonly accessed
by industry professionals. Over the years, legislation has changed to open the pathways of
knowledge transfer between the universities and industry. Everett Rogers defined diffusion in a

43
way that opened an entire field of study; the mechanisms of which are very well understood.
And, previous work has shown which academic resources are most valued.
The research proposed in this dissertation aims to take this one step further: regardless of
perceived value, what resources are most commonly accessed by industry professionals? Not
only does this study examine the current influence of academic sources, but it intends to study
which sources are preferred by industry professionals. This process might also uncover barriers
that prevent professionals from using preferred sources of information.

CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
Using the literature review as a foundation, Chapter 3 discusses the nuances of the
methodological approach used to survey industry professionals. The purpose of this research was
to strengthen the connection between industry and academia by evaluating industry professionals
to determine the methods by which they access academic resources in a highly technical
manufacturing environment. In order to properly accomplish this, a quantitative approach was
deemed to be the most appropriate method for analyzing the data obtained from this study.
Supplemental qualitative methods were employed for the anecdotal evidence provided by
respondents of the survey.
This chapter outlines the methods used for this study, including the selection of an
industry partner, subject determination, survey method, data collection methods and topics
pertaining to the statistical analysis. Conclusions about the aforementioned topics will end this
chapter.
3.1 Industry Selection
Rolls-Royce was chosen as the basis for this study particularly for the complexity of the
components produced at their manufacturing facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. The literature
indicates that firms of larger size, with complex products, have the highest propensity to partner
with academia (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008; Rose & Joskow, 1990; Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002;
Pavitt, 1984). These larger firms are also more likely to act as technological innovators (Rose &
Joskow, 1990). The Rolls-Royce manufacturing facility in Indianapolis employs roughly 4,000
people, and their aerospace divisions alone generated approximately 13 billion dollars in revenue

45
in 2015 (Rolls-Royce, 2015). Their Indianapolis facility designs, assembles and tests engines for
both defense and civil applications. Additionally, Rolls-Royce has a substantial international
presence with access to a multitude of technological academic resources. These qualities, as well
as being located within the geographical boundaries of Indiana, were the primary reasons for their
selection as the focus of this study.
3.1.1 Internal Permissions
The internal permissions for access to Rolls-Royce employees were facilitated through
the ProSTAR program at Purdue University. ProSTAR is a non-traditional degree program that
partners with industry with a mission to educate full-time members of the workforce. The
program was piloted through a partnership with Rolls-Royce and has grown to encompass a
number of private sector participants. Once it was determined that Rolls-Royce would be the
focus of this study, existing partnerships between Rolls-Royce and Purdue helped to facilitate the
deployment of this study. It was determined, through internal channels, that the Rolls-Royce
Library & Resource Knowledge Center would provide the best opportunity for the successful
implementation of this study. The contacts at Rolls-Royce largely participated in, and facilitated,
the successful internal transmission of the survey instrument to qualified Rolls-Royce personnel.
3.1.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval
In order to survey employees at Rolls-Royce, the research methodology needed to be
cleared by the institutional review board (IRB) to ensure that no physical and psychological harm
would come to the participants. The IRB determines whether or not researchers will be granted
access to work with human subjects by reviewing the survey instrument itself, method of
instrument dissemination, methods for the collection of personal data, and the amount of contact
time with participants. For this project, IRB approval was sought due to the nature of indirect
contact with Rolls-Royce employees. After such review, it was determined that this study was

46
exempt (Category 2) from IRB oversight due to the noninvasive design of the survey instrument.
Please refer to Appendix A for the full IRB application and approval notice. Documents included
within are the application for Category 2 exemption and permissions from Rolls-Royce to
perform research on their employees.
3.2 Participant Selection
The participants for this study were selected by their employment in engineering related
positions at Rolls-Royce. Adhering to the scope of the research questions, and results of the
literature review, it was determined that the instrument would be applied to professionals working
in either engineering or R&D positions (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008). It was our theory that these
individuals would be most likely to utilize academic resources in their day-to-day duties while
being employed for an aerospace firm. Prospective participants were contacted via email through
our Rolls-Royce contact in the Rolls-Royce Library & Resource Knowledge Center.
Participation in the study was voluntary. However, Rolls-Royce sponsored an internal incentive
in the form of a company gift card in an effort to boost the response rate of the survey. The
winner of the gift card was selected randomly from the pool of respondents.
3.3 Resource Selection
As per the literature review, the following academic resources were selected for further
investigation. The list was modified to allow for resources deemed most important for the
context of this study. While this list is not exhaustive, it encompasses the essence of the
university-academic relationship in a summarized form. The following academic resources were
selected for investigation:


Trade show



Technical assistance program

47


University partnership program



Recent graduates



Current/retired faculty



Industrial journal



Peer-reviewed academic journal



Review article



Online encyclopedia/resource

These selections, as adopted from previous studies, were selected for their relevance with
industry (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008; Shartinger, Rammer, Fischer, & Frohlich, 2002). Due to the
design of this survey instrument, it was not feasible to include all 23 items evaluated by Bekkers
and Freitas (2008), so an abridged list was created. Most notably omitted from other studies were
patents. Patents were not included in this study due to the complex nature of determining which
patents were of academic origin. It was important that the resources chosen were mainly
academic in nature. Furthermore, the sporadic nature of patent production in academia
establishes an impossible metric for using patent production as a reliable academic output. The
specifics of the design considerations for the survey will be discussed in the next section.
3.4 Survey
This section will discuss items pertaining to the survey instrument. These items include
the survey style, length, and contents.
It was determined that the most effective way to obtain a meaningful sample size was to
employ an internet-based survey using Qualtrics, a software package available through Purdue
University. The purpose for using an automated survey tool was for both ease of dissemination,
as well as ease of data collection. It was imperative that the survey was easy to access and easy

48
to submit as to ensure the highest possible response rate. In addition to the ease of completing the
survey, it was also important to ensure that the survey was short enough as to not inhibit the
professional duties of the individuals participating in the study. According to a study conducted
by Jepson, et al., it was observed that the response rates of questionnaires distributed to
physicians saw a significant drop once the length of the questionnaire surpassed 1,000 words
(Jepson, Asch, Hershey, & Ubel, 2005). On the other hand, surveys too short are perceived by
respondents to be “unimportant”, and can have a detrimental effect on the response rate (Wilson,
2013). Due to the fact that the survey was being distributed to professionals in an engineering
field, it was determined that three (3) mandatory questions would provide a sufficient sampling of
data without being overbearing to the participants, and the risk of a low response rate was worth
meaningful introspection on behalf of the respondents. For additional information, two (2)
optional questions were provided on the questionnaire. These questions are discussed in Section
3.4.3.
3.4.1 Survey Style
A survey, as opposed to an interview, was chosen as the primary method of engagement
with industry professionals. The respondents’ time is important both to Rolls-Royce and to the
researchers, so it was imperative that the involvement with Rolls-Royce employees was as
minimally invasive as possible to ensure no significant loss of time to Rolls-Royce. Interviews
have the potential to be expensive and time consuming, and are best suited for situations where
the sample population might be difficult to reach, whereas questionnaires can be crafted to a
specific length with an estimated time of completion (Molitor, Kravitz, To, & Fink, 2001;
Couper, Traugott, & Lamias, 2001). Specific guidelines for the determination of survey length
will be discussed in Section 3.4.2.

49
It was determined that a web-based survey, limited to three (3) substantive questions,
would be the best delivery method. The researcher chose to employ a web-based survey, using
Qualtrics, because it was low-cost, easy to disseminate, and aided in clean and concise data
collection (Dillman, Smyth, & Christian, 2014). While web-based surveys lack human
interaction, it was determined that the target population was too large and time constraints were
too prohibitive to make a hard-copy questionnaire feasible. Some researchers argue that the lack
of the interviewer presence has the benefit of removing interviewer bias from the study (Schwarz,
1995; Sheehan & Hoy, 1999). There could occur a situation where, in the face-to-face delivery of
a questionnaire, the respondent may become confused about the wording of a question. In this
case, it would be expected that the participant would ask the interviewer for clarification.
Schwarz (1995) warns that the wording, or repetition of the question by the interviewer, should
be identical to the wording on the questionnaire to avoid influencing the participant. As a result,
the mere nature of web-based instruments eliminates this particular introduction of interviewer
bias, thus the reason for employing an online instrument in this study (Couper, Traugott, &
Lamias, 2001).
Survey cost was another deciding factor in the choice to employ an online instrument.
Depending on the size and spread of the target audience, the dissemination of a hard-copy survey
can quickly become cost-prohibitive, especially if face-to-face interaction is required (Dillman,
Smyth, & Christian, 2014). While using online web-based survey software typically involves
subscription, this service was provided to the researcher at no-cost though Purdue University.
Coupled with email distribution, the net cost of survey dissemination was zero. Moreover, data
collection was simplified without the need for return mail, or manual collection of surveys. By
utilizing online survey tools, like Qualtrics, data collection was instant with real-time analysis
tools. This greatly reduced the cost, and time constraints associated with traditional survey
techniques (Sheehan & Hoy, 1999). According to McCullough (1998) the two most expensive

50
components of survey-based research are “data collection and analysis”, both of which are
eliminated by the use of online survey methods. Another added benefit is the fact that collection
errors are almost entirely eradicated by removing human error from the equation (McCullough,
1998).
The last and arguably most important factor in choosing a web-based survey was for the
fact that an online instrument would be the least invasive method of data collection on behalf of
the respondents (Hoerger, 2010). While a certain level of participant attention would be required
for the survey, it was critical that the time consumed by survey would be insignificant in regards
to the professional workload of the respondents. A web-based survey provided the means for a
sub-ten minute survey, facilitated by an easy to use, clear interface for which the participants
could interact. Additionally, in an attempt to minimize invasiveness, the web-based platform
allowed for an increased threshold for anonymity on behalf of the participants, which research
has shown increases participants willingness to respond fully and truthfully to the questionnaire
(Sheehan & Hoy, 1999).
3.4.2 Survey Length
The length of the survey proved more difficult to determine. Some critics argue that
shorter surveys lack depth, and can negatively influence the results of the survey. The theory is
that the question set, so long as the questions are interrelated, reflects the true conditions of the
population (Cortina, 1993). This relationship is known as Cronbach’s alpha, which is a method
of quantifying the reliability of a survey, or test, by comparing the question set as a whole to the
results of the test (Tett, Guterman, Bleier, & Murphy, 2000). The shorter the survey, the less
likely the results of the questionnaire will reflect the true state of the population (Lord & Novick,
1968). It should be noted that Cronbach’s alpha was not computed for this study, as it is most
commonly used when comparing multiple questions within a survey, or test, to determine if the

51
questions are reliably producing similar results. In the case of this study, the two substantive
questions are measuring two different “rates”; therefore their interrelatedness is not a concern.
Another proposed weakness of short surveys states that respondents value longer surveys as more
meaningful. Dillman, Smyth, and Christian (2014) warn that short surveys can cause participants
to view the information they are providing as unimportant, and might rush through their
responses. On the other hand, lengthy surveys have the potential to be too broad, thus diluting the
results, statistically hiding trends that may otherwise be significant (Maloney, Grawitch, &
Barber, 2011).
However, it has been proven that shorter surveys often have higher response rates
(Wilson, 2013). One of the primary goals of this study was to maximize the feedback received
from a relatively small population. The focus of the study was on a single manufacturing
company, so from the start the population was greatly limited. Therefore, further limiting the
possibility of high response rate with a long survey was not acceptable. One related study found
that roughly 6% of participants withdrew from the study after giving consent, and a total of
approximately 10% withdrew after the first twelve questions (Hoerger, 2010). To combat this
phenomenon, many sources agree that informing respondents about the length of the survey in
advance is essential to maintaining their attention (Couper, Traugott, & Lamias, 2001; Wilson,
2013). For the survey used in this research, participants were informed of the survey length in the
introductory correspondence that contained the link the questionnaire. While a progress bar was
not employed, participants were presented with a single webpage of questions in an attempt to
remove any ambiguity in regards to the length and expectations of the survey instrument
(Dillman, Smyth, & Christian, 2014).

52
3.4.3 Survey Contents
In an effort to maintain a meaningful, yet comprehensive set of survey questions, one (1)
demographical question, and two (2) practical questions were presented to the participants. The
objective of the study was to measure both the current usage of academic resources, as well as
preferred methods for accessing academic resources. Two (2) optional follow-up questions were
provided to the participants to gain any extra input they might have regarding their use of
academic resources. This section will outline the five (5) total individual components of the
survey instrument administered to participants.
3.4.3.1 Education Level (Question 1)
First and foremost, a baseline of participant education needed to be established; specifically,
the highest complete level of education. This was used to evaluate the presence of correlation
between education level and the participants preferred academic resource. In other words, does
the education level of the participants predict their usage of academic resources? The following
six (6) levels of education were presented as options to the participants:
1.1 – High School/GED
1.2 – Technical Certificate
1.3 – Associate’s Degree
1.4 – Bachelor’s Degree
1.5 – Master’s Degree
1.6 – Ph.D.
3.4.3.2 Current Usage (Question 2)
One of the objectives of the survey instrument was to gauge the current state of the problem.
In other words, how much influence do academic resources currently have in the workplace?

53
This was accomplished using a Likert-based question where participants were given options from
“Less Than Once a Year” to “Daily”. The question posed to the participants:
2 – In a given year, how often do you utilize the following resources while doing background
research for a project? This includes information obtained from a company librarian.
Likert-based responses were chosen primarily due to the ease of response by the participant,
but also since the data is not expected to be continuous, but rather discrete in nature. The Likerttype scoring system for Question 2 is shown in Figure 3.1 below.

Figure 3.1. Likert-type scoring system used for Question 2 of the survey.
3.4.3.3 Hypothetical Usage (Question 3)
Another objective of the survey instrument was to measure the likelihood that a participant
would choose particular academic sources, given an unknown subject. In contrast to collecting
data on current usage statistics, this would provide some context as to whether or not certain
academic sources are preferential to industry professionals. To gauge this, the following
hypothetical question was presented to participants:
3 – If you were tasked with implementing a new technology, how likely would you be to
consult the following resources:
Respondents were given a Likert-type scale, similar to Question 2, although with adjusted
categories. The scoring system for Question 3 is shown in Figure 3.2 below.

54

3.4.3.4 Follow-up (Questions 4 and 5)
The list of resources provided to the respondents of the survey was obviously not exhaustive,
as shown by Bekkers and Freitas (2008). However, the need for additional feedback prompted
the addition of two (2) optional follow up questions. The first of which prompted the respondent
to provide their personal preference in academic information:
4 – What is your favorite resource for technical information?
This question was posed for a few reasons. First of all, it was important to allow the
participants the opportunity to provide a resource other than those provided in the mandatory
questions, as this information may reinforce the hypothesis of this research. Secondly, the
preferred resources may significantly differ from those provided for the mandatory questions.
This could provide insight into an alternative unconventional resource for interacting with
academic information. Again, the ultimate purpose of this research was to uncover the most
influential channels of knowledge transfer between academia and industry. If it were discovered
that an alternative resource is preferred, it could be valuable knowledge for the academic
community.
The last field posed to the participants allowed for an open dialog regarding the research
topic. This was provided to retrieve feedback, beyond radio-buttons, that could offer insight into
the preferences and concerns that might be present in industry. The verbiage for this question is
as follows:

55
5 – If you have any additional comments regarding your access to academic resources, please
feel free to use the text box below to convey your thoughts.
The open-endedness of this question was supplied as an outlet for respondents to expand
upon their previous answers. This was done in an effort to gauge any shortcomings in the status
quo by allowing the respondents to vent any frustrations or commend any strengths of their
current method for gathering academic information. The responses from these optional questions
will be used as qualitative evidence, thus no statistical analysis will be performed in regards to
Questions 4 and 5.
3.5 Data Collection
Data collection was performed using Qualtrics. As discussed in Section 3.4.1, automated
systems are inexpensive and greatly aid in the collection of data. Human error is almost entirely
removed from the equation by using an automated data collection system. These platforms also
allow for the exportation of the raw data in multiple formats, thus reducing the chance for data
corruption when transferring the raw data between processing platforms.
3.6 Statistical Analysis
The analysis of the data obtained from this study was evaluated using a combination of
the following methods: analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparison of means, and regression
models. Only the responses of the three (3) mandatory survey questions will be used for
statistical inference. The fourth and fifth questions, pertaining to preferred resources, were used
primarily for discussion purposes, and will not be evaluated statistically; although the responses
may be used to corroborate the statistical results. This section will outline the various methods
and the applicability to this particular research project.

56
For this study, the data will be treated as continuous due to the high response rate
although it was recorded in an ordinal discrete format via a Likert-style response. There is some
contention among the field of statistics regarding the use of analytical means for Likert-scale
data. Many argue that the nature of discrete data does not allow for the use of parametric
methods since the data is not continuous (Allen & Seaman, 2007). However, evidence shows that
with enough data, the data can be treated as if it was continuous, thus enabling the employment of
parametric methods such as ANOVA and means comparisons (Norman, 2010). Norman (2010)
computed statistical analyses on a multitude of studies and found that, regardless of parametric or
non-parametric methods, the results did not vary significantly. These results, in conjunction with
advice from the Purdue Statistical Consulting Service, have established enough reason to treat the
data obtained in this study as continuous, thus allowing for the use of parametric methods (Song,
2016).
3.6.1 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
In conjunction with the Statistical Consulting Service at Purdue University, it was
determined that the most logical approach to analyzing the data was to utilize an ANOVA for
comparing the usage rates of the various academic resources; specifically a two-way mixed
ANOVA.
The two-way mixed ANOVA was chosen primarily due to the fact that the interpretation
of the data was dependent on two factors: education level and academic resource. This allowed
for the investigation of the two main effects, as well as the interactions between the two. The
model was a mixed model since it contains both a random effect (the participants) and fixed
effects (education level and academic resource). The mixed design also accounts for the fact that
each participant answered each question multiple times. For example, the participants were
presented with nine (9) resources for the second question: “In a given year, how often do you

57
utilize the following resources while doing background research for a project?” Since each
respondent answered that particular question nine (9) times, once for each resource, there was a
need to control for within-subjects variability; variability between each of the respondent’s
answers. Additionally, there was a need to control for the between-subjects variability; variability
between all of the respondents. The mixed methods ANOVA design accounts for both of these
scenarios. The results of the two-way mixed ANOVA for Questions 2 and 3 are presented in
Sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4 respectively
The purpose of employing an ANOVA was to discover whether or not a difference exists
between group means. In this case, when investigating the current usage of academic resources,
the ANOVA output will indicate whether or not a difference exists in the usage rates among the
nine (9) resources, but not necessarily which resource is used more frequently than another. For
this situation, post hoc means comparison is required. A common compliment to the ANOVA, a
means comparison procedure investigates which group means are different from one another, and
to what degree a difference exists. For this type of analysis, a Tukey means comparison measures
the differences between group means, evaluates the standard deviations, and determines the
significance of pairwise comparisons. The Tukey means comparison is generally considered the
most powerful of the means comparison procedures as it is the most conservative of the many
means comparison methods, meaning it is most likely to reject the alternative hypothesis in favor
of the null. In other words, it tightly controls the Type I (false positive) error. The details of
interpreting Tukey means comparisons are discussed in Section 4.3.2.2.
3.6.2 Correlations
One outcome of the research was to predict the likelihood of a firm’s workforce to
participate and engage with academic resources. To do this, the respondents were asked to
provide their highest completed level of education, as education level should act as the greatest

58
predictor for an employee’s engagement with academic resources. For statistical reinforcement, a
regression model was chosen as this will provide a correlation matrix for the factors involved.
Knowing not only the strength of the correlations, but knowing whether or not the correlations are
positive or negative can greatly influence the conclusions of this study. The results of the
correlation analysis are discussed in Section 4.3.5.
3.7 Summary
This chapter has provided an overview of the methodology employed for this study.
Included was the methodology for selecting a willing industry partner, the participant
identification process, as well as a description of the survey instrument. Also covered was a
description of the statistical methods that were employed for the data analysis. The next chapter
will present the data obtained through this methodology. Chapter 4 will contain an overview of
the sample demographic, as well as discussion regarding data collection techniques and data
manipulation.

59

CHAPTER 4: PRESENTATION OF DATA
This chapter provides a presentation of the data obtained in pursuance of the research
questions established in Chapter 1. The questions being investigated were presented to
participants in an order to discover (1) the level of current industrial participation in academic
resources and (2) the likelihood of choosing various academic resources given the task to
implement a new technology. The results from these two questions were evaluated in a
quantitative manner, the results of which will be presented in this Chapter. In addition to the
research questions, additional feedback from the participants was obtained through two openended response questions in an effort to bolster the quantitative analysis. This qualitative dialog
will be presented as it pertains to the research questions. The raw data is presented in Appendix
B. Discussion and conclusions drawn from the data will follow in Chapter 5.
4.1 Participant Demographics
As established in the previous chapters, the survey instrument was disseminated to
engineering professionals at the Rolls-Royce manufacturing facility in Indianapolis, Indiana.
According to the Rolls-Royce representative facilitating the dissemination of this instrument, the
final copy of the survey was distributed to a population of approximately 1,000 Rolls-Royce
employees. An exact number was not available since the survey was distributed through internal
channels. A total of 227 participants completed and returned the survey, resulting in an
approximate 22 percent response rate.
It was important to obtain a snapshot of the demographics of the sample population, so
the first question, Question 1, on the survey inquired as to the highest completed level of

60
education for the participants. It was hypothesized that education level would have the greatest
impact upon the propensity of the participants to access academic information, thus the need for a
question establishing the educational credentials of the participants. A summary of the
participant demographics can be found in Table 4.1 below.

It was noted that the percentage of respondents possessing below a Bachelor’s degree
was not proportional to the percentage of those possessing higher than a Bachelor’s Degree. In
fact, both High School/GED and Associate’s Degree education levels had only one respondent.
This disproportionality will be discussed further in Section 4.3.1. However, the remainder of the
educational distribution appeared to coincide with the preconceived expectations pertaining to the
formal education of employees at an aerospace firm.
4.2 Data Collection
The data were collected over a nearly two-week period during the spring semester, 2016.
The survey was initially disseminated on February 15, 2016 and was officially closed on
February 26, 2016, allowing for 12 full days of data collection. Recalling the demographics
mentioned in Section 4.1, the overall response rate was 22 percent, with a total of 227
respondents. As such, the first three questions of the survey were mandatory, thus ensuring 227

61
data points. The remaining two optional questions, Questions 4 and 5, resulted in 186 and 33
respondents, respectively. A summary of these response rates can be found in Table 4.2.

While the response rates for the two optional questions were not ideal, the responses
gathered were still useful for the qualitative study of the responses. The next section will discuss
the statistical analysis, as it pertains to the presentation of the data. Refer to Section 3.6 for the
in-depth methodology of the statistical analysis employed.
4.3 Quantitative Analysis
This section outlines the statistical analysis as it pertains to the quantitative analysis of
Questions 2 and 3 from the survey instrument. Included are subsections covering data
conditioning, the coding and method selection within the software package, as well as the
statistical results from Questions 2 and 3. This section will end with a discussion of correlations
between Questions 1 and 2, and Questions 1 and 3.
4.3.1 Data Conditioning
The data, in raw form, were imported from Qualtrics into Microsoft Excel, where it was
coded for use in a dedicated statistical package. The data were sorted into column form, with
replicating respondent ID’s to account for the nine (9) responses, corresponding to the nine (9)

62
academic resources, for both of the quantitative questions. No data points were removed or
altered for any of the respondents or questions.
Recalling Table 4.1, it was observed that there was a lack of respondents with a claimed
highest-completed level of education below a Bachelor’s Degree. The lack of data for these
education levels could cause skewness of the results due to the fact that low group sample sizes
have a tendency to act as outliers. In an effort to mitigate these effects, the three lowest levels of
completed education were combined into a single group. This combination of education levels
averages out the responses over a concise group, rather than influencing the entire data set with a
single outlier. Since all three education levels were below the requirements of a Bachelor’s
Degree, it can be assumed that these education levels can be reclassified as a single group,
comprising of individuals having completed “less than a 4-year college degree”. It was
determined that this outcome would more appropriately represent the sample population, in
contrast to the deletion of these data points, as these participants still provide meaningful input to
the research at hand. As such, Table 4.3 shows the combined grouping for education level.

4.3.2 Statistical Analysis Software (SAS)
SAS (Ver. 9.4) was chosen as the software package for the quantitative analysis of the
data primarily for its prominence in the statistical software arena. Additionally, the SAS interface
allows for greater user flexibility with regards to model selection, data input, and analytical
output. The code shown in the following sections were used for Question 2. Identical code was
used for Question 3, but with altered file names corresponding to the appropriate data sets. For
the sake of redundancy, the code for Question 3 was omitted from these sections.
4.3.2.1 Proc Mixed
The SAS code used to execute the two-way mixed ANOVA for Questions 2 and 3:
/* IMPORT DATA */

For the results of this code, refer to Sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4.
4.3.2.2 Tukey Means Comparison
One optional output from the “Proc Mixed” procedure, shown in Section 4.3.2.1, was a
Tukey means comparison. An ANOVA can only indicate whether a difference in group means
exists, but will not decipher which groups are different or to what extent they differ. A means
comparison procedure will conduct pair-wise comparisons of all of the groups involved, returning
significance tests for each pair-wise comparison. These significance tests are then grouped in a
table, and alphabetic letters are associated to factor levels that share similar group means.
Significance is determined by comparing each factor level’s mean, and standard deviation to the
t-distribution to establish a test statistic. The magnitude of the test statistic determines whether or
not the comparison conveys a statistically significant difference in group means.

Using Table 4.4 as an arbitrary example, it is evident from the grouping letters that Factor
Levels 1 and 2 are not significantly different from one another since they share a common
grouping letter. In other words, due to possible error, it would be inconclusive to state that either
factor level was better or worse than the other. However, Factor Levels 1 and 2 are significantly
different from Factor Levels 3 and 4 due to the mismatched letter pairs. Furthermore, it can be
noted that Factor Levels 3 and 4 are also uniquely different from all other factor levels since they
each possess a single unique grouping letter. Tukey means comparisons for Questions 2 and 3
are supplied in Sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4.
4.3.2.3 Proc Reg and Proc Corr
The SAS code used to execute the regression model, as well as the correlations, for
Questions 2 and 3:
/* IMPORT Question 2 DATA */
PROC IMPORT OUT= WORK.Q2regression
DATAFILE= "\\Client\J$\Purdue

For the results of this code, please refer to Section 4.3.5.

66
4.3.3 Question 2
The second question on the survey, recalling Section 3.4.3.2, was presented to the
participants in an effort to retrieve the current usage statistics for the provided list of academic
resources. Question 2 stated: “In a given year, how often do you utilize the following resources
while doing background research for a project? This includes information obtained from a
company librarian.”
Due to the nature of a two-way ANOVA, there are multiple hypotheses to account for the
increased number of model factors. The factors include the education level, academic resources,
and the interaction between the two main effects. For this question, we will be evaluating the
following statistical hypotheses at alpha (α) = 0.05:
Factor = Education:
H0: There is no difference between the means of the various levels of education level
with respect to Question 2 (All µ’s equal)
HA: A significant difference exists between group means of education level with respect
to Question 2 (One or more µ’s not equal)
Factor = Academic Resources:
H0: There is no difference between the means of the current usages of academic
resources with respect to Question 2 (All µ’s equal)
HA: A significant difference exists between group means of the current usages of
academic resources with respect to Question 2 (One or more µ’s not equal)

67
Factor = Education*Academic Resources:
H0: There is no interaction between education level and the usage of academic resources
with respect to Question 2
HA: An interaction does exist between education level and the usage of academic
resources with respect to Question 2
With these hypotheses in mind, a two-way mixed ANOVA, as outlined in Section 3.6.1,
was performed on the data. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4.5.

Looking at this output, it was evident that there was sufficient evidence to reject the null
hypotheses, on all accounts, in favor of the alternatives that there exists a significant difference
between group means for education level and academic resource, as well as a significant
interaction between these two variables. Since the interaction was significant, it will be
imperative that an analysis be conducted to explain this interaction. This analysis will be
discussed in Section 4.3.5.
Since the primary focus of this question was to investigate the industry preference of
various academic resources, it was also important to explore the inequalities between these
academic resources signified by acceptance of the alternative hypothesis. Although our primary
focus was on the interaction term, it was still deemed important to look at the main effect
individually. To do this, a Tukey means comparison on the nine (9) academic resources was

68
employed. The Tukey grouping method allows for a researcher to group the levels of a factor in a
descriptive manner to allow for quick comprehension of the statistics. For Question 2, the results
of the Tukey means comparison can be found in Table 4.6.

Using the analytical methods for Tukey means comparisons, as discussed in Section
4.3.2.2, it was evident that the most frequently accessed academic resource was “Online
Encyclopedia”. In fact, the results show that online encyclopedias were favored significantly
over all of the other academic resources, as indicated by the fact that it is grouped alone with a
unique letter. The results also show that peer-reviewed journals, industrial journals, and review
articles are favored behind online encyclopedias, but do not differ significantly from one another
in the current rate of usage. “Current/Retired Faculty” and “Recent Graduates” share a common
group, indicating an insignificant difference between two. The remaining resources, “University
Partnership Programs”, Trade Show” and “Assistance Programs” showed signs of varying levels
of significance between the three resources. Direct conclusions regarding this analysis can be
found in Chapter 5.

69
4.3.4 Question 3
The third question on the survey, recalling Section 3.4.3.3, was presented to the
participants in an effort to gauge the likelihood that an aerospace engineering professional would
choose certain academic resources over others when posed with an unknown subject. Question 3
stated: “If you were tasked with implementing a new technology, how likely would you be to
consult the following resources:”
Due to the nature of a two-way ANOVA, there are multiple hypotheses to account for the
increased number of model factors. The factors include the education level, academic resources,
and the interaction between the two main effects. For this question, we will be evaluating the
following statistical hypotheses at alpha (α) = 0.05:
Factor = Education:
H0: There is no difference between the means of the various levels of education level
with respect to Question 3 (All µ’s equal)
HA: A significant difference exists between group means of education level with respect
to Question 3 (One or more µ’s not equal)
Factor = Academic Resources:
H0: There is no difference between the means of likely usage of academic resources
with respect to Question 3 (All µ’s equal)
HA: A significant difference exists between the means of likely usage of academic
resources with respect to Question 3 (One or more µ’s not equal)

70
Factor = Education*Academic Resources:
H0: There is no interaction between education level and the likely usage of academic
resources with respect to Question 3
HA: An interaction does exist between education level and the likely usage of academic
resources with respect to Question 3
With these hypotheses in mind, a two-way mixed ANOVA, as outlined in Section 3.6.1,
was performed on the data. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4.7.

Again, it was evident from the output in Table 4.7 that there was sufficient evidence to
reject the null hypotheses, on all accounts, in favor of the alternatives that there exists a
significant difference between group means for education level and academic resource, as well as
a significant interaction between these two variables. Since the interaction was significant, it will
be imperative that an analysis be conducted to explain this interaction. This analysis will be
discussed in Section 4.3.5.

71
The primary focus of Question 3 was to measure the likeliness that an engineering
professional at a highly technical company would choose certain academic resources when
presented with the task of implementing new technology. Since the ANOVA results do not
specify which academic resources are favored, a Tukey means comparison was again employed
to quantify the group differences. For Question 3, the results of the Tukey means comparison can
be found in Table 4.8.

another. Likelihood of usage ranked from lowest to highest by

Using the analytical methods for Tukey means comparisons, as discussed in Section
4.3.2.2, it was evident that the Tukey comparison for Question 3 differs greatly from that of
Question 2. “Peer-Reviewed Journal”, “Online Encyclopedia”, and “Review Article” were
scored as the most likely academic sources to employ when conducting research on a new
technology. It should also be noted that since these three (3) resources share the same letter
grouping, the favorability between the three (3) are not significantly different. As with Question
2, the remaining resources differed greatly. Direct conclusions regarding this analysis can be
found in Chapter 5.

72
4.3.5 Interactions and Correlations
Recalling the presentation of data for both Questions 2 and 3, in Sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4,
respectively, there was a significant interaction between education level and the academic
resources. Interactions are important to interpret because they allow inference on how one factor
of the model may be influencing another. The visualization of this is done by producing
interaction plots, where one factor is plotted on the x-axis and the score of the other on the y-axis.
For Question 2, the interaction plot is shown in Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1. This graphical output is the interaction plot for education level and academic resource
for Question 2. The x-axis in this case represents the nine (9) different treatments, or academic
resources: (1) Trade Show, (2) Assistance Programs, (3) University Partnership Programs, (4)
Recent Graduates, (5) Current/Retired Faculty, (6) Industrial Journal, (7) Peer-Reviewed Journal,
(8) Review Article, and (9) Online Encyclopedia. The y-axis represents the mean score for each
resource, by each level of education. The levels of education: (123) <4-year College, (4)
Bachelor’s Degree, (5) Master’s Degree, and (6) Doctor of Philosophy.

73
Probably the most notable of the interactions for Question 2 were with (7) “PeerReviewed Journals”, which had the widest spread in the average score between all education
levels. According to this interaction plot, employees holding a doctoral degree exhibit the highest
current usage of peer-reviewed academic journals in the workplace, followed by master’s degree
recipients, bachelor’s degree recipients, and then those who have not completed a 4-year degree.
To determine whether or not this interaction was significant, a procedure called a slice was
performed on the interaction. A slice determines the extent to which an interaction is significant
by measuring the difference between means for one factor, while sorting for another. In this case,
the slice will determine the difference between education levels for each of the individual
academic resources. The results of the slice for Question 2 are shown in Table 4.9. From Table
4.9, the significant interactions, at alpha (α) = 0.05 are between education level and (3)
“University Partnerships”, (7) “Peer-Reviewed Journal”, and (8) “Review Article”. This
significance indicates that education level has a significant effect on the current usage of the
aforementioned academic resources. The interaction plot shown in Figure 4.1 reinforces these
findings, as the spread between these group means is much wider than for the other resources.

In order to determine the magnitude of these interaction effects, an analysis of the
correlations between education level and the nine (9) academic resources was performed for
Question 2. There were four (4) significant correlations at alpha (α) = 0.05. The results of this
analysis are shown in Table 4.10. It should be noted that although (6) “Industrial Journal” (6)
was not found to have a significant interaction with education level, there was a significant
correlation between the two. Additionally, these results show that a positive correlation exists,
meaning that as education level increases, so does the usage of (7) “Peer-Reviewed Journal”, (3)
“University Partnership Program”, (8) “Review Article”, and (6) “Industrial Journal”.

As with any correlation, it should be noted that correlation does not imply causation. In
other words, this research does not reveal whether or not the education level of a workforce
causes a rise in the participation in academic resources. The active participation in academic
resources could be an artifact of the work environment, previous training, or other outside
influences. These results merely indicate that there was a positive linear relationship between
education level and the current usage rates of certain academic resources, listed in Table 4.10, at
Rolls-Royce.

75
The next step was to evaluate the interaction terms for Question 3, shown in the
interaction plot in Figure 4.2.

Figure 4.2. This graphical output is the interaction plot for education level and academic resource
for Question 3. The x-axis in this case represents the nine (9) different treatments, or academic
resources: (1) Trade Show, (2) Assistance Programs, (3) University Partnership Programs, (4)
Recent Graduates, (5) Current/Retired Faculty, (6) Industrial Journal, (7) Peer-Reviewed Journal,
(8) Review Article, and (9) Online Encyclopedia. The y-axis represents the mean score for each
resource, by each level of education. The levels of education: (123) <4-year College, (4)
Bachelor’s Degree, (5) Master’s Degree, and (6) Doctor of Philosophy.

Again, we see that education has a profound effect on the likelihood of accessing various
academic resources. However, it appears from the interaction plot in Figure 4.2 that employees
who have completed a 4-year college degree, or beyond, are equally likely to participate with
academic resources. While there does appear to be slight variations between the higher education
levels, the evidence indicates that employees who have not completed a 4-year degree are much

76
less likely to participate in academic resources, according to this plot. To further investigate
these speculative claims, significance tests on the sliced interaction needed to occur. The results
of this slice are shown in Table 4.11, where at alpha (α) = 0.05. From these results, it appears that
only (7) “Peer-Reviewed Journal” and (8) “Review Article” have significant interaction effects
with education level. This indicates that education level has a significant effect on the likelihood
of employing the aforementioned academic resources.

In order to determine the magnitude of these interaction effects, an analysis of the
correlations between education level and academic resources was performed for Question 3.
There were three (3) significant correlations at alpha (α) = 0.05. The results of this analysis are
shown in Table 4.12. Again, it should be noted that although (3) University Partnership was not
found to have a significant interaction with education level, there was a significant correlation
between the two. Additionally, these results show that a positive correlation exists, meaning that
as education level increases, so does the likelihood of accessing, or engaging with, (7) “PeerReviewed Journal”, (8) “Review Article”, and (3) “University Partnership Program”.

As with any correlation, it should be reiterated that correlation does not imply causation.
In the context of Question 3, there was no evidence that the education level of a workforce causes
an increase in the likelihood of participation in academic resources. The likelihood of
participation in academic resources could be an artifact of the work environment, previous
training, or other outside influences. These results merely indicate that there was a positive linear
relationship between education level and the current usage rates of certain academic resources,
listed in Table 4.12, at Rolls-Royce.
4.4 Qualitative Analysis
This section outlines the qualitative analysis as it pertains to Questions 4 and 5 from the
survey instrument. Included are subsections covering data conditioning and the grouped
responses for Questions 4 and 5. The primary purpose for including the qualitative analysis was
to provide anecdotal evidence which reinforced the hypotheses tested for the quantitative
analysis. Participant feedback was key to fully investigating the usage of academic resources in
the work environment. Conclusions drawn from these anecdotal responses are discussed in
Chapter 5.

78
4.4.1 Data Conditioning
Conditioning the open-ended responses for interpretation proved to be a difficult matter.
First and foremost, there was an uneven number of respondents between Questions 4 and 5,
recalling Table 4.2, which meant that it would be difficult to track trends between participants.
Secondly, being open-ended in nature, the questions produced a number of unique responses on a
multitude of ranging topics. As a result, the initial task was to group these responses into a
handful of categories based upon the question set as a whole. The cataloguing of the responses
would provide a summarized overview of the question set, and present it in manner that would
most meaningfully describe the sentiments of the respondents. Beyond grouping, no other
manipulation was performed on the data for Questions 4 and 5. The specific grouping guidelines,
as they pertain to the individual questions, are discussed in their respective sections. All
participant responses in the following sections are presented in an un-edited, verbatim state.
4.4.2 Question 4
The fourth question on the survey, recalling Section 3.4.3.4, was presented to the
participants in an effort to gather the personal preferences of the participants with respect to their
favorite sources of technical information. It was assumed that the respondents of the survey were
professionals in an engineering or R&D role, so understanding their preferential source for
technical information was an important piece of this puzzle. Question 4 simply asked: “What is
your favorite resource for technical information? “
Of the 227 respondents, 186 people responded to Question 4. This equates to 82 percent
of the total number of respondents who participated in the survey. The 186 responses were then
evaluated for common themes, and grouped into categories corresponding to these themes.
Subcategories of these main themes were then formed in an effort to more closely detail the
responses as a whole. In cases where the primary category did not warrant multiple

79
subcategories, a singular subcategory was created in an effort to provide specific detail to the
responses given by the participants. The primary categories and subcategories are shown in
Table 4.13. The percentages and cumulative percentages for the number of respondents who
prefer the listed resources are provided as well.

The most prominent response for the favorite source of technical information was the
internet. The internet is a very broad category, so the responses were broken into four main
subcategories based upon the responses received: “Online Encyclopedia”, “Google Search”,
“Database”, and “Not Specified”. Roughly 25 percent of those who answered this question
within the “Internet” category did not specify a particular website or resource preference. It was
not inferred as to whether or not these responses implied a “Google Search” since specific details
were not provided. Contrarily, the most common response among participants who did specify an
online preference was online encyclopedias. Nearly all of these respondents referenced
Wikipedia as their encyclopedia of choice, but often times also referenced a form of Google
search in conjunction. As a result, there could be some confounding within this subcategory in
the event of listing multiple answers. However, in cases where both resources were listed, the
responses were separated into the group “Encyclopedia” for the pure fact that a specific online
encyclopedia was mentioned in the response. For this reason, responses only containing
references to a Google search were categorized differently. There was also no inference made on
the results of using a Google search to uncover technical information. With this is mind, a nearly
equal number of respondents specified databases where they prefer to gather technical
information. These were grouped in yet another category for the purpose of differentiating
between a generic Google search and a specific database for technical information. The most
prevalent of the databases listed was Knovel, with 6 respondents referencing the database,
followed closely by Scopus and Science Direct.
The next most frequent responses related various types of publications. For this category,
it was important to differentiate the type of publication, due to the fact that many of the resources
provided in the survey were forms of published literature. Publications were divided into five (5)
subcategories: “Industrial Journal”, “Peer-Reviewed Journal”, “Textbooks”, “Review Article”,
and “Not Specified”. According to the responses from Question 4, 45 respondents indicated that

81
“Industrial Journal” was their preferred source of information. Responses in this category were
primarily aerospace centric, which was expected due to the fact that the sample population was
employed for a leading aerospace manufacturing firm, Rolls-Royce. Other popular specific
sources from industrial literature were the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Surprisingly, the number of
participants who recorded a “Peer-Reviewed Journal” as a preferred source was less than 25
percent of those who responded within the “Publications” category as their preferred source of
technical information; a definite contrast to the relatively even spread among the subcategories of
the “Internet” category. One resource not considered in the original survey, but indicated as a
frequented academic resource according to resource preference was “Textbooks”. Six
participants indicated that textbooks from their academic careers were their favorite source of
technical information. While not a traditional publication, textbooks can often act as a review
article, or encyclopedia, wherein they contain summarized reviews of the state of a current field
or topic.
Personal contacts made up only 13 percent of the total responses for Question 4. This
category was split into four (4) subcategories: “Colleagues”, “Academics”, “Suppliers”, and “Not
Specified”. In an overwhelming majority, “Colleagues” were the most favored within the
personal contact category, consuming 68 percent of the 25 participant responses. It should be
noted that nearly all of the responses appeared to be in reference to informal, rather than formal,
personal contacts. “Academics” and “Suppliers” had minimal response, with no particularly
notable anomalies.
The last three (3) categories had significantly fewer respondents than the former
categories. These last three categories include: “Internal Sources”, “External Sources” and
“Events”. Internal sources, namely “Rolls-Royce Historical Reports” were referenced by 10

82
participants. According to the comments, these documents are very useful for identifying proven
processes and materials for current applications. Another common “External Source” was the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Rolls-Royce facility in
Indianapolis designs, manufactures, and tests turbine engines for both civil and military
applications, so the technological overlap between Rolls-Royce and NASA creates a substantial
need for common information. While not common overall, the fact that multiple respondents
reference NASA as a preferential source warranted its inclusion as a subcategory. The least
common yet still relevant preferred resource was “Events”, subcategorized as “Conference/Trade
Show”, had no notable comments, but still deserved inclusion.
In order to get a detailed overview of the preferred resources, as indicated by the 186
respondents, the subcategory totals were calculated and ranked from most respondents to least
respondents. This ranking of preferred resources provided a greater overview of the data by
giving a more detailed perspective into the trends present at Rolls-Royce. The ranked list of
categorized responses is shown in Table 4.14, on the next page.

4.4.3 Question 5
The final question on the survey, Question 5, was intended to serve as an open ended
question to allow the participants to provide feedback on the details surrounding accessing and
using academic resources. The question stated: “If you have any additional comments regarding
your access to academic resources, please feel free to use the text box below to convey your
thoughts.” Examples of participant responses are presented in this section to provide qualitative
context as to the general consensus among participants.
The analysis and collection of this question was much different than that of the previous
questions. First of all, there were considerably fewer respondents for Question 5 than the
previous questions, totaling only 33 people. This equates to roughly 14 percent of the 227 total

84
respondents for the survey instrument itself. Furthermore, the types of responses varied to a
greater degree as a result of the open-endedness of the question, resulting in greater challenges for
categorizing the participant responses.
The first step towards meaningful categorization was to read through and understand all
33 responses. It was immediately noticeable that the underlying theme for most of the 33
responses was negative, meaning that the comments left by participants were complaints about
the status quo for gathering academic information. It was determined that there were five (5)
sentiments regarding the use of academic resources present among nearly all of the responses:
“Difficult to Access”, “Expensive to Access”, “Irrelevant to My Job”, “Not Advertised” and
“Inefficient”. With these five (5) sentiments established, each comment was dissected to see
which of the five (5) sentiments were present within each comment. It was not unlikely that a
single comment had multiple common sentiments, so many were scored among multiple
categories.
The most common response entailed the difficulty of accessing academic resources. Of
the 33 responses, 17 mentioned the difficulty of accessing academic information. These included
people who felt that information was difficult to search, difficult obtain, or generally tough to
access even if the location of the resource is known. For example, Participant 79 stated: “I can
find articles through Google, but the publishers' websites are usually hard to navigate.” This is
further corroborated by Participant 88 who commented “University resources are generally too
difficult to search on-line. Almost always requires a telephone call.” In lieu of navigating
difficult databases, Participant 196 responded:
“It appears that I gravitate towards sources that are easily accessible and searchable.
Usually obtaining large quantities of data from various low-quality sources will answer
technical information questions faster than looking for singular high-quality data sources.
Whether it's the "pay to access" firewalls, the difficulty of knowing which peer-reviewed
source is likely to contain the topic of interest, or ignorance of the information sources

85
available I am probably not using academic resources as much as those producing the
content would like.”

Some participants complain that, even with the assistance of a company librarian,
accessing academic information can take an exorbitantly long time to receive the searched
information. Participant 62 wrote:
“Academic journals are difficult to obtain and makes it hard make that my go-to source
for information. I can get almost any article that I find though our librarian, but it can
take a few weeks, which is often too long for my research which moves quickly.”

In the case that the company librarian does not have access to a particular resource, the
next possible route is a third-party, as stated by Participant 84:
“I have also used our company library extensively for technical information and if they
don't have it, we find what I need through their channels, which are either Amazon or
NASA library. I will also use the internet to dig up papers.”
The problem does not seem isolated to the purely academic realm. Recalling Question 4,
where participants indicated that industrial journals were the most popular form of published
resources, Participant 227 stated: “It is almost impossible to get articles from AIAA, ASME etc.”
The difficulty of accessing information from these societies does not appear to be an isolated
event, as Participant 80 responded: “Access to electronic proceedings from technical conferences
is often dependent on personal attendance, or knowing someone that attended a conference. We
need to make sure our company library has access to such proceedings as much as possible.”
These comments indicate that not only are there problems with accessing academic
databases, but that even once the information is found, there are additional obstacles in the form
of pay-walls and site-registrations. While only 4 responses indicated such barriers, Participant 48
replied: “I would probaly [sic] use academic resources if they were free, meaning no on-line

86
subscriptions required, and I knew how to access them internally.” Moreover, Participant 63
writes: “Make your research articles freely available to the taxpayers who fund your research.”
Regardless of accessibility or cost, a significant proportion of the respondents felt that
many academic resources were irrelevant to their current job. Out of the 33 responses, 10
suggested that academic resources played an insignificant role in their day-to-day duties or job
description. The reasons for this appear to vary, but the most common responses dealt with the
fact that the roles of the respondents do not require the use of innovative methods or processes.
For instance, Participant 124 commented:
“I develop the electronics for control systems. My needs may be different than what you
expect. Few things are really new but rather existing products applied using a novel
method. I look for experts for the type of problem I need to solve. That is usually the
field applications engineer from a supplier. Academic resources usually lack an
understanding of production whereas the applications engineer has a track record of
applying his product in a production environment. / Seems that an applications engineer
should be included in the choices above.

Another respondent, Participant 47 stated:
“A majority of my work is to review engine components that we are manufacturing and
assembling. Because of this, when I am doing research on a problem, rather than going to
outside sources, I comb through old documents and reports we have internally on the
given component to find a similar problem set and see what was previously troubleshot. /
/ As I learned in college, the easiest way to find a good generic source it to go to
Wikipedia and from there, go to the cited source for a piece of information you need.

It seems that many of these participants reference internal documents when conducting research.
Participant 128 stated: “Texts available through my company's library or public library are often
valuable for technologies that are not extremely new. These can be located through library
resources, Amazon, and more specialized services like Knovel.” This is further corroborated by
Participant 209, who wrote:

87
“I marked "never" quite often above. Mostly because my role does not usually require a
large degree of research to be done on a given project. A lot of the process/methods are
already in place - research need not apply in many cases.

Participant 22 also stated: “In my opinion, engineers at my company under-utilize the library
resources and rely to [sic] heavily on inside knowledge within the company.”
A smaller, yet equally important few discussed concerns regarding the availability of
academic resources, particularly with regard to assistance programs and partnership programs.
Participant 112 wrote: “Need to make University Partnership Programs more visible.” This
sentiment was shared by Participant 205 who commented:
“The how-tos [sic] of accessing the knowledge of a University-Based Technical
Assistance Program or University Partnership Program are not communicated efficiently,
therefore they resulteed [sic] in low scoring. Frankly, I was vaguely aware of their
existance [sic] but had no knowledge or training on how to utilize them effectively.

The issue of intellectual property was addressed by two of the respondents, especially
concerning the partnership or collaboration between industry and academia. While these
concerns have mainly been address by legislation, namely the Bayh-Dole Act, and other
international policies, their concerns are legitimate and should be noted. Participant 213 wrote:
“Academia and advanced development projects are nearly incompatible due to the IP
issues. A company wishing to get a jump on the competition with the incorporation of
advanced technologies into a product does so at risk and with the intention of reaping a
profit through control of the intelectual [sic] property. A university is bound to
diseminate [sic] any information developed for all to see and use ( i.e. articles, journals,
thesis, etc.).”

In addition to intellectual property, these relationships can be complicated for reasons of
differing values. Participant 50 touched on these issues with their response:
“I appreciate your attempt at a survey, but a lot of the survey's response will depend upon
the project(s). For example, I'm working on a project to introduce a new material to
RRC. We're working quite closely with the vendor who developed the new material and

88
have never considered working with a college because the vendor has never worked with
a college and the nature of the project has no need of a university partnership. On
another project, RR has a partnership with a university in the UK, but the project's needs
are so far outside of what the partnership covers that, at least for my project, the
partnership has no value. Then there are intellectual property issues with many new
technologies, so there may be generalities of a new technology published in journals and
on the internet, but the specifics are going to be withheld and released to RR only when
non-disclosure agreements are signed. / I would much rather talk about how the college
curriculum can be better matched to the needs of industry. / Thanks for your survey and
good luck.”
As stated earlier, the lack of participant response, and open-endedness of Question 5
prohibited the use of quantitative analytical methods. Qualitative interpretation was deemed
more valuable to the research as a whole, and as such, will bolster the quantitative results from
Questions 2 and 3. The feedback gained from the participants in this study will be invaluable to
both the research at hand, as well as the directive of future work.
4.5 Conclusions
This chapter presented the data and covered the quantitative analysis of Questions 2 and
3, as well as the qualitative aspects of Questions 4 and 5. It was found that for the current usage
of academic resources, online encyclopedias are the preferred source of technical information.
However, when presented with the hypothetical scenario of implementing an unknown new
technology, participants were most likely to employ peer-reviewed journals, review articles, and
online encyclopedias with equal likelihood. A significant interaction effect indicated that
education level does have an effect on the usage rates of traditional academic resources, but the
participants indicated that their access to academic resources was often discouraged by
cumbersome databases and pay-walls. The data was presented in an unbiased manner;
conclusions based upon this presentation of data will be discussed in the following chapter. The
full data, in raw form, is provided in Appendix B of this document.

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS, DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter provides a summary of the methodology, general conclusions pertaining to
the research questions and the current status of the academic relationship with industry,
discussion regarding the implications of the results of this study, and recommendations for
addressing the impacts of the discoveries uncovered by this research. Recommendations for
future work conclude this chapter.
5.1 Summary of the Study
The data collection process was conducted over a two-week time-span during the spring
semester of 2016 at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. The data were collected
through an online survey instrument administered to engineering and R&D professionals
employed by Rolls-Royce in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rolls-Royce was chosen as the focal point of
the study for their ability to meet the selection criteria, discussed in Section 3.1. The five (5)
question survey, disseminated to Rolls-Royce employees, yielded 227 responses from a
population of approximately 1000 individuals, resulting in an approximate 22 percent response
rate. Question 1 on the survey instrument identified the highest completed level of education for
the respondents and was used to establish a basis for correlations between education level and the
remaining questions on the survey. Mandatory Questions 2 and 3 were evaluated in a quantitative
manner in unison with Question 1. These questions established the current usage rates of
academic resources, as well as the likelihood of using academic resources when presented with
the task of implementing a new technology. Questions 4 and 5 were optional questions intended
to receive qualitative feedback with regards to the personal preference of academic sources of

90
information, as well as provide feedback pertaining to the process of accessing academic
resources. The remainder of this section will recap the methodology used for the analysis of the
data and draw direct conclusions on how the research questions were addressed by the statistical
analysis.
5.1.1 Review of the Method
Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for the analysis of the data. The
responses for Questions 1, 2, and 3 were used for the quantitative analysis. As stated in the
previous section, the purpose of Question 1 was to establish a profile for the respondents’
educational background. This information was used primarily to investigate correlations between
Questions 2 and 3. Questions 2 and 3 were analyzed using a two-way mixed ANOVA, with an ad
hoc Tukey means comparison on the various academic resources. Due to the presence of
significant interactions of the main effects for both questions, slices were performed to investigate
the significance of the interactions themselves. Lastly, correlations between Questions 1 and 2,
and Questions 1 and 3 were performed in an effort to evaluate the predictive qualities of
“Education” on both the current usage of academic resources, as well as the likelihood of
accessing academic resources for future projects.
Questions 4 and 5 were used for qualitative purposes. This was largely due to the fact
that the questions were not mandatory for the participants; therefore the number of responses for
these two questions was considerably lower than that of the three mandatory items. The openendedness of the design for these questions was another factor considered for choosing a
qualitative analysis. While it was possible to group the question responses into explanatory
categories, the variation between responses did not lend itself well to appropriate quantitative
analytical methods. As a result, the responses for Questions 4 and 5 were used only as anecdotal
reinforcement to the quantitative analysis of Questions 1, 2, and 3.

91
5.1.2 Research Questions
When discussing the conclusions of this study, it is important to consider the context of
the research questions. This section recalls the research questions and provides direct conclusions
to these questions based upon the empirical results presented in Chapter 4. Further discussion
regarding the implications of these conclusions is presented in Section 5.2.
5.1.2.1 Research Question 1
1. What are the most influential academic channels for the dissemination of knowledge
within the aerospace manufacturing sector of industry?
Based upon the statistical analysis of the survey questions, it was concluded that the most
influential academic channel for academic information was the internet, specifically: online
encyclopedias. This was further confirmed by the corroborating evidence from respondent
feedback, where online resources were the most prevalent favored source of academic
information. According to the participants, the primary reasons for utilizing online encyclopedias
and other general internet sources are cost and ease of access. Many participants cited that paywalls and complicated database interfaces prevent common access to many of the formal
academic resources. Online encyclopedias, like Wikipedia, are free to access and have much of
the general knowledge required for further exploration. Search engines, specifically Google,
have vastly increased access to scholarly resources through Google Scholar, although these
databases are still severely lacking in overall content when compared to the vast databases
available to academicians.

92
5.1.2.2 Research Question 2
2. What academic channels are professionals in the aerospace industry most likely to
employ while researching an unknown topic?
When faced with an unknown research topic, respondents of the survey were split
between three (3) possible outlets for obtaining new information: “Peer-Reviewed Journal”,
“Online Encyclopedia”, and “Review Article”. According to the statistical analysis, these three
resources do not differ significantly amongst themselves, meaning ranking them from most-likely
to least-likely would require extrapolation of the data. Therefore, it should be considered that
these three resources would experience an equal likelihood of being chosen when conducting
research on an unknown topic. When taking into account the comments provided by respondents,
many made it clear that academic resources like peer-reviewed journals and industrial journals
would be a preferred source if it were not for the limited access. Contrarily, others felt that the
information contained within many academic resources was irrelevant to their jobs. This contrast
between groups is likely the reason why all three resources were found not significantly different
from one another. In summary, internet resources are the favored source for professionals at
Rolls-Royce; yet, if given the opportunity for something different, they would choose something
more purely academic in nature.
5.1.2.3 Research Question 3
3. What, if any, barriers exist to accessing academic resources in a non-academic setting?
When just looking at the barriers to accessing academic resources, by far the most
popular sentiment was the fact that many academic resources are difficult to access from a
number of fronts. First and foremost, the databases that contain many of the purely academic
resources are very difficult to search. Respondents cited the complexity of the websites, as well

93
as the ambiguity of the database user interfaces as common barriers. Additionally, nearly all of
the databases that store academic resources are subscription services, meaning some form of
monetary exchange is required to access the information contained within. Another important
barrier to note is the irrelevancy noted by a number of participants. Comments from the
participants indicate that many of the pure academic resources are far too theoretical, and do not
have much relevance in a manufacturing environment. Furthermore, participants indicated that
many of the processes or materials involved in their current roles are not necessarily new or
novel, therefore the utilization of academic resources does not add much value to their daily
duties. So to draw a specific conclusion, the most common barriers for accessing academic
resources for industry professionals are “pay-walls”, difficulty navigating academic databases,
and a lack of practical publications.
5.2 Discussion
This section covers the implications of the conclusions drawn in the previous sections,
and the ramifications this research could have on the status quo for the production of academic
information. Many of the discussion points provided in this section indicate solutions that would
require systematic change. As a result, it would be of great value to both industry and academia
that further investigation be completed to determine the magnitude of the deficiencies noted in
this study.
After employing the selection criteria, Rolls-Royce was chosen as the focal point of this
study to measure the current usage of academic resources at a highly technical, cutting edge
manufacturing facility with the capital, resources, and manpower for extensive R&D operations.
As established in the literature review, Chapter 2, companies of this nature have the highest
propensity to interact with academia, therefore provide the greatest opportunity for measuring the
strength of industrial participation with academic resources. By this logic, a company like Rolls-

94
Royce should be in the upper percentiles of companies who participate actively with academia.
Furthermore, engineering and R&D professionals should have even more of a necessity to engage
with academia given the nature of their roles within the company. However, the results of this
study show that not only was the use of academic resources low, but it was also discouraged by
cumbersome and expensive barriers to entry. This was evident through the direct comparison
between the results of Questions 2 and 3 on the survey instrument. The Tukey means comparison
for Question 2 determined that “Online Encyclopedia” was the most commonly used academic
resource among the participants of this study. However, when looking at the likelihood of
choosing a certain academic resource for the task implementing a new technology, the pure
academic resources are grouped similarly with “Online Encyclopedia”, meaning that no
significant difference exists in the likelihood that any of those resources will be chosen over
another. Yet, even with the perceived preference, pure academic resources such as peer-reviewed
journals, review articles, and industrial journals are not being used extensively in this nonacademic setting. Even with the anecdotal evidence provided by the respondents in Questions 4
and 5, there appears to be a shared sentiment that a number of barriers prevent the pure academic
resources from being used in their day-to-day duties. So what are the implications of these
findings?
To answer this question, there needs to be some insight into the production of academic
resources and the culture surrounding their production. In academia, there is substantial
motivation, in the form of job retention, to produce publications. As the saying goes, “publish or
perish”. But the question must be asked: For whom are these publications being produced?
Published peer-reviewed research comes in two forms: Basic and applied. Basic research tests
and investigates the cutting edge of knowledge, whereas applied research focuses more on the
practical aspects, or application, of a technology. For example, basic research might include the
formulation of a new polymer chain. Applied research would then investigate the mechanical

95
properties of said polymer for end-use applications. With the exception of the pharmaceutical
industry, most manufacturing operations rely on the applied research domain for new or novel
information (Bekkers & Freitas, 2008; Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002). But, the results of this
research showed that this is not necessarily the case. This study indicates that peer-reviewed
publications, and other pure academic resources, are being produced by, and for academics – not
industry. It could also indicate that much of the research being published is theoretical in nature,
and therefore not applicable to industries’ needs.
Funding is yet another concern when considering the fact that peer-reviewed sources
appear to be incestual in nature. As mentioned in Chapter 2, Purdue University alone spent $600
million dollars on research oriented projects in 2014. Also established in Chapter 2 was the fact
that the primary deliverables of such academic research projects are publications and/or patent
production (Agrawal & Henderson, 2002). As such, in the same year, 2014, Purdue University
produced 93 patents, all of which were utility patents, resulting in a record breaking year for
patent production (Sequin, 2015). According to the literature, only a small fraction of patents
survive to commercial fruition, meaning that of the 600 million spent on research, only a fraction
will trickle back towards the economy (Toole & Czarnitzki, 2010). Is this deficit necessarily a
negative outcome to the investment in research? No. But one could deduce that publicly funded
research should have a greater impact on the domestic economy by disseminating academic
information to the industry; rather than producing publications and patents that are of largely no
value outside of the academic setting.
However, these conclusions are not to say that academic resources are not being utilized
at all. Recalling Section 4.3.5, it was found that a significant correlation existed between
education level and both the current usage and likelihood of using academic resources.
According to this correlation, education level has a positive effect on these metrics, meaning that

96
as education level increases, so does the use of the traditional academic resources. As stated
earlier, this correlation does not imply causation, but rather that as the education level of the
workforce increases, so does the propensity for the workforce to interact with academic
resources. This is further corroborated by the significance of the interaction between main effects
for both Questions 2 and 3 where education level was shown to significantly interact with “PeerReviewed Journal”, “Review Article”, and for Question 2, also “University Partnership
Program”. This indicates that education level has a significant effect on the current and
hypothetical usage rates of academic resources.
Another correlation worth noting is that the participation with university partnership
programs and university assistance programs strongly correlated with the use of all of the other
academic resources listed on the survey, with the exception of online encyclopedias. This implies
that employees who engage with these university programs are more likely to employ academic
resources in their day-to-day duties, as well as when faced with researching or implementing new
technologies. In fact, the only academic resource not found to exhibit a significant correlation
with both “University Partnership Program” and “University Assistance Program” was “Online
Encyclopedia.” This finding suggests that individuals or companies who participate with
partnership programs or assistance programs tend to interact with a wider range of academic
resources. Now, it could be plausible that these programs are the sole facilitators of this
interaction between industry professionals and academic resources, but it is still engagement
nonetheless. These correlations for “University Partnership Program” and “University Assistance
Program”, with respect to the context of the Question 2 current usage statistics and hypothetical
usage statistics can be found in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 below, respectively

Note again, that in both Tables 5.1 and 5.2, the only resource not to have a significant correlation
with either “University Assistance Program” or “University Partnership Program” was “Online
Encyclopedia.”
The same trends hold true when looking at the correlations for “University Partnership
Program” and “University Assistance Program” in the context of the likelihood of using academic
resources when faced with implementing a new technology. In some cases, the correlations were
considerably stronger. These correlations can be found in the following Tables 5.3 and 5.4.

From Tables 5.3 and 5.4, it is suggested that respondents who felt likely to use either
university partnership programs or assistance programs when implementing a new technology
displayed less of a likelihood for using the traditional academic resources in favor of personal
contacts and events. This is contrary to Tables 5.1 and 5.2 that show the opposite with regards to
the current usage statistics. One possible theory for the discrepancy is that individuals who are
likely to employ university partnerships or assistance programs are relying on supplemental

99
assistance for accessing traditional resources; whereas participants who currently utilize the
services provided by partnerships and assistance programs already possess the tools required to
perform the searches on their own. My personal experience with clients through the Technical
Assistance Program at Purdue University corroborates this theory. A large number of companies
seeking assistance through TAP were doing so in an effort to gain access to the Purdue Library
database. In essence, they knew what they wanted; they just did not possess the tools to access it.
Again, it should be noted that these correlations do no imply causation.
5.3 Recommendations
So how do we encourage more widespread participation in academic resources? There
are a few possible suggestions that can be made, both on an immediate scale and also in a more
gradual manner to address the deficiencies of the academic-industrial relationship.
5.3.1 Outreach
It was discovered that university partnership programs and assistance programs had a
significant correlation with the participation with nearly all of the other academic resources. One
recommendation I would make on this front would be to encourage and more openly advertise the
benefits of utilizing university based technical assistance programs and higher level university
partnerships. As is the case with the Technical Assistance Program (TAP) at Purdue University,
basic technical consulting services are provided free of charge to the client, allowing the creation
of a risk-free connection to academia for any company with a physical location within the
geographical boundaries of Indiana. In my personal experience with TAP, many of these
companies maintain their relationship with Purdue long after the project has ended. Some clients
return for additional projects, while others have established partnerships with faculty for more
advanced research. For those companies wishing to maintain deeper, longer lasting relationships,
Purdue University should encourage some of the numerous partnership opportunities available by

100
creating a smoother segue between short term assistance program activities and the longer term
partnership activities. Although more specific than assistance program services, partnership
programs can create a lasting channel for transferring, sharing, and engaging industrial partners
with new and novel technology.
5.3.2 Open-Source Publication
A recommendation broader systematic change might take shape with the way research is
published and disseminated. There is much debate in the current academic environment over the
validity of open-source outlets for publishing research. The ultimate goal of open-source
publications is to broadcast published research to the masses at no cost. In 2013, the Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), a division of the Executive Office of the President,
initiated a memorandum which would require that the results of publicly funded research be
published in a manner that would allow for unrestricted access to the general public (Van Epps,
2016). The OSTP mandate established a handful of basic requirements. First, any U.S. agency
with over $100 million in “annual conduct of research and development expenditures” should use
available funds to develop a plan to facilitate open access publications (Holdren, 2013). Each
agency’s directive should cover access to existing private databases, means to improve public
ease of access, long term accessibility issues related to database structure, a method to educate
recipients of federally funded projects on dissemination stipulations, and also internal mandates
on metrics for policy success (Holdren, 2013). As of April 29th, 2016, sixteen departments had
completed and submitted their plans for open access publications (Holdren, 2016). This initiative
has been a significant step forward for the academic community with regards to disseminating
knowledge to the masses, from both an ethical and professional viewpoint.
Many private publishers in the medical realm, as well as many STEM fields, have been
slowly moving toward open-access publications as a result of claims that closed-access medical

101
publications violate the ethical boundaries of humanity. So how do private, for-profit publishers
turn a profit when their publications are offered for free? This gray area of the open-access arena
gave way to a business model where fully edited versions are retained for paying subscribers. In
this scenario, pre-edited versions are published online, for free, but in order to view the versions
in an edited, “official” state, one must subscribe to the publication. These “free” versions,
however, are often incomplete or missing important data. Another popular alternative is the
“author-pays” model. In this situation, the author of the article pays the publisher a one-time fee,
ranging anywhere from $500 to $2,500 depending on the length of the publication, contents of the
research, and credibility of the journal (Clarke, 2004). From that point forward, the published
article is supplied at no cost to the public and is therefore considered “open-source” (Clarke,
2004; Van Epps, 2016). But is this still truly open-source? Both of the aforementioned models
require some sort of monetary compensation in order to access the information contained within,
whether it be from the author or the general public. While there are repositories where true opensource publication is encouraged, many critics argue the legitimacy of such outlets over claims
that the review processes are not nearly as rigorous as their closed-source counterparts. One such
outlet is the arXiv database. The arXiv database was originally founded as a place for
professionals in the field of physics to share and temporarily publish innovative physics research,
but has since grown to include many of the science fields (Cornell University Library). In most
cases, arXiv acts as an outlet for researchers to publish scientific breakthroughs in a manner that
establishes a traceable research timeline. However, arXiv does not peer-review publications, and
as a result suffers in terms of credibility. As a result, publishing in this domain does not
strengthen ones promotion and tenure document. While arXiv may be a unique example, the
“open-access” nomenclature, in a general sense, does not necessarily imply “not peer-reviewed; it
simply states that the information contained within the publication is available freely to the
general public (Van Epps, 2016). An example of a peer-reviewed open-source archive is the

102
PubMed Central repository, established by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). As of 2009,
the Omnibus Appropriates Act created a law requiring that any published National Institutes of
Health (NIH) funded research be submitted to the NLM PubMed Central database (United States
National Library of Medicine; National Institutes of Health, 2016). PubMed Central is not a
publisher per se, but rather a database or archive containing peer-reviewed publications from a
number of known academic publishers. Nevertheless, the information contained within is
provided at no cost to the general public. In this particular case, legislature was the driving factor
in creating an open-source repository for the general public.
The open-source framework of PubMed Central is primarily limited to the medical field,
with branches slowly expanding to include other biological sciences and chemistry related fields.
As it stands, the remainder of the STEM community is largely closed-source, with a few
exceptions subscribing to the “author-pays” model (Van Epps, 2016). The OSTP mandate aims
to fill this gap by incorporating a directive that ALL federally funded research be available for
free, as it arguably should be. It is recommended that Purdue University, or academia in general,
incentivize the publication of research in the open-source arena. Undoubtedly, there is a much
deeper relationship between academia and the private publishing industry that would most
certainly hinder any significant movement in this general direction, but the recommendation
needs be made. Recalling the data, the driving theme of the participants’ responses was that too
many barriers exist with regards to their access to academic information; namely cost and
difficulty of database navigation. As a result, the participants resort to less reliable sources of
information, even when pure academic resources were favored. If academicians are required and
incentivized to publish in open-source venues, then active industry participation in academic
resources will eventually rise, in turn strengthening the academic-industrial relationship and
ultimately the economy.

103
5.3.3 Industry Portal
During my undergraduate studies at Eastern Illinois University (EIU), I was employed as
a student-worker in the EIU library system’s periodical department. My duties were menial, but
included organizing the periodical section and directing library patrons to their destinations
within the vast array of stacks. Towards the end of my studies, the library system decided to
move away from print periodicals in favor of their electronic counterparts. Before the transition,
any person could visit this particular public university library and flip through any number of our
print periodicals in search of a specific peer-reviewed publication. After the transition, the only
portal to this collection of resources was a PC workstation that required university credentials to
access. No longer were the days of unfettered public access.
The same trends hold true at Purdue University. In fact, in the Potter Engineering
Library, only two PC workstations provide guest-access to the Purdue Library network. If we
take a step back, and evaluate the overall system, it is evident that publicly funded research is
slowly taking steps towards open-access dissemination through the OSTP mandate. But what
about the services paid for by Purdue University? Although public funding accounted for
approximately 15 percent of the total endowment, Purdue University is still considered a state
funded public university (Purdue University, 2014). By this logic, the taxpayers of Indiana
should have at least a little access to the extensive resources of which Purdue University has
subscribed. Before the digital revolution, this might have been easier to accomplish since public
access to print materials was relatively easy to facilitate. However, in the wake of the shift to
digital media, access to these once accessible resources has become, ironically, more
cumbersome. One recommendation to remediate this hurdle would be to provide short-term
industry access through an industrial portal. As mentioned in Section 5.2, an alarming number of
Indiana companies contacted the Technical Assistance Program because of restricted access to

104
academic publications. This indicates that not only is there a need for such a service, but also that
the benefits of an industrial library portal could incubate long-term industrial research
partnerships with Purdue University. The University could even host industry-centric workshops
for searching and accessing academic resources. In other words, make Purdue University the
proverbial one-stop-shop for technical assistance.
This framework can be taken one step further through the implementation of a program
that would allow Purdue graduates the opportunity to re-activate career accounts for access to the
Purdue Library system. Not only would this facilitate active industrial participation in academic
resources, but it would give potential employers of Purdue graduates an incentive to employ
Purdue alumni. Again, there are certainly hurdles for such systematic change. Purdue University
subscribes to a number of databases that ultimately comprise the Purdue Library as it is currently
known. The subscription fee for this service is based upon the total full-time equivalent (FTE) of
the university (Van Epps, 2016). As such, drastically increasing the number of users through the
retroactive addition of alumni could cause a substantial increase in the cost for this service.
However, the potential benefits of a fully equipped alumni population could offer a significant
increase in the demand for Purdue graduates, as well as serve as a framework for other
universities who wish to implement similar programs.
Regardless of the implementation method, an industry portal to the Purdue Library could
greatly increase the frequency of industrial collaboration, creating abundant opportunity for
further partnership and research initiatives. It would provide a lifeline for smaller companies who
simply need a leg up on the competition. For large companies, it has to potential to serve as a
foundation for a deeper collaborative research agreement. At the very least, Purdue could pilot
this program through companies with which it already has an existing partnership. In either
scenario, both the State of Indiana and Purdue University would come out ahead.

105
5.4 Future Work
The final section of this dissertation outlines the future work that can be used to continue
the focus of this study. This particular study offered a glimpse as to the current strength of the
academic relationship with the aerospace industry. Going forward, there are a few studies that
could be completed in an effort to fully define this relationship. While the breadth of these
proposed studies may vary, the underlying objective aims to explore the ever-dynamic
relationship between industry and academia.
5.4.1 Scalability
This study investigated the magnitude of the relationship between a highly technical
manufacturing firm and academia. One of the assumptions established by the literature review
was that a company like Rolls-Royce would have the greatest likelihood of participating with
academic resources. The next logical step in this research would entail a comparison between the
results from Rolls-Royce and the manner by which smaller, less technical operations access
academic information. This would determine if firm size, complexity of the product, or the
expendable capital of the firm have any bearing on the propensity of a firm’s employees to access
academic resources. A sample survey, identical to the one completed by Rolls-Royce employees
was sent to a small, technologically advanced machine shop as an investigative study to gauge the
necessity of such follow-up work. This machine shop was chosen for their extensive repertoire of
highly technical manufacturing equipment, and the fact that they approached the Technical
Assistance Program at Purdue University for assistance gathering peer-reviewed journal articles.
The initial results found that their staff highly depends on trade shows for learning about, and
procuring the latest in manufacturing equipment. As a result, a follow-up study of this nature
should include both the technology readiness level (TRL) and the manufacturing readiness level
(MRL) as factors. These readiness level metrics establish a quantifiable value to both the

106
sophistications of a firms technologies and their ability to meet manufacturing needs (Engel,
Dalton, Anderson, Sivaramakrishnan, & Lansing, 2012; Peters, 2015). These metrics, combined
with the survey instrument created for this research would provide important feedback on how
various operational aspects of the evaluated companies contribute to their use of academic
resources. Linking either TRL or MRL to academic engagement would be a monumental step
forward for measuring the industrial-academic relationship.
5.4.2 Trustworthiness
Another important follow-up study would gauge the epistemic qualities of academic
resources. A common sentiment regarding the use of online encyclopedias, namely Wikipedia, is
that they are untrustworthy sources of information (Konig, 2013). However, there has been some
recent speculation as to the trustworthiness, or rather lack thereof, with regards to the pure
academic publications. In fact, a recent study published in Science found that nearly two thirds of
the psychological studies they sampled could not be reliably reproduced (Nosek, 2015). If the
same holds true for fields outside of psychology, then what does this say about the credibility and
trustworthiness of the most holy of academic publications? At that rate, they are no more
trustworthy or reliable than Wikipedia. One study found that the articles contained within
Wikipedia were found to be more incomplete than inaccurate, making it a surprisingly reliable
source for basic information (Fallis, 2008). With this in mind, it would be an interesting followup study to survey industry professionals to determine their level of trust with academic
resources, namely published peer-reviewed work. It is already known that the pure academic
resources are not being widely used in industry, so add to that the level of distrust and larger
themes may begin to appear.

5.5 Summary
This chapter provided summary of the study and a review of the methodology employed
for the analysis of the data. The conclusions drawn from the analysis were provided as they relate
to the research questions established in Chapter 1, and discussion pertaining to the implications of
these conclusions was also included. Although broad in scope, the implications were addressed
in a compartmentalized fashion in order to properly recommend extensive, yet feasible solutions
to the shortcomings established by this study. By no means will the remediation of these
shortcomings be simple, but the future work established in this section should provide a
systematic approach to fully characterizing the true strength of the academic relationship with
industry.

In my opinion, engineers at my company under-utilize the library
resources and rely to heavily on inside knowledge within the
company.

none
My role doesnt involve anything novel that would require research.
As such, I don't ever use the resources for this.

A majority of my work is to review engine components that we are
manufacturing and assembling. Because of this, when I am doing
research on a problem, rather than going to outside sources, I comb
through old documents and reports we have internally on the given
component to find a similar problem set and see what was previously
troubleshot. / / As I learned in college, the easiest way to find a good
generic source it to go to Wikipedia and from there, go to the cited
source for a piece of information you need.
I would probaly use academic resources if they were free, meaning no
on-line subscriptions required, and I knew how to access them
internally.
I appreciate your attempt at a survey, but a lot of the survey's
response will depend upon the project(s). For example, I'm working
on a project to introduce a new material to RRC. We're working quite
closely with the vendor who developed the new material and have
never considered working with a college because the vendor has
never worked with a college and the nature of the project has no need
of a university partnership. On another project, RR has a partnership
with a university in the UK, but the project's needs are so far outside
of what the partnership covers that, at least for my project, the
partnership has no value. Then there are intellectual property issues
with many new technologies, so there may be generalities of a new
technology published in journals and on the internet, but the specifics
are going to be withheld and released to RR only when non-disclosure
agreements are signed. / I would much rather talk about how the
college curriculum can be better matched to the needs of industry. /
Thanks for your survey and good luck.

Academic journals are difficult to obtain and makes it hard make that
my go-to source for information. I can get almost any article that I find
though our librarian, but it can take a few weeks, which is often too
long for my research which moves quickly.
Make your research articles freely available to the taxpayers who fund
your research.
I think this is very unique to each person. Many of our choices are
choices out of habit or familiarity. I use whatever I feel is appropriate
and rarely follow the same formula each time.

Access to electronic proceedings from technical conferences is often
dependent on personal attendance, or knowing someone that
attended a conference. We need to make sure our company library
has access to such proceedings as much as possible. /

I can find articles through Google, but the publishers' websites are

I have also used our company library extensively for technical
information and if they don't have it, we find what I need through
their channels, which are either Amazon or NASA library. I will also use
the internet to dig up papers.

University resources are generally too difficult to search on-line.
Almost always requires a telephone call.

Limited contacts in the SE department from recent graduates/alumni
from my school, most tech documents are found online or through
coworkers from field experience.

I don't do much of this in my current role

Need to make University Partnership Programs more visible.
I generally don't have access to academic resources.

Another source of information we use in research is the US patent
database both issued and published.

I develop the electronics for control systems. My needs may be
different than what you expect. Few things are really new but rather
existing products applied using a novel method. I look for experts for
the type of problem I need to solve. That is usually the field
applications engineer from a supplier. Academic resources usually
lack an understanding of production whereas the applications
engineer has a track record of applying his product in a production
environment. / Seems that an applications engineer should be
included in the choices above.
Rolls-Royce uses UTC support for answering techincal questions.
Better visibility to these UTCs for general employees would be useful.
Opportunity to submit ideas for projects...

Texts available through my company's library or public library are
often valuable for technologies that are not extremely new. These can
be located through library resources, Amazon, and more specialized
services like Knovel.

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and the technical fellowship were
omitted from this survey, yet they play the largest role in new
technology. These individuals are active in the research community
and are the individuals who branch out and acquire the knowledge
from the areas mentioned above. Going to them is a one stop shop.

the concept of libraries is dated and obsolete

My observation is that very few in idustry perform a proper "literature
search" before launching a technology project.

It appears that I gravitate towards sources that are easily accessible
and searchable. Usually obtaining large quantities of data from various
low-quality sources will answer technical information questions faster
than looking for singular high-quality data sources. Whether it's the
"pay to access" firewalls, the difficulty of knowing which peerreviewed source is likely to contain the topic of interest, or ignorance
of the information sources available I am probably not using academic
resources as much as those producing the content would like.

The journal of thermal spray technology is an excellent resource but
not available due to the fee not being covered by RR

The how-tos of accessing the knowledge of a University-Based
Technical Assistance Program or University Partnership Program are
not communicated efficiently, therefore they resulteed in low scoring.
Frankly, I was vaguely aware of their existance but had no knowledge
or training on how to utilize them effectively.
no comment
I marked "never" quite often above. Mostly because my role does not
usually require a large degree of research to be done on a given
project. A lot of the process/methods are already in place - research
need not apply in many cases.

Academia and advanced development projects are nearly
incompatible due to the IP issues. A company wishing to get a jump
on the competition with the incorporation of advanced technologies
into a product does so at risk and with the intention of reaping a profit
through control of the intelectual property. A university is bound to
diseminate any information developed for all to see and use ( i.e.
articles, journals, thesis, etc.).

Google provides access to many useful documents, reports, and
presentations from universities, companies, books, etc

Technical conferences such as ASME and AIAA often have trade shows
attached, but they are not trade shows in and of themselves. I find
technical conferences useful because they bring many experts
together in one place. The trade shows that are attached have much
less value to me.
It is almost impossible to get articles from AIAA, ASME etc.
