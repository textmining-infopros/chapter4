ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Information Practices Relative to Parental Mediation and the Family Context
Among Puerto Rican and Dominican Teens
By STEFANI E. GOMEZ

Dissertation Director:
Marie L. Radford

The influx of information communication technologies (ICTs) into the modern family
household can create tension between teens’ right to access and autonomy and
parents’ right to mediate their ICT activities that needs to be accommodated within the
everyday routines of the family. As a part of their everyday lives teens’ must negotiate
the sometimes-opposing motivations of their parents, the everyday family routine, and
an increasing number of digital devices and information technologies. Though there has
been a great deal of research into the methods parents use to mediate and monitor
their children’s technology use (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008; Clark, 2011), there has
been very little investigation into the ways that teens negotiate their parents’ practices
or how their ICT interactions are related to their family. This dissertation explored these
issues through an in-depth look at the families of eight 14-16-year-old Puerto Rican and
Dominican teenagers living in the US. To do this it utilized a mixed-methods approach
that included surveys, semi-structured in-home family interviews, a teen mapping

ii

activity, and individual interviews with both teenagers and their parent(s) for each
family. The resulting data was coded and analyzed according to the constant
comparative method and typologies were developed of parental and teen practices.
The findings provide a holistic understanding of teens’ everyday information practices
within the family context. The narratives that parents and teens expressed throughout
the interviews situated their practices within their personal contexts and their
understanding of reality and seemed to be linked with the combinations of practices
they described, as well as the dynamic between them. Overall, the teens generally
described abiding by parents’ rules and respecting their authority. They did not see
their parents’ mediation as outside of their parental rights and they attempted to use
ICTs within the structure of what they believed their parents considered appropriate
and would maintain the balance of their relationship. At the same time, teens described
negotiating these constraints in ways that enabled them to pursue their own interests
and meet many of the ICT expectations of their peer and academic worlds. The
creativity they brought to this task appeared to influence the extension of their personal
information ecologies, and consequently their ability to negotiate for their own needs
and their access to ICT resources.

Acknowledgements
I have been on the other side of this mountain for so long it is hard to believe
that I have reached this side, but now that I am I would like to express my gratitude to
all of the people that helped me get here. First, I would like to thank my Advisor Dr.
Marie L. Radford. I am deeply grateful for your thoughtfulness and encouragement over
the years. You made this possible with your guidance, reassurance, and review of what
must have seemed like an endless number of drafts.
I would also like to thank my committee members. Dr. Ross J. Todd, your
knowledgeable suggestions and your decision to fund me for this last year have made
such a difference to my project and to my family. Dr. Denise E. Agosto, your feedback
has improved this work and will help me further develop it. Dr. Vikki S. Katz, my work
with you sparked my love for interviewing and fostered my interest in families. During a
conversation, early on in the dissertation process, you told me that if I managed to do
this while my daughters were still young, they would grow up knowing that they could
do anything. I have held onto that for the last year and it has helped me focus and
persevere.
Thank you to Dr. Marija Dalbello, Dr. Daniel O’Connor, and Dr. Sonja Thomas for
encouraging me to pursue a PhD and to the ALA Spectrum fellowship that provided me
with generous funding that supported my work for many years.
Thank you to my wonderful friends, Abby and Mylinh, for all these years of
friendship and the countless hours of thoughtful conversations. Thank you to my

iv

beautiful and talented sisters, Jennifer and Meggan. Knowing you will always be there
makes everything a little bit easier.
Thank you to my mom and dad, Karen and Humberto. Your extra help in those
last few weeks, picking up the girls after school, taking them on camping weekends, was
crucial. I am grateful that during my childhood you encouraged me to read anything I
could get my hands on, but also taught me I could not believe everything I read.
I am deeply appreciative of everything my husband, Rami, has done to make this
dissertation possible; the years of support and encouragement and the extra weekend,
evening, and bedtime shifts that he took on so willingly with the girls. Thank you, Rami,
you are a wonderful father and partner and this accomplishment is as much yours as it is
mine. I am also very grateful to his parents, Amale and Marwan, for raising such a
generous, patient, and warm son. Amale, also, thank you so much for all the extra
household chores you took care of this summer to allow me to focus on my work.
Thank you to my daughters, Frida and Zoya, who were so patient about all the
hours I couldn’t spend with them over the last year. Your precocious curiosity and
generosity of spirit inspire me every day.
Finally, I must express my deep gratitude to the teenagers and families that
participated in this project for allowing me into their homes and trusting with me their
stories.

Chapter 1 : Problem Statement
This dissertation examined the dynamic between parents’ mediation practices
and 14 to 16 year-old teens’ ICT practices in Puerto Rican and Dominican families and
explored how this dynamic is embedded in their particular family’s technological culture
and the broader culture in which they are situated. Havighurst (1972) identified the
development of stable relationships with peers, independence from parents, and a
personal value system as some of the main developmental tasks of adolescence. Though
adolescents’ attention is moving from parents to their peers, they still generally live in
the family home under the purview of parents’ rules, guidelines, and surveillance. While
"the home has been considered a private sphere where individuals can regulate their
own behavior, this is an adult-centric narrative. For many teens, home is a highly
regulated space with rules and norms that are strictly controlled by adults" (boyd, 2007,
p.134). Though there has been a great deal of research into the methods parents use to
mediate and monitor their children’s technology use (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008;
Clark, 2011, Yardi & Bruckman, 2011), there has been very little investigation into teens’
perspectives of their parents’ practices (Mascheroni, 2014) or their response to them.
This is an important area of investigation because the incorporation of
information communication technologies (ICTs) into the parent/teen dynamic can make
establishing boundaries from parents challenging. ICTs have now been integrated into
every aspect of most contemporary youths’ lives (Madden, Lenhart, Duggan, Cortesi, &
Gasser, 2013) and sharing information has become a mainstay of youth culture (boyd &

2
Marwick, 2011). Many teens are now calling, Googling, texting, IMing, Tweeting,
Facebooking, Youtubing, blogging, Skyping, Instagramming, Snapchatting, music sharing,
and gaming (Grinter, Palen, & Eldridge, 2006; Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, & Zickuhr, 2010;
Lenhart, Duggan, Perrin, Stepler, Rainie, & Parker, 2015; Livingstone & Helsper, 2008)
utilizing a variety of devices, such as, mobile phones, smart phones, tablet computers,
gaming devices, laptops, and desktop computers (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010).
While these ICTs do “create new kinds of opportunities for youth to connect,
communicate, and develop their public identities” (Ito, Horst, Bittanti, boyd, HerrStephenson, Lange, 2008, p. 10-11) the properties of digital media complicate the
nature of privacy (boyd, 2007). Privacy is not so much about withholding information,
but about controlling ones’ boundaries (Altman, 1975) by managing the information
that gets revealed in different contexts (Palen & Dourish, 2003; Petronio, 2002). Teens
must reflect on the qualities of digital information, their digital devices, and their
environment to negotiate their boundaries with their parents. This entails a complex set
of information practices that should be understood.
The dissertation looked specifically at Latino/a teens because they are
understudied within LIS and also provide a vantage point for exploring how information
practices are embedded within cultural experience. While the literature showed that
there were many similarities between Latino/a teens’ access and use of technology and
their majority-culture counterparts, it also showed important distinctions (Lenhart et al.,
2015) that might stem from contextual differences related to their cultural membership
and have important implications for their interactions with information.

3
While research on privacy in relation to teens most often focuses on commercial
privacy and keeping teens safe from the risks of the Internet (Marwick, Mugia-Diaz, &
Palfrey, 2010), there has recently been a turn to investigations of teens’ negotiation of
their online social privacy (Vickery, 2015). These researchers have used qualitative
methods to explore social privacy from teens’ perspectives and have forged an
understanding of the practices that teens use to deal with the collapsed contexts of the
online space that include structural and social methods of constructing privacy (boyd &
Marwick, 2011) and involve strategies, such as strategic information sharing, selfcensorship, and social steganography, or in other words, obscuring the meanings of
what they post (Marwick & boyd, 2014; Oolo & Siibak, 2013). Within information
science (IS) researchers have also found that teens filter the large audience of their
social media (SM) “friends” into separate groups and have different customs and habits
of communicating with these various groups (Read, Shah, S-O’Brien, & Woolcott, 2012).
Teens also have a plethora of reasons why they choose to use different ICTs with
different people and groups (Agosto, Abbas, & Naughton, 2012). These studies reveal
that teens are aware of the consequences of their information practices on their social
contexts and actively take measures with their information and ICTs as a result of this
knowledge in order to navigate their social connections and assemble social boundaries.
Although much of this research touched on the strategies that teens used in both their
communications and their interactions with information to evade their parents’
mediation and monitoring, the focus was usually on their practices in general and
parents and families were only a marginal concern. Therefore, there was a gap in the

4
literature concerning how teens respond to parental mediation (PM) and monitoring
and how their responsive practices are situated within the structures of their familial
context.
To help fill this gap and assemble a holistic picture of how adolescents’ ICT
practices are embedded within the social context of their families, this study
incorporated a sample of eight Latino/a families using a mostly qualitative mixedmethods approach that included surveys, a semi-structured in-home interview with
each family as a whole, a household mapping activity with 14 to 16 year-old
adolescents, and individual interviews with parents, that helped to mitigate each
methods’ individual shortcomings (Connaway & Radford, 2017). The research design
facilitated the exploration of teen and parental perspectives and how their practices
were integrated into the family’s everyday culture and routines. The data that was
collected initially coded according to a theoretically driven coding scheme developed via
findings from a pilot study and the literature review. Because of the nature of the study,
the codes were evaluated for their fit with the data in memos throughout the coding
process and when needed, adjusted to better fit the data using the Constant
Comparative Method (Campbell, Quincy, Osserman, & Pedersen, 2013; Charmaz, 2014;
Taylor & Bogdan, 1998). Accordingly, the analysis stayed stay open to meanings and
practices that become salient in the data.
Though the current study primarily used the term “teen” to refer to youth
between the ages of 13-19 that Havighurst (1972) has identified as the adolescent stage

5
of life development in order to use a term that teens themselves use, this dissertation
will use the terms teens, teenagers, adolescents interchangeably. The term “youth” will
be used to refer to broader demographic that includes both children, adolescents, and
young adults.
Within this study, the strategies that teens used to negotiate their ICT use in the
family context were approached from within the everyday life information seeking (ELIS)
perspective. ELIS researchers have highlighted the importance of understanding
information behavior as it occurs within everyday life (Savolainen, 1995). These
researchers promote considering information as a process of construction (as opposed
to being a thing that people acquire) (Dervin, 1992), dependent on context (Pettigrew,
1996) and group membership (Chatman, 1996, 1999, 2000), which can be instigated
through random encounters in everyday situations, from any type of media (Williamson,
1998). Informed by this view of information, throughout this dissertation, Savolainen’s
(2007) term information practices, rather than the more traditional information
behaviors, was used to refer to the various activities that teens, their parents, and their
families take up with ICTs. Savolainen argued that information practices encompass
“activities such as information seeking, searching, and use; in addition, formal and
informal communication” (p.124) and can only be understood from within the social
structures they are embedded in. Construing information in this way allowed the study
to investigate the information, entertainment, and communicative ICT activities whose
boundaries are blurred in the modern household environment.

6
This dissertation contributes to theory development within ELIS through its
development of typologies of parental mediation and the ICT practices that were
involved in teens’ negotiation of their family membership (see Appendix F and G for the
full typologies with definitions and examples). These typologies provide a framework for
understanding how teens’ ICT practices function within the information ecology of the
family context. The study builds on work by Agosto and Hughes-Hassel (2006a, 2006b)
and has integrated aspects of Chatman’s (1991, 1996, 1999, 2000) “small world”
theories, Silverstone’s (Silverstone, 1991; Silverstone, Hirsch, & Morley, 1992;
Silverstone, Morley, Dahlberg, & Livingstone, 1989) work on the domestication of
technology and the technological culture of the home, and Nardi and O’Day’s (1999)
concept of the information ecology. Agosto and Hughes-Hassel’s work linking teens’
development to their information needs demonstrated that their information needs
were integrally related to their developmental stage in life and created an opening for
questions about how their need for autonomy from parents and connections with peers
(Havighurst, 1972; Petronio, 2002) influence how they interact with information and use
ICTs within their family context. Silverstone et al. (1989) conceptualized the family as a
"cultural entity," that "occupies its own private space," has an economic system, and
"domestic politics," and is essentially a microcosm of society at large (Silverstone et al.,
1989, p.7). They argued that the family’s mythologies, or the stories that the family tells
itself about itself, serve as the backdrop for the family’s interactions with technology
and help create the social norms about what its members think are appropriate
(Silverstone et al., 1989). Silverstone et al. (1992) developed a framework called the

7
moral economy of the home to explore how families incorporate ICTs into the spaces
and routines of the household over time and gain an understanding of how this process
is influenced by the family’s own meanings, beliefs, and values. Chatman (1996, 1999,
2000), on the other hand, focused on information flows and how individuals’
interactions with information were influenced by the worldview and social norms of
their group memberships or “small worlds.” The individuals in her studies managed and
manipulated information to maintain their “small world” membership and to construct
boundaries to protect themselves from those they understood to be outsiders. Nardi
and O’Day provided a way to understand how “people, practices, values, and
technologies” (Nardi & O’Day, p.49) in a locality interact over time to form the routines
that make up the domestic information ecologies of teens’ family contexts. Integrating
characteristics from these theories provided a way of understanding how the physical
spaces of the household and the social norms and routines of the family were related to
the practices that parents used to mediate and monitor their teenage children’s ICT use,
and the ways that teens used ICTs to negotiate the flow of information to within the
family context in order to maintain their memberships within their family and peer
groups.
This study has important implications for the design of literacy curricula and
library practices that support the interconnected nature of parent and teen ICT
practices. This chapter has introduced the dissertation and presented the problem
statement, Chapter 2 will proceed with the literature review and a description of the
pilot study’s findings and contributions. Next, Chapter 3, will provide an explanation of

8
the methods and analysis that were used in the study. Chapter 4 is the first of four
chapters, Chapters 4-7, presenting the findings from the analysis of the data collection
of this dissertation. The findings will then be discussed in Chapter 8, and lastly Chapter 9
will present theoretical discussion, contributions, implications, limitations, and the
conclusion.

Chapter 2 : Literature Review
The literature review considers a broad realm of research that underpins
understandings and explorations of teens’ boundary negotiations in the family context
in relation to ICTs. The complexity of both the technologies themselves, and teens’
varied and ubiquitous use of them, made it necessary to weave together research from
Library and Information Science (LIS), Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Psychology,
Communication, and Cultural and Media Studies to explore teens’ ICT Information
practices in the family context. The literature review begins by establishing the study’s
place within everyday life information seeking (ELIS) and discusses the most important
theoretical perspectives that inform this dissertation. It then discusses Latino/a teens’
ICT practices and issues involved in access, as well as research on teens’ information and
communicative practices. An overview of what is already known about how teens carve
out boundaries online and the shared spaces of the home is provided and the literature
review concludes with an examination of research on the parent/teen dynamic involved
in teens’ privacy, and the methods that parents use to mediate and monitor their
teenage children.

This study was grounded in the stream of research within LIS dedicated to ELIS.
ELIS began as a differentiation from research into work-related information seeking by
scholars who wanted to highlight the need to attend to non-work situations
(Savolainen,1995). These scholars conceptualized a new way of understanding
information and information behaviors that was rooted in how these figured in

10
individuals’ everyday lives (Dervin & Nilan, 1986). In the most popular model of ELIS,
Savolainen (1995) utilized Pierre Bourdieu’s (1984) concept of habitus to discuss how
individuals seek out information during the course of their everyday lives. He explained
that Bourdieu conceptualized habitus as “a socially and culturally determined system of
thinking, perception, and evaluation, internalized by the individual” (p.262-263) and
argued that individuals use this system to structure and organize their life so that they
are able to maintain their “way of life” and support their “mastery of life.” Savolainen
maintained that “way of life” referred the various kinds of activities that are a part of
the routines of everyday living, while “mastery of life” concerned individuals’ ability to
keep these routines of life in order and functioning. While Savolainen was most
interested in how the individual managed their daily routines, Nardi and O’Day (1999)
extend Savolainen’s model to examine how small “local environment[s]” maintain
normal everyday information routines. They “introduce the concept of the information
ecology to focus attention on relationships involving tools and people and their
practices” (p.50) and provide a metaphor that researchers can deploy to describe how
all of these facets come together in a particular “locality.” Jarvelin (2011) applied the
concept of an ecology to the individual, calling it the personal information ecology (PIE).
He proposed the PIE contains “all the channels, tools, services, documents, or resources
that a person can use for information access and organization” (p.20), as well as
subjective aspects that shape what individuals understand is available as a resource.
Scholars within ELIS demonstrated that to understand information behavior as it
exists within everyday lives it must be understood as a process people undergo to make

11
sense of their interactions with the world (Dervin, 1992). Researchers used innovative
methods to investigate how individual’s interactions with information are embedded in
their everyday life routines and found that their activities are not always purposeful.
Individuals continuously encounter information within their environment, including the
people, situations, and mass media they came into contact with, that they had not even
been previously aware that they needed (Williamson, 1998). Individual’s integration of
information was also conceptualized as being dependent on both context and their
group membership (Chatman, 1996, 1999, 2000; Pettigrew, 1996). Work by the above
scholars asserting that individuals’ information interactions are contextually situated
and assembled by individuals during the process of going about their everyday routines,
and that their competency in doing this will influence their “mastery of life” (Savolainen,
1995) support the need for an investigation into the types of practices that this might
constitute.
Elfreda Chatman’s (1996, 1999, 2000) “small world” theories were particularly
important to the dissertation. A small world is a “world in which everyday happenings
occur with some degree of predictability” (Chatman, 2000, p.3) and stability. In her
pioneering work, Chatman integrated theories from sociology and anthropology to look
at marginalized populations—elderly women (1991a), university janitors (1991b), and
female prisoners (1999)—that had been historically understudied within LIS. These
investigations provided her a vantage point to observe that their information behavior
was related to their group membership and went far beyond the type of purposeful
information seeking that much of LIS research had traditionally investigated and

12
included active information avoidance and manipulation. She argued that individuals
used their information behaviors to support the stability of their small worlds and they
determined what information to filter from the “set of socially determined attitudes and
norms” (Thompson, 1999, p. 120) within the group. In her later work Chatman
developed her theory of normative behavior in order to look more generally at how
individuals’ information interaction was influenced by their group membership in their
small worlds. Chatman described (Chatman, 2000) “the routine or common events that
characterize the everyday reality of people who share a similar cultural space” (p. 10) as
normative behavior and theorized that these routines for interacting with information in
relation to their group membership were assembled from the group’s worldview, social
norms, social types, and information behavior. Social norms are the standards for what
is seen as appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Worldview entails a collective idea
by the group of what is important and unimportant that helps members orient to
reality, information and the group. Social types are the categories of people that are
seen as belonging to the group and help members understand their own role within the
group. Information behavior involved individuals’ general orientation towards
information in the group and referred to "a state in which one may or may not act on
the information received" (p. 12) in response to their group membership.
Through Chatman’s (1996) research into the working poor, she also developed a
conceptual framework for understanding how small world “insiders” would react to
“outsiders,” that consists of deception, risk-taking, secrecy and situational relevance.
She found that in this community individuals would be secretive to protect themselves

13
from "unwanted intrusion" (p. 195) from outsiders and deceptive to present “outsiders”
with a picture of reality that was distorted, but presented them as they wanted to be
seen. She found that these behaviors were enacted because “insiders” felt that being
open with “outsiders” might put them at risk, which she called risk-taking. For this
reason, they would also only use new information if it was situationally relevant. This
framework hinted at the specific types of strategies that teenagers might use to
circumvent their parents’ monitoring and mediation if they felt their “small world”
membership in their peer groups to be at risk. Research has shown that teens use
differing levels of disclosure to manage the information that their parents find out about
them (Cumsille, Darling, & Martinez, 2010; Darling, Cumsille, Caldwell, & Dowdy, 2006;
Engels, Finkenauer, & van Kooten, 2006), which supports Chatman’s ideas on the role
individuals take in avoiding and manipulating information to present themselves as they
wish to be seen in order to sustain their group memberships. However, Chatman’s
small world theories are not a perfect fit. Chatman considered the small world to be a
closed unit and considerations of teens need to contend with their membership in
multiple “small worlds” and how they employ their information practices to protect
their membership within all of those groups. Modern teenagers’ worlds are constantly
moving and shifting (Marwick & boyd, 2014) and include people from differing offline
and online contexts that they are engaged with both in person and online through a
host of platforms that are accessed on an assortment of devices. Despite this
conceptual limitation other researchers have attempted to use Chatman’s theories to
study groups that are steeped in information and whose boundaries are much more

14
open, such as feminist booksellers and virtual communities (Burnett, Besant, &
Chatman, 2001), which suggested that her theories might also be useful with teenagers
in relation to their peer groups and families. Both of these groups are centered around
social norms that create ICT expectations for teens. Families also often have dense
information infrastructures and strong common worldviews. In addition, teens also a
very specific “social type” within the family group that influences their position of power
and accordingly their ideas of what is appropriate information to integrate and ability to
deviate from the family norm.
Agosto and Hughes-Hassell (2006a) built on the foundational ELIS work discussed
above to understand how the ELIS of urban, mostly African American, teenagers was
connected to their developmental context. They used Havighurst’s (1972)
developmental model to establish a theoretical model of urban teen development that
described seven developmental tasks that are salient to teenagers and guide their
interactions with information, including the fostering of the social self, the
establishment of an independent emotional self, the nurturing of a reflective self, the
adjustment to the physical self, the expression of the creative self, the understanding of
the cognitive self, and the recognition and development of the sexual self. They then
mapped these tasks onto 28 distinct information needs (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell,
2006b) that corresponded with literature involving non-minority teenagers. Agosto and
Hughes-Hassell’s (2006a, 2006b) work demonstrated the importance of teens’
emotional development to the types of information needs they had and argued that
“teenagers have similar information needs across socioeconomic, ethnic, cultural, and

15
geographic boundaries" (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006, p. 1425). However, the extent
of topical variation that might be experienced by these urban participants within these
broad categories was unclear. For instance, Meyers, et al (2009) discovered that while
African American urban tweens had many of the same information needs as their
majority culture counterparts they were more likely to discuss needing information on
how to cope with bullies, strangers, drug and alcohol users, and unsafe places.
Additionally, though Agosto & Hughes-Hassell presented the spectrum of information
needs experienced by urban teens and their connection with their development, the
authors did not address how these information needs fit into the contextual realities of
their lives. This opens up important questions about how teenagers’ developmental
need for autonomy from their parents and their need to establish a social self will
influence how they interact with technology and information and how minority
teenagers’ practices may be different than non-minority teenagers.
This research drew on the domestication of technology body of theory
(Silverstone, Hirsch, & Morley, 1992; Silverstone et al., 1989) in order to conceptualize
the information ecology of the family household. Domestication research has explored
a range of ICTs that are used in the household (Silverstone et al., 1992), as well as how
individual technologies have been incorporated into familial routines. This included the
home computer (Lally, 2002, Haddon, 2006; Morrison & Krugman, 2001), television
(Silverstone & Haddon, 1996), the Internet (Ward, 2005), and mobile phones (Haddon,
2003; Ling, 2004). Domestication work sets the foundation for this study’s premise that
each home will have a technological or culture that will structure the roles and the

16
practices that family members take up around ICTs. Silverstone et al. (1989) proposed
that the family technological culture includes “the set of values and activities that define
[that] family’s systematic relationship to the technologies within its own domestic
environment and to those technologies which impinge on that environment” (p. 22).
According to Silverstone et al.;
the media pose a whole set of control problems for the household, problems of
regulation and boundary maintenance. These are expressed generally in the
broader public through the regular cycle of moral panics around new media or
new media content, but on an everyday level, in individual households, they are
expressed through decisions to include and exclude media content and to
regulate within the household who watches what who listens to and plays with
and uses what (p. 20).
Using this framework as a guide the technological culture was understood to provide a
foundation for the parent/teen dynamic through the practices parents chose to use to
mediate and monitor their teenagers’ interactions with ICTs and the information
practices teens used to negotiate the family context. Silverstone et al. (1989) argue that
family is structured around the patterns of behavior that have become ingrained in the
practices and rituals of the family’s everyday life. The practices and technology that
become incorporated into the routines of the family are grounded in part on the stories
that each family tells itself about itself (Silverstone et al.,1989). These family
mythologies serve as the backdrop for the family’s interactions with technology and
create the social norms about what its members think are appropriate for different
members, such as that technology is seen as the realm of the males in the household,
that teens are seen as knowing more than their parents, or that policing technology is
seen as a part of the mother’s job. Moreover, they contend that within each family’s

17
story is also a story of how they are different from other families, and these differences
can tell us a lot about how culture, ideology, class, race, and ethnicity manifest
themselves in the materialities of everyday life (Morely &Silverstone, 1990).
Latino/a Teens
Though ELIS researchers highlight the importance of context and culture
(Chatman, 1996, 1999, 2000; Pettigrew, 1996; Williamson, 1998) there is a lack of work
exploring Latino/a teens. This is important because research from outside LIS has
indicated that Latinos/as often have different ICT usage patterns than their majorityculture counterparts (Katz, 2010; Lombano-Bermudez, 2015; Vickery, 2015). Katz has
also shown that lower income and marginalized Latino/a teens’ information practices
are often drastically different from that of their middle-income peers. Looking at
second-generation Latino/Hispanic teenagers in Texas, Lombano-Bermudez
demonstrated that they had particular patterns of interacting with ICTs that meant
“their participation in new media culture” was often only peripheral (p. viii).
Additionally, Latino/a immigrant teens often have language and technical skills that are
superior to their parents and the added responsibility of using media to broker their
parents’ connections to their communities (Katz, 2010, 2014) and responsibilities to
monitor and mediate their siblings’ media use (Clark, 2009)1. Latino/a parents have also

1

These issues will be covered in more detail in Chapter 4.

18
been found to have different parenting styles (Guillermo- Ramos et al., 2007; Rodriguez,
Donovick, & Crowley, 2009) that influence how their children take up ICTs (Tripp, 2011).
Data from the Pew Internet and American Life Project shows that Latino/a teens
are just as likely as their non-minority peers to have smart phones, and to use SM and
text messaging, but they also found that Latino/as had less access to desktop computers
and game consoles and were much more likely to use Google Plus (Google +,
https://plus.google.com), messaging apps, anonymous apps, and video chat (Lenhart et
al., 2015). It is important to consider what this information may conceal, beginning with
access itself.
Variations of Access
Though most researchers have progressed beyond considerations of mere access
to sophistication of use, for many individuals and families access is still an issue. While
59% of Hispanic homes have an Internet subscription, this drops to 35% in Spanish
dominant homes and 33% when considering homes of those with less than a high school
education (Smith, 2015). The lack of a home Internet connection can diminish the
quality of teens’ participation on the Internet. Jenkins (2006) has argued that the
mastery to participate with the new types of social interactions that are enabled by new
media activities depends on being able to access the Internet in a more extensive way
than is generally possible outside of the home. Furthermore, Pearce and Rice (2008)
found that teens that only accessed the Internet from their mobile device engaged in
less "capital enhancing" activities.

19
Beyond the physical inequities in access, there are inequities in ability.
Researchers interested in issues of access emphasize the importance of attending to the
quality of use (Livingston & Helsper, 2008; Hargittai, 2010) because “differentiated
usage patterns among the connected have the potential to contribute to social
inequality" (Hargittai, 2010, p.94). Hargittai has called this a second-level divide.
Livingstone and Helsper have developed a four-step system for measuring gradations of
use: a) basic users use the Internet solely for information seeking, b) moderate users
add in games and email, c) broad users add instant messaging (IM) and download music,
and d) all-rounders do all of the above, also adding creative uses. Hargittai, E., Connell,
S., Klawitter, E. F., and Litt, E. (2014) assert that participating creatively in Internet
activities, such as “editing Wikipedia to taking part in online forum discussions, posting
reviews and voting on others’ content” (p.1) are far from universal activities and tend to
be concentrated in privileged populations of teenagers, such as those with highly
educated parents. For instance, Lombano-Bermudez (2015) found that ICTs were
helping second generation Latino/a teens integrate, but that they had often not
developed their competency. Jenkins (2006) calls this a “participation gap” and
highlights the important of focusing on the ways “cultural protocols and practices” (p.
23) contribute to this inequality. Lloyd (2010) has argued that information literacy
needs to be understood in terms of “practical understandings (knowing how to do
things like searching for information), rules (explicit formulations that direct how a thing
is done or what counts) and teleoaffective structures (the overarching purpose, mood or
feelings that are linked to tasks).” (p.246).

20
In addition, having the ability to access the Internet does not mean having equal
access. Gonzalez (2016) has highlighted the importance of looking beyond immediate
connections to the Internet to the continuity of their connections. In interviews with
low-income individuals, participants often spoke of times when their various
connections to the Internet broke down and they experienced disruptions. These
disruptions had real consequences for their ability to access information, and also
negatively influenced how these individuals felt about technology.
Parents’ Place in Teen’s Information Practices
Literature that discusses the boundary negotiation between parents and teens
often describes parents’ anxiety that their children’ technological skill surpasses their
own (Erickson, Wisniewski, Xu, Carroll, Rosson, & Perkins, 2015). Todays’ teens are
often described in popular media as “digital natives,” (Prensky, 2001) believed to have
vast comprehension of technology and information, and to be more knowledgeable
than their parents. This claim has been disputed (Bilal, Erdelez, Beheshti, & Todd, 2012;
Hargittai, 2010), and research has shown that parents are still an important presence in
teens’ information lives (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2005; Foss et al, 2013; Meyers et al.,
2009). Foss et al. (2013) found that 61% of the adolescents (14 to 17 year-olds)
reported that they were highly influenced by their mothers in their technological
interactions, while another 7% mentioned their fathers. These teens said that their
mothers regularly worked with them on the computer and provided them with
assistance with finding sources, and rules and guidelines for doing searches, and help
formulating search terms. Numerous studies also reported that parents were among

21
teens’ most important sources (Meyers et al., 2009; Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2005).
However, complicating the parent/teen information dynamic is the fact that parents are
also potent information barriers in teens’ lives. For example, Meyers et al. report adult
authority, oversight and monitoring as hindrances to tweens’ (9 to 13 year-olds)
information seeking. Moreover, parents have consistently reported monitoring and
restricting their adolescents’ media use (Yardi & Bruckman, 2011). Looking specifically
at Latino/a teens, Tripp (2011) revealed that the anxiety parents felt about technology
and the Internet meant that they were often highly restrictive of their children's
Internet use, confining their use to school work, and thereby limiting online
opportunities. Though adult-driven activities provided teens with ways to learn about
the opportunities available online for media production, they often failed to provide
teens with interest-driven activities that can help motivate teens to develop more
thorough capabilities and discover new interests (Tripp & Herr-Stephenson, 2009; Ito et
al., 2008).
Social Nature of Teens’ Information Practices
Many youth spend an inordinate amount of their day on their devices consuming
media and communicating with others. In a recent Pew Research Center study of teens’
Internet and technology use, Lenhart et al. (2015) found that 88% have access to a
mobile or smart phone, 73% had their own smart phone, 87% have access to a desktop
or laptop computer, 58% have access to tablet computers, 81% have access to game
consoles, 92% go online daily, 91% use text messaging, 89% use SM, and 71% use
multiple SM sites. Teens are using these devices and their access to the Internet to

22
consume a large quantity of media and communicate with their social groups. Rideout
et al. (2010) report that youth spend on average 7 hours and 38 minutes a day
consuming media, and because of multitasking actually consume 10 hours and 45
minutes of media during that time and Lenhart et al. (2015) finds that the typical teen
sends 30 texts a day. Despite teens’ inundation in media and communications their
information behavior has generally been defined narrowly as intentionally seeking out
specific “useful” information. This definition means that much of the information work
that is done by adolescents to maintain their information saturated daily existence has
been invisible to research. There has, however, been a developing acknowledgement of
how important the social nature of information use is for teens. For instance, in their
work on tweens, Meyers et al. (2009) found that the youth in their study usually started
a quest to find information by talking with their peers and then continued to assemble
information through various other interpersonal interactions until their problem was
solved. To do this they used phones, IM, and email but generally preferred talking in
person. Teens’ information habits are also often shaped by their friends’ habits. In their
study, Foss et al. (2013) found that though the younger children in their earlier study
never spoke of being influenced by their peers 55% of adolescents spoke of their
searching and computer habits being influenced by their friends. They also found that
for some teens SM and communication sites were their primary activity regardless of
whether they were searching for information or not. These teens tended to use the
social functions of sites to fulfill any activity they were involved with and would pull the
computer and the Internet into most of their offline activities with their friends. Ito et

23
al. (2008) have described how teens’ information practices are both interest and
friendship driven and embedded in a "broader social and cultural ecology"(p.6). Taken
together, this research makes it apparent that there is a need to reconsider what ELIS
researchers consider information and information behaviors in regards to teens because
like Foss et al. say, "[s]ocial computer use and use of social networking sites do involve
access of information, even if the information pertains not to schoolwork but to popular
culture and friends’ activities" (Foss et al., 2013, p.185). For instance, Ito and associates
have found that much of teens 'making sense' does not consist of directed informationseeking, but of learning while participating with social others in activities like building a
profile on Facebook and chatting on IM. From their work, it is evident that teens’
information practices are intricately intertwined with their social lives and that this
interconnection must be accounted for within any consideration of modern teens’
everyday information practices.
Social Norms and Teens’ Communicative Practices
Within the broader field of LIS there are some interesting studies that consider
teens’ communicative practices within their various social groups. Researchers have
attempted to understand the complex ways teens’ communicative information practices
are intertwined with their social behaviors. In their exploratory study with 21 high
school seniors, Read, Shah, O’Brien, and Woolcott (2012) found teens’ stable network
were composed of various groups that ranged from very intimate friends to a broad
group that included everyone they had met during the course of their lives. The entire
social network tended to mimic the makeup of teens’ Facebook friends, which generally

24
included most of the people in all their groups. Read et al. say that "[a]dolescents are
increasingly dependent on technically mediated modes of interaction for defining social
roles and functioning" (Read et al., 2012, p. 489). The methods teens used to
communicate with the various groups within their social network were an important
way they expressed their social roles. The use of ICTs both reflected and helped to
construct the social norms for interacting with the varied groups to which teens
belonged, such as expectations of continuous contact (Clark, 2013), rules around how to
choose friends and whom it is socially acceptable to reject (Ito et al., 2008, boyd, 2007),
and which ICT should be used when (Agosto et al., 2012). For instance, speaking faceto-face was generally reserved for the most intimate friends (Read et al, 2012), texting
was used for a core group of close family and friends (Ishii, 2006), Facebook was used to
communicate with broader group of less intimate friends, and email as used for more
formal communication with teachers and employers (Agosto et al., 2012). Different
communication styles were also used according to differing relationships and groups.
Each group had its own domain and “its own clearly articulated style and mode of
communication" (p.496) and teens often they often communicated differently with
different groups. boyd and Marwick (2011) also found a gendered component in what
individual teens felt was appropriate to share online that conformed with traditional
notions of femininity and masculinity.
In a qualitative study of six focus groups in which Agosto et al. (2012) sought to
understand the social rules that governed why teens chose certain social networks and
ICTs to communicate. They found that the teens decided on their ICTs along six factors

25
that included social factors, relationship factors, self-protection factors, recipient
factors, information/communication factors, and systems factors. Within these factors
they found that participants used the closeness of the relationship, the size of the
audience, the rules, norms and beliefs of their social groups, their need to protect
themselves online, their need for privacy, to control the onslaught of communication,
the urgency of a communication, the affordances of the ICT, and the technical knowhow
and level of access of the recipient, among others, to decide which ICT to use. These
findings demonstrate the importance of context and the complexity that goes into their
decision making.
Taken together, the extant research discussed above demonstrates that
communicative practices are an integral part of the social norms that bind teens’ social
worlds together and that they provide the means by which teens move between their
differing social contexts and attempt to keep them separate. Teens use of all these
factors to make their ICT decisions demonstrate they combining their personal goals
with an understanding of the features or affordances of the various ICTs they are using
and wielding this knowledge to participate in a way that conforms with the social norms
of their various groups and helps them to control their personal boundaries. The
dissertation sought to build on this work by exploring teens’ use of ICTs as boundary
facilitating resources more explicitly.
Conceptualizing teens’ boundary negotiations. Privacy research in relation to
teens; privacy generally follows two threads that both focus on the threats that the
online environment poses for children (Marwick et al., 2010). The first is about the risks

26
children face online from corporate entities that use the information they share for their
own profit-driven means (Moscardelli & Liston-Heyes, 2004; Youn, 2009). The second
concerns how teens’ increasing presence online makes them vulnerable to sexual
solicitation, contact with unknown others, online harassment, and inappropriate
content (Lenhart & Madden, 2007; Palfrey, Sacco, boyd, & Debonis, 2008; Youn, 2009).
These fears have set off a “technopanic” about teens and privacy (Marwick, 2008) that
stereotypes them as not caring about privacy and serves as a frame for institutional and
PM and monitoring (Marwick et al. 2010).
Teens are often seen to be “reckless” with their information online (Notten &
Nikken, 2016), but this is an oversimplified understanding of teens’ privacy behaviors.
Research shows that teens are concerned with privacy. They understand that there are
risks to their SM participation (boyd, 2014; Christofides, Muise, & Desmarais, 2011;
Clarke, 2009; Moscardelli & Liston-Heyes, 2004) and they do make attempts to
safeguard it (Madden, et al., 2013). They are however, sometimes lacking in information
(Moscardelli & Liston-Heyes, 2004) and confused about the best ways to protect their
privacy (Livingstone, 2008). Teens are also generally more interested in what privacy can
accomplish for their lives, than in the abstract concept itself (Marwick et al., 2010). For
teens, "privacy is about being in control of their own actions, information, and choices,
including the ability to share personal information online and participate in online
socializing" (Marwick et al. p. 11) in their everyday lives. This includes the ability to share
information with some people and keep it from others.

27
Altman (1975) conceptualized privacy as a social boundary construction practice.
He viewed privacy as a dialectical process in which people have different desired levels
of privacy for different settings or contexts and will use different mechanisms to adjust
their boundaries to the current situation. "Privacy is, therefore, a changing process
whereby people attempt to regulate their openness/closedness to others" (Altman &
Chemers, 1980, p.75) in relation to their current context. Building on Altman, Petronio
(2002) developed the Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory to describe
the communicative practices that people use to hide, present, and manage the
information that others have about them. In the CPM theory managing private
information is seen primarily as a boundary regulating process and privacy is defined as
the feeling that one has the right to own private information, either personally or
collectively; consequently, boundaries mark ownership lines for individuals” (Petronio,
2002, p. 6).
The balance between sharing enough information and revealing too much is
particularly precarious in the digital world (Palen & Dourish, 2003) because the
properties of digital media mean that "[i]nformation that was once scattered,
forgettable, and localized within small local groups is becoming widespread, permanent
and searchable" (Marwick, Murgia-Diaz, & Palfrey, 2010. p. 51). However, while the
properties of digital media make negotiating privacy difficult (boyd, 2007) individuals
still attempt to maintain what Nissenbaum (2004) calls “contextual integrity.”
Nissenbaum (2004) argued that different contexts have different rules about the
information that is appropriate within that realm and how the information can then be

28
distributed beyond that context that shape individuals’ expectations of privacy. She
reasoned individuals feel that their privacy has been breached when information is
shared (or viewed) outside of the original context in which it was first shared. This
understanding of privacy has not generally been taken up by ICT researchers. The failure
to understand privacy from teens’ perspectives is largely due to the fact that privacy
research has been designed by adults (Marwick, et. al, 2010; Agosto & Abbas, 2015) and
framed from within adult fears for their children. Recently, however, there has been a
turn in privacy research to work that attends to teens’ privacy as a social issue, rather
than as simply an institutional or safety issue (Vickery, 2015).
Social privacy strategies. Social privacy research has most often focused on the
strategies teens use to cope with the collapsed contexts of the online environment.
Collapsed contexts refer to an individual’s online applications, such as Facebook, being
populated by people from different life settings, such as parents, friends, and coworkers
(Marwick & boyd, 2011). It is in human nature to communicate differently with
different people in different contexts (Goffman, 1972), however “[t]echnology
complicates our metaphors of space and place, including the belief that audiences are
separate from each other” (Marwick & boyd, 2011, p. 2) or that it is even possible to
know who is a part of the online audience. Oolo and Siibak (2013) conducted focus
groups to investigate how teens perceived their online audiences and found that teens
had little idea who was in their audience. Yet, researchers have found teens are
uncomfortable with their personal information being accessed by unintended audiences
(Agosto & Abbas, 2015) and social privacy researchers have described finding they have

29
a variety of strategies to cope with unintended audiences and construct privacy in the
online space (boyd, 2010; boyd & Marwick, 2011; Marwick & boyd, 2014; Oolo & Siibak,
2013, Siibak & Murumaa, 2011). boyd and Marwick (2011) note that teens’ strategies
include both social and structural practices and Oolo and Siibak have categorized them
as self-censorship, strategic information sharing, and social steganography
Self- censorship, social steganography, and the related “subtweeting” are social
strategies that teens use to attempt to communicate with an intended audience and
control how they are perceived by people outside of that audience. Oolo and Siibak
(2013) indicate that teens often think about whether what they intend to post would be
appropriate for “adult acquaintances” and relatives and censor their posts accordingly.
Another way that teens deal with the ambiguous “invisible audience” is social
steganography. Social steganography entails “encoding” text so that only the intended
audience will understand it (boyd, 2010; boyd & Marwick, 2011; ; Oolo & Siibak, 2013;
Siibak & Murumaa, 2011). To do this, teens often post quotes and song lyrics that they
think only some of their audience has the knowledge to interpret (boyd & Marwick,
2011; Siibak & Murumaa, 2011). Marwick and boyd (2014) note that teens also engage
in an extension of this practice that teens themselves refer to as “subtweeting.”
Subtweeting consists of posts that encode talk about personal drama or conflicts using
“obscure references” and pronouns instead of names (p.9). An example they provide of
such a post is, “[w]hy do u post pictures on Instagram of yourself in the morning when u
look so ratchet” (p.9). Posts like this one are meant to be understood by the person they
are about and sometimes by a small group that is in the know, but are also meant to be

30
unintelligible to outsiders and provide the poster with “plausible deniability” (Marwick
& boyd, 2014, p.9).
Some teens also attempt to use structural means to make the audience more
manageable and be more strategic about what information gets shared with whom
(Oolo & Siibak, 2013; Marwick & boyd, 2014). For instance, the Pew Internet &
American Life Project reports that 74% of teens have deleted people from their friends,
58% have blocked people on other sites, 59% have deleted something they posted in
the past, 53% have deleted other people’s comments to their page, and 45% have
removed a tag from a picture that was a posted of them (Madden et al., 2013). Some
teens also separate their Facebook “friends” into groups, which helps them to
communicate differently with different groups by avoiding context collapse (Read et al.,
2011). Others use their privacy settings to manage who is able to see their posts,
though some teens would rather share less than isolate themselves in this way (Oolo &
Siibak, 2013). boyd and Marwick (2011) describe how one of their participants even
deactivated her account while she was not using it, though they point out that this is an
unusual strategy.
One of the most common structural methods teens use to strategically share
information with different audiences is the use of different platforms to talk to different
groups (boyd & Marwick, 2011; Vickery, 2015). Teens do this to resist the collapsed
contexts they need to contend with on sites like Facebook and "reach different
audiences, explore different identities, and form different communities" (Vickery,
p.289). They have also been found to segregate their conversations because of their

31
perceptions of the privacy of different platforms (Agosto & Abbas, 2015; Marwick &
boyd, 2014; Oolo & Siibak, 2013). Oolo and Siibak (2013) discovered that teens
considered certain topics to be too personal to be shared on Facebook, but were often
more open in their public blogs since there were less obvious clues as to adult
readership. Teens were also found to be especially open on Instant Messenger (IM)
since they perceived it to be faster and more intimate.
Privacy differences. Vickery has expanded on the findings of other social privacy
researchers to look specifically at how economics influences the types of strategies that
teens take up. In her study of 18 low-income “non-dominant” teens’ privacy in relation
to SM and mobile phones, Vickery found that their circumstances led to unique privacy
challenges. She calls the participants in her study “non-dominant” because they are
mostly non-white and are from “a low-performing, economically challenged, and
ethnically diverse high school in central Texas” (p. 284). Non-dominant teens are often
monitored differently than middle-class white teens (Kelly, 2003) and are more likely to
share bedrooms and devices (Vickery, 2015). Vickery found that mobile phone access
among these teens was not about having one or not, but was instead more temporal in
that it was about having one right now. To get around the privacy complications
associated with sharing devices, many teens erased most of their communications as
they happened. Others used alternative devices such as the iPod touch or Nintendo DS
to text message. Some teens even chose not to use certain technologies in order to
resist the “power, pressures, and expectations that encourage them to be ‘always-on’”
(p.287) and to disassociate from peers that behaved “inappropriately” online.

32
Parents as audience. There is very little research specifically devoted to social
privacy in relation to parents or about how teens feel about their parents’ monitoring.
Most of the research on social privacy looks at teens across all contexts, of whom
parents are only one subsection. This is true even though teens have been shown to be
most concerned about privacy in relation to parents and other authority figures (Herring
2008; Ito et al. 2008; Livingstone 2006). The research that does discuss parents
generally focuses on how context collapse in certain online spaces pose particular
challenges for teens in regards to their parents (boyd, 2014). Parents often use the
public nature of social network sites (SNS) to monitor their teenage children and
research has found that 80% of the parents on a SNS with a child on a SNS have
“friended” their child (Madden, et al., 2012). While Child and Westerman (2013) found
in an online survey that most teens accept their parents’ Facebook friend requests and
generally do not use privacy settings to limit their access, in focus groups, Madden et al.
(2012) learned that many teens had mixed feelings about being Facebook “friends” with
their parents. Teens conceived of the Internet as a private space in which they could
socialize with their peers and resented their parents’ efforts to infringe on it (Ito et al.,
2008). West, Lewis, and Currie (2009) found that youth believed their parents should
not be a part of the public SM audience.). Teens were quick to point out that that their
need for privacy was not because they had anything to hide or were doing anything
wrong (boyd & Marwick, 2011; Vickery, 2015), they simply wanted “to control the
context in which information [was] disclosed and shared” (Vickery, p. 282). Teens felt
that when parents monitored their online presence they were ignoring the boundaries

33
that are implied by different social contexts (boyd, 2014). To teens the issue was “not
whether someone can listen in, but whether one should” (boyd, p. 58).
Privacy in physical space. Physical space is another important realm for
research into how teens use ICTs to construct privacy in the family context. Since most
of the social privacy research is focused on teens’ online participation, this area has
been mostly neglected. However, numerous studies on PM and monitoring have
demonstrated that parents regularly use the physical spaces of the household to help
them restrict and regulate their children’s use of ICTs (e.g., Brush & Inkpen, 2007;
Erickson et al., 2015; Yardi & Bruckman, 2011, 2012). This suggested that physical space
would conversely be an important component in teens’ construction of privacy within
the household.
One popular way that teens deal with the need for privacy in their households is
by creating individualized spaces for themselves in their bedrooms (Lincoln, 2014; Ling &
Thrane, 2001; Livingstone, 2007a; Livingstone & Bovill, 2001). As adolescents get older
their bedrooms become more and more like independent personal living spaces (Ling &
Thrane, 2001). Livingstone (2007a) says the personal bedroom provides adolescents
with somewhere to collect and store personal items, a personal space where they are
not under scrutiny, a space in which to enact identity, and a platform from which to
interact in their peer culture. However, it is important to note that not all teens’ have
the privilege of a private bedroom. Vickery (2015) found that the nondominant teens
that participated in her study were more likely to share bedrooms than the majority

34
culture teens that have usually been studied. Sharing bedrooms should change the
dynamics around how teens carve out privacy in the home.
Mobile use of technologies problematizes the division between public and
private space in the home by providing a means for teenagers to construct
individualized spaces in the presence of other family members. In her study of Japanese
teenagers’ use of mobile phones, Ito (2005) explained how mobile phones helped teens
assemble a private space within the public spaces of the home. She described how
mobile phones have allowed Japanese teens, who generally have much less personal
space in the home than American teens, to escape parental and sibling surveillance, and
provide for a semblance of non-physical personal space within the physical space they
are sharing with their family. However, while new media create the possibility for
family members to have the feeling of private space even while they are physically
together (Livingstone, 2007b), they also expose these activities and the information
therein to the family members that are present. In order to deal with this visibility, the
teens in Ito’s (2005) study controlled how their mobile use appeared to their parents by
always answering their phones out of earshot of their parents and therefore never
inadvertently revealing any information to them. In this way, Ito says, teens could use
their mobiles to circumvent parental power without upsetting the power dynamic.
Similarly, Grinter and Palen (2002) found that teens could use IM while their parents
were in the same physical space by keeping IM windows closed and turning off the
notification sound. Like this, teens could use IM to get around both natural and social
constraints.

35
Another way that teens create both physical and nonphysical personal spaces for
themselves is by upsetting the expectation that they can always be reached. Ito (2005)
said that while mobile phones let youth subvert the power dynamics of institutional
constraints, they were also "accompanied by new sets of social expectations and
manners" (p. 11). Under the expectation to be "continuously available" to both family
and friends, teens had developed communicative practices to escape these
expectations, such as the good night text or a text that indicated they would be doing
something specific like taking the subway that were then to be understood to others as
an indication of unavailability. Grinter and Palen (2002) also related that teens used the
technical features of the IM system to make it look as though they were not available
when they actually were, in order to help mitigate any hurt feelings that might accrue
from a nonresponse. Teens seemed to believe that “availability is implied by presence”
and they took actions to create technical boundaries that would not threaten their
social relations (Grinter & Palen, p.28).
Parental Influence and Family Context
The research discussed in the preceding section provides a solid foundation of
findings on teens’ social privacy. This research indicated that teens use ICTs to protect
their boundaries and to help maintain their social relationships, but said little about how
they do this within the family context. Beyond the complications of securing privacy
online, within the family there are the added complications of sharing a culture, a living
space, and devices, along with parents and family having the proximity and opportunity
to inspect the traces of teens’ activities that are stored in various devices, as well as the

36
power dynamic that sets up parents as entitled to their children’s information. The next
section will review literature related to the teen/parent dynamic and PM and
monitoring.
Parent/teen dynamics. Families have a unique ecosystem of routines,
boundaries and rules that structure the way individual members orient themselves to
everyday life, one another and technology (Silverstone et al, 1989), that begin to shift
when children enter adolescence (Ling & Yttri, 2004). During adolescence, teens begin
to need more autonomy from their parents (Havighurst, 1972; Petronio, 2002; Smetana,
Campione-Barr, & Metzger, 2006) and naturally use the ICTs that have become such a
big part of modern youth culture to carve out some independence and connect with
their peers (boyd, 2014). Parents, however, have a variety of fears about their
children’s use of ICTs (Livingstone et al., 2012) and are also often orienting their
parenting to a cultural environment in which parenting children’s use of media is seen
as an indication of how “good” a parent one is (Hoover et al., 2004). Though parents
and teens both tend to agree that teens need some degree of privacy, they often
disagree about the boundaries of parental monitoring (Cranor, Durity, Marsh, & Ur,
2014). For instance, Cranor et al. found that teens felt that their phones and particularly
their text messages should be “off limits,” while parents felt that there was no space
that should be out of bounds. Smetana et al. (2006) also found that parents consistently
felt their children had more of an obligation to disclose information than did their
children. These disagreements between teens and their parents about the level of
autonomy teens should have or the level of authority parents should have can cause

37
turbulence in their relationships (Smetana & Asquith, 1994) and spur more secrecy on
the part of adolescents (Smetana et al., 2006).
In response to this newfound secrecy in their adolescent children, Petronio
(1994) found that parents often attempt to learn more information about their
adolescent children in both direct and subversive ways and that children tend to defend
against these invasive behaviors in both confrontational and evasive ways. Looking at
the open-ended responses of emerging adults, Ledbetter et al (2010) updated Petronio's
(1994) typology in light of modern technology and found that modern parents
participated in spatial invasions, telephone invasions, computer invasions, and verbal
invasions. They also found emerging adults reported defensive behaviors in all of these
categories.
While parental monitoring has been associated with positive outcomes (Laird,
Pettit, Dodge, & Bates, 2003; Steinberg, Lamborn, Dornbusch, & Darling, 1992) and less
deviant behaviors (DiClemente et al., 2001; Hayes, Smart, Toumbourou, & Sanson,
2004), parental monitoring can also induce teens to share less with parents than they
normally would (Hawk, Keijsers, Hale, & Meeus, 2009). Conversely, parental trust and
respect for their adolescent children’s privacy can often lead to beneficial results. For
example, Sorbring and Lunden (2012) found that parents that engaged with their
teenage children and also trusted them to behave appropriately online had more insight
into their online experiences. Establishing a good relationship with teens may also lead
teens to disclose more with parents (Smetana, 2008). Kerr and Stanton (2000) found

38
that parents’ knowledge of who their children associate with, where they are, and what
they are doing is largely due to their children’s willingness to disclose information about
themselves and their activities to their parents rather than their parents’ attempts to
monitor them.
Other researchers have built on this important finding and uncovered that teens
have a broad range of techniques that they use to vary their levels of disclosure to
parents, such as voluntarily disclosing, partially disclosing, lying, only disclosing
information when specifically asked, and by avoiding disclosure by avoiding the issue
(Cumsille, Keijsers & Laird, 2010; Darling, Cumsille, Caldwell, & Dowdy, 2006; Darling, &
Martinez, 2010; Engels, Finkenauer, & van Kooten, 2006). These findings highlight the
complexity of how teens’ need for privacy plays out within the family. Teens do not just
hide their information, or close off access, they attempt to manage the access their
parents have to them and their information in such a way that they are able to present
themselves as they wish to be seen in order to maintain their relationships (Petronio,
2012) and create personal space for themselves. Petronio states that, “[a]t the core of
privacy management is the need to be connected to family members while retaining a
sense of autonomy apart from those members” (p. 175).
There are a handful of studies that explore the parent/teen boundary
negotiation process in relation to technology. Most of these studies explore the issue
from the parental perspective (Yardi & Bruckman, 2011; 2012; Yardi, 2012), but there
are a few studies that have accounted for both parents’ and teens’ perspectives

39
(Ammari, Kumar, Lampe, & Schoenebeck, 2015; Burke, Adamic, & Marciniak, 2013; Child
& Westermann, 2013; Cranor et al., 2014; Erickson et al., 2015; Livingstone, Ólafsson,
O’Neill, & Donoso, 2012; Sorbring & Lundin, 2012). These have concerned
communication between parents and teens on Facebook (Burke et al., 2013),
acceptance of parents’ friend requests by young adults on Facebook (Child &
Westerman, 2013), parental sharing of information about children on teens (Amari, et
al., 2015), and the level of insight parents had into their children’s Internet activities
(Sorbring & Lundin, 2012). Cranor et al. (2014) and Erickson et al. (2015) focused
specifically on the parent teen negotiation of privacy. From their interviews with both
parents and teens Cranor et al. found they while both agreed that teens had some
limited right to privacy they disagreed about the how far this privacy should extend. The
authors proposed that much of the “gap” between how parents and teens viewed
privacy could be attributed to whether parents viewed their teens’ online privacy in the
same way that they saw their privacy in physical spaces, with those that viewed them
similarly feeling they had more right to infringe on their teens’ online environment.
Erickson et al. (2015), extended these findings through their use of 12 parent/teen
dyads as the unit of analysis. This allowed them to gain a better understanding of “the
complex, dialectal boundary negotiation process between parents and teens,” as they
manifested in particular dyads (p. 4). Erickson et al. found that parents influenced their
teens’ behaviors, but not in any straightforward way. Teens with parents that had a high
degree of control over them were often very accommodating about allowing their
parents access, but these teens then also often had less access to technology and more

40
limited online experiences. Though they found that some teens with very controlling
parents rebelled and took “subversive measures” to assert their own autonomy (p.14),
the authors note that for the most part the “boundaries were defined but negotiable"
(p.6) and would only go to extremes in certain situations. The variations that were
uncovered in the parent/teen dynamic may point to an underlying difference in these
families’ technological cultures or parenting styles.
Parenting styles. In her seminal paper Baumrind (1966) identified three different
parenting styles: authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive, to which negligent was
later added as a fourth style (Maccoby & Martin, 1983). Authoritative parents are
understood to have levels of authority and warmth. Authoritarian parents have high
levels of authority and low levels of warmth and permissive parents had high levels of
warmth and low levels of authority. However, there is little understanding of how these
parenting styles apply to Latino/a parents. Latino/a parents have been described both
as authoritarian (Darling & Steinberg, 1993; Hammer & Turner, 1990) and permissive
(Julian, McKenry, & McKelvey, 1994) in the literature. Rodriguez, Donovick, and Crowley
(2009) contend that Latino/ parents do not fit into these categories. Halgunseth, Ipsa,
and Rudy, (2006) argue that the variations found in Latino/a parenting styles are based
on parenting goals that prioritize familial closeness, respect, and the provision of a
moral education. Additionally, though the use of an authoritative parenting style has
been connected to positive outcomes, researchers have found that the connection
between the two did not hold in Latino/a families (Lindahl & Malik, 1999; Park & Bauer,
2002). Rodriguez et al. argue that it is the inclusion of autonomy granting in connection

41
with parenting styles that has led to inaccuracies in investigations of Latino/a parenting
style because Latino/a parents often grant their teens less autonomy. Stewart and Bond
(2002) have reasoned that parental dimensions—warmth, demandingness, and
autonomy granting—are more helpful indicators as they can be applied across cultures.
Parental mediation (PM). How parents manage their children’s relations with
media has been defined more specifically as PM within the communication literature
devoted to media effects (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008). This research has generally
been done in the positivist tradition, with quantitative methods, While researchers are
now beginning to consider PM in relation to the Internet (Livingston & Helsper, 2008;
Kirwil, 2009; Lee, 2012; Lee & Chae, 2012), video games (Nikken & Janz, 2006; Shin &
Huh, 2011; Jiow, Lim, & Lin, 2016), mobile phones (Clark & Sywyj, 2012), smart phones
(Mascheroni, 2014) and a range of devices (Yardi & Bruckman, 2011; Yardi & Bruckman,
2012; Ames, Go, Kaye, & Spasojevic; 2011; Clark, 2013), PM has most often been
considered in relation to children’s television use (e.g., Borzekowski & Robinson, 2007;
Lemish, 2008; Nathanson, 1999; Valkenburg, Krcmar, Peeters, & Marseille, 1999), where
researchers have traditionally conceived of three types of PM styles: active/instructive,
watching and discussing television with children, restrictive, setting rules and guidelines
for watching television, and co-viewing, watching television with children (Nathanson,
1999; Valkenburg et al., 1999).
Livingstone and Helsper (2008) show that parents employ similar mediation
styles for monitoring their children’s online behaviors and identify four types of

42
mediation strategies based on those developed in television-related research. These
strategies are active co-use, which involves sitting with one’s children while they use the
Internet and engaging them in instructive interactions about their use, as well as three
restrictive strategies that include restrictions on who children can interact with, rules
restricting use, and restrictions that are enforced using technical tools. They also found
that parents engaged in monitoring, which included the ongoing monitoring of the
websites that their children visit as well as their online communications (e.g., chat
messages and social networking activities). Zaman et al. (2016) assert that parents use
supervision in conjunction with deference to grant their children some autonomy over
their interactions with ICTs, but also stay involved.
In their study of parenting teens’ various technology use, Yardi and Bruckman
(2011) also found that parents placed restrictions on the time of day technologies could
be used, the frequency with which they could be used, and where they could be used. In
her study of the PM of smartphones in Italian homes, Mascheroni (2014), observed that
while parents did use technical restrictions, both permissive and authoritarian parents
were uncomfortable with the idea of these types of “external constraints” (p. 453).
Instead they often attempted to control smartphone use by “limiting time or context of
use” (p.450), such as during dinner or homework. Parents also sometimes explicitly
barred access to the Internet while outside the home or did this implicitly by using “pay
as you go” methods that made communications costlier.
Differences in PM. While all families seem to accept that they have a
responsibility to parent their children’s technology and media use (Hoover, Clark, &

43
Alters, 2004) there are large variations between families in the adoption of PM
practices. A family’s structure, economic circumstances, culture, and availability of
parents for family interactions play a big part in what types of mediation parents decide
to engage in. Mothers as opposed to fathers, more educated parents, parents of
younger children, and higher income parents are all more likely to mediate their
children’s media consumption (Eastin et.al, 2006; Valkenburg et.al., 1999; Warren,
2005). Socio-economic class has a large influence on parents’ ability to mediate their
children’s technology use. For example, Yardi and Bruckman (2012) found that the
parental monitoring of African-American families with a low socio-economic status was
often constrained by issues such as inflexible work schedules and parental responsibility
to shelter, feed, and clothe their children. Furthermore, parents that work longer hours
outside the home often do not have as much time to engage in discussions about the
television their children are consuming or to enforce regulations on their media
consumption (Austin, Knaus, & Meneguelli, 1997; Brown, Childers, Bauman, & Koch,
1990; Warren, Gerke, & Kelly, 2002).
Socio-economic class, underlying values, and PM. While socio-economic class
often leads to structural differences in parents’ ability to mediate their children’s
technology, there are also differences in the underlying values of families of different
socio-economic classes that direct these practices. In studies concerning television,
various researchers have found that higher-income families tend to be very concerned
with its negative effects, while lower-income families are less anxious about

44
incorporating it into their everyday lives (Brown et al., 1990; Jordan, 1992; Silverstone et
al., 1992).
Ames et al. (2011) have found that this applies to the whole range of ICTs that
families incorporate into their homes. Through observations of ten working class and
ten middle class families and interviews with the parents of these families, they found
that, though both groups had similar technologies, they used them differently and had
different family rituals that reflected their differing circumstances and values. The
middle-class families placed little focus on content choosing instead to restrict their
children’s use of all technology, very often referring to it as "screen time." The authors
note that these families tended to be "cautious (or guilty) at best and alarmist at worst"
(p. 4). Working class families, on the other hand, had more mixed feelings about their
children’s use of technology and talked about how their children's knowledge of
technology would give them an advantage. They tended to see technology as separate
from the content and placed more restrictions on specific content. These families were
also much less anxious about their children’s use of technology and even parenting in
general, feeling that parenting did not necessarily need to be stressful.
Similarly, Clark (2013) found that upper-income families had an “ethic of
expressive empowerment” and pushed their children to use media mainly for selfdevelopment and educational reasons, while lower-income families had “an ethic of
respectful connectedness” in which PM was centered around promoting children to use
media in ways that were respectful to parents and conducive to family connectedness.
She stresses that children inherit their approach to media and technology from their

45
families, which may have larger ramifications. Lareau (2011) argues that the “cultural
repertoire” of parenting practices that are associated with different socio-economic
classes are widening the gap between them. She says that social institutions are biased
against the relaxed parenting style that is demonstrated by less privileged parents
towards the “concerted cultivation” that more privileged parents practice. However, at
the same time, the influence of context on teens’ ICT use is complicated and it is
important to consider the limitations that a regimented media ICT culture, focused on
restricting screen time and/or content might create for teens when researchers have
found that children benefit from interest-driven ICT activities (Ito et al., 2008; Tripp,
2011).
Cultural factors and PM. Cultural factors can also influence how parents
approach mediation and monitoring. In her study of PM in different European
countries, Kirwil (2009) found that parents from collectivist countries preferred
restrictive methods and countries with individualistic cultures tended to prefer social
methods of mediation, such as co-use. Furthermore, cultural factors can shape parents’
media related concerns for their children. Elias and Lemish (2011), found that Russian
immigrant parents were concerned with the influence that the media of their host
country would have on their children. Underscoring the significance of the underlying
values being important in directing parents’ concerns and their resulting mediation
practices, in a study of Slovakian parents, Izrael (2014) found that parents’ religiousness
was a predictor of all types of mediation.

46
The beliefs that can result from membership in a minority culture might also
influence parents’ perceptions of risk and the mediation strategies they use. Using
unreported data from the EU KIDS ONLINE Project, Bosman, Bayraktar, and d’Heanens
(2015), found that parents that perceived that their kids were discriminated against
were more worried about their online risk and more likely to take an active stance on
mediation to help ensure their safety, such as actively educating their children on what
sites were bad and which could be trusted. Additionally, situational factors can
influence the way families engage with media and technology which might lead to
different mediation strategies. For example, immigrant children, especially girls, are
more likely to use media with their parents and families (Louie, 2003). Moreover,
children of immigrants and of disadvantaged families also often have additional
responsibilities related to media, such as brokering their parents’ connections to media
(Katz, 2010, 2014) and mediating their siblings use of media and technology (Clark,
2009), which could influence their parents’ efforts to mediate their ICT activities.
Nonrationality of PM. Many rules and practices about ICTs are developed
according to parents’ beliefs and intentions, but are then commonly not actually carried
into regular practice (Hoover et al., 2004). Most PM research works under the pretense
that parents’ biggest motivation should be a careful weighing of the benefits of each
type of technology and media for children’s future. However, Clark (2011) critiques PM
research as largely having “overlooked the ways in which parents utilize media for
positive familial and developmental goals that may not be directly related to media” (p.
324), as well as the irrational or emotional reasons parents have for their mediation

47
decisions. Clark (2011; 2013) notes that parents’ particular mediation strategies have
less to do with the careful weighing of the pros and cons of each method and much
more to do with a families’ particular culture and the need to find a way to integrate
media into the family routine in a way that parents feel benefits the family.
Parent/teen discrepancies. The incongruence between parents’ intentions and
practices can be seen in the discrepancies between what parents and their children
report about PM and monitoring. While various researchers have found that a majority
of parents say they establish rules for their children’s Internet use and monitor their
online activities (Lenhart, 2005; Lenhart & Madden, 2007; Wang, Bianchi, & Raley, 2005)
only a minority of teenagers believed their online activities were being monitored
(Lenhart, 2005; Wang, Bianchi, & Raley, 2005). These inconsistencies between what
parents and children report are important because they highlight that in order to get
the full picture, research on the parent/teen dynamic surrounding technology needs to
address both parental and adolescent perspectives.
While monitoring and mediation have been studied extensively, research has
generally concentrated on parents’ actions and perceptions. There is a need for
research that looks at mediation from both parents and teens’ perspectives that pays
attention to the methods teens take to circumvent it, the varied technologies they avail
to do so, as well as how the technological culture of the home influence those methods.
Synthesis of What is Known From the Literature
The preceding literature review has discussed relevant research. It brings
together scholarship from multiple disciplines and reveals the areas that still need

48
investigation. This study seeks to explore how teens manage information to negotiate
personal space in the family context from the everyday life information seeking
perspective. ELIS researchers understand information to be a process by which
individuals make sense of their lives and situations (Dervin, 1992). They have found that
individuals often seek out information in order to help them sustain the activities that
are a routine part of their everyday lives and help them maintain “the order of things”
(Savolainen, 1995). Information can be encountered within any situation and any kind
of media (Williamson, 1998) and how people interact with it and choose whether to
trust and integrate it into their lives can depend on context (Pettigrew, 1996) and group
membership (Chatman, 1996, 1999, 2000).
Scholars of adolescents’ ELIS have found that adolescents’ information needs are
related to their developmental stage and that they seem to be similar “across
socioeconomic, ethnic, cultural, and geographic boundaries" (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell,
2006, p. 1425). Adolescence is a time when teens are generally attempting to establish
autonomy from their parents and turning towards their peers (Havighurst, 1972;
Smetana et al., 2006). While teens’ information habits are still influenced by their
parents, social engagement outside of the domestic context is increasingly important
during this time and many of teens’ information activities are influenced by this new
social orientation (Foss, et al., 2013). Their information activities are very social and
youth often interact with a series of peers and interpersonal connections when they are
attempting to solve a problem (Meyers, et al., 2009). Likewise, many of their social
activities “involve access of information, even if the information pertains not to

49
schoolwork but to popular culture and friends’ activities" (Foss et al., 2013, p.185). For
some teens engaging with SM and communication sites are their primary activity
regardless of whether they are searching for information or not (Foss et al.). Scholars
have suggested that it would help researchers attempt to understand individuals’
“information practices” if the boundary between activities that are generally accepted
as information related and those that are considered communicative could be avoided
(Savolainen, 2006). This would be helpful in a consideration of teens’ ELIS because their
information activities are intimately interlinked with their social activities (Ito et al.,
2008).
There has been a rapid integration of a multitude of devices (Rideout et al.,
2010) and platforms into many modern teens’ lives (Grinter, Palen, & Eldridge, 2006;
Lenhart et al., 2010; Lenhart et al., 2015; Livingstone & Helsper, 2008). The
incorporation of ICTs into teens’ lives affords them new ways of interacting with people,
but it also creates new rules of social etiquette (Ito, 2005), new expectations of
availability (Ito, 2005; Ribak, 2009), and information sharing (boyd & Marwick, 2011).
Knowledge of the social norms their various groups have adopted and their roles within
those groups help teens decide what ICTs to use (Agosto et al., 2012) and understand
how to interact (Read, et al., 2012). Teens use different ICTs (Agosto et al, 2012),
different styles of communication and talk about different subjects with different
people and groups (Read et al., 2012).
Sharing information over ICTs helps many teens make connections and develop
their identities (Ito, et al., 2008), but the properties of digital media can make it difficult

50
to construct social boundaries and privacy (boyd, 2007). Research on teen privacy has
usually concentrated on the risks teens face online (Marwick et al., 2010). However,
teens are less interested in the abstract dangers of privacy risks than the concrete ways
they feel privacy is relevant to their everyday lives (Marwick et al., 2010). Recently
there has been a handful of researchers that have dedicated their work to the
consideration of teens’ privacy from their point of view (boyd, 2010; boyd & Marwick,
2011; Siibak & Murumaa, 2011; Oolo & Siibak, 2013; Marwick & boyd, 2014; Vickery,
2015). These researchers have generally concentrated on the social and structural
strategies that teens use to negotiate the collapsed contexts of the online space. They
have found that teens often censor themselves, attempt to share with only some groups
or people, and encode their posts so that only the intended audience can understand
them (boyd & Marwick, 2011; Oolo & Siibak, 2013; Marwick & boyd, 2014). In addition,
teens use a range of technical strategies such as changing privacy settings, deleting
posts (Madden et al., 2013), and using different platforms (boyd & Marwick, 2011;
Vickery, 2015). Structural and cultural factors also influence the methods that teens
use. Minority and disadvantaged teens often have different privacy challenges than
their middle-class and white counter-parts and sometimes use different strategies, such
as non-use and erasing traces of communications on shared devices, to construct
privacy and resist dominant power structures (Vickery, 2015).
Social privacy researchers have not focused on parents or the family, even
though most teens are most concerned with keeping their information private from
their parents and other adults (Marwick, et al., 2010) and their information seeking is

51
understood to be hindered by adult authority, oversight and surveillance (Meyers et al.,
2009). Parents have an assortment of fears about their teenage children and their use
of ICTs (Tripp, 2011) and they have variety of practices that they use to monitor and
mediate their teens’ ICT use. These include social methods, such as engaging media with
their teenagers and attempting to educate them about their values and the risks of the
Internet (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008). However, they also include invasive and
restrictive methods in which parents make restrictions about who teens can interact
with online, how much they can interact (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008), and the time of
day, the frequency, and the locations different technologies can be used (Yardi &
Bruckman, 2011), as well as the monitoring of teens’ search histories and
communications (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008). Parents methods are influenced by
cultural and socio-economic factors (Ames et al., 2011; Yardi & Bruckman, 2011; 2012;
Clark, 2013) and how teens interpret their parents’ methods have been shown to be
influenced by cultural factors (Clark & Sywyj, 2012).
Parents and adolescents often disagree about the extent of teens’ right to
privacy (Cranor, et al., 2014), which complicates the dynamic surrounding teens’ privacy
and PM and monitoring, as does the legal context surrounding parents’ rights to access
children’s data and other personal information. Parents range from having high levels of
control and complete access to their children’s online spaces to very little control and
no access and teens range from being very open about their online activities and going
to a considerable effort to assert their autonomy or negotiate for it (Erickson et al.,
2015). To control what their parents know about them, teens often vary their level of

52
disclosure (Cumsille, Keijsers & Laird, 2010; Darling, Cumsille, Caldwell, & Dowdy, 2006;
Darling, & Martinez, 2010; Engels, Finkenauer, & van Kooten, 2006). This helps them to
present themselves to their parents in ways that sustain their relationship with them
(Petronio, 2012), but little is known about how the dynamics between parents’
mediation and monitoring practices and teens’ social privacy practices is mediated by
ICTs or how it plays out within the everyday routines of the household.
Gaps in the Literature
The preceding section synthesizes what is known about the dynamic between
teens’ social privacy practices and parents’ mediation and monitoring practices. This
section turns to the gaps that need to be filled. Adolescents’ information needs have
been clearly connected with their process of development and it seems that teenagers
of different socio-economics, race, ethnicity, and geography have generally the same
information needs (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006a; 2006b), but there is little
understanding of how teenagers developmental need for autonomy and membership
with their peers will influence how they use ICTs to go about seeking information and
keeping it private within the family context or how teenage minorities’ methods for
doing so might be different than their majority culture counterparts. Much of the
research on teens’ social privacy has tackled it in general and there has been very little
investigation focused on how these practices are situated within the domestic context.
This is true even though social norms are understood to be a major factor in teens’ use
of ICTs (Agosto et al., 2012; boyd, 2014) and teens do, for the most part, still live in the
family home under the constraints of PM and monitoring. Additionally, while a great

53
deal is known about the methods that parents use to mediate and monitor their
children’s technology use, little is known about how teens respond to specific practices
or how they correlate with teens’ attempts to manage the information their parents
learn about them and construct privacy. Also, though, non-dominant youth have been
found to have different privacy challenges than majority youth (Vickery, 2015) and
cultural and socio-economic factors are understood to influence how families interact
around ICTs (Katz, 2010) and the parenting of ICT use (Ames et al., 2011; Yardi &
Bruckman, 2012; Clark, 2013; Bosman et al., 2014), there is little research that explores
how membership in a minority culture and the PM and monitoring that stem from the
underlying values related to their cultural experience might relate to teens’ attempts to
construct privacy from their parents or family members. Furthermore, there is a
particular deficit in the understanding of how teens cope with the monitoring of the
traces that their activities and information seeking leave behind in their devices and the
shared devices of the home and how teens’ attempts to construct privacy are
distributed across the various ICTs to which teens have access, even though they are
known to use “media holistically, in a way that does not demarcate and delimit” by
platform or device (Woodfall & Zezulkove, 2016, p.104). Likewise, there is a dearth of
research that attempts to understand the ways physical space figures in teens’ attempts
to construct social privacy. The dissertation sought to fill these gaps by exploring how
Latino/a teens’ information practices are a response to PM and monitoring practices,
embedded in the physical spaces and technological culture of the home, and expressed
through an entire constellation of technologies.

54
Pilot Study
An exploratory study was conducted to look at the mediated lives of low-income,
Latino adolescents with immigrant parents (Gomez, Booth, & Katz, 2011). The goal was
to explore the ways these under-studied youth actively used technologies for their own
purposes and how their activities were different than their majority culture, middleclass counterparts. The research questions were as follows:
RQ 1: How are negotiations of parental monitoring and mediation of children’s
media connections different in Latino immigrant family contexts?
RQ 2: How are the mediated environments of these young people different from
those of their majority culture counterparts?
Since extant research indicates that teens’ use of technology is best understood
from within the context of the social arrangements of family life (Livingstone, 2002,
2007), the pilot study was designed to investigate how the family context as well as
other social settings influenced the kinds of interactions these teens had with
technology. To investigate these issues, four focus groups were conducted with 30
adolescents (aged 11-19) in April 2011, in two locations in New Brunswick, NJ. Though
only 27 completed the pre-focus group paper survey, all 30 youth participated in the
focus groups. Of those who completed the survey, 85 percent were Latino/a, 63 percent
had parents who were Spanish dominant or mono-lingual, and 15 percent were AfricanAmerican.

55
Findings
Key findings from the pilot study were:
•

Respondents reported that their parents have similar ICT worries to those
majority-culture parents had expressed in prior studies.

•

Parental monitoring and mediation were a common experience for the
minority culture youth in the study. The monitoring and mediation they
experienced echoed many of the findings reported in the literature for
their majority culture counterparts.

•

Respondents reported having to negotiate their family contexts to
construct privacy.

•

The physical spaces of the household figured in their attempts to control
the information they exposed to their parents.

•

They actively participated in their family members’ mediation by
controlling their own visibility and invisibility.

•

They utilized the affordances of the technologies they had access to, as
well as their knowledge of their parents’ limitations to negotiate their
privacy.

•

There were gender differences in their privacy expectations.

Pilot Study Contributions to the Main Study
The findings from the study indicated that there were important areas of teens’
social privacy that merit further investigation. While there is very little research on

56
teens’ methods for constructing social privacy in the family context (Marwick et al.,
2010) the pilot study clearly indicated that respondents were enacting privacypreserving behaviors and that they were related to parents’ mediation and monitoring,
as well as to underlying family values. Respondents described the strategies they had
developed for circumventing PM and monitoring from within the particular
constraints—both structural and social—of their family, using the resources they had
available. The physical space of the home also figured in their attempts to construct
privacy. For some of the youth, physical space was a constraint that needed to be
circumnavigated; for others it was a resource, and for some, it was both.
While the focus group and survey methods employed in the pilot study revealed
important issues involved in teens’ attempts to use ICTs to construct privacy, the study
design did not provide any means to assess parental perspectives or data that teens
provided about their family lives that were relevant to the participants’ practices. By
conducting surveys, an in-home family interview, and individual interviews with parents
and youth, the dissertation builds on the pilot study’s findings by giving the researcher
first-hand access to parents, mapping and survey data of the physical space of the home
and where ICTs are used in that space, the family’s culture, parents’ perspectives, and
teens’ perspectives that should help provide a holistic understanding of the family
dynamics in which teens’ social privacy practices are situated.

Chapter 3 : Methods
The following chapter will present the design and rationale for this project. It
will begin with the Research Questions. It will then proceed to the participants, setting,
recruitment, and the compensation participants received. Next it will present the
methods, protocols, and the methodological approach and analysis that were utilized.
Research Questions
The development of the research questions was based on the literature review
and pilot study findings. The design of the main study was then focused around
answering the following questions:
RQ 1. How do Latino/a parents mediate their teens’ Information Communication
Technolgy (ICT) practices?
RQ 2. How do Latino/a teens negotiate their use of ICTs in accordance with the
family small world?
RQ 2a. What practices do teens use to negotiate their resources in
relation to ICTs in accordance with their family small world?
RQ 2b. What practices do teens use to negotiate their interpersonal
relationships in relation to ICTs in accordance with their family small
world?

58
Introduction
Addressing the research questions necessitated the use of methods that allow
the researcher to discover knowledge regarding the family home, the familial culture
and values, parental points of view, teens’ points of view, the ICTs that are accessed by
family members, where they are used in the home, and how they are integrated into
the family’s everyday routine. In order to encompass this broad range of interest, this
study used a mixed-methods approach that included surveys, in-home family interviews,
a mapping activity and individual interviews with teens, and an individual interview with
parents. The various methods included in the study each provide a different vantage
point for understanding “the reality” that constitutes the family’s dynamics and each
member’s role within it. The parent/teen dynamic in any individual family stems from
what they each understand to be the “the reality” or to use Chatman’s (1996, 1999,
2000) term, the “small world,” of their family.
The mixed-methods approach that was used in this study helped to mitigate
each method’s individual shortcomings (Connaway & Radford, 2017). For instance,
while the surveys establish demographic characteristics of family members and indicate
where family members prefer to use them, more data was needed to understand why
they use them in certain household spaces. The family interview was designed to
provide context for interpreting why technologies are placed where they are in the
home, and how they are integrated into the family routine. The family interview was
also crafted to provide insight into the relationship between the technological culture of
the home and the parent/teen dynamic. Additionally, it allowed the investigator the

59
opportunity to observe the family members’ interactions with one another and gain
some first-hand knowledge of the home setting.
The teen mapping activity was adapted from an instrument developed by Katz
and Gonzalez (2016). It was intended to provide a sense of the space of the home,
where ICT devices are located, and how teens used ICTs in these spaces in relation to
other family members. Moreover, it was meant to gather data on teens’ subjective
understanding of the spaces of their home (Silverstone, Hirsch, & Morely, 1991) and
how they use them. Silverstone et al. (1991; 1992) have shown that objects and spaces
are integral considerations in the activities surrounding technological use.
The individual interviews with teens and parents were meant to give them each
the opportunity to share more freely about their personal practices and perceptions
than they might be able to in the group setting of the family interview. The separate
teen and parent interviews were designed to complement one another and provide
insight into the dynamic in the teen/parent relationship surrounding ICTS. Conducting
the interviews in the family home also provided the researcher with the opportunity to
get a first-hand sense of the physical space of the house. This was meant to provide
context for the researchers’ understanding of the survey and interview data and help
add to the validity of the study. Additionally, the mixed methods approach provides an
“initiation” function (Connaway & Radford, 2017) that allows access to the differences
in how mothers and fathers feel about parenting their teen children’s ICT use, and the
discrepancies between parents’ and teens’ perspectives and accounts of their practices.

60
Method
The following sections describe the specific method, protocols and procedures
used to address the above Research Questions.
Participants. Morse (1994) identifies six interviews as the minimum number of
interviews needed to gain a phenomenological understanding and reach saturation.
Reaching saturation requires the researcher to continue “bringing new participants into
the study until the data set is complete and data replicates” (Morse, Barratt, Mayan,
Olson, & Speirs, 2002, p.16). With the goal to reach saturation in mind, the researcher
used convenience and snowball sampling to recruit eight Latino families with at least
one teen between the ages of 14 and 16. Latino/a families were chosen because they
are understudied within LIS (Jaeger, Bertot, & Franklin, 2010; Subramaniam & Jaeger,
2010) and also provide a vantage point for exploring how ICT practices are embedded
within cultural experience. Generalizability was not a goal of this study, rather it was
designed to provide an “information rich” (Patton, 2002) data set that would allow the
researcher to explore the ways culture intersects with media and technology practices.
Various cultural factors have been shown to influence the ICT-related responsibilities
teens have in the home (Clark, 2009; Katz, 2010), the types of mediation and monitoring
that parents utilize (Kirwel, 2009; Clark, 2013; Vickery, 2015; Yardi & Bruckman, 2012),
the methods that teens use to secure their own privacy (Vickery, 2015), and how teens
feel about their parents’ mediation (Clark & Sywyj, 2012). The study does not focus on
Latinos in order to attribute any specific characteristics to Latinos as a culture, but to
explore the challenges and assets (Alper, Katz, & Clark, 2016) that the technological

61
cultures of Latino/a teens’ homes contributed to their negotiation of ICTs; and the
creative ways that they harnessed the resources of their particular situations to do so.
For the purposes of recruitment, a “family” was defined as the individuals living
together in a household and a “Latino family” is defined as having at least one Spanishspeaking parent of Latin American heritage. The requirements for inclusion in the study
are:
•

Family members live in the same household

•

Parent(s) and teens both have access to a camera phone or mobile device

•

Families contain at least one Spanish speaking parent of Latino/a
background who is able to be interviewed and to provide consent for the
family’s teen participant(s) to be interviewed

•

Families contain at least one teen between the ages of 14-16

The age range was chosen to limit the sample to families with teenagers that
were in middle adolescence. Children living in the household in between the ages of 813 were allowed to participate in the survey and family interview with parental consent,
but they were not interviewed individually. Children under eight were also be allowed
to participate in the family interview with parental consent, but were not asked to fill
out a survey or interviewed individually.
Participant recruitment. Recruitment of families was focused on the city of
Allentown within the metropolitan area of the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania because it
is a vibrant center of Latino/ a culture. The Lehigh Valley is a metropolitan area of

62
Pennsylvania consisting of the cities of Easton (27,052), Bethlehem (75,135), and
Allentown (119,104) with a combined population of 221, 291 (Census Bureau, 2014). It
has a diverse population with a larger Hispanic demographic than the national average
(Census Bureau, 2014). Much of that growth is concentrated in the city of Allentown,
where Hispanics went from being 24 percent of the population in 2000 to 43 percent in
2010.
Five out of the eight participating families were recruited from the Allentown
Public Library, The Literacy Center, and Casa Guadalupe in the city of Allentown,
Pennsylvania. In order to recruit from the organizations discussed above the investigator
made connections with the directors of each organization and explained the study and
the compensation that participants would receive. In each case the directors were
interested in the project and accommodating. Fliers were posted in each organization
and the investigator made one short presentation to members of Casa Guadalupe and
four presentations, four different times to adult students at The Literacy Center. The
presentations were all conducted in Spanish. One family was recruited through the
Allentown Public Library, three families came through The Literacy Center and one
family was recruited through one of the families recruited from The Literacy Center.
Another family was recruited through a personal contact who then suggested the family
that had been living with them for the last six months. This family was selected because
they met the requirements of the study, but in addition, because of the study’s interest
in physical space and family boundaries and the exploratory value these two families
provided through their shared living arrangement.

63
Compensation. Recognizing that participation in the study required a large time
commitment, the researcher provided incentives to compensate for participants’ time
that included: Pizza on the day of the first visit to family households for participants in
the family interview and gift cards for parents and teens on the completion of the
individual interviews on the second visit. Teens and parents were compensated based
on their completion of the study’s activities. Each set of parents or single parent were
able to collect up to $40 and each teen was able to collect up to $30. Parents received a
$40 gift card after the completion of the parental interview. Teens received $15 towards
a gift card for the completion of the mapping activity and an additional $15 after the
completion of their individual interview. The schedule for rolling compensation was as
follows for families, parents, and teens:

Research process overview. A survey of family members and a set of three
interviews—one with the family, one with the teenager, and one with the teenagers’
parents—were carried out for each family over the course of two visits to each family’s

64
home. The first visit (Phase one) took approximately one and a half hours to two hours
and included the administration of the survey and the family interview. The survey was
filled out by all the family members eight and older participating in the family interview
and took about ten minutes to complete. The family interview included all the family
members that were willing and able to participate. Seven out of eight of these
interviews were conducted mostly in Spanish with some English. Teens and their
siblings often switched back and forth from Spanish to English. One family interview
was conducted in English. The second visit (Phase two) included an interview with both
parents when possible, and a mapping activity and interview with the participating teen.
Each family, parent, and teen interview took approximately one to one and a half hours
and were audio recorded and transcribed by the researcher and two additional research
assistants trained in transcription services. Seven out of eight of the individual parental
interviews were conducted in Spanish and one was conducted in English. All eight
individual teen interviews were conducted in English. Immediately or very soon after
each interview, the interviewer wrote fieldnotes that encapsulated the investigator’s
experience and impressions of that interview. These fieldnotes helped the investigator
maintain a vivid memory of each experience.
Phase one. On the day of the first visit to each residence the researcher arrived
at the family household with pizza and juice. This pizza was meant as an ice breaker and
to thank family members for participating in the family interview. The pizza was eaten
as the research process commenced in some cases, and, in other cases, the family
waited until the completion of the interview. During this visit the researcher introduced

65
the project, had all the participants sign the proper consent forms (parental, informed
consent, and informed assent forms) in English and in Spanish for parents that did not
speak English, and provided them with copies for their own records (see Appendix H for
sample consent forms). During the explanation of the project, participants were told
about their rights as research subjects. They were assured that they could skip any
question on the survey or the interview that they did not wish to answer and could
terminate the interview at any time. They were also told about how the rolling
compensation would allow them to collect some compensation even if they did not
complete all of the study’s components. Additionally, the specific measures that would
be taken to secure their privacy were also clarified at this time. The researcher then
administered the survey. Following the survey, the researcher initiated the recording
device and conducted the family interview. After the interview, a date was scheduled
for the second set of interviews.
Survey. Before the family interview, surveys were circulated to all participating
family members eight and older in English and in Spanish for those parents more
comfortable in Spanish. The survey collected knowledge of the spaces that family
members chose to use their devices, in order to gain a sense of how teens used space to
demarcate their personal boundaries and assemble privacy. Family members were
asked to check off boxes and write in textual data indicating demographic information,
the technological devices they used in the home, the household spaces they usually
used them, and whether they used them while they were with others in those spaces.
Participating teens were asked to indicate the physical spaces in the house where they

66
typically conducted specific ICT activities and whether they did these activities in the
specified spaces by themselves and/or with others. This helped the researcher to gain
an understanding of each teenagers’ PIE. The surveys took approximately ten minutes
to fill out and were designed to get a quick inventory of the ICT devices that were used
and the physical locations where they were used (see Appendix B for survey
instruments).
Family interview. The family interview probed the ways technology had been
integrated into the everyday routines, habits, and rituals of the family. It also helped
provide a sense of the family dynamic and the underlying values that helped to
structure how family members took up technology individually and as a family. The
eight family interviews included all the members of the household who were willing and
able to participate. These in-home family interviews were used to get a glimpse of the
technological culture of the family (Silverstone, et al., 1989). Researchers have noted
that in-home interviews are particularly beneficial for studying media within families
(Lim, 2008; Ling & Thrane, 2001; Morley, 1992; Silverstone, Hirsch, & Morley, 1991;).
Silverstone et al. (1991) have discussed the benefits of conducting an in-home interview
with the whole family. They said that the family interview,
provided an opportunity not just to get a sense of how family members
displayed or made visible their knowledge of the various forms ICT-related or
non-ICT-related activities in the home, but it provided the first opportunity for
them to display in their talk the balance of powers within the family, as between
husband and wife, as between parents and children…and a first opportunity for
the researchers to gain some sense of the family ideology and values of the
social organization of the household (p.213).

67
The family interview followed a semi-structured format in which the researcher asked
open-ended questions and then asked follow-up questions to clarify or pursue relevant
subject matter. The family interviews began with asking participants to walk through
their daily routine and discuss how technologies were integrated into it, starting from
when they woke up and began the day, through to work and school, after school, the
evening, and bedtime. As they described their day, the researcher probed into how
they used ICTs to partition the day, the spaces of the home in which family members
used technology, how they negotiated the joint use of ICTs and physical spaces,
technology related family rituals, the rules and restrictions for ICT use, and any conflicts
these rules created for the family. The researcher was especially attentive to ICT
practices, particularly the practices that parents used to mediate and control their
teenagers’ ICT use, and the ways that teenagers negotiated their ICT use in accordance
with familial values and expectations. (see Appendix C for Family Interview Protocol).
Phase two. The subsequent meeting consisted of both the joint parent interview
and the individual teen interview. At the beginning of these interviews the researcher
reminded the participants of their right to skip any question and terminate the interview
at any time. At their conclusion, the researcher presented parents and teens with the
gift cards they had earned according to the rolling compensation schedule.
Parental interview. The parental interview was conducted with both parents in
dual parent households whenever possible, and with one parent in the single parent
household included in the study. The interview with parents were semi-structured. This

68
gave the interviewer the freedom to pursue clarifications and probe further. This
interview was meant to provide insight into parental decisions about incorporating
technology into the household and its routines. This included the practices parents used
to mediate and monitor their teenage children’s ICT use, the values that influenced their
practices, and the ways they attempted to use their practices to construct a family that
was in line with those values.
A more structured survey was included in this interview asking parents about
their mediation practices and the help they received from the teen participants. The
survey was delivered orally and included fourteen questions where parents were asked
to estimate the frequency of each activity on a four-point Likert scale, where very often
meant every day, often meant once a week, once in a while meant once a month, or
never. Each of these replies were assigned points as follows with never being zero, once
in a while being one, often being two, and very often being three. While this part of the
individual parental interview was structured as a survey, the interviewer would proceed
with each response in a semi-structured format, asking parents to clarify to expand.
Their responses were meant simply to provide supplementary data concerning the
context of the participating teens’ ICT experiences in the home. (see Appendix D for
Phase Two Parent Interview Protocol).
To gain a better understanding of how each parent contributed to the
technological culture of the family, the researcher made an effort whenever possible to
interview both parents together in the two parent households that were included in the

69
study. While much of the PM literature professes to focus on parents, mothers are
generally questioned more often (Austin et al., 1999; Nathanson, 1999; Nathanson,
2002; Valkenburg et al.,1999; Warren, 2005), even though PM has largely been found to
be a gendered activity (Louie, 2003; Liau, Khoo, & Ang, 2008) and mothers and fathers
have been shown to have different priorities when it comes to parenting media and
technology (Lim, 2008). When it was possible, interviewing parents together helped
crystalized each of their separate points-of-view and revealed how their individual
beliefs and values had become manifested in the parental ICT mediation that had
become a part of the family routine. When only one parent was available to be
interviewed, that parent was asked about the differences between their and their
spouse’s beliefs about technology and habits for mediating their teen’s ICT practices.
Mapping activity. Teens are increasingly seen as capable of competently
reporting on their own activities (Hazel, 1995). This study sought to gain in-depth data
about teens ICT experiences in their homes from their perspectives, by using a mapping
activity adapted from an instrument developed by Katz and Gonzalez (2016). Maps can
be helpful in achieving an ecological understanding of a subject area. Mapping has been
found to be a useful method by some investigators for use with teenagers (Banerjee &
Lynch, 1977; Moore, 1986), but it has not been extensively utilized. In his heavily cited
work, Banerjee & Lynch (1977) found asking teens to draw maps of their local
environments to be an effective way to gain knowledge about how they viewed them.
Moore (1986) also asked youth to draw their favorite places in their neighborhoods. In
this way, he was able to collect what he called “turf maps.” However, Travlou, Owens,

70
Thompson, and Maxwell (2008) argue that when teens draw maps they tend to reiterate
cultural understandings and that this method does not access teen's personal
perceptions. In contrast, they contend that map reading gives teens the opportunity to
talk about their experience of the space and that their accounts will include their
preferences, dislikes, how they move though the space and use it, and how social others
fit in. For this reason, teens were asked to both make maps of their home spaces and to
read and explain their maps to the investigator during their individual interviews. In the
mapping activity, participating teens were instructed to make a map of the rooms in
their home where they used ICTs. They were asked to include the devices that were
located in those rooms, the devices that they utilized in those rooms, and where they
and other family members generally situated themselves while in those spaces. Teens
were then questioned about their maps within their individual interviews. These
questions probed into their and their family’s use of the spaces in relation to their use of
ICTs. The mapping activity was useful toward understanding how ICTs were related to
teens’ use and movement through the physical spaces of the home, and how other
family members were integrated (see Appendix E for the Mapping Protocol).
Teen interview. Many researchers have used interviews to gain information
about adolescents’ information practices (Ito et al. 2008; Read et al., 2012) and social
privacy practices (boyd, 2014; Grinter & Palen, 2002; Ito, 2005; Marwick & boyd, 2014;
Vickery, 2015) from their point of view. Individual semi-structured interviews with teens
were conducted to assist the researcher to understand the kinds of practices that teens
used to negotiate their ICT use in accordance with their familial small worlds. As

71
discussed above, teens individual interviews began with questions about the map they
had drawn of the various physical spaces in the home where ICT devices were located.
This study sought to understand teens use of ICTs and the physical spaces of their
homes from their perspectives. Participating teens were then asked about their
routines, their ICT habits, their preferences about where they use ICTs, how they go
about sharing the ICT devices and the physical spaces of the home, how they negotiated
the collapsed context of social media, and about their experience of their parents’ ICT
mediation. They were also questioned about the underlying feelings and meanings that
make up the context of their experiences using ICTs in accordance with the small world
of their families.
Within the semi-structured individual interview given to teens were four short
structured surveys that included 14 questions about their parents’ mediation practices,
16 questions about their practices managing their parents’ mediation and assisting their
parents and siblings, nine questions about different locations they might use ICTs, and
12 questions about their participation in certain ICT activities. For each question teens
were asked to estimate the frequency of each activity on a four-point Likert scale, where
“very often” meant every day, “often” meant once a week, “once in a while” meant
once a month, and “never” was never. Each of these replies were assigned one point
with never being zero, once in a while being one, often being two, and very often being
three. While this part of the individual teen interview was structured as a survey on a
scale, the interviewer would often proceed with each response in a semi-structured
format, asking teens to clarify, to expand, or for an example. These questions are meant

72
to collect an inventory of various factors that might influence teens’ information
ecologies and the extension of their personal ICT spheres of interaction. They were
meant to help provide descriptive data concerning the context of the ICT experiences of
the teens in the sample and make basic comparisons (see Appendix D for the Teen
Interview Protocol).
Ethical Issues
In any research dealing with human subjects it is important that ethical
considerations be taken seriously. This becomes especially true when the study involves
working with vulnerable populations. To minimize risks, the proposed study complied
with all Rutgers University IRB human subject protocols and received approval from the
Institutional Review Board. The researcher, as well as the additional assistants that
assisted with transcribing interviews, completed the additional required CITI human
subject protection training. IRB compliance involved providing participants with
parental consent forms, informed consent forms, and assent forms that included a
description of the project, participants’ rights as research subjects, contact information
for the researcher, the researcher’s advisor, the review board, and the specific
measures that would be taken to insure participants’ privacy. They were then provided
with a copy for their records.
While this study is primarily interested in teenagers between the ages of
fourteen and sixteen, as noted above, the participants’ siblings were able to participate
with parental consent.

73
Participants’ privacy was protected by securing the audio recordings of the
interviews on a password protected computer and their transcripts in a locked cabinet
in the researcher’s home. All parental consent, consent, and assent forms are being
kept in a locked cabinet in the researcher’s home. Participants are being kept
confidential and pseudonyms and numbers, such as Teen 1, were used in the transcripts
and analysis, and will also be used in any published reports or conference proceedings.
A linking list connecting participants’ names with their pseudonyms and numbers was
not kept. After ten years the interview recording will be deleted.
Participants were told at both the initial meeting and then reminded again prior
to their individual interviews that they could skip any question and stop the interview at
any time without needing to provide any explanation. As noted above, the study had a
rolling compensation and participants would be able to collect some recompense even if
they did not complete all the study’s components.
Additionally, as this study is focused on PM, including parental monitoring, and
privacy information practices within the family, the possible dangers to having privacy
breached by other family members needed to be addressed. The research process was
carefully considered and designed in order to minimize any risks to family members.
This included not asking teens about their personal methods of seeking out privacy or
parents about their methods for monitoring their teenagers’ ICT use during the family
interview when the whole family was present. Such inquiries were reserved for the
separate interviews with parents and teens. Both the parent and teen individual

74
interviews were conducted in as private a setting as possible, and the content of teen
interviews was not reviewed with parents or vice versa. Assurance that the interviews
would not be shared was included in the parental consent, consent and assent forms
and explained during the initial description of the project. When a secluded location for
the interview could not be secured for either interview, the researcher took lack of
privacy into consideration when asking questions, avoiding any question about personal
practices that might not be known to the opposite party.
While the interview questions were not meant to cause any distress, there is
always the possibility that a participant might become upset or reveal some deep
personal problem. If this happened the researcher had a contingency plan to attempt to
diffuse the emotional response and ask participants if they wanted to terminate the
interview. Furthermore, if it had been deemed appropriate, the researcher would have
provided subjects with a referral to a counselor to whom it would be convenient for
them to access and a list of counselors in the area was provided in all the consent forms.
This was not necessary, as no distress was evident.
Data Collection
The researcher collected various types of data that were then analyzed
quantitatively and qualitatively. The units of analysis were the responses from each
teen, parents, the parent/ teen dyad, and the family. The interviews were analyzed for
what they contributed to knowledge of parent and teen practices, but were also
understood as a part of a trio of familial texts that each provided a partial view of

75
individual and family practices. The surveys that participants eight and older completed
collected general demographic information and data about the household locations in
which they used various ICT devices. This included checking boxes and providing short
answer free response data. Additionally, one short survey concerning parents’
mediation of teens’ ICT activities and the assistance teens provide them was given to
parents as a part of the individual parental interview. Parents were instructed to
respond as to the frequency of certain practices on a four point Likert scale. Four short
surveys were also included within the teen interviews. Teens’ responses of frequency
were also structured as a four-point Likert scale that would demonstrate their
impression of the frequency of some basic PM activities, their practices to evade
mediation, their use of ICT devices in some select locations outside of the home, and
their participation in some basic ICT activities.
Responses to the surveys were analyzed with descriptive statistics and used to
supplement the qualitative data. The small sample size precludes making any
generalizations from the data in the surveys to the greater population. The responses
by parents and teens to these oral survey questions in their individual interviews were
meant to impart a fuller description of each teens’ PIE. These also provided basic data
to make comparisons among teens and families.
The mapping contribution by teen participants was used to help elicit and direct
interviews with teens and provide context for their accounts. Teens were asked a
number of questions in their individual interviews about the maps that they had drawn

76
and their responses were coded as a part of their interviews. Teens’ maps in
conjunction with their responses to the questions in their individual interviews related
to the maps, supplied valuable information concerning the spatialization of ICT devices
and how they and their families used the physical spaces of the home.
The interviews with families, parents and teens provided the foundation for this
study. These interviews were audio recorded and then transcribed by the researcher
and two research assistants trained in transcription. The fieldnotes that the researcher
took immediately or soon after each interview served to provide a record of the
interviewers’ experience and initial impressions. All the interviews were transcribed
verbatim as Wengraff (2001) suggests. The transcriptions were then organized and
coded by the principal researcher using NVivo qualitative coding software. The amount
of text that was coded was determined according to meaning and some blocks of text
were coded in multiple categories.
Analysis
Constructivist analysis helped the researcher approach the data with an eye to
the performative nature of participants’ statements. Constructivists believe that people
use their accounts to position themselves in relation to others and present themselves
as they wish to be seen. They “do not approach the research participants statements
as ‘raw data’ that might be unproblematically analyzed so as to get us close to ‘the
truth,’ but as conditional statements made in a particular context and which of necessity
require interpretation (Hoover et al., 2004, p.30). While this study is very interested in

77
specific ICT practices, it also considered how participants were using their accounts of
their practices to construct their own and their family’s identities in relation to one
another. The analysis concentrated more on how participants saw their world, their
actions, and their practices than in the truth value of their statements. For this reason,
the analysis focused on participants’ perspectives, practices and language forms. The
words, phrases, and expressions that constituted individuals’ language forms,
“condense[d] meanings” and revealed the context from which a participant was
speaking (Connaway & Radford, 2017) and how they were attempting to position
themselves in relation to their family members and the broader culture. Grounded
theorists refer to these kind of participant terms as in vivo codes (Charmaz, 2014).
Charmaz notes that “[u]npacking such terms gives you an opportunity not only to
understand implicit meanings and actions but also to make comparisons between data”
(p.134) and that these types of language forms will “anchor your analysis in your
research participants’ worlds” (p.135).
With these considerations in mind, a three phase analysis was conducted. The
first phase began while the first six interviews from the first two participating families
were being collected. During this phase, the investigater organized and coded the first
six interviews using NVivo qualitative coding software according to a theoretically driven
coding scheme developed based on findings from the pilot study and the literature
review. NVivo was used to organize the data and to conduct queries. While the coding
scheme developed by the author had been designed to elucidate on themes and
practices present in the research, the exploratory nature of this study portended the

78
importance of staying open to meanings, practices, and themes that became apparent
in the data and were not represented in the initial codebook. At this time and
throughout the process, the investigator wrote approximately 100 “memos” that
commented on how well phenomena fit into the categories and made comparisons to
correspondingly coded data in other interviews (Campbell, et al. 2013; Charmaz, 2014).
This way of comparing codes with data was meant to allow the researcher to spot
significant overlapping themes between data, identify the most useful codes, and
identify gaps in the coding scheme in order to adapt the codebook to better fit the data.
In the second phase of data analysis, the investigator coded six additional
transcripts according to Taylor and Bogdan’s (1998) constant comparative method. This
method involves the simultaneous coding and analysis of data. The transcripts were
repeatedly read and the participants’ words, phrases, and activities were assessed for
patterns pertaining to teens and parents’ ICT practices and the dynamic between them.
As patterns began to emerge related to parents’ ICT mediation practices and teens’
family small world ICT practices the initial codebook was altered and expanded to
produce a codebook typology for each of these major themes. (see Appendix F and G
for the adjusted typology codebooks.). All 24 interviews were then coded in NVivo
according to these codebooks and more fine-grained classifications emerged as
subthemes and categories of those themes.
In the third phase of analysis the survey data was assembled to present the
participant demographics and supplement the interviews. In addition, demographic
data from the surveys, the teen mapping activity, fieldnotes, audio recordings, and

79
transcripts from all the interviews were used to construct a portrait of each household
participating in the study and an inventory of the ICT devices in each home. (see Table
4.6 in Chapter 4 for an inventory of houshold technologies by household)
Data contiued to be collected throughout the research process until the
researcher had completed 3 interviews with all 8 participant families. The three-phase
approach used in this study enabled the researcher to construct a “multidimensional”
understanding of the data, using both emic and etic data (Connaway & Radford, 2017).
The initial theoretically driven coding scheme contributed etic data by providing an
analytic framework that connected the raw data to the “conceptual categories” of the
varied disciplines discussed in the literature, while the interviews and maps elicited for
the study provided emic data that was used to understand the participants’ cultures
through their eyes and expand the analysis beyond what is already established within
the research literature. By continuing to make adjustments to the codebook and
analysis throughout the research process according to Taylor and Bogdan’s (1998)
constant comparative method, the investigator was able to develop an analysis that
expanded the initial conceptual categories into a new theoretical framework. (see
Tables 5.1 and 6.1 for PM Practices and Teen Family Small World ICT Practices
typologies and Appendices F and G for the typology codebooks with definitions and
examples).
This chapter has presented the methods and analysis that were used for this
project. The following four chapters, Chapters 4-7, present the findings, beginning in
Chapter 4 with the participant demographics and portraits of each family.

80
Chapter 4 : Demographics and Family Portraits
Introduction and Organization of Findings Chapters
Chapters 4-7 describe the results of the data collection and demonstrate the
interpretation that the investigator has determined from the evidence provided by the
participants’ surveys, maps, and interviews. The process of collecting data was designed
to provide the investigator with information about the dynamic between teens and their
parents in relation to Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) within the family
context and answer the Research Questions (see page x). Because of the large amount
of qualitative findings resulting from analysis, there are four chapters devoted to
findings: Chapters 4-7. The contents of each chapter are briefly described below.
Overview of Chapter 4. Chapter 4 begins with the participant demographics and
the similarities and variations among the eight Latino/a families that participated in the
study. After this, a portrait of each family is provided. These portraits are derived from
the surveys, fieldnotes, and interviews, as described in Chapter 3, and they are
presented to provide a picture of the situation of each family and how the dynamic
between teens and their parents functioned within the small world of their families.
Overview of Chapter 5. Chapter 5 addresses parental ICT mediation practices. It
begins with a presentation of the parental mediation typology that was developed from
analysis of the fieldnotes, audio recording and transcripts of the family, parent, and teen
interviews. Parents were found to mediate their teens’ ICT interactions through
restrictive mediation, active mediation, control over ICT devices, parental monitoring,

81
the provision of privacy, and social media. The results for the major qualitative themes
and subthemes will be explicated and illustrated with quotations, as appropriate.
Overview of Chapter 6. Chapter 6 presents findings related to RQ 2a concerning
teens’ family small world ICT practices in relation to their resources. Chapter 6 beings
with a full typology of teens’ ICT practices. The typology is separated into two
overarching themes that relate to RQ 2a and RQ 2b—negotiation of resources and
negotiation of interpersonal relationships—and are presented in Chapters 6 and 7. The
findings for the typology and the resulting chapters were derived from the teen surveys,
mapping activity, and family, parent, and teen interviews. Chapter 6 adresses teens’
negotiation of their resources. As a part of their membership in the family small world,
teens needed to manage the resources that were available to them in the home,
including the use of ICT devices, physical space, ICT content and interactions, and
Internet access.
Overview of Chapter 7. Chapter 7 presents the findings of RQ 2b concerning
teens’ negotiation of their interpersonal relationships in relation to ICTs and their family
small world. The major qualitative themes of the typology related to teens’ negotiation
of their relationships are parental authority, social worlds, mental states, and social
media.
This section has presented an overview Chapters 4-7. These chapters will
present the results for the major qualitative themes that were discovered in the data
relating to RQ 1 and RQ 2, RQ 2a, RQ 2b and will be illustrated with quotations, as

82
appropriate to exemplify these themes. The next section will begin the presentation of
the findings by describing the participant demographics and providing short portrait of
each family.
Demographics and Family Descriptions
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 3.8 million 14-16-year-old
Hispanic/Latino teens within a community 56.6 million Hispanic/Latino in the U.S. that
make-up 17.6 % of the total population (Census Bureau, 2015). However, these
statistics do not represent the diversity within the Latino/a community. Latino/as hail
from many countries, racial categories, economic groups, cultural affiliations and have
very different historical experiences in the U.S. (Weaver, Umaña-Taylor, Hans, J. D., &
Malia, 2001), but they are often studied as if they are a homogenous group. Research
investigating Latino/as has primarily focused on low-income Mexican families with
results being generalized to the entire population (Zambrana, 2011). However,
investigations are needed (such as the present dissertation) that include other
populations in order to accurately represent the diversity within the Latino/a
community, and to avoid misrepresenting their experiences.
This dissertation focuses on the families of eight, first generation 14-16-year-olds
living in the northeast that have migrated from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic
across a variety of socio-economic and educational categories. Puerto Rican and
Dominicans are underrepresented in research on Latino/as (Zambrana, 2011), despite
being within the top five most populous Latin-American communities in the U.S. (Lopez

83
& Dockterman, 2011). Investigations that represent the diversity of the Latino/a
community in relation to information use and competence are essential because
information competence has been shown to be related to demographics in complicated
ways. Low income does not directly lead to less access. Less access does not directly
correlate with low levels of ICT competence levels, and having parents with higher
education does not directly correspond with higher competence levels (Hargittai &
Hinnant, 2008). While it is known that parents that are more educated and
technologically proficient can provide their children with more support (Facer et al.,
2003; Seiter, 2008), it is unclear how these factors influence their children’s ICT
competence or the dynamics that develop around ICTs in these homes.
It is also important to situate the participating families in relation to the
experiences of the Latino/a community as a whole in the U.S., as variations can have a
large bearing on how they acculturate into majority culture, as well as parenting and
teens’ likelihood of complying with their parents. Findings by Gomez, Booth, and Katz
(2011) suggest that Latino/a teens showed more deference to their parents because of
their understanding of their parents’ vulnerabilities, such as low English and technical
proficiency. Parents’ vulnerabilities and the roles teens take up in the home around ICTs
may be quite different, depending on their migration process. Latino/as from different
regions have very dissimilar experiences of immigration. For instance, many Cubans
migrated to the U.S as political refugees and were generally fairly affluent when they
came, while Mexicans have usually migrated for economic reasons (Weaver et al., 2001)
and are more likely to be or have undocumented family members making their

84
situations more precarious. In contrast, by virtue of being U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans
have more flexibility and freedom of mobility than other groups. Dominicans also have
a high rate of immigration and many cultural similarities to Puerto Ricans (Durand,
Telles, & Flashman, 2006), which may make their immigration experience easier.
Variations can also exist between the regions of the U.S. to which Latino/as choose to
migrate. For example, Puerto Ricans living in the South and West have had more
success improving their economic status than those in the Northeast (Marzan, 2009).
Issues like these will affect the education individuals achieve, employment they will be
able to find, the money that will be available for tech purchases, and the confidence
parents will have to participate in their communities, which will all contribute to the
specific ICT culture that develops in their families.
This section as situated the participants within a cultural context. The next
section will present the demographic results.
Demographic Results. As described in Chapter 3, Methods eight families with a
total of 30 individuals participated. Table 4.1 summarizes participant demographics for
each family, including the children’s ages, their country of origin, years in mainland U.S.,
annual combined income, parental education, and the number of members in each
family. To protect the anonymity of the participants, pseudonyms are used in the table,
and the portrait section of the dissertation and numbers are used in the findings and
discussion sections, for example, Teen 3 represents the participating teen from family 3
and Mom 5 represents the Mom from family 5. Numbers are used within the main

85
portion of the findings in order to discuss individual family members, and to maintain
the connection of each individual to their corresponding family. Table 4.2 summarizes
the participants by type. Table 4.3 summarizes the teen participants by age. Table 4.4
summarizes the gender of participants and Table 4.5 summarizes the number and type
of interviews.

Inventory of devices. To aid the analysis of teens’ negotiation of ICT devices in
accordance with the family small world an inventory of ICT devices that were present in
the participants’ households at the time of the interviews was assembled using data
from the surveys, the mapping activity, and all interviews. The collected inventory
revealed that all teens had access to at least two devices in their households, though
there was a large range in the quantity of ICT devices that different families owned.
Table 4.6 shows the devices available in each of the families’ households. There was a
significant range in the quantity of devices between households with families 2 and 4
having less than five devices and family 3 having twenty. The household mean was
approximately eleven devices.
Analysis of the data demonstrated that the number of devices in each household
did not directly correspond to teens’ ICT use in the home. There were large differences
in teens’ use of the different devices present in the home for a variety of reasons. Table
4.6 shows the devices available in the home, the devices that were personal to the
participating teens, and those that teens had access to. Access in this sense means,
refers to the devices in the home that teens used. The table shows that the number of
devices that teens used was different than the number that were available in the home.

Variations among families. The eight families met certain standards to be
selected to participate (as described in Chapter 4), but beyond these qualifiers there
was a large amount of variation within the sample. As seen in Table 4.6, six (75%) of the
participating families came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic, although one came
by way of Puerto Rico, and two families (25%) were from Puerto Rico. The families
ranged from 2-12 years in the U.S.. The parents from family 3 did not provide the

91
number of years each had been in the U.S., but Teen 3 was born in the U.S. He was the
only teenager in the sample that was born in the U.S. and he had the only parents that
were completely fluent in English. The median of time in the U.S. for the remainder of
the parents that participated was 7.5 years and the mean was 7.9 years. There was also
variation in English fluency, socio-economic means, and education, as described below.
English language fluency. The parents in the sample varied in their level of
English proficiency in a way that is difficult to quantify. The parents of Teen 3 spoke
English, but they had both mostly been raised on mainland U. S. All of the rest of the
parents were more comfortable speaking Spanish. The mothers from Family 1, 2, and 7
understood some English. The mother of Family 4 and the fathers from 7 and 8
understood English and could make themselves understood in English, but were much
more proficient in Spanish. Many of the parents sometimes peppered their Spanish
responses with English phrases or words. All of the teens in the study spoke English very
well. Teen 4 was the least comfortable, but still fairly proficient.
Occupation and socio-economics. The mother and father from family 7 and the
father from family 8 had professional jobs (2 families, 25%). Though they only worked
part time, they used computers regularly in their jobs. The other parents had less
fluency with ICTs, except for the father from family 3 who was a gamer. Most of the
parents in the sample worked in low wage blue collar jobs. Two mothers worked in
child care (F1 and 8), one was school bus driver (F2), and one worked at a big box store
(F4). There was one mother that was unemployed (F5). Additionally, there was one

92
father that worked maintenance (family 6), one that was a laid-off fork-lift operator (F3),
and one that was on disability (F2).
The mother from Family 1 did not provide the annual combined income for her
family, and the rest of the families ranged from less than $20,000 for families 4 and 6 to
$60,000-$80,000 in family 8. Two families (25%) had an annual combined income less
than $20,000, two families (25%) had an annual combined income of $20,000-40,000,
two families (25%) had an annual combined income of $40,000-$60,000, and one family
(12.5 %) had an annual combined income of $60,000-$80,000. The number of family
members is important to this quantity, as there were a number of large families in the
sample. The families ranged from 2- 8 members, with a median of 4 members and a
mean of 4.8 members (see Table 4.1, above).
Education. The parents also varied quite a bit in their level of formal education.
Of the 12 parents that participated, three (25%) parents had completed some high
school, three (25%) had graduated from high school, two (17%) had completed some
college, one (8%) had graduated from college, and three (25%) had graduate degrees.
As revealed in the interviews the level of formal education parents achieved had
some connection with parents’ comfort level with ICTs, with those with more formal
education (P7 and 8) generally being more comfortable with ICT use. These parents also
had jobs that were more information intense, one working in IT. However, the father
from Family 3, who had graduated from high school, was very adept with technology
and the mother from Family 1, also a high school graduate, did all of the ICT related

93
roles, such as research, installation, and maintenance, in her family and was fairly
comfortable.
Family Portraits
In the following section portraits of each of the eight families have been
assembled to provide an introduction to the Information Communication Technology
(ICT) culture and dynamic between teens and their parents in each home. The portraits
are summaries of the families’ circumstances during the time of the data collection.
They have been assembled through the various forms of data collected during the study
including: demographic data from the surveys, the teen mapping activity, and the
fieldnotes, audio recordings, and transcripts from the family, parent and teen interviews
(see Chapter 3). The survey data provided information concerning the number of family
members living in the household, the age of the children, parental occupation, the
country of origin, and the number of years they had been in mainland US. Fieldnotes
from the interviews provided information from the observations that the investigator
made at the time of the interviews. This information concerned the appearance of the
participants and the family home, their English language proficiency, their personalities
and idiosyncrasies, and the dynamic between family members. The mapping activity
provided data about ICT device location and the family members’ use of physical spaces.
Finally, the interviews provided contextual information about the family, and data
concerning parents and teens’ beliefs and practices in relation to ICTs.
Family 1: The Cardona family. The Cardona family was a family of four: Maria
(approximately 36), Lina (daughter, 14), Juan (son, 9), and a father that did not

94
participate. This was one of the two families wherein the mother demonstrated the
highest degree of monitoring and level of control over her teenager. In this case,
Maria’s parenting was also the best example of what Lareau (2011) calls concerted
cultivation, in which parents cultivate their children by enrolling them in activities
conceived to enhance their development and future. Maria was invested in getting her
teen daughter, Lina, into an elite college on a scholarship and kept her busy with
extracurricular activities that she thought would help her daughter achieve this goal.
She had supplied her daughter with numerous ICT devices and encouraged her to
explore the Internet, but she also maintained a high-level of control by demanding
passwords be shared, randomly taking her daughter’s devices so that she would not
learn to depend on them, and by monitoring her daughter’s Internet history and all her
communications with her peers.
Her daughter, Lina was reticent and answered all of the investigators questions
as briefly as possible. She only perked up when discussing how she had fashioned to
present herself on Instagram to display her talents and achievements. The dynamic
between Maria and Lina around ICTs indicated in the interviews suggested that Lina
negotiated the expectations and constraints of her family’s small world by limiting her
interactions with her peers in order to comply with her mothers’ expectations and
thereby restricting her own information ecology.
Family 2: Mendoza family. The Mendoza was a large family of seven: Andrea
(mother, 36), Eduardo (father, approximately 42), Isa (daughter, 14), Yenny (daughter,

95
11), Marivella (daughter, 10), Alisa (daughter, 9), and Leticia (daughter, 7). They were a
friendly, warm, and close-knit Dominican family with strong family small world
boundaries that are facilitated by their group understanding of themselves as different
from outsiders. Andrea and Eduardo had limited English proficiency and technical skills.
As the oldest sibling, Isa was frequently responsible for brokering her parents’ ICT
interactions and assisting them with technical issues. Andrea and Eduardo had a
negative view of technology and were hesitant to incorporate new ICTs into the
household, fearing the dangers they believe the Internet posed to their daughters and
the disruption it might cause to their familial culture. However, they did believe that
access to some technology was a necessity and had both acquired a smartphone and a
laptop for their daughters to share for educational use, that Eduardo’s younger brother
helped them maintain.
Though Isa’s parents each had their own smart phone they were ambivalent
about acquiring one for her. Isa was the only teen in the study without her own smart
phone. She would have liked to have had one, but she had also internalized her family’s
motto to “be different” and was very accepting of their views and decision. She had a
multitude of creative ways to negotiate the constraints to her access that her family
small world imposed on her and had a tendency to frame all of her constraints from a
positive angle. In this way, she was able to fulfill most of the expectations from her
various social worlds and maintain the equilibrium of her membership in her family
small world.

96
Family 3: The Mendez family. The Mendez family had eight members that
included Martina (mother, 34), Jose (stepfather, approximately 33), Jorge (eldest son,
16), and five younger siblings that did not participate. They were one of two Puerto
Rican families participating in the study and Jorge was the only teen in the study that
was born in mainland US. The family lived on the south side of Allentown; an area that is
considered dangerous by Lehigh Valley natives. Martina and Jose strived to protect
Jorge and their other children from the neighborhood, estranged family, and a world
that they believed was unpredictable and dangerous and had forbidden them to leave
the home (unaccompanied by one of them) beyond school and an after-school program.
In order to keep their children occupied and divert their attention from the physical
outside world, they had provided them with an abundance of ICT devices and
applications.
Jose was laid off at the time of the interviews and Martina worked long hours in
food service to support the family. Jorge was often responsible for his siblings and when
they discussed caregiving his inclusion in the parental unit was implicit. Martina and
Jose tightly controlled and monitored their younger children’s interactions with ICTs, but
had decided that Jorge had earned their trust. They no longer actively monitored him
and allowed him privacy and autonomy over his own ICT use. Jose was a gamer and had
encouraged Jorge’s gaming since he was very young, even teaching him how to read
using video games. Jorge’s affinity for gaming had inspired him to be a video game
designer and he and his parents viewed his gaming as a gateway to a professional
career. Jorge had internalized his parents’ beliefs about the neighborhood and accepted

97
his parents’ reluctance to allow him to socialize outside the household. Instead he had
turned to his gaming to fulfill his need for social connection and his teammates had
become his best friends.
Family 4: The Lopez family. The Lopez family was a single-parent household with
two members: Yolanda (mother, approximately 42) and Felipe (son, 16). They were the
second Puerto Rican family in the study and had been in the area for two years. A lack
of resources that had been exacerbated by his mother’s ICT mediation made Felipe’s
personal information ecology (PIE) the most constrained teenager within the study’s
families. Both Yolanda and Felipe had smart phones, but there were no other ICT
devices in the home. Moreover, Yolanda had intentionally limited his data in order to
limit and control his access to the Internet in response to finding pornography on
Felipe’s phone that went against her strong religious beliefs. The limitation of data on
his smart phone led Felipe to prioritize his data use for social media and limit activities
such as searching for information. Yolanda had also taken away his video games and
made him delete the games on his phone that he played online with his friends.
Although Yolanda used an authoritarian parenting style (Baumrind, 1967) with
Felipe, they were very close and he was very open with her. They spent a lot of time
together and he disclosed information about his actions and communications and when
she asked. He accepted his mother’s restrictions, knowing there would be
consequences, such as the removal of his phone, if he opposed her. To meet the ICT
expectations of his academic small world in accordance with his family small world,

98
Felipe had developed a routine utilizing the school’s computers. However, in other areas
he managed his ICT interactions in a way that had led him to limit his personal
information ecology, including his ability to make social connections and conform to
peer expectations.
Family 5: The Gonzalez family. The Gonzalez family was a large blended family
of six consisting of Marta (mother, approximately 38), Carlos (son, 14), Tina (daughter,
20), Mindy (daughter, 7), and two remaining family members that were not able to
participate in the study. The family went from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico
fifteen years ago and had been in mainland U.S. in the Lehigh Valley for the last six
years. Marta was not proficient in English and had limited technical knowledge. Carlos
and his older sister did the research, installation, and maintenance of the family ICT
devices. They also often provided technical assistance and some mediation of their
younger sister.
Marta had an easy relaxed parenting style and she and her husband had
provided their children with their own devices. Carlos had his own smart phone and
laptop. He was an avid gamer and referred to himself as addicted. He played League of
Legends with his friends over Skype on his laptop from his hub space in the living room,
where the family often congregates. In the past Marta had attempted to limit what she
felt was excessive gaming, but she had decided that it was more important to preserve
family harmony. Instead she chose to prioritize the completion of his academic and
family responsibilities. If he did not fulfill those responsibilities she would threaten to

99
take his devices. She said this practice was usually successful. Carlos admitted to
pushing back on her attempts to regulate his gaming, but was a very good student,
generally respectful, and made sure he had done all his homework and chores before he
started gaming for the evening.
Family 6: The Perez family. The Perez family was a family of five, but only Diego
(father, approximately 34), Mateo (son, 15), and Mia (daughter, 5), were present for the
interviews. The family came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic eleven years ago.
Diego worked second shift in maintenance during the week and his wife worked in
another state every weekend. Neither parent was proficient in English or technically
inclined. Mateo regularly brokered his parents’ connections with ICTs. He also served
as the resident technology expert and was responsible for the ICT research, installation,
and maintenance. He had used YouTube and Reddit to learn about technology and was
very knowledgeable about the technical aspects of computers, and even boasted that
he knew how to build them. Mateo’s interview was the longest interview in the sample.
Mateo was eager to discuss his habits and took pains to differentiate himself from his
parents. His father’s interview was the shortest in the sample. He seemed
uncomfortable and surprised that the investigator wanted to know more about his son’s
ICT use than his.
Everyone in the Perez family spent most of their time in the living room when
they were home, but they were independently focused, each doing their own thing. The
house was small and there was very little private space. His parents shared a bedroom

100
with his younger sister and his bedroom was a walkthrough that was used to get to the
downstairs bathroom. Mateo’s parents placed the desktop computer in the living room
in order to supervise their children’s interactions with ICTs and consequently did not
feel the need to put many limitations on their ICT use. Though his parents believed they
knew what he was doing on the computer, Mateo said that they had no knowledge of
his activities. This was partially because he minimized pages and changed his ICT activity
according to the context, but mostly because he felt secure that they did not know what
he was doing, due to their limited English skills and their lack of attention.
Family 7: The Baldez family. The Baldez family was a family of four consisting of
Carla (mother, approximately 36), Hernan (father, approximately 42), Lisa (daughter,
15), and Camila (daughter, 11). They came to the Lehigh Valley six years ago from the
Dominican Republic for work. They have a medium sized, three bedrooms, unattached
home in a in fairly affluent part of town that they were currently sharing with the Mejia
family, the eighth family in the study. The Baldez and Mejia families were the only
families in the study cohabitating with another family. The mothers of both families
(Carla & Guadalupe) were sisters. Lisa shared a bedroom with her younger sister and
cousin, but lamented the loss of her personal space in the home. Carla and Hernan
were the only parents in the study that both had graduate degrees and worked in white
collar jobs, each working part-time as a mental health counselor. Carla, Hernan, and Lisa
each had their own smart phone and Camila had her own tablet. There was also a range
of other devices in the home. Lisa’s parents used technology often in their work and for
entertainment. Carla spoke little English and both parents were more comfortable in

101
Spanish. Lisa helped mediate her younger sister’s ICT interactions and occasional helped
her mother with technical and brokering tasks. Her father was fairly technologically
adept and responsible for most of the technical tasks in the household.
Lisa’s parents had given Lisa more freedom to make her own choices as she had
gotten older. She and her parents had a balance of trust that was based on Lisa being
open about her ICT activities and their providing her with the autonomy to control her
own ICT interactions. If they asked to see her phone or accounts she disclosed them,
but they did not often ask. Lisa shared her mother’s Instagram account and was friends
with her mother on Snapchat. Carla had instructed Lisa to take down posts she found
inappropriate on a few occasions, which Lisa had found irritating. Lisa often censored
and obscured her posts to make them more appropriate for her mother to read, but she
also posted to her mother’s account in ways that directly engaged her mother in an
affectionate way.
Family 8: The Mejia family. The Mejia family was a family of four that included
Thialgo (father, approximately 40), Guadalupe (mother, approximately 40), Angel (son,
19), and Lisa (daughter, 14). They came to the Lehigh Valley from the Dominican
Republic seven years ago for an IT job Thialgo acquired at a mental health facility in the
area. They were currently living with Guadalupe’s sister’s family, the Baldez family, and
had been staying with them for approximately six months. Thialgo had a graduate
degree and worked part-time in IT and Guadalupe worked fulltime in a day care. The
Mejia family was shy and Thialgo was often the one to respond to the investigators

102
questions. He spoke slowly and methodically. Victoria was the most restrained teen in
the study. She answered briefly, often only nodding or shaking her head.
All four Mejia family members had their own smartphone and Angel had a TV
and a gaming device in his room. There was also a range of other ICT devices in the
home. Victoria shared a room with her cousins, Lisa and Camila. Thialgo viewed ICTs as
tools and their use as a skill. Guadalupe was a bit more uneasy with technology, but let
her husband lead as the expert in the family. They believed that ICT mediation was best
handled through discussion and guidance and allowed their children autonomy to make
their own ICT choices. They believed that they could not control their teenagers when
they were not present and that the most effective way to influence them was by sharing
their beliefs and allowing them to decide for themselves. The only rule that they
consistently enforced was bedtime.
Overview of families. This section has presented a portrait of each of the eight
families in the study. The portraits provide a holistic overview of the context of each
family and how the various issues that are discussed later in this chapter by research
question fit in. Each family had its own ICT culture of routine practices that was situated
within the particular circumstances of their personal context in combination with their
family narratives and underlying beliefs. Differing parenting styles and ICT mediation
practices led to dynamics that varied widely across the families. Broad demographic
similarities appeared to produce very different results depending on the families’
particular circumstances, narratives, and parents’ beliefs about parenting and

103
technology. For instance, in the two homes with the smallest annual income (F4 and
F6), Teen 6 had almost complete autonomy to interact with ICTs, access to ten ICT
devices in the home, but very little privacy. Teen 4, on the other hand, only had access
to two devices, limited data on his smart phone, extreme restrictions on his content, but
a good deal of physical privacy. The differences between these participants’
experiences were both structural and cultural. Teen 6 lived in a tiny home with his
family of five and his parents had a permissive style of parenting based on a family
narrative of individualism that may have been related to their dependence on their
children’s language and technical assistance. Teen 4 lived alone with his mom and had
his own room, but his mother believed in the importance of parental control and
authority, which was not challenged by a need for her son’s assistance as she
understood English and the only technology they had to maintain was their personal
smart phones. What was constant across the families, however, was that the
adolescents negotiated their own practices within what was acceptable to their parents
and that family stability was prioritized by both parents and teens. In families where
parents provided more autonomy, their teenagers also pushed their boundaries more.
At the same time, in these homes parents also negotiated their own practices more to
accommodate their children’s autonomy. Even within those families where parents
were described as exhibiting more controlling practices, they had a tendency to adjust
to their teens’ strongly expressed priorities. For example, despite having a controlling
parenting style, Mom 4 had completely stopped posting to SM about her son per his
insistent request. Similarly, the adolescents adjusted to strongly felt parental priorities

104
even if they disagreed with the underlying premise or beliefs and they were often able
to do this with a level of proficiency that allowed them to stay within their families’
social norms, but also extend their connections and practices beyond that world. The
following chapter, Chapter 5, will explore the findings related to RQ1 concerning
parents’ ICT mediation practices that were determined from the collected data.

105
Chapter 5 : Findings for Research Question (RQ) 1
This chapter will present findings for RQ 1 which asked: How do Latino/a parents
mediate their teens’ ICT interactions? Data from the family, parent, and teen interviews
revealed that Latino/a parents had a number of parental practices that influenced how
teens interact with ICTs. As stated in Chapter 4, the investigator commenced the
analysis with a codebook based on the literature review and a pilot study that was then
adapted through analysis of the qualitative data using the Constant Comparative
Method (Charmaz, 2014; Taylor & Bogdan, 1998). This process involved the
construction of a typology of parents’ ICT mediation practices that is presented in
Parental ICT Mediation Practices Table 5.1, below that delineates major theme,
subthemes, and categories. The second column in the table indicates the quantity of
families categorized within that theme from the family, parent, and/or teen interviews
in which they participated. The third column in the table represents the total number of
statements from all of the qualitative interviews that were categorized within the
indicated category. The full typology with definitions and examples can be found in
Appendix F.

Major Theme: Parental Mediation (PM)
PM has traditionally been conceptualized as the practices that parents use to
prevent the negative effects of media, specifically television (e.g., Borzekowski &

107
Robinson, 2007; Lemish, 2008; Nathanson, 1999; Valkenburg, Krcmar, Peeters, &
Marseille, 1999). Clark (2011) has critiqued this focus as idealistic and called for
research that includes a more realistic consideration of ICT parenting practices. This
research answers her call by interpreting PM as the parental practices that influence
their teenagers’ ICT interactions. This helped the research address the entanglement of
parenting practices with PM practices. With this conceptualization in mind, and the data
from the family, individual parent, and teen interviews was coded for mediation
practices 488 times. Units of data were sometimes coded more than once to represent
different aspects of the typology. The most prevalent subthemes identified in the data
were as follows: directive narratives (134 times), restrictive mediation (99 times), active
mediation (70 times), parental monitoring (59 times), privacy provision (32 times), and
SM (30 times). As part of their restrictive mediation parents made rules and restrictions
for their teens’ ICT use that provided the general framework for what was appropriate
and inappropriate. For example, in the family interview Mom 2 described making her
children stop using ICTs at bedtime. She said, “when the time comes for sleep, that is at
9 pm, be they sleepy or not they have to sleep” (M2, FI, trans). 23 Parents also employed

2

Abbreviations are used to identify participants’ family role, the number of the family in which they were
identified with in Chapter 4, and the type of interview the quotation is derived from. M stands for mom,
D stands for dad, and T stands for teen. M2, FI from the first quotation in this chapter identifies the
quotation as a statement Teen 2’s mother made in their family interview.

All illustrative quotations were in English unless marked as translated. All translations are presented
verbatim, without corrections for grammar, but filler words (such as ah, like, um), meaningless word
repetitions, and interviewer responses are omitted to promote readability. Translations were all made by
the investigator.

108
active mediation techniques where they engaged directly with their teens about their
ICT use. Mom 1 explained, “I always need to remind her that if it was photo…that she is
only half clothed, that stays forever” (M1, PI, trans). Parents’ mediation of ICT
technologies usually included the removal of the teens’ devices as a threat or a
punishment. For instance, speaking of his father, Teen 6 said, “one day I missed school,
and then he came, and he just took it” (T6, TI). Parents also monitored teens’ use of
their ICT interactions. Speaking of her daughter’s smart phone, Mom 1, said, “I check
where she was, even the history, I check that, where she has entered” (M1, PI, trans).
Parents often balanced their monitoring with the purposeful provision of privacy. Teen
7’s mother explained, “we don’t impose too much, she has her privacy” (M7, PI, trans).
However, the ubiquitous presence of SM in modern lives complicated the division
between what was private and public and created a situation ripe for PM. About
monitoring her son’s SM participation, Teen 3’s mother said, “if he posts something
then I'll see it” (M3, PI). Lastly, participants’ accounts often included statements related
to their identities and priorities that were connected to parents’ mediation practices
and the dynamic that had developed around ICTs in the family. These types of
statements are referred to within the study as directive narratives. For instance, Mom 1
described how she was, “the one that takes care of everything” (M1, PI, trans). She saw
herself as the family administrator and had taken on this role in relation to ICTs as well.
Results for the major qualitative subthemes that were discovered in the data relating to
RQ 1 are presented below in order of frequency of occurrence, except for results related
to the directive narratives subtheme, which will be presented last. Illustrative

109
quotations, as appropriate, from the data are used to exemplify these subthemes. The
major findings for RQ 1 are listed at the end of this chapter.
Subtheme: Restrictive mediation. Analysis of family, parent, and teen
interviews demonstrated that parents’ rules and restrictions were significant to how
their teens’ used ICTs and coded 99 times from the data. These rules and restrictions
constituted the formal structure for the ICT interactions that were understood as
appropriate in teens’ households. Rules and restriction were very similar, but were
understood slightly differently within the study. Statements were categorized as
restrictions when they described a constraint parents had that directly concerned teens’
ICT use. Statements were categorized as rules if they described a practice that
constrained teens’ ICT use indirectly by affecting their parameters for ICT use. These
rules and restrictions varied by family, but emerged as significant constraints on teens
ICT interactions and will be discussed below.
Category: Restrictions. Parents had practices concerning the ICTs teens could
interact with and how they could interact with them (coded 62 times). There were 4
categories of this type of direct ICT constraint including restrictions on access (21 times),
interactions (18 times), content (17 times), and screen time (6 times). There was a
large range in how parents described what these restrictions meant in their household.
For instance, seven out of eight of the teens’ parents discussed restrictions on content.
For some parents, this included anything that was understood as unladylike (P2), for
others it meant X-rated content (Parents of Teen 3), but for most it was somewhere in

110
between and could be quite vague. When asked about rules, Teen 5 mentioned that he
was, “not to look at inappropriate stuff in my room” (T5, Teen interview), but had
trouble defining what exactly that meant. Teen 1’s mother was the only parent that
described using technical restrictions, such as a content filter, to help limit her
daughter’s exposure to violent and sexual content.
Parents and teens also mentioned restrictions concerning how they interacted
online. These included restrictions on competitive behavior, sharing personal
information, posting provocative photos, interacting with strangers, and online bullying.
Dad 3 said, “[j]ust don't be cyberbullying” (D3, FI). While many of parents’ restrictions
had no mechanism for enforcement in place, restrictions on access were enforced by
tangible actions, such as not buying a personal device for their teen (P2), restricting
access to personal ICT devices (P1, 2, and 4), controlling the amount of data that could
be accessed (P4), and controlling how the Internet could be accessed (P4). For example,
Teen 4’s mother limited the amount of data available on her son’s smart phone in order
to “have more control over what he can use” (M4, PI, trans). Her actions produced
specific restrictions on Teen 4’s ICT use. Teen 4 illustrated this point, by saying, “I don't
have, like, enough data to watch Netflix, so we watch it together” (T4, TI).
Category: Rules. It was inferred from the interviews that parents put rules into
place to keep teens healthy and safe, but they also provided structure and constraints

111
for teens’ interactions with ICTs (see Major Findings 1.2)4. The most prevalent rules
(coded 37 times) that were described in the data concerned bedtimes, (17 times),
completion of responsibilities before ICT use (16 times), and the prohibition of
socializing outside the home (4 times). The most common rule described in the
interviews was bedtime with either parents or teens in 7 out of 8 families (all except F7)
mentioning such a rule. For example, Teen 6 said, “when they go to bed they tell
me…now turn it off, you have to go to bed for school” (T6, FI, trans). Like other rules,
bedtime rules were usually only indirectly related to ICT use, but they influenced teens’
use when they were implemented (see Major Finding 1.3).
Subtheme: Active mediation. Active mediation of teen ICT use was a common
theme that was coded in 64 statements. Parents of all eight teens were reported as
using at least one of the five categories of active PM revealed in the data. Categories
included: discussion of teens’ ICT use (29 times), the provision of help and
understanding (13 times), and active co-use 9 times), the encouragement of exploration
(7 times), and alternative suggestions or activities (6 times),
Category: Discussion. Discussion was the most frequent form of parental ICT
mediation. Statements were coded from either parents or teens 29 times from all eight
families. Parents described having discussions with their teens concerning information

The Major Findings are presented in list form at the end of the chapter. When each finding is introduced
into the text of the findings its number will be stated, such as (see Major Finding 1.3).

112
literacy (P2, 4, and 7), online safety (P1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8), rules and restrictions (P4, and
8), teens’ transgressions (P1, 3, 4, 7, and 8), and their beliefs and values (P1, 2, 4, and 8).
Parents used this method to instruct, explain, and enculturate. Sometimes this meant
parents initiated discussions with teens that directly concerned teens’ use of ICTs. For
example, teen 8’s mother described how she told her daughter “when you enter
Facebook, don’t give your name or your address because there are a lot of people that
will do you harm” (M8, PI, trans). However, parents also discussed imploring their teens
to use ICTs in ways that correlated with their beliefs that only indirectly related to ICTs,
but directly impacted teens’ use. For example, Dad 8 described speaking with his
teenage children about using ICTs differently on Saturdays. He said, “from sundown on
Friday to sunset on Saturday, to rest, we are more immersed in what is the spiritual part
and the religious part…it is part of our beliefs and we try to teach them” (D8, PI, trans).
PM discussions could be responsive as well. Mom 7 disclosed how, “one day [Isa]
received a text…that she didn’t have in her contacts…and right away she came running
to us and said, ‘mami, I don’t know this person and it bothers me” (M7, PI, trans). They
used their daughter’s initiation to begin a discussion about ICT communication safety.
As all of these statements indicate, parents used discussions as they felt they were
needed in the moment.
Category: Help. Parents’ provision of teens with help or understanding in
relation to ICTs was noteworthy within the interviews and was described 13 times by
parents and/or teens in five families (F2, 3, 4, 7, and 8). Parents described themselves
or were described assisting teens with technical issues (P3, 7, and 8), the development

113
of Internet search strategies (P2, 4, 7 and 8), understanding information online (P2 and
7), and school work (P2, 3, 7, and 8). For example, Dad 7 said he helped his daughter,
“when she has some doubt over information, that is, or how to do an information
search, and that type of thing, or to do homework” (D7, PI, trans). The provision of help
was gendered with mothers providing help with information and school work (T2, 3, and
4), and fathers assisting with gaming and technical issues (T3, 7, and 8). Teen 3,
explained, “my dad with gaming and my mom, she, education” (T3, TI). The help
parents provided was skewed towards fathers in general with eight of the 13 statements
of parental assistance being about help from fathers.
Category: Exploration. Parents’ encouragement of exploration using ICTs
emerged in data analysis as an important category of active mediation. Parents of five
teens (P1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) described or were described as encouraging their teens to go
online and explore 7 times. For example, teen 2 said, “[y]eah, she's [her mother] like, go
to YouTube and find useful videos of what they're teaching you in school to keep
yourself, cause I'm not a big numbers person, but she wants me to” (T2, TI). Like teen
2’s description many of the statements referred to encouragement of a specific pursuit,
often education, rather than teens’ personal interests and most were only general
prescriptions. Mom 4 said, “once a month, sometimes I tell him to look up information
about certain things” (M4, PI).
Category: Alternative suggestions or activities. Six times, parents and/or teens
of three families (F1, 5, and 8) said that scheduling or suggestions of alternative

114
activities was used to distract teens from the use of ICTs. Parents of Teen 5 and 8 spoke
about attempting to get teens to read as an alternative. Mom 5 said, “always when I go
out to the store and I see a book I bring him a book, because before he liked to read”
(M5, PI, trans). Mom 1, on the other hand, described keeping her kids busy as an
alternative to making formal ICT rules. She said, “they don’t watch as much television. I
always look for activities, even Saturdays, Sunday, we’re always in the street (M1, PI).
Subtheme: Devices. PM in relation to material ICT devices was a prominent
subtheme that all of the parents described or were described using by their teen
children 70 times in the interviews. Two categories quickly emerged as most noteworthy
to teens’ use of ICTs: parents’ choice of technologies (41 times) and the use of removal
as a threat or punishment (29 times).
Category: Parents’ choice of devices. Parents of all of the teens, except for teen
2, had bought or allowed them to buy (T5) their own smart phone at the mean age of
12. Parents usually cited communication and coordination as their motivation. For
example, Teen 1’s mother said she had bought her daughter her first phone, “for if I got
worried that she was late, so she could call me or whatever” (M1, PI, trans). Teen 2’s
parents’ hesitation to purchase her a phone, on the other hand, was a conscious act to
restrict her ICT use. Parents of half the teens (P1, 3, 5, and 7) had also bought their
teens other personal devices in addition to their smart phones, such as laptops (T1 and
5), tablets (T1 and 7), and gaming devices (T3 and 7) that extended their access. (see
Table 4.6 in Chapter 4 for summary of household devices)

115
Category: Removal as threat or punishment. Second, all of the parents
described or were described using the removal of teens’ personal devices to compel
teens to comply with their wishes (see Major Finding 1.4). Removal was done as both a
threat (P3, 4, 5, 7, and 8) and a punishment (P2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). Parents said
removal was very effective in obtaining their teens’ compliance. For example, in the
family interview, Mom 5 said, “I am going to hit you [her son] where it hurts, the
technology, I am going to take it from you” (M5, FI, trans). She said making this threat
“puts him right, right way” (M5, PI, trans). Sometimes parents used device removal
“only as a threat,” (D8, PI, trans), but many times parents also used it to punish their
teens. In the parental interview, Mom 4 said, “we took it away because we found him,
that he was going into pornography” (M4, PI, trans). Often the punishment then
functioned as a reminder to teens that parents would follow through with their threat if
they did not submit. When Teen 4 was asked if he obeyed his mother, he said, “yeah
cause if I don’t she going to take my phone so” (T4, TI). Parents used these practices in
relation to controlling teens’ ICT use, but they also used them as resource for their
parenting in general. For instance, Teen 7, said that sometimes her parents took her
phone, “‘cause my attitude gets a little out of hand” (T7, TI). In these ways, parents’ use
of device removal as a threat and as a punishment were effective mediation and
parenting practices that often worked in congruence.
Subtheme: Parental monitoring. Analysis of all the interviews demonstrated
that parental ICT monitoring was a prominent theme. Parents of all eight teens were
found to use some type of monitoring 58 times. Additionally, three categories of

116
monitoring practices emerged from parents’ and teens’ discussions: supervision (34
times), checking devices and ICT interaction histories (15 times), and verbal enquiries
(10 times).
Category: Supervision. Supervision involved being alert to teens’ ICT activities
while in physical space and sharing space. For example, teen 2’s mother said, “I had
[the computer] in the living room, because the number one rule was that each person
that was going to use the computer, I had to be watching what they were doing” (M2,
PI, trans).
Category: Verbal enquiries. Verbal enquiries entailed asking teens questions
about their ICT use, such as what they were doing and who they were talking to. Teen
8’s mother said, “there are things that I ask them, ‘what are you watching’” (M8, PI,
trans).
Category: Checking devices and online interactions. Less often, parents
checked teens’ devices and interactions online. Teen 1’s mother explained,” I don’t ask
her who she’s talking to or anything, I just see the page that they were using, Kik, or
Messenger, or WhatsApp, when they talk what she says to see if they talk in good terms,
how she presents herself, if she knows how to defend herself from any questions her
friends ask” (M1, PI, trans). Only one other mother mentioned covert monitoring (M5).
Most monitoring was done with teens’ knowledge and was infrequent. For instance,
Dad 8 said, “it is very rare that we do it, but sometimes, simply to make sure there is
nothing for us to be worried about” (D8, PI, trans). Parents wanted to substantiate that

117
there was nothing to be concerned about. They also hoped teens would control their
own ICT use if they knew their parents might check their interactions (see Major Finding
1.5). For example, mom 3 believed that her son would comply with his bedtime
because “my husband could find out if he's still playing, who he's talking to (M3, PI).
However, this type of monitoring was rarely practiced and was often discussed in
conjunction with teens’ need for privacy (see Major Finding 1.6). When Mom 5 was
asked if she checked her son’s phone she said, “yes, regularly during the morning is
when I most check it, with that sound you ask, ‘wait what sounds so much?’…they’re
messages, they are regularly messages from his friends from school that are texting him.
I see that they are friends, friends. I don’t like checking, I like that he have his privacy”
(M3, PI, trans). Her statement demonstrates the balance between monitoring and the
provision of privacy that parents said that they attempted to achieve.
Subtheme: Privacy. The provision of privacy by parents to their teens emerged
as a significant theme in the interviews and was coded from the data 32 times by the
parents of six teens (P3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). Four categories of privacy were identified:
autonomy (17 times), independence (9 times), privacy in physical space (3 times), and
device and account privacy (3 times). Most parents (P3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) believed that their
teens needed more privacy as they got older and they wanted to provide it, but still be a
good parent. For half the parents (P3, 5, 7, and 8) privacy was described specifically as a
parenting strategy. They believed that allowing their teens personal space would lead
their children to be more open and disclose more information. Dad 7 explained “if we
put a lot of pressure on her, she’s not going to do things in front of us, so then, we won’t

118
know what she is doing. Putting lot of restrictions will push her away from us. So, she
will have, so we will have, trust in her and she in us” (D7, PI, trans).
Category: Autonomy. Parents described providing their teens with privacy by
granting teens more autonomy to control their own ICT content and interactions as they
got older. For example, Dad 7 said, “before we were really on top of her to control the
amount of time, but now she has the capacity, to dedicate time to homework, and the
other to do something recreational like using technology” (D7, PI, trans).
Category: Independence. Parents often gave their children more independence
to be separate from them and/or purposefully did not seek out information about their
personal lives. Mom 3 said “[a]s a teenager, yeah, give them their space, you know?
Sometimes they don’t–he's at that stage where he doesn’t wanna do mommy things no
more” (M3, PI).
Category: Physical space. Parents of two teens (P3 and 4) also referred to
allowing their teens to be by themselves in physical space. Mom 4 disclosed, “I know
that he needs time to be alone and I let him shut the door” (M4, PI, trans).
Category: Device and internet privacy. Parents sometimes made a point of
granting teens privacy on their devices and Internet accounts. Teen 3’s mother
explained, “I never looked at it…I know that's giving him reasons not to trust me” (M3,
PI).

119
Subtheme: Social media (SM). Data analysis of transcripts from all of the
interviews revealed that SM was a significant part of both parents and teens’ lives and
required a high degree of boundary negotiation (coded 30 times). Most of the parents
were friends or followed their teens on SM (P1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). Table 5.2 indicates
the SM sites where parents were their teens’ friends or followers. These friendships
caused a host of structural and social complications for teens’ use of SM through
parental monitoring and judgements (17 times), parents’ posts (9 times), and parents’
social networks (4 times). Findings related to these categories are presented below in
order of topical progression, beginning with parents’ posts and ending with parents’
social network and will be illustrated with appropriate quotations from the data.

Category: Parents’ posts. Most of the parents were SM participants (M1, 2, 3, 5,
6, 7, and 8; D6 and 8) and discussed posting about their teens. Dad 8 said they posted

120
about “things that we do together with them, for example, we go to a park and we put it
so that our family in the Dominican Republic can see that we’re there” (D8, PI, trans).
Three mothers (M1, 3, and 7) posted often, sometimes daily. Teen 3 said his mother
posted about him, “all the time, whenever we’re doing something or she’s just posting a
general post like ‘hanging out with the kids, have the best day everyone,’ and all that
stuff” (T3, TI). Parents seemed to see their SM accounts as their personal space. Teen 7’s
mother defended her right to publish posts about her daughter by explaining her SM
accounts were her personal space to connect with the friends and family that she had
left behind in the Dominican Republic. She said, “I have all my family there, far from
here, and my friends, far from here, and they can all see each other” (M7, FI, trans).
Parents did not usually ask their teens’ permission to post about them and teens 2, 3,
and 7, said they usually found out about their mother’s posts after the fact. Teen 2 said,
“she [her mother] follows a lot of family and a lot of family don’t get to see me, so, and
sometimes I don’t even know she posted it, until she tells me, ‘oh your aunt said this,’
and I'm like ‘what?’ And she's like, ‘oh this’” (T2, TI)! Parents also did not seem to
consider the image that their teens wanted to project to their own peers and the most
common complaint teens (T1, 3, 4, and 7) made about the posts their parents published
about them was that they were unflattering. For example, Teen 7 said, “she was
posting some ugly throwbacks of me. There's this thing called the glow up, it was
before, I had a baby face, I was not looking well, I did not have my eyebrows” (T7, TI).
Category: Monitor and judge teens’ posts. Being friends with teens meant
parents were also able to monitor their teens’ SM activities. This monitoring sometimes

121
occurred simply as a result of being friends with teens, but parents also described
purposefully monitoring SM activities. Teen 1’s mother explained that, “[b]ecause
they’re girls, if she puts some photo that they think is pretty, but for someone, they will
not know if she is well-mannered. Me that, I keep that in mind to check” (M1, PI, trans).
Nearly every parent (except in F6) was concerned with how teens presented themselves
on SM and teens’ posts were sometimes an area of contention between teens and their
parents. Though, in the surveys, none of the teens and only two of the teens’ parents
(T2 and 7) reported parents asking teens to take SM posts down, data from both
parents and teens collected from the family, parent, and teen interviews demonstrated
that one teen (T7) and four teens’ parents (P1, 3, 7, and 8) provided accounts of this
practice. This type of mediation was uncommon, but the accounts were often vivid. For
example, Mom 7 related the following: “this once, she was coming home on the bus,
and with her classmate and her, they were filming all of what a girl, talking obscenities
on the bus, she was angry with someone and wanted to hit her, and she posted it and I
corrected her. I told her not that kind of thing” (M7, PI, trans). Parents’ accounts
provided context for teens’ need to negotiate their boundaries with their parents on
SM.
Category: Parents’ extended network of friends and family. Data from the
parent and teen interviews indicated that parents extended SM networks influenced
their ideas about what was appropriate for their children to post. Though only two
teens (T3 and 7) touched on this aspect of managing their participation with SM, half
the parents’ accounts (P1, 3, 7, and 8) revealed that a common impetus for their

122
requests that teens remove posts from SM was their circle of friends and family. Dad 8
said, “sometimes I have told her, ‘mami mira [Spanish colloquialism that means, “look
sweetheart”], this that you put up, someone told me that isn’t, that it’s not ok, that a
Christian girl or someone of your age post this,’” (D8, PI, trans). Parents’ accounts
exposed that parents’ friends and family extended the reach of parents’ SM monitoring
and the social norms teens needed to accommodate and that teens were often illequipped to negotiate the intricacies of the additional context. Mom 8 explained, “she
does not understand much of what she says in Spanish, and she put it because they do
not know what it is…and I said, ‘No, what happens is that here it is used in English in
another way,’” (M8, PI, trans). Teens’ negotiation of the extra layer of context their
parents’ friends and family added meant that they also sometimes needed to negotiate
the intricacies of parents’ personal relationships. Mom 3 explained, “when it comes to
family and certain people that unfortunately we don’t talk to right now because of
certain situations, and…they're not friends with me, but they're friends with my son…I
just tell him don’t comment on it. Don’t like it, or don’t comment because by you liking
it, that's like, you might as well leave a comment (M3, PI). Her statement reveals she
expected her son to restrict his participation on Facebook with people to whom he had
a different relationship than she did.
Subtheme: Directive narratives. Data analysis from all interviews revealed that
the narratives that participants used to talk about themselves to the investigator were
related to the domestic ICT structure. One hundred and thirty-four directive narratives
were identified in the interviews. Directive narratives are used within this study to

123
indicate orienting statements that were found within the participants’ accounts that
characterized the familiy, as well as individual members’ priorities and identities at the
time of the interviews. This study builds on the findings of Silverstone and colleagues
(1989, see Chapter 3), to demonstrate that family narratives helped to direct the
dynamic that existed in the participants’ households surrounding ICTs. The directive
narratives that were derived from the data could be subdivided into parent (62 times),
family (38 times), and teen narratives (34 times). Findings related to these categories
will be presented below in order of topical progression, starting with family narratives
and ending with teen narratives and a discussion of polyphony (Bakhtin, 1980). The
categories will be illustrated with appropriate quotation from the interviews.
Category: Family directive narratives. Family directive narratives were defined
as accounts or statements that participants told that expressed an idea or engaged with
an idea of who they were and what they thought as a family (38 times). For example,
Dad 8 said,
we are Seventh Day Adventists, so, on Saturdays, in general, we don’t use our
telephones in the same way that we use them during the week…we can watch
movies, for example, but…something that has to do with being a Christian,
histories of biblical figures, even if it’s cartoons, or live action, or documentaries
about animals. That is what they watch, if they watch something else we always
bring it to their attention (D8, PI, trans).
Dad 8’s narrative of their being Seventh Day Adventists was woven into his explanation
for the family’s ICT practices, providing a context for who they were as a family, the
practices that were connected with that identity, and the roles that various members
played out within the context (see Major Finding 1.7). Half of the families’ directive

124
statements were like a family motto that strongly established their identity as a family
(F2, 3, 4, and 8), while in other families they provided an underlying directive for how
the family approached ICTs (F1, 5, 6 and 7). The difference between these two types of
family narratives can be illustrated by contrasting family 2 with family 6. Family 2 had
an overall view of themselves as “different” that was taken up by the entire family. In
the family interview, Dad 2 said, “[n]o perfecta, but be a different” (D2, FI, trans). This
mantra provided the family members with a structure for how they were meant to
interpret their own practices in relation to outsiders. This combined with another family
mantra about their “old fashioned” (M2, FI, trans) relationship to technology and
seemed to direct how they interacted with ICTs. The family members expressed their
perceived difference with pride. Teen 2’s younger sister, Yenny, explained about how
their family was with technology, “so we’re not really a big fan...we don’t use it as much,
we’re not an addict with it” (S2, FI). Her statement reproduces the family narrative,
positions it in relation to outsiders, and demonstrates that it has been internalized by
family members and become a distinct part of how they see themselves as a group. In
contrast, Family 6’s narrative was subtler, but also correlated with how they approached
ICTs as a family. Dad 6 explained, “we are independent, each one” (D6, FI, trans).
Members of Family 6 tended to interact independently with ICTs despite spending most
of their time together in the living room. In his interview, Teen 6 expounded, saying,
“my parents they give us, they give me–my sister they don’t care 'cause she's like an
adult, but they give me and her, my little sister, a lot of freedom I think” (T6, TI).

125
Category: Parental directive narratives. Directive narratives were also a
prominent category in parents’ explanations of their practices and seven of the teens’
parents (P1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8) were coded as asserting parental narratives 62 times in
the family and parent interviews. Parents’ accounts or statements were classified as
parental narratives if they were used to establish a personal and/or a parental identity
or engaged with an idea of who they were. Most of the parents had a tendency of
circling back to similar themes within their interviews that distilled an underlying
philosophy of how they saw themselves as parents and/or as individuals in relation to
ICTs. For example, Dad 8 explained various times that he and his wife mediated their
children’s ICT use “[s]imply by talking with them, advising them” (D8, PI, trans). His
duplication of statements like this one seemed to exhibit a desire for the investigator to
perceive them as being democratic parents that prioritized discussion, individual choice,
and consensus. He expanded, “[w]e don’t obligate them, we simply explain what we
believe and we give them the option to choose” (D8, PI, trans).
Parents occasionally also made identity statements about their own relationship
with ICTs. For instance, Mom 7 said, “I’m addicted, he’s not” (M7, PI, trans) in reference
to her use of Instagram in relation to her husband. In contrast, her husband, Dad 7,
declared, “I’m not a fan” (D7, PI, trans) to elucidate how he did and did not engage with
digital culture. Teen 7’s parents’ diverging narratives revealed how they saw themselves
and pointed to the different ways they engaged with their daughter around ICTs. Her
father did not want his daughter to be easily influenced by her interactions with culture
on ICTs. He explained how he tried to prevent this. He said, “I talk to her a lot about the

126
phenomenon of the fan, that is, for me that, for me people that are fans, are, that is, I
call them dough people, and I don’t want my daughters to be dough people” (D7, PI,
trans). In contrast, Teen 7’s mother’s main engagement with her daughter around ICTs
was through SM. Describing how she shared her Instagram account with her daughter,
Mom 7 said, “she grabs my phone, she herself publishes on mine, that is, I let her do
what she wants” (M7, PI, trans). The narratives exemplified by Teen 7’s parents
demonstrated the way parents’ personal narratives related to how they individually
parented their children’s ICT use.
In the analysis of the individual parental interviews, parents’ beliefs about
parenting and technology were found to be a significant part of their accounts of their
ICT mediation and monitoring (see Major Finding 1.8). The parenting beliefs that were
expressed by parents in the data concerned their beliefs about their right to information
about their teens, how information should flow between teens and parents, how much
authority they should assert over their teenagers, and their underlying beliefs about
technology. Parents’ beliefs about parenting and technology combined with their
directive narratives in interesting ways to help produce the collection of varied ICT
mediation practices that they used. They did not lead directly to certain practices, but
were interpreted and combined by parents in distinctive ways. For instance, Mom 4
expressed a strong belief in the need for parental monitoring and control of her son’s
activities. She explained that she was, “trying to, adjust his mind so that he thinks like
me, like what I have learned is right. That the things that God does not like, that one
doesn’t want to practice them” (M4, PI, trans). She had combined her belief in

127
authoritarian parenting (see Baumrind, 1967) with her narrative of being a Christian
mother. She expanded, “I use the Bible a lot to give him guidance, about what God
thinks, because I’m not there 24 hours of the day. But God, he knows, is observing 24
hours a day” (M4, PI, trans). In this way, Teen 4’s mother was attempting to get her son
to interact appropriately with ICTs when she was not around by convincing him that
someone, God, was always watching.
Category: Teens’ directive narratives. In the analysis teens’ personal narratives
were identified as playing a significant role in the overall structure of the family. All 8
teens presented personal narratives a combined 34 times in the family and teen
interviews. These narratives exemplified teens’ personal identity and priorities and
provided an inside perspective to their relationship with technology. For example, Teen
6, communicated that unlike his technically ignorant family, he was knowledgeable
about technology. He said, “I learned like throughout the years. I was interested in
electronics, since little, like, when I got a toy…like the Sunday, I got a toy I remember the
same day I opened it, and I was little, and they were talking to me, ‘like now put it back
together’” (T6, TI). In this statement Teen 6 established himself as conversant in
technology and provided an origin myth to explain how he had first become interested
in the subject. Some teens provided narratives that were less individualized and instead
reiterated the dynamic they had with their parents around ICTs. For instance, when
Teen 7 was asked if she participated in any ICT activities that her parents did not know
about she said, “I’m an innocent child” and later explained that “you should trust them,
and they trust you” (T7, TI). Teens’ personal narratives provided a counter narrative to

128
their parents’ or family narratives and the dynamic between them contributed to the
technological culture of the family that was a part of the context of PM.
Polyphony. Analysis of the directive narratives in all the interviews, family by
family, uncovered that taken together family, parent, and teen narratives intermingled
forming a polyphony (Bakhtin, 1980) of voices that served as the context for the family’s
interactions with ICTs. They also provided insight into how the family dynamic had
evolved surrounding ICTs. Interview data from over half the families (F2, 3, 4, 7 and 8)
were coded as having family, parent, and teen narratives that seemed to interact with
one another to help form the family dynamic around ICTs (see Major Finding 1.9). For
example, family 3 had a family narrative that the world was a dangerous place that had
become a shared worldview by all of the family members. This narrative helped direct
how they interacted in the world and with one another and intermingled with their
individual narratives. Discussing their worldview in the parent interview, Teen 3’s
parents said,
Dad 3: “'cause you can't say it's a happy, that it's a happy world out there. You
can't, you can't. Wish it was, but…”
Mom 3: “It's not.”
Each parent and their son had their own individual narratives that highlighted their
perspective, but also recalled the family narrative. Explaining how she protected her
children, Teen 3’s mother said, “I try to keep them in my bubble, my world…and I don’t
care what anybody else thinks or what anybody else says, it’s my kids” (M3, PI). Within
this statement she had constructed a narrative that presented a view of herself and her

129
role as parent in relation to outsiders that included the family narrative of the world as a
dangerous place as its context and her own role as her children’s protecter. Her
husband’s narratives were analogous to hers and told a story of wanting to protect their
children from what he went through as an adolescent. He said, “I was, caused a lot of
trouble, too, and when I was younger, and I don’t want my kids to go down that way
because it doesn’t leave anything good” (D3, PI). His narrative presented the world as a
temptation to undesirable behavior and presented his own technological competence as
something he could employ to safeguard their future. Discussing video games he
related, “I taught him how to read by playing games” (D3, PI). His son later echoed this
statement in his own interview, saying his father had “actually put an Xbox controller in
my hand at the age of 6 and I’ve been playing since then” (T3, TI). When considered in
correlation, the family’s shared narrative of the world as a dangerous place, Teen 3’s
father’s narrative of technology’s educational benefits, and his mother’s narrative of
keeping her children safe within her “bubble” provided a structure for the parental
decision to use ICTs as a resource to distract their children from the impulse to leave the
household. Discussing restricting Teen 3 to their home, his mother said, “I know he's in
my little bubble, my little world, I know he's gonna be okay. So, you know, he's okay
over here. He's with his family, with his dad and the way he uses his technology” (M3,
PI). Their narratives underscored how they compensated for their restriction by
providing him with a large pool of technological devices and few ICT time restrictions.
This dynamic had in turn, set their son, Teen 3, up to devote a large chunk of his time to
online gaming. He had internalized the family narrative and accepted their attempts to

130
protect him. Discussing the danger of leaving the house, he said, “it’s the sad truth, but
yeah I don’t really go out” (T3, TI). Consequently, Teen 3 had turned to the online
environment to meet his social needs and his gaming had become a vital part of his
personal identity. Describing his gaming, Teen 3 said, “so it’s a big thing, it’s just
something I would like to do and it’s something that’s built into me that I have a lot of
dedication for” (T3, TI). His parents, in turn, had encouraged his passion and had
incorporated his narrative into their own. Discussing their son’s gaming, Mom 3 mused,
“I know it's to further something that he wants, which is do the gaming designing, the
graphic designing and gaming” (M3, PI) and Dad 3 proudly related “[h]e's like, he's big”
(M3, PI) within the gaming community. Their acceptance of his narrative and their
integration of it into their own narratives completed the polyphonic circle helping to
provide a structure for how they interacted with ICTs as a family in their everyday lives
and how they moved into the future (see Major Finding 1.10).
The example of Teen 3’s family suggests how directive narratives could
contribute to the particular culture each family developed around ICTs. The shared
meaning of the group or family narrative was important, but the individual members’
personal narratives were woven into those shared meanings and contributed to the
dialogic that formed between the narratives. In Family 3, the family, parent, and teen
narratives were alligned to accommodate and compensate for one another. In fact,
there were no family groupings of narratives within the sample that seemed
nonsynchronous, although there were teens whose narratives were less aligned with
their parents. For instance, Teen 5’s narrative about being addicted to gaming

131
contrasted with his mother’s belief that it was a waste of time. However, despite their
differences, over time they had managed to integrate their narratives in way that would
cause minimal conflict in their relationship. Teen 5’s mother described coming around
to her son’s gaming, “I have tried one hour, the most I want him to use the computer is
one hour, but no…either I let it go or we end up fighting” (M5, FI, trans). Instead she
had developed a parenting narrative prioritizing his fuflimment of his household
responsibilities. She admitted that she now repeatedly tells him, “[y]ou complete your
tasks, there’s no problem” (M5, PI, trans). Likewise, Teen 5 made an effort to take care
of his responsibilities before he started gaming for the day. Similarly, the other teens
and parent participants had incorporated their narratives into their routines in ways
that created minimal friction. There were teens and parents with narratives that were
less synchronized, but none that seemed incompatable at the time of the interviews.
Summary Statements
Analysis of the data from the family, parent and teen interviews resulted in these
summary statements (Knowledge Claims) about the mediation practices of the Latino/a
parents:
Restrictive mediation:
•

Parents set rules about turning off devices at bedtimes and only allowing ICT
privileges once responsibilities had been completed.

•

Parents used restrictions on content, interaction, access, and screen time to
mediate their teens’ ICT interactions.

132
•

Parents did not want their teens to view or interact with inappropriate content.

•

What counted as inappropriate content was vague to both parents and teens,
but was usually discussed in relation to violent and sexual content by parents.

•

Parents did not often make specific restrictions limiting their teens’ screen time.

•

It was rare for parents to use covert monitoring or technical restrictions to
mediate their teens’ ICT use.

Devices
•

All parents used the removal or threat of removal of their teens’ devices as a
method to get them to comply with them in regards to ICTs or other areas.

•

Parents used the removal of devices to punish their teens for various
transgressions, such as not doing well in school, having an attitude with parents,
and staying on past the designated stop time

Monitoring
•

Parents had a variety of monitoring practices related to their teens’ ICT activities
that included supervision, checking devices and online account activity,
monitoring SM participation, and making verbal enquiries.

Privacy

133
•

Parents used granting autonomy, independence, privacy in physical space, and
device and account privacy as a method to increase their teens’ trust in them
and encourage their openness.

Active Mediation
•

Parents actively mediated and shaped their teens’ ICT use by discussing how
teens should use ICTs in relation safety and health and parents’ values and
beliefs, helping them with technical assistance and information literacy, co-using
ICTs with them, encouraging their use, and suggesting and scheduling alternative
activities.

Social Media (SM)
•

Parents had practices related to SM that made teens’ negotiation of their
boundaries difficult. These included parents’ posting practices, their monitoring
and judgement of teens’ participation, and their extended social networks.
Directive Narratives

•

Families had narratives that defined themselves as a family in relation to ICTs
and influenced how they interacted with ICTs as a family.

•

Parents had narratives that expressed their personal identities and their
parenting priorities in relation to ICTs that influenced how they parented their
teens’ use of ICTs.

134
•

Parents’ beliefs about parenting and technology were related to the practices
they used to mediate their teens’ ICT use.

•

Parents’ beliefs were integrated into their directive narratives and helped
provide the rationale for specific combinations of parental ICT mediation
practices.

•

Teens had narratives that expressed their personal identities and priorities in
relation to ICTs that influenced how they interacted with ICTs.

•

Family, parent, and teen narratives interacted and influenced the family dynamic
that was created around ICTs.

Summary of Major Findings Related to RQ 1
Analysis of the data from the family, parent, and teen interviews related to RQ 1
resulted in the following major findings related to Latino/a parents’ ICT mediation
practices:
1.1 Most of the specific parental ICT mediation practices demonstrated by the Latino/a
parents concur with the findings that have been established in the PM literature.
Exceptions include [what exceptions were there?]….
1.2 Parental ICT mediation was inextricably interwoven with general parenting practices.
1.3 Parents had rules and restrictions for teens in relation to ICTs that related directly to
their ICT use and others that were related to their concerns for teens’ health and safety
that indirectly influenced teens’ ICT use and interactions.

135
1.4 PM of ICT devices often concerned the use of the removal of personal devices as a
threat and a punishment. Parents used this strategy to procure teens’ compliance
about their ICT use, but also as a general parenting strategy.
1.5 The anticipation of occasional monitoring was used by parents as a way to provide
teens with autonomy, feel secure there was nothing to be concerned about, and as an
attempt to have teens internalize parents’ rules and restrictions so they would comply
of their own means.
1.6 Parents created a balance between the provision of privacy and monitoring.
1.7 Directive narratives were related to the ICT mediation practices that parents used
and to how family members experienced their reality.
1.8 Parents’ beliefs about parenting and technology were incorporated into their
parental directive narratives and influenced their ICT mediation practices.
1.9 Family, parent, and teen directive narratives influenced one another and were
constitutive of one another.
1.10 The polyphony of directive narratives contributed to the overall dynamic of the
technological culture that had evolved.
This chapter has presented the findings for RQ 1 concerning the parental
practices that parents used to mediate their teens’ ICT interactions. The next two
chapters will address teens’ practies for managing their family small worlds in relation to
ICTs.

136

137
Chapter 6 : Findings for Research Question 2 (RQ 2)
This chapter and Chapter 7 will present findings for RQ 2 related to the practices
that Latino/a teens use to negotiate their Information Communication Technology (ICT)
interactions in accordance with the small world of their family. Teen participants were
found to use a number of practices to negotiate their ICT use in accordance with their
familial small worlds (see Chatman, 1996, 1999, 2000). Data from all interviews were
coded within the overarching theme Teens' Family Small World ICT Practices 505 times
and coded into a typology of the two major themes related to RQ 2a and RQ 2b:
resource negotiation (328 times) and negotiation of interpersonal relationships (176
times). Analysis further generated a typology of four subthemes of teens’ ICT
information behavior in relation to each major theme (see Table 6.1 below for the full
typology and Appendix F for final codebook). Data was sometimes coded in more than
one subtheme and category to represent their relevance to different aspects of the
typology. As shown in Table 6.1 below, there were two major themes of Teens' Family
Small World ICT Practices. The first was teens’ negotiation of their resources, which
included the following subthemes: physical space (157 times), ICT content and
interactions (92 times), devices (58 times), and internet access (22 times). The second
was teens’ negotiation of their relationships and included the ensuing subthemes:
parental authority (80 times), extended social worlds (51 times), mental frames (39
times), social media (SM) (26 times). This chapter presents the findings related to RQ 2a
concerning teens’ negotiation of resources, whereas Chapter 7 presents findings related
to RQ 2b concerning teens’ negotiation of their relationships. These major themes do

138
overlap, in such that negotiation of resources was sometimes for the purpose of
managing relationships and vice versa. However, these two major themes do not
represent a clear-cut division, but are separated to demonstrate the creative and
habitual practices teens had for managing resources and relationships in relation to ICTs
within family constraints. The results for the major qualitative themes and subthemes
that were discovered in the data related to RQ 2a are presented below with illustrative
quotations from the interviews, as appropriate. In describing and illustrating the major
themes, subthemes, and categories, the analysis of the interview data was also
supplemented with data from the teen surveys and mapping activity.

Results for RQ 2a
This section will present findings for RQ 2a related to the practices that Latino/a
teens use to negotiate their resources in relation to ICTs. Teens were found to
negotiate many of their household resources in ways that helped them fulfill their needs
and maintain the balance of their familial relationships (see Major Finding 2.1). The
subthemes for the branch of the typology included in this section are negotiation of
physical space, devices, ICT content and interactions, and Internet access. See Table 6.1
for the table of Teens’ Resource Negotiation Subthemes. As seen in Appendix F, criteria

140
for each category was as follows. Statements were classified as physical space
negotiation when they referred to teens’ use of household spaces, such as bedrooms,
kitchens, and/or living rooms, to meet their needs. For instance, Teen 3 described how
he used ICTs in his bedroom to get away from his siblings, “I usually spend [time]
upstairs in my room and the kids stay here with my mom” (T3, TI)56. This type of
references to the negotiation of household ICT technologies were categorized as
devices. For example, explaining how he negotiated the use of his mother’s TV, Teen 5,
said “well I’m allowed to use like the TV, they let me, but I have to ask first” (T5, TI).
Interview statements were coded as ICT content and interaction when they indicated
the adolescents’ choice of ICT content or activities were influenced by their membership
in their family small world. Teen 3 said, he would “not go on stuff that I'm not supposed
to be going on” (T3, TI). Lastly, teens’ attempts to manage their connections to the
Internet were coded within Internet access. Teen 6 described how he accessed the
Internet on his phone when he did not have access to Wi-Fi: “I'll be like to my friend or
something, can you put the hotspot real quick so I could text them” (T6, TI). Results for
the major qualitative subthemes and categories that were discovered in the data

141
connected to the major themes of RQ 2a dedicated to teens’ family small world ICT
practices related resource negotiation are presented below in order of occurrence and
illustrated with qualitative data from the interviews.
Subtheme: Physical space. The significance of the physical space of the home to
teens’ ICT use was apparent from data analysis (see Major Finding 2.2). The study
methodology was designed to capture the importance of physical space and the teen
participants all gave statements that were coded as managing physical space in some
capacity in relation to ICTs 120 times. The physical spaces of the home were interwoven
into teens’ ICT experiences and they actively managed them to meet their needs. The
four categories that were most prevalent in the interview data were: negotiating the
shared use of space (61 times), physical privacy (50 times), participating in a “placeballet” (Seamon, 1980) (34 times), and concentrating ICT activities in central-hubs (12
times). Findings related to these categories will be presented in order of the frequency
of their occurrence and will be illustrated with qualitative data from the interviews as is
appropriate.
Category: Shared spaces. In the teen interviews, all eight participants discussed
their practices for sharing physical space to create personal spheres and social
connections 60 times. Spaces where there were stationary ICTs, such as desktop
computers (F6), TVs (F1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8) or gaming systems (F3, 7, and 8), were often
discussed as needing to be shared. In the surveys, teens said that the spaces that they

142
were most likely to use ICTs while they were with others were living rooms, family
rooms, and basements.
The mobility of smart phones and the existence of multiple stationary devices in
most homes increased teens’ flexibility to choose whether or not they used them with
family members; nevertheless, statements by all eight of the teens and many of their
parents described their using ICTs in shared physical space with their families to connect
socially at least occasionally (see Major Finding 2.3). In her individual interview Teen 7
said, “like maybe we watch like a movie on Netflix together or we watch TV together like
on HBO, but, yeah. Like we hang out down there when we get the chance” (T7, TI). The
adolescents also described or were described spending time with family members while
they each engaged in their own individual ICT activity. Teen 5 explained how his family
would use the living room together in the afternoons “for my sister for school work or
for my mom it’s for school work too, and for me it’s for school work or video games”
(T5, TI). The individualization of devices also meant that teens could be in a physical
space with others doing their own activity and slip in and out of their personal sphere at
will. In her explanation of the mapping activity, Teen 8 portrayed how her and her
cousins would use their shared bedroom together. She said, “[w]e’re separately on our
phones. Well, sometimes she would like show me videos or something, if she sees
something funny” (T8, TI). In this way, they could switch back and forth from using their
bedroom as a social place or personal space.

143
Teens had practices for creating a personal sphere while they interacted with
ICTs in shared spaces in order to engage in their own activity, accommodate others’
comfort, and keep their ICT interactions and communications private. For instance,
Teens 2 and 6 talked about using headphones while sharing physical space with family in
order to work or watch independently. Teen 6 said that by using headphones he was
able to use the shared living room while his family watched TV to, “watch TV shows, like
the same as here, but without commercials” (T6, FI, trans). Participants also adjusted
their ICT notifications and where they sent and responded to them in a way that
allowed them to control their visibility and keep their information private. In the survey,
half the teens said they sometimes kept their phone on silent while sharing space (T3, 4,
7, and 8) and half said they sometimes left the room to send or receive a message (T3, 5,
6, and 8). Discussing his phone, Teen 4, said, “I always have it on silent, always” (T4, TI).
In the survey, two participants also said they minimized their screens (T5 and 6). Teen 6
said he did this, “'cause sometimes I see something, and it might be weird to them [his
parents] but to me it's not” (T6, TI). The context of the space while teens were using it
was discussed by participants as being important. Teens would participate in different
ICT activities and interact with different content depending on who was in the room.
Teen 2 explained, “I look up different things, like when you guys were talking, and Y was
in my room doin' her homework, I was looking up dresses” (T2, TI).
Category: Personal physical space. Teens’ negotiation of physical space for
personal ICT use was a prominent category that was coded 50 times from statements
made by all eight teens in the teen interviews. Privacy itself was not often evoked by

144
the teens, though all of the teens discussed methods related to assembling privacy to
use their ICTs. Participants often cited comfort as the motivation for seeking out private
spaces, such as avoiding noise (T7) and cold temperatures (T8). Teen 7 explained that
she found it difficult to participate in some ICT activities while other family members
were present. She said, “If I'm watching something they're too loud about it, so I just go
up to my room” (T7, TI). The survey data revealed that teens participated in most ICT
activities more frequently when they were alone. This was also true for spaces that were
used by the whole family, such as the living room. Teen 1 said she used her phone in
the living room, “when it’s like empty” (T1, TI).
When teens were asked specifically about privacy, all eight teens said they
usually went to their bedrooms. This was true for youth with their own bedrooms (T1,
3, 4, 5, and 6), those that shared (T2, 7, and 8), and even for those that preferred
common spaces for most of their ICT activities (T4, 5, and 6). Teen 4, said, “[s]ometimes
I want to be alone or whatever so I just go to my room, my mom stays here” (T4, TI).
Likewise, the participants (T2, 7, and 8) that shared bedrooms described a few methods
of obtaining privacy. For example, Teen 2 claimed the bedroom she shared with her
younger sister as her own. When asked if it was hard to find privacy, she said, “I go to
my room usually. I dunno. That’s like…I don’t say off limits, but they know it’s off
limits…they can come in and sit down and whenever, but like, what are you doing
here?” (T2, TI). When bedrooms were not available, teens used other spaces. Teen 5
said, “privacy for myself? Ehhhh, I just stay away from where wherever they are, like if
they’re upstairs I come downstairs or they’re downstairs then I go upstairs” (T5, TI).

145
Category: Place-ballet. Analysis of the teen mapping activity and their individual
interviews demonstrated that their movement through the physical space of the
household as they adjusted to the routines of other family members was a salient
practice and was represented by seven teens, 34 times in the data. The youth would
often participate in a kind of dance through the house as other household members
moved through the physical spaces of the home and spaces became available.
Following Seamon (1980) this type of movement through the house is called a “placeballet” in this study. Teens moved within a habitual “time-space routine” (Seamon,
1980) of the house, but they used knowledge of that routine to improvise within the
moment and use the spaces of their home to meet their current needs. This type of
movement was visible in the data by most of the youth, though it was more common for
those that had less physical space of their own (T6, 7, and 8). For those with small
households without a room of their own, managing use of space could be a complex
task that depended on knowing everyone else’s schedule and routine movements. For
example, Teen 7 and 8 both described the bedroom that they shared with Teen 7’s
younger sister as their favorite space. Though they had not discussed it, Teen 8
explained that because they were off school on vacation during the time of the
interview, they had settled into a routine where Teen 7 used the room in the morning
and then in the afternoon they would shift and Teen 8 would use it. Additionally, as
other spaces in the household became available they would quickly adjust and assume
use of them. Teen 7 said, “my parents when they work, I usually just stay in their room”
(T7, TI). The availability of those spaces was inconsistent and Teen 7 said her use of her

146
parents’ room, “depends on their schedule that day” (T7, TI). Having their own smart
phones made teens mobile and able to adapt. In this way, they were able to create adhoc places out of the various spaces of their homes as they became available to them.
Category: ICT hubs. Analysis of family and teen interviews revealed that the
adolescents often had physical spaces in their home where they centralized personal ICT
use. Ling and Thrane (2001) called this a “base of operations” (p. 9). Twelve statements
from seven teens described how they used specific physical spaces at home as hubs for
their ICT use. Two teens (T1 and 3) centered their ICT activities in their bedrooms,
similar to what is called bedroom cultures (Bovill & Livingstone, 2001). For example,
when Teen 3 was describing his bedroom during the mapping activity he said,
when you [go] through the door I have my little corner where I have all my
gaming set up and it’s like a little desk in the corner, with I have my Xbox plugged
into the corner with my tv, and I usually charge my phone and iPad there and
leave it on the desk and stuff and all my school stuff too, and I use that as a
workspace and gaming space” (T3, TI).
Teens 1 and 3 focused their ICT use in their bedrooms both because they were private
and because they had great deal of ICT resources in those rooms. In contrast, some
youth had their ICT hubs in a public area of the house (T4, 5, and 6) due to comfort (T4
and 5), social proximity (T4 and 5), and technical practicality (T6). Teen 4, said he stayed
in the living room because “if my mom’s doing something in the kitchen, I’m right here,
we talk, I’m using the phone at the same time” (T4, TI).
Statements by three teens were coded four times describing a cycle of
responsibility they routinely used, where they would leave their ICT hubs to complete a

147
responsibility and then return after it had been completed and then repeat the cycle
again the next time they were needed. For example, Teen 3 had regular caregiving
responsibilities, but would return back to his room at every opportunity. Explaining his
process, he said,
I’ll play for a little bit by myself and then go pick up the kids from Casa and then
come back and then they you know I tell them, did you do your homework, if
you did I put all their stuff away again, get ‘em undressed and into pajamas and
stuff and then help them with their homework if they didn’t finish…then I usually
go back upstairs play for the rest of the night until the kids have to go to bed and
then they go to bed and I play a little more until like ten then get off (T3, TI).
By enacting this cycle, participants described being able to fulfill their responsibilities,
but also spend as much time as possible in their preferred space using their ICTs. While
they would all regularly use other physical spaces in the home besides their personal
hubs to access their devices, they used their hub spaces more often and preferred to
use these spaces if conditions were favorable.
Subtheme: ICT interaction and content. All eight teens described or were
described managing their ICT content and interactions in accordance with the family
small world 91 times in the data from the interviews. Four categories emerged as the
most prevalent within the data: teens’ adjustment to parental expectations (35 times),
ICT brokering (27 times), sibling ICT mediation (25 times), and research (4 times). These
categories of the findings will be presented below in order of the quantity of the
occurrence of the codes and illustrated with quotations from the qualitative data.

148
Category: Teen adjustment to parental expectations. Analysis of the family and
teen interviews showed that the adolescents’ negotiation of their ICT interactions and
content were regularly influenced by their parents’ expectations (see Major Finding 2.4).
They discussed trying to avoid content and interactions they knew their parents would
disapprove of. Teen 3 said, “if it’s my mom says it’s a problem, then it’s a problem, like I
respect her opinion, yeah I respect it and I won’t get on” (T3, TI). Some youth (T3, and
4,) specifically described not interacting with any content that they knew their parents
disapproved of, but parents’ expectations could be quite ambiguous. For instance,
when asked what types of content his parents wanted him to avoid, Teen 5 said, “really
weird stuff…cause some videos out there, they’re really weird. People, just do some
weird stuff, they do drugs or they do challenges” (T5, TI). Many of the participants’ (T5,
6, 7, and 8) compliance was implied and they rarely described themselves or were
described as engaging with content their parents objected to. However, some teens did
compensate for parental restrictions by managing their content and interactions in
unexpected ways that both extended and limited their personal information ecologies
(PEIs), in order to meet their own needs. For example, Teen 4 compensated for his
mother’s restrictions to his access by regulating his information seeking practices to
prioritize his limited data for SM. He explained, “I mean I barely can use my phone to
google stuff or to be on the Internet, cause it take a lot of data and I don’t have too
Internet on my phone so the data that I have is for my social media” (T4, TI). Similarly,
Teen 2 negotiated her mother’s restriction against SM by borrowing her friends’ phones
and SM accounts. She said, “so I would take their phone and answer every single

149
Snapchat” (T2, TI). By using her friends’ accounts, she could connect with her peers and
“stay updated” (T2, TI) without overtly breaking her mother’s rules. In this way, parents
established the framework for what teens understood was possible for their own ICT
interactions and then teens developed their routine ICT practices in relation with that
structure.
Category: Brokering. Twenty-seven statements from the teen and parent
interviews indicated that all of the adolescents, except for Teen 3, performed some
language or technical brokering of their parents’ interactions with ICTs (see Major
Finding 2.5). Teens were understood as brokering when they described or were
described helping their parents make connections to ICTs with either technical or
language assistance similar to what Katz (2010) and Correa et al. (2015) have
articulated. There was a large range in parents’ language and technical abilities and in
accordance, teens’ assistance. For some youth (T1, 4, 7, and 8), technical help included
only some occasional help with parents’ mobile phone or an application. For others (T5
and 6) technical help included installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting all family ICT
devices. Mom 5 said, “they take care of it, there they are the experts” (M5, PI, trans).
Teen 2 and 6 shouldered more language brokering responsibilities, such as filling out
forms, paying bills and parking tickets, and buying plane tickets, than did the other
participants because their parents lack of English proficiency and technical ability. Teen
6 stated “I'm the one that fills out everything” (T6, TI). Providing an example, his father
said, “I had a ticket, that they give me for the car and I didn’t know how to pay it, and I
wanted to pay it, and it could be paid, I didn’t know so he helped me with that” (D6, PI,

150
trans). Lack of English skills compounded parents need for technical help. Mom 1
explained that “[w]hen you see an application for something and especially if I don’t
understand the English, she will download it for me, and help me interpret it” (M1, PI,
trans). This type of assistance could even include help with online safety. For instance,
Teen 6 described helping his family avoid phishing scams. He explained, “they were
telling ‘em something about Verizon…to go to this website and my sister was about to
do it and I was like ‘what are you doing? no, that’s a scam, stop’” (T6, TI).
Category: Sibling ICT mediation. Teens’ assistance mediating their younger
siblings’ ICT content and interactions was significant within the data from all the
interviews. Seven teens (T1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8) discussed or were reported performing
this familial responsibility 25 times and it was represented in every family where they
had younger siblings. Sibling ICT mediation could generally be divided into incidental
mediation and active mediation. Incidental mediation was more common and involved
a general awareness of younger siblings and the constraint of ICT activities to content
they felt was appropriate for them, while active mediation concerned an ongoing active
role in their siblings’ ICT interactions. Five participants (T1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) talked about
watching different content or playing different video games with their siblings than they
did on their own. Teen 1 said, “my shows that I watch aren’t like for him so… I just try to
like watch what he wants because I know I’m not going to be there for long” (T1, TI).
Three adolescents (T3, 6, and 7) actively mediated their younger siblings’ ICT
interactions, regularly having them change content that looked inappropriate and
making sure they were not involved in anything problematic. For example, Teen 7

151
described a scenario that had recently occurred with her sister. She said, her sister “was
typing someone…and I think that person was bullying her, so I grabbed the computer
and I blocked the person and it was basically like cyber bullying, and so I told my parents
and they were like okay you're not allowed to go on this anymore, I don’t want these
people bothering you” (T7, TI). Teen 7 kept an eye on her sister’s ICT activities and then
reported back to her parents “[w]henever I see something I don’t like” (T7, TI). Parents
In two families (F3 and 7) seemed to depend on their teens to consistently perform this
role. Mom 7 explained, “the big one is always checking, cause like the other one is
younger and that, she is more attentive, closer to the little one, because we are in a
ladder [laughs] us with the big one and the big one checks what the little one does”
(M7, PI, trans). In these ways teens took personal responsibility by managing their
siblings’ ICT interactions and extending their parents’ monitoring and mediation
abilities.
Category: Research. Data collected from the parent and teen interviews
established teens sometimes performed ICT information seeking research for the family.
Three of the youth (5, 6, and 8) described or were described being involved in
performing research for the purchase of ICT devices five times. Teens researched both
to assist in the purchase of their own ICT devices (T5 and 8) and as a routine part of the
teens’ ICT responsibilities for the family (T5 and 6). Two participants (T5 and 8) were
depicted performing research and presenting an argument to their parents as evidence
of why a certain ICT should be purchased. Dad 8 explained how his teenage children
“research what they want, and so they let us know what they want and if we can buy

152
this or that technology” (D8, PI, trans). However, for Teen 6, research was a much more
ongoing and in-depth process that was his responsibility to perform for the entire
family. Describing how he would help his sister, he said, “sometimes she's like, ‘I wanna
buy this, can you check the reviews or something,’ and I search and I'm like ‘alright, it's
good, you could get it’ or ‘no, get something else 'cause it's bad’” (T6, TI). The
difference in the type of research teens provided was associated with their parents’ and
families’ knowledge of ICTs, their English proficiency, and the level of ICT related
responsibility that teens had taken on in the family.
Subtheme: Devices. Data collected from all interviews indicated that the
negotiation of ICT devices was an important subtheme in relation to teens’ ICT use in
the family context and was reported 58 times. The technologies that were available in
adolescents’ homes served as both resources and constraints and their use of them was
highly dependent on their negotiation practices (see Chapter 4, Inventory of Devices
section and Table 4.6 for a summary of the devices available to participants). In the
analysis of the family and teen interviews, teens were identified as having four
categories of practices in connection with their household ICTs: sharing (33 times),
lending and giving away (13 times), issues of quality or breakdowns (12 times), and
borrowing (8 times). Findings related to these categories will be presented below in a
topical progression that begins with teens sharing practices, continues to lending, then
borrowing, and ends with teens practices concerning ICT breakdowns and quality issues.

153
Category: Sharing. Adolescents’ negotiation of shared devices was the most
prevalent category of practices concerning devices that arose in the analysis of the teen
mapping activity and the interview data. All eight teens described managing shared
devices 25 times in the teen interviews. Though all the youth described sharing ICTs at
some point, it was more common in households that had fewer technologies, such as
Families 2, 4, and 6. In these families, parents expected teens to share and they had
developed more techniques to do so. Also, TVs, gaming systems, desktops, and laptops
were often meant to be shared (see Table 4.6, Chapter 4, for available devices in the
household). Teens described a variety of social protocols to negotiate the shared
technologies of the home, such as claiming, taking turns, and time limits. For example,
Teen 8 explained how she determined whose turn it was. She said, “[i]f we had it first,
and they wanna watch something, and we’ve been there for a while, I would give it to
them…if they’re there, then I would ask, but if they’re watching something then I would
just play another time” (T8, TI). Parents also played a large role in context. For instance,
Teen 2 shared a laptop with her four younger sisters. Their mother discussed
attempting to institute turn-taking “by time” when she was home (M1, FI, trans),
however, when she was not home, her daughter said they used “first call” (T2, FI, trans).
Teen 2 explained, “it’s about who claims it, and that person who claimed it” (T2, TI). By
establishing “first call” or being the person who “claimed” a device, the adolescents
could take some control over how household technologies were used. The interviews
revealed that establishing dominance over a device was a powerful strategy. Three
teens (T2, 6, and 8) described establishing dominance through habitual use.

154
Reoccurring daily routines helped solidify their claim (T2 and 6). Teen 6 said each
afternoon after school, his mother was “watching TV…my little sister on her tablet, and
I'm on the computer” (T6, TI). This type of routine meant the desktop was rarely vacant
and that in order to use the shared item, family members needed to specifically request
it. Teen 6 explained, “[m]e and my mom switch sometimes, like, sometimes she wants
the computer so I’m like, all right, and then I watch the TV for a while” (T6, TI). They
took turns, but Teen 6 would resume use as soon as they completed their task, further
establishing his dominance over the device.
Category: Lending and giving away. Teens’ practices in relation to lending or
giving away personal technologies emerged as a prominent category within each type of
interview and was discussed by six teens (T1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8) 13 times.
Individualization seemed to increase teens’ mobility, give them more autonomy over
their interactions, and decrease their need to share or lend their devices out (see Major
Finding 2.6). However, half of the adolescents (T1, 5, 6, and 7) still described allowing
younger siblings to borrow their personal devices for reasons such as their own waning
interest (T1 and 7) and siblings’ pleas (T5 and 6). About his little sister, Teen 6 said, “'if
she sees me with it and I don’t give it to her, she just starts crying” (T5, TI). Teens
described various tactics to mitigate the risk of lending to siblings, such as making rules
(T5) and hiding (T6). Teen 6, explained that he “used to like hide it from her basically…I
used to hang around a lot in my room like back two years ago because of that” (T6, TI).
Parents were also described as providing teens and their siblings with their own devices
specifically to decrease conflict between them. Mom 3 explained each of her six kids

155
“have their tablets…so there's no more fighting” (M3, FI). In addition, the purchase of a
new personal device could inspire youth to give another away. Teen 1 said, “I gave the
tablet to my brother and now the phone is just one of my favorites” (T1, TI). However, it
was more common for the participants to describe inheriting a technology from an older
sibling (T4, 5, and 6) than giving one away (T1).
Category: Borrowing. Borrowing personal devices from family members was a
salient theme in the data and analysis indicated that it influenced teens’ use of those
devices. Interview statements from four participants (T2, 3, 6, and 7) were coded eight
times as discussing borrowing family members’ ICT devices. Teen 2 described borrowing
her mother’s smart phone and Teens 3, 6, and 7 discussed borrowing laptops. Most
teens did not have their own laptops and had to borrow devices to complete school
work. Teen 7 explained, “so now I'm using my dad's, 'cause he has a MacBook so it's
easier, so I use his to do projects and if I need to print something out” (T7, TI).
Borrowing was less common then sharing and the ownership of the device by another
family member and the need to request to use it seemed to be an impediment to teens’
use of the borrowed devices (see Major Finding 2.7). Participants usually tried to use
their phones first and limit their use to the ICT activity for which they were requested.
Teens 3 and 7 both described restricting their use of their parents’ borrowed laptops to
do schoolwork and to print. Teen 3 said, “I only use it for educational purposes” (T3, TI).
Teen 2 and 6 described borrowing devices for activities other than schoolwork, but this
was limited.

156
Category: Device quality and breakdowns. Managing low quality devices and
breakdowns presented in the data as significant issues that impacted teens’ use of
household ICT and by extension, their PEIs. The majority of the adolescents (T1, 2, 4, 6,
7, and 8) reported these types of issues 12 times. By far the most common strategies
that they used to cope with these problems were by becoming accustomed to the loss
or by using another technology. Two teens (T1 and 6) discussed the issue of managing a
slow computer and how it discouraged them from use. With his interest in learning
about software and hardware at an advanced level, Teen 6, felt the lack of quality of his
household desktop acutely. He said, “I tried to learn, on that one but it's too slow” (T6,
TI). Teen 6 compensated for the low quality of the family desktop by limiting use to
activities the computer could handle and by planning to build a better one in the future.
He explained, “I could use it but, it's not what I want. Yeah, so when I make one, I need
a job, 'cause the parts and that, they're not cheap” (T6, TI).
Half of the teens (T2, 4, 7, and 8) also talked about adjusting to technical
breakdowns. Breakdowns could compound other access issues and lead youth to limit
their ICT activities. For example, Teen 4 admitted when he had hacked his cell phone
five months before “I did something wrong, so now I can’t download or update
anything” (T4, TI). He explained he needed access to another computer to do it, but he
did not “wanna go to a friend’s house and bother him or whatever” (T4, TI). Instead of
attempting to use the social capital that was available to him to fix the incorrectly
executed “hack,” Teen 4 chose to adjust to the breakdown by limiting his ICT activities
and by extension his PEI.

157
Subtheme: Internet access. Though it was an uncommon practice across the
teens, the negotiation of Internet access was a significant factor in the data for three
teens (T4, 5, and 6). Data from their teen interviews was coded within this category 22
times. Teen 4 and 6’s negotiation of their Internet access was related to constraints on
their smartphone data plans, while Teen 5’s was related to constraints on the strength
of the Wi-fi signal in his household. They had practices to circumvent their constraints
that included limiting ICT interactions to certain parts of the house (T5), limiting
activities (T4), using apps to compensate (T6) and securing alternative methods to
connect (T4 and 6). Having Wi-fi at home did not guarantee a high-quality connection.
Teen 5 described having difficulty connecting in various parts of his household such as
both his and his mother’s bedrooms. Of his mother’s bedroom, he said, “there’s no
connection there, it’s like horrible” (T5, TI). Consequently, he limited his use of his
laptop to the living-room because, “I have a better connection” (T5, TI). In contrast,
Teen 4 and 6 had no Wi-Fi at home and moreover limited data on their phones. This
was a bigger constraint for Teen 4, as he had little other access to the Internet in his
home, while Teen 6 had an Internet connected desktop. To negotiate his limited access,
Teen 4 rationed his data in order to have enough for the social media activities that he
prioritized. He explained, “the data that I have is just reach enough to use Snapchat or
my social medias” (T4, TI). Teen 4 and 6 also described using other individuals’ phones
as hotspots to connect to the Internet. For example, Teen 6 said, “[s]ometimes, when I
need it, when I see somebody and I need to text them, since my phone's not connected,
I'll be like to my friend or something, ‘can you put the hotspot real quick so I could text

158
them?’” (T6, TI). Additionally, when he was able to connect to Wi-Fi he used the
messaging capabilities of various social media sites to text. He explained,
“Snapchat…Messenger, the Facebook thing, Kik, I use a lot for texting” (T6, TI). Though
these participants had very different levels of access they negotiated their resources in
order to maximize their connections to the Internet and meet their needs.
The findings presented in this chapter demonstrated the strong role parents and
families played in teens’ negotiation of their resources. Summary statements of this
chapter will be presented next, followed by the Major Findings. The findings concerning
how teens negotiated their relationships in accordance with their family small worlds in
relation to their use of ICTs will then be presented in Chapter 7.
Summary Statements
Analysis of the data from the family, parent and teen interview resulted in these
summary statements (Knowledge Claims) about teens’ family small world ICT practices.
Physical Space:
•

Teens negotiated their use of the physical space of the home in order to
establish privacy in physical space and to construct personal space in shared
physical space.

•

Teens had central hubs or locations in the household where they usually
centered their ICT use.

•

Teens negotiated their ICT use in the physical spaces of the home in accordance
with context and participated in a kind of “place-ballet” (Seamon, 1980).

159
Devices:
•

Teens negotiated their use of the ICT devices that they had access to in the
household.

•

Teens actively negotiated household ICT devices by lending, sharing, and
borrowing them.

•

Teens often needed to negotiate problems with technologies such as quality
issues and breakdowns.

Content and Interactions:
•

Teens’ understanding of what was appropriate ICT content or interactions was
shaped by their parents.

•

Teens had a variety of practices to negotiate their ICT content and interactions in
accordance with their family small world that included choosing approved
content and avoiding disapproved content.

•

Teens often negotiated their families’ interactions to ICTs through ICT brokering,
ICT mediation of their younger siblings, and research.

Internet Access:
•

Teens negotiated their ICT access in accordance with their family small world by
using messaging apps rather than text messaging, borrowing hotspots, using
outside Wi-fi connections, prioritizing certain content because of limited data,
and choosing physical spaces to use ICTs with stronger Wi-fi signals.

Major Findings for RQ 2a Related to Teens’ Negotiation of Their Resources:
Analysis of the data from all interviews, the teen surveys, the mapping activity, and
fieldnotes resulted in the following Major Findings about Latino/a teens’ family small
world negotiation of their resources in relation to ICTs.
2.1 Teens’ membership in the small world of their families influenced how teens used
the resources that were available to them.
2.2 Teens’ presence in physical space influenced their interactions with ICTs.
2.3 Teens negotiated their use of ICTs in the physical space of the household to fulfill
their needs for personal space and social connections
2.4 Teens’ negotiated their ICT content and interaction in accordance with what they
believed their parents thought was appropriate.
2.5 Teens were involved in managing their parents and families’ ICT interactions.
2.6 Teens ownership of devices provided them with some autonomy and freedom in
managing their resources.
2.7 Teens’ need to share or borrow devices influenced the likelihood of using them and
the extension of their PEIs.
This chapter has presented findings related to teens’ negotiation of their
resources, the following chapter will address how ICTs fit into teens’ practices for
managing people and their relationships relative to their family small world.

161
Chapter 7 : Findings for Research Question 2b (RQ 2b)
Results for RQ 2b
This section will present findings for RQ 2b related to the practices that Latino/a
teens use to negotiate their interpersonal relationships (see Table 6.1 in Chapter 6 for
the full typology and Appendix G for Teen Family Small World Practices Typology
codebook). The subthemes for the negotiation of interpersonal relationships (coded
328 times), discussed below, are negotiation of parental authority (60 times), social
worlds (51 times), the use of mental frames (39 times), and social media (26 times).
Findings relating to RQ 2b from these major qualitative themes and their subthemes are
presented below in order of the frequency of their occurrence and illustrated with
verbatim quotations from all interviews as appropriate.
Subtheme: Managing parental authority. References within the interviews to
the adolescents’ practices for managing the power differential between them and their
parents were categorized as managing parental authority. For example, discussing her
parents, Teen 7 said, “when they're around I can't just be on my phone like that because
it's family time… But if I see them on their phone, I'm gonna be on my phone, too” (T7,
TI)78. Teen 7 follows her parents’ rules, but also understands when they are less likely to

Abbreviations are used to identify participants’ family role, the number of the family in which they were
identified with in Chapter 4, and the type of interview the quotation is derived from. M stands for mom,
D stands for dad, and T stands for teen. M2, FI from the first quotation in this chapter identifies the
quotation as a statement Teen 2’s mother made in their family interview.

All illustrative quotations were in English unless marked as translated. All translations are presented
verbatim, without corrections for grammar, but filler words (such as ah, like, um), word repetitions that

162
be applied and is able to manage that knowledge for her own benefit. Analysis of the
family, parent, and teen interviews uncovered that teens actively negotiated their
parents’ authority over them in relation to ICTs (see Major Finding 2.8)9. All of the teens
used statements that were coded 60 times as describing a practice they used to
negotiate the power differential between them and their parents. Often these practices
were implicit and simply a part of their regular way of doing things, and other times they
consciously managed their boundaries with their parents to avoid punishment, evade
suspicion, and negotiate their relationships. Three categories arose in the interview
data under the negotiation of parental authority subtheme: earning leeway (30 times),
not hiding (32 times), and pushing their boundaries (14 times), as discussed below.
Category: Earning leeway. Data from the interviews indicated that seven teens
(T2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) referred to practices they used to earn their parents’ trust and
possibly negotiate some lenience or less oversight (30 times). Earning their parents’
trust usually was comprised of fulfilling parental priorities, complying with rules and
restrictions, recognizing parental authority, avoiding disapproved ICTs, and responding
to parents’ ICT communications (see Major Finding 2.9). Participants largely reported,
and were reported by their parents, as complying with parental authority. When Teen 6
was asked about the repercussions of breaking his parents’ rules, he responded, “I don’t

Translations were all made by the investigator.

The Major Findings are presented in list form at the end of the chapter. When each finding is introduced
into the text of the findings its number will be stated, such as (see Major Finding 2.8).

163
know, ‘cause I don’t break them” (T6, TI). Sometimes the adolescents seemed to have
internalized the rules as simply the way things are done, but other times, they complied
purposefully to evade punishment, or make life easier. Mom 7 said about her daughter,
“[s]he says it’s better, she prefers, doing what she has to do than see us [chuckling]”
(M7, PI, trans). If teens complied with parents’ authority and fulfilled their priorities,
parents were generally depicted as being more complacent and open to their ICT use.
For example, Mom 5 said, “I tell him the game is not going anywhere, go do your stuff
and then you can sit down relaxed and I won’t bother you (M5, PI, trans). In these ways,
youth could maintain the relational balance with their parents, earn some leeway with
their ICTs, and avoid having them taken away.
Category: Not hiding or Hiding in plain sight. Analysis of teens and parents’
interview responses revealed that a significant strategy used to negotiate parents’
authority was not hiding. They utilized this strategy to build trust with their parents,
evade suspicion, limit monitoring, and also, in rare cases, to hide in plain sight. These
teens’ practices included: being open with their parents by voluntarily disclosing
information (T4 and 7), yielding information and devices when asked (T4, 7, and 8),
leaving online accounts open (T8), disclosing passwords (T1 and 7), sharing space with
parents (T2, 4, 5, 7 and 8), and in one case by using parents’ ignorance to hide in plain
sight (T6). Eighteen statements were coded from every teen, except for Teen 1, as using
these types of practices. These strategies were often combined and used as a general
way of engaging with their parents. For example, Teen 4 explained that he was
routinely open with his mother about his ICT interactions. He said, “when I’m using my

164
phone, if I’m on the couch and she’s sitting next to me and she want to look, I’m right
there so I just show her…I don’t have anything to hide, so [I] don’t get mad at her if she
want to see my phone or whatever (T4, TI). An open dynamic was an ordinary part of
the everyday routine of his relationship with his mother.
Trust was an important principle mediating family dynamics and teens’ openness
was described by parents as an essential component of their trust. For instance, Dad 8
explained, “they don’t mind that their Facebook stay open on the computer or their
email, from that side we feel confident in what they do on the computer…and [we]
respect what they do” (D8, PI, trans). Because his children were open with him and his
wife, Teen 8’s father believed they could, in turn, give them more autonomy to interact
with ICTs. Regularly sharing household space also inspired parents’ trust in their
children. Mom 7 said she did not worry about her daughter because, “she is always at
our side, she’s near. When a child isolates herself and you see that she is always
isolated you have to suspect that something is happening, but she doesn’t give us that,
that distrust, that she’s very quiet or isolated, no she is always near us” (M7, PI, trans).
Most teens (T2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8) described themselves, or were described by their
parents, as sharing space with parents at least occasionally, and many did it often. This
allowed participants to build trust with their parents and preempt parental monitoring
and mediation.
An inversion of not hiding was the use of open ICT interactions and shared
physical space to hide in plain sight. Though not common, this tactic seemed to be

165
practiced by Teen 6. Dad 6 described how he and his wife kept the family desktop in the
living room in order to supervise their children’s ICT activities. However, Teen 6 said his
parents “don’t know about anything, basically. If I go on YouTube and I'm watching
some video or something, they don’t know about it” (T6, TI). He had a few practices to
protect his personal boundaries from what his parents might consider “weird” (T6, TI),
such as minimizing content when they were in the room, but what really seemed to give
him confidence, was how much more he knew about technology and the Internet than
they did. He said, “they know not even the basics, basically” (T6, TI). In a sense, he
seemed to hide from them in plain sight by using their inattentiveness, dearth of
technical knowledge, and lack of English language skills as a buffer.
Category: Pushing boundaries. Though teens’ and parents’ accounts in the
interviews described teens almost always following their parents’ rules and respecting
their authority, the data indicated they did participate in some attempts to push their
boundaries with their parents and these types of practices were represented in the data
12 times. The participants usually attempted to do this through verbal attempts to
affect change. Their pleas depended on their specific situation, but asking parents for a
few more minutes or some more time on whatever device they were using was the
most common form of persuading parents to change a restriction. For example, Teen
5’s mother said, “sometimes I tell him, go to bed…and he is connected playing and to
disconnect is a problem, ‘just one hour,’ now five muntes,’ ‘just let me finish this game’
and it’s a whole project” (M5, PI, trans). Five teens (T1, 2, 4, 5, and 7) were found to
request a change or probe for an explanation for a rule or restriction they felt was

166
unfair. For instance, Mom 4 said that after she took her son’s phone away, “everyday
he was like, mami, please!” (M4, PI, trans). Four teens (T1, 5, 6, and 7) were also
described or described themselves as being assertive about asking for the ICTs they
desired. They would make arguments to their parents for certain ICT purchases. Teen 1
said she often talked to her parents, “when I want to show them something, I want this,
I want that” (T1, TI). It was apparent in the data that the practices that participants
used to extend or push their ICT boundaries with their parents were fairly benign, and
not dramatic. However, teens did use a steady stream of verbal attempts that were
successful at least some of the time.
Subtheme: Social worlds. Statements that referred to the ways that teens
brought their ICT interactions with their social worlds, such as their peers and at school,
into accordance with their family small worlds were categorized as social worlds. For
instance, talking about one of the practices she used to meet her schools’ ICT
expectations, Teen 2 said, “I go to the public library to print…so I just type it there, and I
print it, and then I take it home” (T2, TI). Analysis of the teen interviews demonstrated
that the structures and constraints inherent in their family small worlds imposed
constrictions on their ability to connect and conform to the ICT social norms and
expectations of their extended social worlds. Fifty-one units of data indicated
participants often confronted social norms and expectations related to their ICT use in
schools and by peers. The need for this type of practice was more discernable in the
teens who were the most constrained by the circumstances of their family small world.
It was particularly visible in Teen 2’s individual interview. Teen 2 was the only teen in

167
the study without her own smart phone because her parents were uncomfortable with
technology and feared the change it would cause in their family culture. However,
other participants with less constraints and abundant access also took actions to align
their extended social worlds with their family (see Major Finding 2.10). The analysis of
family, parent, and teen interviews uncovered that teens’ extended world negotiation
practices could be subdivided into four categories of practices, including the negotiation
of social relationships (21 times), taking advantage of devices outside the home (16
times), using social capital (10 times), and engaging interpersonal methods (4 times).
These categories will be presented below in order of frequency of occurrence and
illustrated with verbatim quotations from the interviews.
Category: Social relationships. Analysis of the interviews illuminated how the
ICT social norms of the family small world could influence teens’ choice of friends and
how their choice of friends could influence their freedom to interact with ICTs. The
influence of the family small world ICT structure and constraints on teens’ social
relationships were visible 21 times in the data. This was discernable in participants’
descriptions of their interactions with their friends and communities, as well as their
explanations for why they did not interact with their peers. Three teens (T2, 3, and 7)
discussed having friends that made it easier for them to live by their parents’ values and
constraints. For instance, when Teen 7 was asked in her individual interview if her
friends ever made it difficult to follow her parents’ rules she said “[m]y friends are
goody-goodies, I don’t have that problem…good friends worry about their grades, worry
about what their parents are thinking,” (T7, TI). In addition, she seemed to believe that

168
having friends that her parents approved of helped them to trust her and consequently
to give her more autonomy to interact freely with them and the ICTs she used to do
that.
Parental constraints that affected teens’ relationships seemed to lead teens to
interact with ICTs in particular ways and, by extension, to choose one community of
friends over another. Teen 3’s mother had forbidden him to go outside without his
family beyond school and an afterschool club. Teen 3 revealed that he conformed with
that restriction, stating “I don’t really have friends who socialize in real life.” Instead, he
said, “I do it mostly online, I don’t really go out the house at all so, this is my space” (T3,
TI). He focused all his need for social connection onto his online gaming community.
The data also revealed that half the teens (T1, 3, 4, and 6) sometimes used ICT
practices that distanced them from their peers in order to comply with parental
constraints and therefore limited their personal information (ecology PIE) (see Major
Finding 2.11). Sometimes this involved simply accepting their parents’ restrictions and
other times it involved specific maneuvers to avoid their peers. For example, Teen 4 had
given up gaming online with his friends to comply with his mother. He said, “she didn’t
like that kind of games so I had to delete them” (T4, TI). She disapproved of the violent
games he was playing and the competitive behavior that it inspired and when his friends
asked him to play, he would decline. He explained, “if they ask me now, ‘do you play?’,
or ‘do you have this game?’, whatever, I’m like ‘nah, I don’t have it,’ that’s it, I don’t
really miss the games or playing with other people” (T4, TI). Teen 1, on the other hand,

169
was more active in her rejection of her peers to comply with her mother’s social
restrictions. Though she was vague in her interview, her mother provided details in the
parental interview that she had read in her daughter’s ICT communications. She said,
“when they invite her, like a group is going to the pool…‘no I’m doing something, but
thanks,’ or ‘I don’t have any money,’ ‘I’m going to do some other things,’ she now
knows, how to defend herself in that situation, I have seen her” (M1, PI, trans). Teen 1
complied with her mother’s restriction from socializing outside of the house by
providing her peers with socially acceptable excuses using chats and text messages as to
why she could not participate in social events with them.
Category: Devices. Teens’ use of institutional or borrowed technologies to
supplement their ability to meet extended social world expectations was coded 12 times
in the interview data. The participants with no access to laptops at home, or even some
with less access, generally compensated by using schools’ (T2, 3, 4, 6, and 7), or less
commonly, the public library’s computers (T2). Teen 4 had no devices beyond his smart
phone in his home, but he had developed a regular routine to help him meet the ICT
expectations of his school. He said, “I have a routine now, if they gave me homework,
then I know that I have to go [trans] to the library, so I just get a pass and go to the
library and do it” (T4, TI). Teen 2 and 4 also borrowed their mother’s cell phone (T2)
and internet connection (T4) to keep up with school communications, such as text
reminders about projects.
Category: Social capital. Teen 2 also described using social capital (coded 10
times) to help her to meet her peer’s ICT social norms and academic expectations. Teen

170
2 explained that she often enlisted her best friend to help her meet her school’s
expectations. She said, “I usually tell–one of my closest friends…’I'm gonna send you
the link of this, could you print it?’ She's like ‘okay’” (T2, TI). By cultivating her
friendships and understanding them as resources she was able to extend her PIE with
resources that she did not have access to in her own household. Teen 2 also regularly
borrowed her friends’ phones while she was with them to connect with her peers and
live up to the social norm of SM participation. She explained, “I'm the one always on
their phone, I'm like, ‘I feel like it's picture time,’ I take their phone, I'm the one who's
like ‘let's Snapchat this!’” (T2, TI).
Category: Interpersonal methods. Interpersonal methods of managing family
small world ICT constraints in relation to extended social world expectations were
especially salient for Teen 2. In her interview, she mentioned using interpersonal
communication four times to negotiate not having a phone in environments where
smart phones were the norm for everyone she knew. For instance, she described
speaking to teachers in private when they asked her to complete a task in class that she
was unable to do without her own phone. She explained, “my theology teacher was
like, okay, take your phones out, and we did a live Quizlet, and it was about to pick the
topic of our project, so everyone went in their phones, signed in, whatever and they
picked…Yeah, so, that means I had to tell the teacher I can’t get in” (T2, TI).
Interpersonal practices such as these allowed Teen 2 to participate at school without
calling attention to not having a phone, but she also used interpersonal methods with
her peers. For example, she said, “today I had a field trip, I told my friend, are we gonna

171
bond or are you gonna bond with your phone” (T2, TI)? By commenting on her friends’
behaviors, she was able to influence how her peers interacted with ICTs while she was
present.
Subtheme: Mental frames. The mental frames classification was used when the
participants communicated a narrative that indicated they processed a constraint in a
way that helped them accept it. About not having a phone, Teen 2 said, “there's
advantages…like one of my closest friends, her mom takes her phone away because it
drives her [to] so much drama. So, to me, I'm drama free because I don’t have to deal
with that!” (T2, TI). Analysis of the data collected from teen statements in the family and
teens interviews suggested that they often made an effort to mentally process the
constraints to their ICT use in a way that enabled them to accept the constrain and
maintain the balance of their relationship with their parents and their membership in
their family small world (see Major Finding 2.12). Thirty-six instances of mental frames
were coded from interviews with six teens. Four frames were most prominent in the
data: acclimating to constraints (13 times), positive reframing (11 times), having no
control (8 times), and looking to the future (7 times).
Category: Acclimating frames. Statements from four adolescents depicting their
adaption to an ICT constraint that had been imposed on them were classified as
acclimating frames. Describing how things had changed since her mother’s sister’s
family had moved into their household Teen 7 said, “[w]hen they weren’t here, I used to
spend time, all the time in the basement” (T7, TI). When she was asked how she found

172
privacy in the newly crowded house, she responded, “I don’t get much privacy, so I'm
just used to it” (T7, TI). By choosing this frame, Teen 7 communicated that she had
chosen to accept the constraints rather than create conflicts with her family or extended
family. A variation of this narrative was participants’ description of their adjustment as
being a result of having changed their own mind about the new constraint (T3 and 4).
This frame enabled teens to accept the new circumstances, but position themselves as
having agency. For example, Teen 4 explained how he had changed his mind about an
activity his mother had forbidden. He said, “at the time, I disagreed with her, but after
that I didn’t have the games and then some friend show[ed] me the games...[and] I
didn’t like them anymore” (T4, TI).
Category: Positive frame. Three participants (T2, 4, and 6) used positive frames
to discuss a constraint. Accounts were categorized as positive frames when they
demonstrated a teen discussing an ICT constraint as beneficial to them. For example,
describing the effects of not having a smart phone, Teen 2 said, “okay, you have it, and
now a million people are texting you, you have to reply. Sometimes I don’t have time for
that and I don’t even have one to be all the time, ‘oh I just did this, blah blah blah’. How
are you gonna live 24 hours of the day doing that? So sometimes I thank that secretly,
that I don’t have one” (T2, TI). Positive frames were described by participants as
allowing them to accept their constraints and not resent them.
Category: No control frames. Four participants (T1, 2, 3, and 7) communicated
eight statements that positioned them as not having any power to change their

173
situation. These were coded as utilizing the no control frame. For example, when asked
what she did about the unflattering pictures her mother posted to SM about her, Teen 1
said, “I don’t do anything, it’s not my Facebook to control” (T1, TI). The acceptance of
her mother’s Facebook account as a place that was out of the realm of her control,
helped Teen 1 to avoid the conflict that might occur if she had taken a defensive
position to her mom’s frequent posts.
Category: Future frame. Statements from two teens (T3 and 6) were
categorized as using the future framing device seven times. Adolescents’ reports were
coded in this category if they presented their constraints as temporary and situated
their ICT use and knowledge as methods they would use to overcome their limitations in
the future. For example, In the family interview, Teen 6 said, “I could like build a
computer and stuff, like I know how to do it” (T6, FI). Later he explained that he had a
concrete plan to buy the parts he would need online when he was sixteen and was able
to get a job. He said, “if I had a better one, I could be doing more stuff. I could learn
more” (T6, TI). He described the narrative of a better future as helping him to accept
how things were, and directing how he interacted with ICTs in order to prepare.
Subtheme: Social media practices. Statements were categorized as social media
(SM) when they referred to the complexity of boundary negotiation with parents as
friends or followers on SM. Teen 3 explained how he would ask his mother not to make
certain posts about him. Discussing asking his mother to take SM posts down, Teen 3
said, “I say it, it’s just there’s points where there’s certain things that’s kind of

174
embarrassing and stuff that you know I wouldn’t do” (T3, TI). Analysis of interview data
revealed that all of the teens had referred to managing their personal boundaries on
social media (26 times). Social media was a pervasive presence that every teen in the
study interacted with in one form or another. They often used social media to connect
and communicate with their peers, to stay up-to-date, and to stay occupied, but in
order to do so they often had to negotiate an audience that included a host of
individuals from different contexts (see Major Theme 2.13). For example, Teen 4 said, “I
just have like one [profile] for everybody--For my friends in school, my friends that I
know for a long time, my friends from PR, my family, everybody has my one Instagram,
my one Snapchat” (T4, FI). Participants described practices to negotiate the reception
of their own posts and posts that were linked to them (11 times), the imposition of
parents’ posts (9 times), and to connect socially with family (6 times). These categories
will be presented below in a topical progression using quotations from the qualitative
interview data when suitable.
Category: Parents’ posts. Much of the negativity that participants described in
relation to being friends with parents on SM was connected with the posts parents,
particularly mothers, published about them. Teens discussed a number of coping
strategies that included active strategies to change their mothers’ behavior, as well as
more passive practices nine times. Teen 4 was the only one that had asked his mother
to stop posting about him altogether. His mother said that she had posted about her
son “a long time ago” (M4, PI, trans), but said that she had stopped when he had asked
her to refrain. In his interview, Teen 4 confirmed her statement, saying, “yeah, she

175
never posts anything” (T4, TI). Practices that participants used in connection with their
parents’ posts were making active requests for parents to stop posting about them (T4),
asking parents to take down posts they had already published (T3 and 7), claiming lack
of control (T1, 3 and 7), and making a decision to accept parents’ posting practices (T3).
Some adolescents did not have as much luck with their attempts to curb their mother’s
posts. Teen 3 and 7 expressed having asked their mothers to take down posts they
disliked, but indicated they had less success. When Teen 7 was asked what she had
done about an unflattering “throwback” photo her mother had posted of her, she
responded she had asked her to “take it down, of course. She didn’t listen, she was like
‘this is before you’ and blah blah blah, fine, I was like, ‘but it's just annoying’” (T7, TI).
While teens 3 and 7 had taken some action by asking their parents to take down posts,
they communicated that they felt as if they had no ability to constrain them. Teen 3
framed his lack of control as an explanation for a decision to “toughen up” and tolerate
his mother’s posts. When he was asked how he had gotten to the point where he was
okay with her “embarrassing” posts, he said, “I grew accustomed to it, but I would say
just recently I got used to it, it was just like ‘alright I have no choice anyways, you’re
going to do it anyways so, to toughen up’” (T3, TI).
Category: Teens’ posts. Analysis of the interviews uncovered that teens’ posts to
social media were another aspect of their social media participation that was made
complicated by having parents as friends. More than half of the adolescents (T1, 3, 4, 5,
6, and 7) discussed practices they used to control their social media posts and how they

176
were understood, (11 times), and half the teens (T1, 3, 4, and 7) demonstrated using
these practices specifically in relation to their parents.
Teens that were friends with parents on social media, or had them as followers,
described often choosing to either post items that they believed would be acceptable to
all their audiences (T1, 4, and 7) and/or making posts only the intended audience would
be able to understand, similar to what other researchers have found (see boyd &
Marwick, 2011; Oolo & Siibak, 2013; Vickery, 2015). By keeping it “PG” (T7, TI)
participants could avoid any negative consequences from being observed by an
unintended audience member. For example, Teen 1 explained, “you know how [some
people] just don’t like certain things, they think this is wrong, they think this is right?
Like if I post something, like a picture of, what is that thing called like, the march that
they did for gay rights?...Yeah, some people get offended, I won’t do that” (T1, TI).
Three teens (T5, 6, and 7) also described managing their social boundaries on SM by
making posts that only some individuals would understand. They did this by using song
lyrics (T6), references to inside jokes (T5), or acronyms (T7). For example, Teen 7
disclosed, “maybe I'll say something like, no one uses it anymore, but you know what
LOL means? There's those little short words that they don't understand, only my friends
understand” (T7, TI). In these ways, participants were able to negotiate their personal
boundaries and participate with their peers.
Ancillary finding. In his parent interview, Dad 8 made a comment that reveals
another layer of complexity for Latino/a and immigrant teens’ participation on SM. He

177
mentioned that their daughter helped him and his wife to negotiate what was
appropriate for them to post on SM. He said, “many times she takes care of us, a lot of
times too, of what people might think, other people” (D8, PI, trans). His comment
suggests that immigrant teens might also be responsible for managing the boundaries of
the family group on SM in addition to their own boundaries. However, there was no
other data concerning this additional area of teen family responsibility and SM
boundary negotiation.
Category: Social connections. Despite having to negotiate extra surveillance and
complicated layers of social norms from being friends with parents on social media,
interview data revealed that teens also used social media to relationally connect with
members of their families. Six instances of participants using social media to connect
with family were coded from four teens (T5, 6, 7, 8). Practices that teens used to
connect with family members were posting about them and interacting, and
commenting on their posts. Four teens (T5, 6, 7, 8) described using social media to
publicly interact and connect with family members. For example, Teen 7 was described
by her mother as using SM to interact with her. During the parental interview, Mom 7
showed the investigator a quick video that her daughter had posted to Instagram. In
the video Teen 7, said, “mira mami [look mom], my boyfriend, he’s cute, right? Right
ma? Ok, mira, he plays basketball, he’s so tall, he’s so cute [Her mom giggles]” (M7, PI,
trans). Teen 7 had posted this video to the Instagram account she shared with her
mother, teasing her mother in a playful and affectionate way, about a fake boyfriend.
Teen 7 could be understood as managing multiple audiences in this video. She was

178
communicating with her mother. She was quite possibly teasing her mother about a
post that her mother had made her take down from Snapchat showing her with a boy,
and she was performing their mother/daughter relationship in public for both sets of
their friends. Teen 7’s post demonstrated sophisticated negotiation of the intricacies of
context and of relationship construction and maintenance on social media. Another
social media practice that was revealed in the Family 7 interview, was the use of joint
production of media content to connect relationally with family members. Teen 7 said,
“me and my cousin like recording” (T7, FI) and posting to Snapchat. Mom 7 then
described how they would enlist Teen 7’s younger sister to film. She said “[w]hat the
two cousins are doing, they put her on filming because she doesn’t have Snapchat” (M7,
FI, trans).
Though not common in the data, Teen 8 was also described using social media to
connect with family members offline by her father in the parental interview. Dad 8 said
she would come find them and, “show us something from her phone, or an application,
like Snapchat” (D8, PI, trans). The social media content provided the context for Teen 8
to connect with her parents and share what was happening in her life with them.
This chapter has described findings concerning the ICT related practices teens
used to negotiate their relationships in accordance with the family small world. The
subsequent section presents summary statements for this chapter, followed by the

Major Findings for RQ 2b Related to Teens’ Negotiation of Their Interpersonal
Relationships
Analysis of the data from the teen surveys, the mapping activity, and the
fieldnotes from the family, parent, and teen interviews resulted in the following Major
Findings about these Latino/a teens’ negotiation of their resources in accordance with
the family small world:
2.8 Teens had ICT related practices that were specifically connected to negotiating
parental authority.
2.9 Teens’ described and were described complying with parents’ rules and restrictions
and respecting their authority.
2.10 Teens had a variety of practices to manage their social worlds in order to negotiate
their membership in the small world of their family.
2.11 The methods that teens used to negotiate the boundaries of their familial small
world in relation their other small worlds both increased and decreased the extension of
their PIEs.
2.12 Teens used mental frames to process their constraints in ways that made it easier
for teens to accept them.
2.13 Teens had practices in relation to their friendships with their parents on social
media to negotiate the collapsed context of SM and connect with parents and family.

182
This section has presented findings from the analysis of the surveys, mapping
activity, and family, parent, and teen interviews concerning the practices that teens
used to negotiate their ICT interactions in order to maintain the balance of their
membership within their family and meet their needs. The following section will
present a discussion of the findings.

183
Chapter 8 : Discussion of Findings
This chapter contains the discussion of the findings, following the order of the
research questions. The first section addresses the findings for RQ 1 concerning
parental mediation (PM) practices, and the two following sections will address RQ 2, RQ
2a, and RQ 2b in relation to teens’ family small world negotiation of resources and their
interpersonal relationships.
Discussion for RQ 1 Related to Finding Presented in Chapter 5
This section discusses the findings related to Research Question 1 (RQ 1), which
asked: How do Latino/a parents mediate their teens’ Information Communication
Technology (ICT) practices? The discussion addresses the typology of ICT mediation
practices that was produced from analysis of the data, afterwhich it will discuss directive
narratives and their relation to parenting and the ICT context of the home.
The typology produced from this project subdivided parents’ ICT mediation
practices into six subthemes: rules and restrictions, devices, active mediation, parental
monitoring, privacy, social media (SM), and directive narratives (see Chapter 5 for the
PM typology and Appendix F for the full typology codebook with definitions and
examples ). As discussed in the literature review (see Chapter 2) traditional PM theory
generally concieves of three types of PM; active, restrictive and co-use (Nathanson,
2002, 2008). Other researchers have added categories to this classification, such as
monitoring (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008), co-playing (Joiw et al., 2016; Nikken & Jansz,
2003, 2006; Shin & Huh, 2011) and participatory learning (Clark, 2011; Zaman et al.,

184
2016). Findings generally uphold these categories, but also diverge somewhat because
of this dissertation’s focus on PM in relation to its influence on adolescents’ ICT use,
rather than as a set of activities directed at protecting children from negative media
effects (see Major Finding 1.1)10. For this this reason, findings revealed additional
categories of active mediation, considers parental monitoring and privacy as connected,
but separate concepts, and includes an entire subtheme devoted to SM.
Contrary to recent findings (Clark, 2011; Joiw et al., 2016; Nikken & Jansz, 2003,
2006; Shin & Huh, 2011; Zaman et al., 2016), this dissertation found limited evidence for
co-use and co-playing and no evidence of participatory learning. There were families
that discussed co-use (F 1, 2, 4, and 7)11 and co-playing (F3 and 8), but these practices
were only described as being frequent in Family 3, where father and son shared a
gaming hobby (see “buddy parenting” in Zaman et al., 2016), and Family 4, where
restrictions on his access meant that Teen 4 had little choice, but to share with his
mother if he wanted to use the Internet. Many of these practices have been more
readily identified with younger children (Nikken & Janz, 2014), which suggests the lack
of evidence in this study for these types of practices might indicate parents use ICTs
with their children more when they are young, but taper off as they get older. Parents

185
were involved in their teens’ ICT use, but this was expressed more as help with ICTs,
discussions about its use, and encouragement of certain types of interactions. If the
assitance with ICTs that parents and teens gave one another was included as co-use, the
practice would have been classified as common. However, these types of assistance
were usually described by participants more as unidirectional help that either parents or
teens were providing and neither discussed sitting down together to learn as a joint
activity. Instructional assistance has typically been grouped with conversational active
mediation in PM, but it is incuded in the dissertations’s PM typology in Appendix F as a
separate category of active mediation, because it often seemed like a different type of
activity than conversation. While these two categories do overlapp somewhat,
conversation seemed to be used more to shape teens’ overall practices, or what is
generally called a proactive parenting process (Padilla-Walker, Christensen, & Day,
2011), while ICT help was often more perfunctory and practical.
Consistent with the literature (Chakroff & Nathanson, 2009), parental
conversations with their children concerning their use of media was a very popular form
of PM in this dissertation. This dissertation provides a catalog of the topics that were
most prominently depicted in parents’ conversations that builds on past
conceptualizations of conversation in PM as purposeful attempts to shape teens’
evaluation of media (Eastin, Greenberg, & Hofschire, 2006; Kirwil, 2009) by
distinguishing the topics that were most prominantly discribed by parents. Parents
reported conversing with their teens about ICTs in relation to information literacy (P2, 4,

186
and 7), online safety (P1,2,3, 4, 7, and 8), rules and restrictions (P4, and 8), teens’
transgressions (P1, 3, 4, 7, and 8), and their beliefs and values (P1, 2, 4, and 8).
The use of monitoring in a variety of forms was also a popular practice among
the participating parents. Monitoring has generally been considered a kind of restictive
mediation (Eastin et al., 2006; Kirwil, 2009; Nikken & Jansz, 2003, 2006; Oosting et al.,
2008 ), but as Jiow et al (2016) have indicated, and was also found in this dissertation,
monitoring is often not restrictive, and it is also often combined with other mediation
practices, particularly privacy practices, that make it beneficial to address it singularly.
This designation needs updating for today’s more extensive media environment and the
important role ICT monitoring seemed to play in PM and parenting. Zaman et al. (2016)
argue that parents use supervison in conjunction with deference (see Padilla-Walker,
Coyne, Fraser, Dyer, & Yorgason, 2012), to grant their children some autonomy over
their interactions with ICTs, but also to stay involved. This finding was upheld by this
dissertation, but there was also a range of monitoring and privacy provision that are not
addressed within the concept as Zaman et al. have concieved it. The parents in this
dissertation were found to use various types of monitoring that included supervison, but
also incorporated verbal enquiries, and monitoring of teens’ devices, online accounts,
and Internet histories. These additonal subdivisions are simlar to the Ledbetter et al.
(2010) classifications of parental invasions of privacy. However, invasion is a loaded
word for these parenting practices, considering that in interviews parents reported
using monitoring for a variety of purposes and with a range of intensity. Though
infrequently it was described as an active process that involved reading all

187
communications and following all Internet interaction (P1), monitoring was usually
discribed as a more passive practice that hinged on the possibility that it could occur
(see Major Finding 1.5). Mom 3 explained, “I trust him 'cause…so let's say my husband
falls asleep and he's still online, and I gave him a bedtime and he didn't go to bed, my
husband could find out if he's still playing, who he's talking to” (M3, FI)12. Her ability to
check Teen 3’s gaming history, and her belief in his knowledge that she could check on
him at anytime allowed her to trust him enough to refrain from engaging in any actual
monitoring of his activities. This type of internalization of external motivation is called
integration by Deci and Ryan (2008) and was often integrated into parents’ balance
between monitoring and the provision of privacy.
While parents often balanced monitoring with privacy they have been separated
in the typology assembled in this dissertation in order to clarify their distinct
dimensions. Privacy provison, often referred to as deference (Padilla-Walker, 2008;
Padilla-Walker et al., 2012), was divided between the granting of four types of privacy:
autonomy, independence, physical space, and device and account privacy. These
varying types of privacy were distributed differently among the parents and combined
with the various types of monitoring in contrasting ways (see Major Finding 1.6). For
example, Teen 7’s parents used SM monitoring and occasional monitoring of her

188
personal devices coupled with the provision of a high degree of autonomy to interact
with ICTs as she felt was appropriate. On the other hand, Teen 1’s mother used
extensive monitoring of her accounts and devices, but allowed her daughter privacy in
her bedroom. Parents used these combinations of practices to control their teens’ ICT
practices, but they were also used as resources for parenting.
An important aspect of findings regarding PM was that the practices that were
oriented towards limiting the negative effects of ICTs on teenage children were
completely intertwined with mediation that was more a product of general parenting
concerns and used as a parental resource (see Major Finding 1.2). Clark (2011) has
critiqued the traditional focus on media effects within the PM literature (e.g.,
Borzekowski & Robinson, 2007; Lemish, 2008; Nathanson, 1999; Valkenburg, Krcmar,
Peeters, & Marseille, 1999) as idealistic and called for research that includes a more
realistic consideration of ICT parenting practices. As media and ICTs converge (Jenkins,
2006) and become integrated into every aspect of modern families’ routines, it is more
helpful to characterize PM in terms of the overall influence that parents have on their
children’s ICT practices. PM research could be very relevant to everyday life information
seeking (ELIS) research as it would promote understanding of parental information
practices and their influence on children and teens’ practices. There is also already a
large body of literature that describes parents’ intermediation between children and
ICTs to serve as a foundation. To make the transition the “mediation” terminology
should be understood to have a more nuetral intermediary quality than the PM
literature has generally proposed. This is not to imply that parents are nuetral in their

189
influence of teens’ ICT use, but that their influence has many pretexts and purposes that
are not soley related to wanting to prevent the negative effects of ICTs. For instance,
Teen 1’s mother encouraged her daughter to use ICTs in a way that would benefit her
future and make her more attractive to colleges. This encouragement could be
described both as a parenting practice or an attempt to instruct her daughter on how to
use ICTs in a responsiible and productive manner. One ICT mediation practice that was
used by all of the parents more as a general parenting practice was the removal of
devices as a threat or punishment. This practice was often used by parents as a
behavior contingency (see Hogan, 2001; Kutner et al., 2008; Nikken & Janz, 2006) to
persuade teens to comply with them in the moment and to influence their priorities in
general (see Major Finding 1.4).
Parents influenced their teens’ ICT use with behavioral contingencies that
constrained the context of teens’ use and with rules and restrictions that put specific
limits on the type of content, interactions, and access that were allowed or possible (see
Major Finding 1.3) as O’Connor et al. (2013) have specified, however, the contextual
backdrop of this dissertation indicated that most of parents’ influence on teens’
interactions with ICTs was messy and less delineated than those classifications would
suggest (see Major Finding 1.7). The devices they allowed into the household, their own
technical competencies, the activities they supported, the help they provided, the
values they tried to impart, and the family narratives they established were intertwined
with the explicit limits parents made on ICTs. This finding regarding broad familial ICT
influence was more similar to what Silverstone et al. (1989) have called technological

190
inheritance than to PM, when it is depicted as a group of distinct practices that are used
in isolation as it is often characterized by scholars (Livingstone & Helsper, 2008;
Nathanson, 2002, 2008; Yardi & Bruckman, 2011). For example, Teen 3’s father was a
gamer and had always encouraged and helped his son to strengthen these skills. Teen 3
described how his father had “actually put an Xbox controller in my hand at the age of 6
and I’ve been playing since then” (T3, TI). His father’s encouragement, assistance, and
co-playing in this domain seemed to have an enhancement effect (Nathanson, 2002,
2008), setting the groundwork for Teen 3 to focus most of his time on improving his
gaming skills. Teen 3 said, “I spend, I would say most of the day [gaming],…I would say
more than eight hours” (T3, TI). Family context influenced teens in various ways. For
instance, Teen 6 developed some of his ICT competence to provide his parents with
language brokering and technical assistance. This familial need in combination with the
ICT freedom his parents afforded, and an extended family member that reinforced his
interests, helped spark his interest in technology and the technological competence he
built over time, despite being a member of one of the least affluent families in the
sample. The early introduction and encouragement of technical activities seemed
particularly instrumental. Teen 6 explained that he had become interested in
computers because his cousin “knows a lot about computers basically...since we were
little, like seven or something we used to play on computers a lot, that's why” (T6, TI).
All of these contextual factors influenced the ICT competence that Teen 6 developed.
Parents, teens, and individual family members seemed to reveal their priorities
within their accounts of their practices. Parents positioned themselves in relation to

191
society by using “publicly available stock” (Carey, 1989; Hoover et al., 2004) as “an
explanation and justification of themselves as ‘good’ parents and by extension, creators
of healthy families” (Hoover et al. p. 8), but in doing that they communicated their
personal priorities as parents and individuals in relation to their practices. Plowman
(2015) has shown that parents “ethnotheories” influence the group of practices that
parents use with young children. In addition, Silverstone et al. (1989) have argued that
the stories or “family mythologies” that families recount about themselves were
important to the functioning of family households. This dissertation builds on their
argument by demonstrating that both family and individual narratives were significant
to the evolving dynamic of the family around ICTs and what the family experienced as
their reality. Mitchell and Egudo (2003) assert that narrative is “deeply constitutive of
reality, not merely a device for establishing meaning” (p.2). In concurrence, data
analysis identified family directive narratives as providing a shared context that helped
to establish the boundaries of the family, their orientation to one another, and to
outsiders (1.11).
Parents were not solely directed by family and parental narratives, they also had
individual narratives. While PM has been found to be gendered (Louie, 2003; Liau,
Khoo, & Ang, 2008), analysis of the individual directive narratives helped to reveal the
connection between parents’ personal identities and the differences in how each
mediated their children in everyday life. For instance, Teen 7’s mother and father had
very different stances on technology and this was reflected in the differentiated ICT
activities that they both performed in the home. He was instructive and she was more

192
of an ICT companion and sometime student. Some parents (P2, 7, and 8) discussed their
shared parenting philosophies in great detail, but demonstrated differences when
discussing themselves as individuals. This indicated that there were two types of parent
narratives: a) parental narratives that presented them as they wanted to be seen as
parents by the investigator, similar to what Silverman (2006) calls interpretive
repertoires, and b) personal narratives that identified their own ICT practices and
priorities. Both of these types of narratives exemplified different aspects of families’
technological cultures or small world.
It was difficult to get a sense from the parental interviews about which
mediation practices were enforced, and which were simply preferences or
representations of values they had and/or felt it was important to present to the
investigator. In the past researchers have found that parents only enforce their rules
20% of the time. (Austin, 1993; Dorr & Rabin, 1995; Strasburger & Donnerstein, 1999).
Parents and teens’ perceptions of mediation have also long been demonstrated in the
literature to be in disagreement (Austin, 1993; Byrne & Lee, 2011), and this dissertation
does echo those results to some extent. In the survey, participants demonstrated
differences in their perceptions of the frequency of mediation, with teens reporting less
PM than did parents. However, the difference was minimal, and whether or not
parents’ or teens’ reports in the survey or interview accounts were entirely accurate,
they seemed to be indicative of their beliefs and their general orientation towards
technology and parenting (see Major Finding 1.8). As other researchers have found,
parents’ beliefs and values seemed connected to their parenting, (Ames et al. 2011;

193
Clark, 2012; Nikken & Jansz, 2014; Sigel & McGillicuddy-De Lisi, 2002), but directive
narratives clearly contextualized parents’ practices in ways that connected them directly
with their personal histories and beliefs. The directive narratives also provided a
rationale for the set of varying mediation practices that the parents had assembled
(1.11) that went far beyond demographic predicters. In particular, the Latino/a
demographic characteristic did not seem linked to any categorical notion of parenting
styles (Baumrind, 1966) (see Chapter 2, section on parenting styles), upholding findings
that Latino/a parents ways of parenting do not fit well into the traditional classfications
(Guillermo-Ramos et al., 2007; Halgunseth et al., 2006; Rodriguez et al., 2009).
Furthermore, the differences that Ames et al. (2011) found between middle class and
lower class parents in their underlying values and beliefs concerning technology were
not visible within this dissertation. While the two more educated and affluent parents
(P7 and 8) did generally have more authoritative parenting styles than the other
parents, they did not have the “cautious” and restrictive way of parenting ICTs that
Ames et al. have described, and they were not overly concerned with the dangers that
ICTs posed to their children. Dad 7, said “we are not afraid of technology, it is a
resource that I understand that we all need…I hope that they use it well” (D8, PI, trans).
Moreover, contrary to previous research, the parents (P1, 2, and 3) that were closer to
demonstrating the types of parenting meant to cultivate their teenage children (Clark,

194
2013; Lareau, 2011) were relatively less affluent13 (especially when family size was
considered) and less educated.
Identifying narratives rather than parenting styles was less effective for
identifying parents as belonging to typical types, but more beneficial to identifying the
dynamic within families and the dialogical way they had evolved. The dialogic that
existed between the monitoring and privacy practices that parents used and teens’
practices was highly relevant to how parents used them . To present them singularly as
PM research has traditonally done (Clark, 2011), ignores that parents and teens’
practices were often responsive to one another in the moment and over time and also
carefully balanced by each party (see Major Finding 1.9). Data analysis revealed that
teens were open with their parents in order to inspire trust, and that parents devised
their particular combination of monitoring and privacy provison to encourage openess.
These practices constituted a reponsive process that evolved over time and was often
integrated into parents’ narratives of their own parenting and the family dynamic (see
Major Finding 1.10).
The boundary negotiation process revelaed in this dissertation is similar to the
process described by Petronio (2002), Erickson et al., (2015), and Ledbetter et al., (2010)
in that variations of parental control and teen autonomy were important to the dynamic
between parents and teens and manifested in their individual practices. However, this

13

195
dissertation contributes a typology of both teen and parental practices that extends
beyond the invasive and defensive practices identified by Ledbetter et al., (2010) to
include parental practices that shape teens’ ICT use, but are not invasive, and teens’
practices by which they negotiate other contextual factors of their families beyond their
parents’ restrictions or monitoring. These distinctions provide a more thorough account
of what is entailed in the parent/teen boundary negotiation process surrounding ICTs
that also acknowledges positive and structural elements.
Discussion for RQ 2a Related to Findings Presented in Chapter 6.
This section will discuss the findings for Research Question 2a (RQ 2a), which
asked: what practices do teens use to negotiate their resources in relation to ICTs in
accordance with their families? The participating teens’ ICT practices and access were
shaped by their parents, their household ICT culture, and the strategies they had
developed to negotiate this influence. Parents overtly influenced teens through the
devices they chose to purchase, the rules and restrictions they created for how teens
could interact with ICTs, and the types of interactions they explicitly and implicitly
encouraged (see Major Finding 2.1). These practices shaped the structures that teens
needed to negotiate and the ICT content and interactions teens understood as
appropriate.
Teens had also developed practices to negotiate their physical resources, such as
the ICT devices and the physical spaces that were available. As Cresswell (2004) asserts,
households had physical barriers that impeded movement, explicit rules about how
spaces were to be used, and social rules, that were more implicit and dependent on the

196
family culture (see Major Finding 2.2). These adolescents regularly negotiated their use
of ICTs in physical space to be alone, to create personal space within shared space, and
to connect with their family members (see Major Finding 2.3). The added mobility that
smart phones provided made their negotiation of space especially relevant to their ICT
use by enabling them more autonomy over their practices and more ability to move
their location in response to context (see Major Finding 2.6). Teen 6 stated, “when I
can’t watch TV down here and I wanna watch something, I just go upstairs instead” (T6,
TI). Teens also used different information and media depending on who was in the
room. For instance, they reported being alone most of the time when they were looking
up personal information. The censoring effect created by sharing space was especially
important for those teens that needed to manage space in order to be alone. To cope
they had developed a kind of “place-ballet” (Seamon, 1980) where they took advantage
of private physical spaces as they became available and in a sense, they converted them
into a place with their use of media as their context. Teens adapted their use to the
circumstances and context of the room, which often changed from day to day. In this
way, the spaces of the home were never complete and were always being constructed
through the integration processes and routines of the home and their practices (Pred,
1984). At the same time, their personal devices and the media they accessed created
continuity, making the new space immediately familiar and their own. Though there
was evidence of the construction of “bedroom cultures” (see Bovill & Livingstone, 2001;
Kearney, 2007; Lincoln, 2014; Ling & Thrane, 2001), most of the teens had not created
this sort of space, similar to what Lim (2008) found in Chinese and Korean teens.

197
However, they did have ICT hubs or “base[s] of operations,” as Ling and Thrane (2001)
have identified, where they centered most of their ICT activities. Teens also adjusted to
sharing space by various practices meant to create a personal sphere or a bubble of
solitude that could easily be modified to shift to a more communally shared experience.
Thrift (1997) has emphasized the importance of practice to the use of space. He
believes that focusing on practice creates knowledge that is more in tune with the
embodied experience of reality and less theoretical.
Teens’ descriptions of their use of the material ICT objects is also important
because they are a distinct part of their immediate practices and, in a sense, can be
considered an extension of the body (Dourish, 2001). Perhaps this is one explanation
for the extreme attachment the participants had developed with their phones, and their
hesitance to lend them to family members. Like physical space, material objects also
contain barriers that constrain use, and affordances that promote it (Norman, 1988).
These practices are not necessarily the same as those that were intended by the
designers, because individuals interact with devices within the constraints of their own
knowledge, habits, and concoct creative solutions to solve problems within their
personal context. However, while teens used ICTs to manipulate their visibility and
create a sense of personal space when they shared space as Ito (2005) has described,
many of the teens were purposefully open with their parents in order to evade
suspicion and to connect with them, as mentioned above. This finding was also true for
material technologies and the online space. As Bernheim et al., (2007) have found, the

198
teens in this dissertation rarely used different profiles or technical settings to control
their privacy, depending heavily on social protocols.
Over all, the teens primarily used social protocols to help negotiate their
household resources, which may have affected their access. The contrast between the
number of devices that were available in the home and the number teens used is a good
example of this. (see Table 4.6 Devices per Family, per Teen, and Home Access per Teen
in Chapter 4 for an inventory of household devices.) For instance, Teens 7 and 8 both
had 17 devices in their home, but each only used approximately five devices. In all, the
teens ranged from using two devices to eleven devices each. However, even this
number could be misleading, as it did not demonstrate the number of devices that were
regularly used, the frequency of use, or the activities for which each device was used.
The number of ICTs that that teens regularly used appeared to be dependent on how
they negotiated the use of devices they had access to in the home. Some participants
were more proactive in securing their use. They found ways of dominating the
technologies they shared with others and were able to extend their personal
information ecology (PIE). Others rarely requested or attempted to use those
technologies and had developed the habit of depending mostly on their smart phones,
which seemed to limit the range of their ICT activities (see Major Finding 2.7) and their
PIEs. This could be important as Pearce and Rice (2008) have found that teens that only
accessed the Internet from their mobile devices engaged less in "capital enhancing"
activities on the Internet.

199
Teens also seemed to be constrained by what they understood their parents
thought was appropriate (see Major Finding 2.4). Parents were found to often serve a
gatekeeping function (see also Dias et al., 2016), sometimes purposefully, others times
not. Teen participants did not generally describe accessing content their parents
disapproved of or had forbidden. This practice left some room for use that was not
explicitly prohibited, such as how Teen 2 borrowed her friends’ SM accounts, as she was
not allowed to create her own, in order to participate with her peers. Generally,
however, the youth limited themselves to topics their parents encouraged, such as
educational oriented apps.
In agreement with the literature (DiMaggio, Hargittai, Celeste, & Shafer, 2004;
Hargittai, 2003; Yu & Zhou, 2016) data analysis for this dissertation found that access
and ability were separate issues of information inequality. Socio-economically
disadvantaged teens were not more likely to report lower technical competency in their
interviews. Though they often did have less access to ICTs, they also sometimes had
more need to build competency because of their role within their family as ICT brokers
(see Major Finding 2.5). They described providing parents with language and digital
media brokering, technical assistance, assistance with ICT research, and ICT mediation
of their younger siblings as the literature has demonstrated is typical of immigrant teens
(Correa, Straubhaar, Chen, & Spence, 2014; Katz, 2010; Clark & Sywyj, 2012). Technical
knowledge was often diffused from teens to their parents (see Correa, 2014) and teens
also regularly influenced what technologies their families decided to purchase (see
Beatty & Talpade, 1994). Similarly, the participants that had the most sophisticated

200
practices were generally found to be those that had the most parental restrictions and
needed to find creative ways to meet their various needs. Those that had the most
educated and technically skilled parents (T7 and 8), on the other hand, did not report
more skill or more sophisticated ICT practices. This finding might have been related to
Teens 7 and 8 having fathers that took on the expert role in their homes as Correa et al.
(2015) have reported. It also may have been gendered as both of these teens (T7 and 8)
were girls, though Teen 8’s father was proud of the ways that his daughter did show
technical competency and described being somewhat disappointed that she showed no
interest in taking after him and pursuing a technology career. The social roles family
members took on related to ICTs, was found to be influential to the roles that teens
took on and therefore how teens interacted with ICTs.
Discussion for RQ 2b Related to Findings Presented in Chapter 7
This section will discuss the findings related to RQ 2b which asked: what
practices do teens use to negotiate their interpersonal relationships in relation to ICTs in
accordance with their families? The specific major findings presented within the chapter
will be indicated with the number they are listed under in the findings section.
Teens demonstrated behaviors that showed that maintaining the balance of
their membership in their families was one of their main priorities, such as limiting their
interactions with peers, but they also used their ICTs to fulfill their personal needs,
which included maintaining their connections to other social worlds. These adolescents
described practices they adopted to negotiate their personal, peer, and family
boundaries on SM, participate in their peer and academic social worlds, and cope with

201
their parents’ authority in ways that usually did not upset the balance of any of their
relationships.
These teens understood that the social norms of their peers and schools were
different from those of their households and made adjustments to enable their
participation in both. For instance, Teen 2 demonstrated creative family small world ICT
mangement skills when she used her relationship with her best friend to meet the
expectation the school had that she print out her papers (see Major Finding 2.10). The
facility with which teens negotiated their family small worlds depended on their
understanding of their and their parents’ roles and the degree of harmony and
dissonance between the social norms of their various small worlds and their own
priorities. To negotiate their ICT interactions in accordance with the small world of the
family, teens had to make priorities in relation to their openess/closedness, the degree
of participation in each of their family, peer, and academic social worlds, and the
extension of their PIE (see Major Finding 2.11). Each family’s social world had different
expectations for their ICT connectedness and communication similar to what Burnett
(2015) has described in his theory of information worlds. Teens had to use strategies
and practices that prioritized certain aspects over others. For instance, extending the
reach of their PIE often meant that teens gave up some of their privacy. This practice
could leave their information, ICT activities or communicative activities more exposed or
open to others. For instance, Teen 2 often used her mother’s phone to text with her
friends or receive messages from the school, which could be seen by her mother.
Similarly, teens that wanted to maintain more privacy might have to limit their PIE in

202
some way, such as not participating on a popular SM network with their peers.
Additionally, the methods that teens used to negotiate the boundaries of their familial
small world influenced their ability to connect with their other social worlds and meet
their ICT expectations. Sometimes complying with the social norms of one small world
meant limiting participation in another small world and their PIE in the process. Though
some teens managed to participate in each social world to the extent of the
expectations from that world, others had to choose to prioritize one world over
another. For example, Teen 4 reported that despite the constraints he had to his
access, he was able to manage his resources in a way that met his school’s ICT
expectations by regularly using the computers in the school library. However, he also
described limiting the extension of his PIE over time by reducing his ICT interactions
with the social world of his peers to meet his mother’s expectations. Teen 4’s ICT use
was helping him to assimilate into US culture, but as Lombano-Bermudez (2015) has
found, his engagement was peripheral and constrained by his mother’s lack of
integration.
Teens’ use of ICTs to circumnavigate their family cultures should not be
exaggerated. Findings reveal that the power differential between teens and parents
was very important. In contrast to what has been reported in the literature for majority
culture teens (Nathanson, 2002; Smetana et al. 2006), this dissertation’s results
corresponded with the Clark and Sywyj’s (2012) finding that immigrant teens did not see
parents’ ICT restrictions as outside their right as parents and they also did not seem to
have negative emotions about their parents’ restrictions contrary to what Padilla-

203
Walker (2008) has found. These results support findings that the boundaries of what is
considered in the personal domain and outside of parents’ authority has been found to
vary among different ethnic cultures (Nucci, 1996; Smetana & Daddis, 2002). While the
adolescents did tend to be more comfortable and to have more positive views of ICTs in
general than did their parents, their parents’ level of restriction did not seem to
influence them to have more positive views of restricted ICTs or to be more likely to
interact with them as Nathanson (2002) has observed. This is in keeping with the
Phinney, Kim-Jo, Osorio, and Vilhjalmsdottir (2005) finding that US teens of ethnic
backgrounds outside of majority culture were more compliant with their parents than
teens of European-American descent. Even teen participants with parents that had the
most restrictive and controlling mediation practices, generally stated that they went
along with parents’ rules and restrictions, and did not report negative feelings about
their parents (see Major Finding 2.9). Accordingly, children with socially controlling
families have been found to feel obligated to conform with their norms (Soenenes &
Vansteenkiste, 2010). Moreover, the teens did not report many attempts to hide from
parents or to deceive them using SM or otherwise, and in many cases, they were
purposefully open with their parents, sharing space, leaving smart phones strewn about
and their accounts open in order to create a balance of trust with their parents, though
one teen did describe activities meant to allow him to hide in plain sight as described by
Gomez, Booth, and Katz (2011). The teen participants were most likely to respond to
their parents’ ICT restrictions and authority as it was enforced in the moment by
complying, as Montemayor (1983) and Smetana et al. (1991) have shown, but they did

204
report and were reported making verbal attempts to change their parents’ minds,
question their rational, and convince them to purchase ICTs (see Major Finding 2.8).
One aspect that seemed important to how family directive narratives integrated
to form the family dynamic was how teens chose to process the constraints parents
imposed. Teens used mental framing devices to help them adjust to their current
circumstances and negotiate their relationships with their parents (see Major Finding
2.12). The six teens (T1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7) that demonstrated using mental frames often
utilized more than one, employing different frames depending on the situation, and
seeing different limitations or infringements from within different frames. In the frames
that teens chose to describe their situations, they tended to cast themselves as either
having control or not having control over their circumstances. Frames that were
constructed around the idea of not having any control seemed to be more interpretive
than active. Frames, such as the future frame, that were used to present themselves
with agency were more constructive, and a direct result of teens’ attempts to view their
situation in way that helped them mentally adjust to how things were. All the mental
frames facilitated teens’ adjustment to the requirements of their situation and
influenced their attempts to use their agency to extend their PIE.
Social Media was salient in the data as an area that was particularly complicated
for teens to negotiate their relational boundaries (see Major Finding 2.13). The parents
and teen participants had both thoroughly incorporated SM into their lives and the
commonality of being friends meant that they were in the process of negotiating new

205
norms for how to use that shared space and that their perceptions of the boundaries did
not always correspond. Though they were not very common, adolescents reported
using some of the privacy tactics described as social privacy in the literature (e.g. boyd,
2014; Grinter & Palen, 2002; Ito, 2005; Marwick & boyd, 2014; Vickery, 2015), such as
only making posts that would be acceptable to all of their audiences, and obscuring or
censoring posts. Teens and their parents also described how they needed to contend
with the extra monitoring that came with being visible to their parents’ social networks
and used some of the same practices to evade that visibility. However, though some
teens were found to be uncomfortable with parental friendships on SM (see also similar
findings from: Madden et al., 2012; Ito et al. 2008; West et al., 2008), most teens had no
problem with accepting parents as friends, as Child and Westerman (2013) have
indicated, or with the posts that parents made about them. Furthermore, some
additional social ICT practices were revealed in the data, such as teens’ use of SM to
connect with their parents and family. One participant was described using SM as the
context for interacting with parents offline (T8) and another few (T5, 6, 7, and 8) were
described using their public posts to relate socially with their parents and family. Similar
to what Caron and Caronia (2004, 2005) have found with mobile phones, teens’ public
performance of their relationships on SM meant that they understood the social norms
of various audiences (Marwick & boyd, 2007), and how to wield the complex “social
grammar” particular sites afforded them to construct their relationships.

This chapter has discussed the project’s findings in relation to RQ 1 and RQ 2, 2a,
and 2b. Chapter 9 will present sections devoted to theoretical discussion,
contributions, limitations, and the conclusion.

Chapter 9 : Contributions, Implications, Limitations, and Conclusion
The following chapter presents discussion that goes beyond the findings of the
study. It will begin with an examination of the project’s theoretical implications and
delineation of its contributions, focusing on the three main contributing theories. It will
then proceed to the main methodological and pragmatic contributions to Library and
Information Science (LIS), present the limitations of the dissertation, and suggest
directions for further study. The dissertation will conclude with final remarks that
reflect on the changes the project generated to the investigator’s understanding and its
significance to the broader library and information science (LIS) research community.
Below, the Silverstone et al. (Silverstone et al., 1989, 1991, 1992), theory of the
domestication of technology, Chatman’s (1991a, 1991b, 1996, 1999, 2000) small world
theories, and Nardi & O’Day’s (1999) concept of information ecologies will be discussed
and the specific contributions of this dissertation will be provided.
Theoretical Implications and Contributions
Domestication of technology (Silverstone et al., 1989, 1991, 1992), small world
theories (Chatman, 1991a, 1991b, 1996, 1999, 2000), and information ecologies (Nardi
& O’Day, 1999) were the key theoretical frameworks used to inform this dissertation
These concepts were similar in that they all conceived of a system of interactions within
which family practices related to ICT use can be placed, but they each characterized
these interactions from a different angle, contributing to the overall analysis of the data,
including the development of the typologies (see Appendices F and G). The following

208
sections will address these important contributing theories and indicate how this
dissertation study applied, contributed to, and extended them.
The domestication of technology. Silverstone et al.’s (1989, 1991, 1992)
understanding of the family as a system, emphasis on technology, and the process of
incorporating technology into that system informed the data analysis in highlighting the
importance of both social and material factors to how this process would evolve in
Latino/a housholds. This dissertation drew on Silverstone and colleagues’ notion of the
technological culture of the home (Silverstone et al. 1989) to look at individual families
as the cultural unit, rather than their ethnic affiliation. From this perpective it was
understood that the household ICT culture would be more significant to how family
members interacted with ICTs and would consequently play an important role in both
how teens used ICTs and in how parents mediated their use. Silverstone et al. (1989)
believed that underlying family mythologies were integral to how the family system
functioned. This concept directed the data analysis to focus on participants’ shared
understanding of their mythologies, or family narratives, which create context for their
experience. Shared family mythologies or narratives emerged as significant organizing
agents that cast individual members in certain roles in relation with other members,
enabling them to understand how they should proceed in the moment. However, the
concept lacked a consideration of how family narratives were enacted within
households or how individual members’ own priorities fit into the family system. This
dissertation is able to address this lack by expanding the theoretical tools to address
individual agency within the system. It does this by extending the analysis beyond the

209
shared understandings of family narratives to member’s individual narratives. The
examination of individual narrative and its connection to individual agency facilitate a
clearer view of the dynamic of the full system.
The directive narrative nomenclature was developed from accounts by individual
family members that expressed their identities and priorities (see Appendix F for the
Directive Narrative subtheme and categories within the full parental mediation
typology). During the analysis, these individual narratives appeared to intermingle with
one another and the family narratives in a way that is similar to what Bakhtin (1984)
describes as polyphony (Bakhtin, 1984). Bakhtin argued that in a polyphonic novel,
individual characters have their own fully formed narratives that interact with other
characters’ narratives in a dialogic fashion. In other words, statements are said, or
practices are enacted, in response to current circumstances within the context of what
has occurred in the past and what is anticipated of the future. Though this is a literary
concept it could be applied to the dynamic within the families that participated. The
individual family members had their own personal perspectives and narratives that
were essentially in a dialogue with their other family members’ narratives that
continued over time and changed in response to one another. In accordance, the scripts
and narratives that participants had about themselves often situated their practices
directly in relation to one another and even when they did not, they provided insight
into individual priorities and practices and how they might interrelate and create certain
family dynamics. Parents and teens had individual priorities that were shaped by the
shared meanings of the family, but also reflected their individual needs.

This section has explored the theoretical implications and contributions of this
dissertation, the next section will discuss Chatman’s (1996, 1999, 2001) small world
theories.
Small world theories. This project drew on Elfreda Chatman’s small world and
normative behavior theories (1991b, 1996, 1999, 2000) to analyze how teens’
membership in their families influenced their ICT participation. Her work assisted to
direct the dissertation’s focus on individuals’ practices. Her emphasis on the role that
groups play in individual information behavior informed the analytic framework used to
interpret teens’ ICT practices in relation to their families. Chatman had found that
individuals limited their information behavior in accordance with the social norms of
those groups. Similarly, teens did seem to manage their ICT practices in ways that
would permit them to meet the norms of their family group. However, they also
managed their practices in ways that allowed them to assimilate information from
outside that main group affiliation and meet the expectations of their extended
information worlds. They understood that their peer and academic social worlds had
different ICT social norms and expectations than did their family, and they made
attempts to negotiate those expectations using strategies that enabled them to meet at
least some of their personal need for competence and social connections (see Deci &
Ryan, 2008, theory of self-determination) and extend their PEIs. Though Chatman’s
(1996, 1999, 2001) small world conceptualization was key to the analysis of the
qualitative data, it was not a perfect fit. It is essentially a deficit perspective of the
individual in the small world. The focus on the closed world of the group was meant to

212
discover how group membership leads to information poverty for their members, but
this assumption limits Chatman’s original small world theoretical framework’s ability to
be utilized to observe individual agency and by extension to perceive the creative
information practices that group members construct to negotiate the structure of the
group.
In using Chatman’s (1996, 1999, 2000) small world theories, it is hoped that the
findings of this dissertation make a lasting theoretical contribution to this body of work.
Results from this dissertation refined and expanded Chatman’s small world theories in
the following ways:
•

Extended the small world framework to include families.

•

Expanded the small world’s consideration of social types to parent and teen
roles within the household and the power differential that helps to characterize
their interactions around ICTs.

•

Identified contextual household factors that were important to how teens
negotiated their family small world.

•

Delineated a teen family small world typology of the practices that adolescents
used to negotiate their membership within their families in relation to ICTs.

•

Reframed Chatman’s concept of Information behavior as an active process of
information negotiation, rather than a passive consequence of group
membership.

213
•

Incorporated material factors, such as household ICT devices and physical
spaces, into the small world conceptualization.

•

Explored how the interconnected nature of modern technology influences the
information behavior of individual members of the family group.

•

Identified practices that teens used to connect with and meet the expectations
of their other social worlds while maintaining their membership in the family
group.

This section has addressed contributions to Chatman’s small world theories, the
following section will explore the Nardi and O’Day (1999) concept of information
ecologies.
Information ecologies. The concept of the information ecology (O’Day & Nardi,
1999) provided a framework to observe contextual factors of the home that took the
data analysis beyond the understanding of the household as a purely a social construct
and provided an inventory of factors that would compose teens’ immediate information
environment. There were devices in local environments, that people had taken on
specific roles to sustain, and the entire system seemed to function according to shared
values. However, the notion of the information ecology was limited in its ability to
grasp the dynamics of how one individual’s information activities would relate to the
broader ecology beyond the home. The findings suggested that teens’ ICT interactions
were grounded and shaped by their household ecologies, but that they used its
resources to extend beyond that ecology to meet the expectations of their other social

214
worlds, mainly their peer and academic worlds, that they needed to interact with during
the course of their everyday lives. For this reason, the analysis turned towards
Jarvelin’s (2011) conceptualization of the PEI provided a framework to understand how
an individual’s habitual information practices and resources intersected with multiple
information ecologies (see Chapter 2 for an explication of the PEI). Yu (2012) argues that
the “information worlds of individuals” have a number of dimensions, such as
availability and accessibility, that exist in space and time. Similarly, it is this
dissertation’s finding that participants seemed to animate these dimensions of their PEIs
n the physical spaces they inhabited within the everyday routines of their lives to cope
with the conflicting expectations of their “information worlds” (Burnett, 2015).
However, the notion of a PEI might lean too heavily on the physical metaphor, because
teens’ PEIs seemed to be more analogous to an active sphere of ICT interaction that
they enacted in relation with the various information ecologies and their own needs.
Imagining the PEI in this way might more accurately explain the way that the Latino/a
teens established the extension of their personal information ecologies within the
cultural context of their families’ information ecologies, but individually managed their
PEIs in order to meet their own needs to the best of their ability. Seeing teens’ PEIs in
this way is not predicated on a deficit perspective, but more as the development of
power to act within the resources and structures at hand.
Results from this dissertation expanded and further developed the information
ecology perspective of Nardi and O’Day (1999) in the following ways:

215
•

Expanded the information ecology concept to the family household.

•

Connected the information ecology concept to individual members.

•

Delineated two typologies of the practices that parents and teens used within
the information ecology of the household (see Appendices F and G for the full
typologies).

•

Identified some of the roles that family members take on around ICTs within the
household information ecology.

•

Distinguished factors that influenced how the various parts of the information
ecology (i.e., people, technology, values) interacted within the household.

•

Demonstrated the importance of social relationships to functioning of the
information ecology of the home.

•

Identified how individual members had adopted practices to facilitate their
movement within the various information ecologies of their social world.
Bringing it all together. This section has discussed the theoretical implications

and contributions of this dissertation regarding the three major frameworks that were
utilized for both its design and the analysis of the data. Above each theory is discussed
on its own, but it is also important to discuss why they were used in conjunction rather
than singularly. Each theoretical construct helped the analysis consider a different
aspect of the family household in relation to teens practices that would not have been
possible individually, specifically the technological infrastructure and diffusion of
information within the household, the social aspects of group relations, and the
influence of the family group on individuals’ information access, competence, and use.

216
Neither of these theories correlated directly to the observation of all of these
characteristics, but together they help to compensate for their individual weaknesses in
relation to this study.
Information ecologies (Nardi & O’Day, 1999) provided a way to look at the local
place of the household as a distinct information ecology with an infrastructure of
relationships and ongoing habitual information practices that are conducted using ICTs
and physical resources that evolve over time in response to changes in technology,
priorities, and relationships. Chatman (1996, 1999, 2000) and Silverstone et al. (1989,
1991, 1992) offered guidance towards how the social aspects of that infrastructure
would function. They both specify the importance of social norms, social roles (though
Chatman, 2000, calls them social types), and shared meanings, however Chatman
focuses on groups’ influence on individuals’ reception of information, while Silverstone
focuses on the family as a cultural unit that develops a particular perspective towards
technology in relation with the broader discourses outside the home. Chatman’s theory
of information behavior is integral to the dissertation’s concept that the teens’ personal
information processing would be shaped by their group membership, but Silverstone
and colleagues’ engagement with the interchange between the household and the
broader culture assist the analysis to get beyond Chatman’s notion of the group as
having rigid boundaries. This helped the analysis to extend the insular
conceptualizations of small worlds and information ecologies to how teens were
negotiating the boundaries of the family group in order to participate in their other
social worlds as well. In addition, Nardi and O’Day’s understanding of information

217
practices as “engagement and participation” assisted in framing the adolescents as
active participants that negotiated the social norms and structures of the family group in
relation to their personal needs, rather than just passively internalizing its constraints
(p.57). The teenagers’ practices included a toolbox of active strategies that were
grounded in their “particular combination of person and situation” (Case, 2007, p. 13).
This section has addressed the most important theoretical contributions to this
dissertation. While no theoretical construct fits perfectly, together they were better
able to assist the analysis to construct a holistic picture of teens’ practices within the
household. The next section will discuss contributions of the methodology.
Methodology Discussion
The following section will present a discussion of the contributions of the
dissertation’s methodological approach. As described in Chapter 3, this dissertation was
devised within a social constructivist framework that conceptualized participants’
understanding of reality as grounded in their interpretations and attempts to make
sense out of their experience (Lincoln & Guba, 1994) and "[i]nformation [as] a
disappearing category" (p. 12) with no ontological status in and of itself (Dervin, 1999).
Analysis thus viewed, collected data not as truths, but as related to truth. From this
standpoint, participants’ survey data and accounts provided evidence of some truth, but
were provided in response to particular conditions, susceptible to demand characteristic
bias (Orne, 2009), and only partial understandings. The dissertation was designed from
this perspective on the evidentiary potential of interview data and the belief that a
mixed-method study that was able to gain and compare knowledge from various

218
methods and perspectives would compensate for the individual weaknesses of each
method (Connaway & Radford, 2017; Fidel, 2008) and provide valuable insight into the
parent/teen dynamic that is a large part of the context for parents’ and teens’ ICT
practices. This mixed-method approach was deemed appropriate for an exploratory
study that was meant to integrate a variety of disciplines to provide a broader and more
context oriented understanding of teens’ ICT practices for everyday life information
seeking (ELIS) research. For this reason, the investigator collected survey, mapping, and
interview data from families, family members, and individually from parents and teens.
Each type of data was meant to provide a view of the family from a different
perspective. The mixed-method approach provided supplementary, complementary,
and conflicting information. These various types of information offered a broader view
of the family system.
Though the survey and the interviews asked participants about some of the
same practices, they also revealed different types of information. The surveys asked
about the frequency of certain ICT practices, and the interviews captured the underlying
context of what had inspired parents or teens practices, each providing valuable
information about how the practice fit into the dynamic between parents and teens.
For instance, in the surveys, none of the teens and only two of the teens’ parents (P2
and 7) reported parents asking teens to take posts down from social media (SM),
however, interview data from both parents and teens revealed that this practice was
significant to teens’ boundary negotiation online. Though this was an infrequent
practice, parents’ and teens’ vivid accounts demonstrated that taking down posts

219
retained an important place in the imagination of participants, suggesting it was a
significant indicator of underlying issues involved in parents’ mediation and teens’
boundary negotiation.
Additionally, the participants revealed supplementary information about one
another’s practices, with parents sometimes relating teen family small world
information practices that teens had not described and vice versa. For example, Teen 7
complained about being friends on SM with her mother and the times that her mother
had asked her to take posts down during her teen interview. However, in the family
interview, her mother described and provided video evidence that her daughter would
borrow her Instagram account and make affectionate posts that engaged with her
mother in a performative way for both sets of their friends. If the investigator had only
interviewed Teen 7, the evidence would have suggested her interactions with her
mother on SM were almost exclusively an irritation. If only the parents had been
interviewed, the annoyance Teen 7 felt about her mother demanding she take down
posts would not have been revealed. Moreover, if only the survey was given the
investigator would have only been able to conclude that the parental demand for SM
posts to be taken down was nonexistent or infrequent in their family and the novel use
of SM to connect with a parent would have never been revealed. The varying selfaccounts are subjective in nature, but they do demonstrate participants’ focus within
their interviews and communicate different facets of the parent/teen relationship, each
helping to assemble a holistic picture of the family dynamic.
The inclusion of the mapping activity, derived from the instrument developed by

220
Katz and Gonzalez (2016), also added more data about the physical context of teens’ ICT
use in the household. Teens’ maps and their accounts of those maps in their individual
interviews were able to capture how participants moved through and shared the
physical spaces of the home in relation to their ICT use. These descriptions of how they
rearranged their use of the physical spaces of the home to meet their needs would most
likely not have been uncovered without a systematic method of going over their maps
one room at a time. As Travlou et al. (2008) have argued, the teens’ maps seemed to
reiterate their cultural understandings and did not always reveal an objectively accurate
picture of the physical space. For example, Teen 7 and 8 both drew maps of the
bedroom they shared without including the other’s bed. However, their accounts of
their maps coupled with a semi-structured interview technique allowed the interviewer
to follow-up on teens’ explanations in ways that exposed the omission and gave the
investigator the opportunity to reflect on the more accurate information of how the
space was used and what the omission might reveal.
The mixed-methods included in this study were demonstrated to be fruitful to an
exploration of the complex social and physical space of the family household. While this
mixed-method approach could be problematic to research intended to provide an
objective conclusion about specific practices, the multiplicity of methods was
appropriate for an exploratory study meant to discover fruitful areas of new research.
Pragmatic Contributions and Recommendations
This project contributes to LIS by helping to extend the boundaries past the
“discursive formations” (Weigand, 1999) that have limited the field’s ability to

221
understand individuals’ information behavior in the modern information environment.
This dissertation demonstrates the benefits of understanding information activties as
including all types of social and communicative ICT activities, as well as traditonally
informative ones. It also demonstrates the advantages of considering the constellation
of ICTs that are routinely used, and the structures that must be negotiated. The family
context provided a framework of physical and social structures that shaped what teens
understood as appropriate and inappropriate ICT content and interactions, the level of
agency they believed themselves to have, and their personal priorities. This project’s
results also affirm the significance of an information practice stance that goes beyond
the traditional understanding of information behavior as purposive information seeking
(Williamson, 1998). Teens’ practices included strategies to negotiate devices, physical
spaces, Internet access, SM, ICT content and interactions, social worlds, and parental
authority in relation to ICTs, but these practices were embedded in their everyday lives
and manifested as they became relevant. Participants’ ability to negotiate these
structures to their advantage influenced their level of access and their ability to meet
the ICT expectations of their social worlds. Savolainen has defined one of the important
facets of everyday life information seeking (ELIS) to be “the mastery of everyday life”
(1995, p. 264). However, while there has been important work about specific issues
such as adolescents’ use of heroin information (Todd, 1999), the use of information in
the LGBTQ process of coming out (Hamer, 2003; Mehra & Braquet, 2007), career
planning (Julien, 1996), and urban teens’ information needs (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell,
2006a; 2006b), there has been little research of their interactions with information

222
across devices, platforms, time, and contexts as they go about their daily lives. This is
the case despite the fact that teens’ information interactions are understood to
intersect with their social behavior (Foss et al., 2013; Ito, et al., 2008; Meyers et al.,
2009), and that teens’ parents (Meyers, et al., 2009) and peers have been found to
influence how they interact with information (Foss et al., 2013). By utilizing Chatman’s
notion of information behavior and integrating elements from Silverstone’s et al (1989,
1992) work on the domestication of technology and Nardi and O’Day’s (1999) concept
of information ecologies, this dissertation was able to distinguish a typology of some of
the particular ways that parents influenced teens’ ICT practices and another of practices
that served as the basis for teens’ family small world ICT negotiation and helped to
constitute their PEIs. It also provides insight into the ways their practices are socioenacted (Lloyd, 2012), and must be negotiated as they cross the boundaries of their
social worlds and manage their varying ICT expectations (see also Burnett, 2015 for
discussion of information worlds) utelizing their own understandings and priorities.
Their practices were socio-enacted but they were also influenced by their own proactive
natures (Sonnenwald, 1999) and creativity. Many researchers have demonstrated that
information literacy goes beyond access (Hargittai, 2010; Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008;
Livingstone, 2004; Van Dijk, 2012; Yuen, Park, & Chen, 2016), but the results from this
dissertation suggest teens’ family small world ICT practices, including both the physical
and social structures the family imposes, should be a measure of teen digital literacy
because data analysis revealed that the negotiation had a significant influence on the
extension of their PEIs.

223
This research also contributes to the importance of including physical space in
LIS research. Though researchers have long shown that locality and context influence
individuals’ information interactions (Chatman, 1996, 1999, 2000; Dervin, 1999; Nardi &
O’Day, 1999; Pettigrew, 1996), there is little understanding of how individuals’ presence
and movement through physical space relates to information use. This study’s results
substantiate findings that the context of physical space had an influence on teens’ use
of ICTs in the home (Ling & Thrane, 2001; Kawser & Brush, 2013). Data analysis
revealed that adolescents used ICTs differently and interacted with different
information when they were alone than they did when they were sharing physical
space. Participants also had strategies for moving through physical space in response to
their immediate environment, the other people that were present, and the context that
was unfurling within that moment, that allowed them to use the spaces according to
their needs.
This research also affirms findings that a variety of contextual factors contribute
to ICT practices and information inequality beyond socio-economic status (Hargittai &
Hinnant, 2008; Yu & Zhou’s, 2016) and broad cultural factors, such as ethnicity. While
there is some research within LIS dedicated to minority groups (Agosto & HughesHassell, 2006a, 2006b; Meyers et al., 2009), and immigrants (Fisher, Durrance, & Hinton,
2004; Lingel, 2011), Latino/a families or adolescents have rarely been of focus. This
dissertation contributes knowledge towards filling this gap, by identifying ICT practices
by parents and teens that were connected with their being members of Latino/a

224
immigrant families, but it was also able to construe culture in a way that went beyond
ethnicity that might be useful to cultural research within the field.
This section has described the contribution this study makes to LIS, the following
sections will discuss the limitations of the dissertation.
Limitations. While this dissertation takes a mixed-methods approach, with rich
data that has informed robust findings leading to both theoretical and pragmatic
contributions, there were a number of limitations inherent in its exploratory design. To
explore parental mediation and teens’ ICT practices in the Latino/a family context a
primarily qualitative mixed-methods study was designed that would provide insight into
the technological culture. This approach took into consideration the variety of ICTs that
teens and their families used as a part of their everyday lives and the spaces of the
household in which they used them. The multi-perspective interviews and mapping
activity provided a broad holistic understanding of the issues underlying the household
information ecology, but the absence of observational data weakened the researcher’s
ability to fully grasp the contextual richness of the families’ everyday interactions
around ICTs. The analysis was also constrained from a lack of data concerning the
relationship between parents’ practices and physical space, as parents, unlike teens,
were not asked to draw maps and explain them. Considering the significance physical
space played in teens’ practices, it would have been useful to have this data for the sake
of comparison. In addition, the exploration of multiple variables limited the ability of

225
the researcher to understand and full describe the intricacies of any one of these
factors.
Though the study was never meant to be representative, the small sample of
eight families might also have hindered its ability to ascertain the full spectrum of teens’
family small world practices, especially considering that the families that participated all
conveyed fairly harmonious relationships and the adolescents did not demonstrate
many of the online privacy behaviors exhibited in the literature (e.g. boyd, 2014; Grinter
& Palen, 2002; Ito, 2005; Marwick & boyd, 2014; Vickery, 2015). Additionally, selfselection bias could have been a factor due to the volunteer aspect of assembling the
sample (Costigan & Cox, 2001; Robinson, 2014). Participants that were interested in the
subject matter might have been more inclined to participate. Also, it was parents,
rather than teens, that volunteered their families in all but one of the families (F6) and
the study was limited to participants from a small geographic area.
Furthermore, demand characteristic bias might have played a role in how
parents and teens responded to the interview questions (Orne, 2009). Parental
mediation has been found to be an area of modern parenting on which parents expect
they will be judged (Hoover et al., 2004) and parents might have adjusted their
responses to what they felt the investigator wanted or was expecting to hear. Teens
might also have interpreted the interviewer as an authority figure and limited their
responses to ones they felt were socially acceptable. For instance, two teens that were

226
described looking at porn by their mothers never mentioned it within their own
interviews.
The cultural heritage of the investigator may also have influenced her
interpretation of the data, in that the author has a subjective perspective based on the
particular context of her upbringing. The author is light-skinned woman of Latin
American decent who was born in Colombia and was raised mostly in the U.S. by her
Colombian father and Spanish-Speaking American mother. The investigator went back
and forth from the U.S. to Colombia during her childhood, but was raised and educated
mostly in the U.S., though she did a year of primary school and a semester of college in
Colombia. Her parents worked in social services and earned graduate degrees during
her childhood. These experiences and her identification as Latina may have shaped her
understanding of Latino/a and family culture as well as parenting, and by extension the
analysis she developed for this dissertation.
In addition, the investigator conducted all of the interviews, data collection, and
analysis of the data, which may have limited the range of the analysis. Also, because of
restrictions on time and resources that contributed to the researcher’s choice to use
geographic proximity as a factor in selecting the sample, all of the participants were
recruited from the Lehigh Valley area, specifically Allentown, which could have
influenced the results of the data collection and limited the dissertation.
Fourteen of the interviews in this dissertation were conducted in Spanish and
then transcribed by the Investigator and a Spanish speaking research assistant. The

227
translations that were included in the dissertation were all translated by the author.
The investigator aimed for the translations to be as close to verbatim as possible, while
still communicating the intended meaning. There are limitations to translations (Venuti,
1995) and to the use of only one translator. However, there is a reasonable expectation
that they were accurate as the investigator is fluent in written and spoken Spanish and
is confident that she was able to understand utterances (including colloquial
expressions) and express herself in a way that was easily comprehended by the Spanish
speaking participants.
This section has discussed the limitations to the study. The following section will
explore its implications and make suggestions for further study.
Implications and Further Study
The results of this study revealed a host of useful knowledge about the Latino/a
family context in relation to ICTs. It demonstrated the breadth of influence parents’
social and material ICT mediation practices had on teens and the interconnection
between those practices and the ICT practices that teens had incorporated into their
routines. It provided evidence that adolescents were constrained by the various
structures the family imposed, but that they also actively negotiated their use of ICTs to
meet their needs. The large role that teens’ needs played in the negotiation of their
PEIs deserves more focused exploration. It might be beneficial to incorporate selfdetermination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) in a future study to probe how power,
control, and autonomy fit into the parent/teen dynamic. It would also be beneficial, for

228
the sake of conceptual clarity, if a future study was able to construct a measure of the
extension of teens’ PEIs that took the social, structural, and personal aspects of their
lives into account. Though other researchers have conceptualized different versions of
the PEI (Jarvelin, 2011; Burnett, 2015, Yu & Zhou, 2016), this analysis demonstrates, that
any framework that measures teens’ PEIs should include a measure of their actual use
of available ICTs and of their ability to negotiate them to meet the expectations of their
main social worlds.
Adolescents’ access should also be addressed in terms that go beyond simple
device availability or technical competence (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008). It is significant
that three teens in the study (T3, 7, and 8) chose to use their phones as their primary
access point to the Internet, despite having physical access to other devices. Connecting
to the Internet primarily through phones has been found to compromise the quality or
sophistication of ICT interactions (Pearce & Rice, 2008; Smith, 2015), and teens’ rational
for these types of choices should be explored.
The findings from this project also suggest parents’ negotiation of their ICTs was
influenced by their social worlds. For instance, some parents reported or were reported
being influenced by family and/or friends’ judgements about the appropriateness of
their teens’ posts to SM. It would be interesting for a study to explore the ramifications
of the intersection between their social networks and their practices on SM. For
instance, Teen 8’s father acknowledged that that their daughter helped them to
negotiate his and his wife’s participation on SM. His comment hints that Latino/a and

229
immigrant teens may be responsible for managing more than their own participation on
SM. There was also some evidence that adolescents use SM to connect relationally with
parents and other family members, both online and offline. These practices extend
beyond evasive techniques that have generally been the focus of any discussion that
includes parents in this type of research (e.g. boyd, 2014; Grinter & Palen, 2002; Ito,
2005; Marwick & boyd, 2014; Vickery, 2015).
It was striking how involved parents and teens were in one another’s ICT
interactions. Even beyond parents’ rules and restrictive practices, parents actively
influenced teens by discussing ICT related issues, providing them with help, and
explicitly and implicitly encouraging certain types of ICT use. Likewise, adolescents
spent a good deal of time helping their parents with ICTs and brokering their
interactions. The provision of all of this help has important implications for research on
adolescents’ everyday life information practices, as well as research on families’ use of
ICTs. While there has been some investigation of parent/teen boundary negotiation
(Burke, Adamic, & Marciniak, 2013; Child & Westermann, 2013; Cranor et al., 2014;
Erickson et al., 2015; Livingstone, Ólafsson, O’Neill, & Donoso, 2012; Sorbring & Lundin,
2012) there has been little investigation of the reciprocal practices that teens and
parents provide for one another and how they influence one another from an
information literacy perspective.
The dialogic quality of parents’ and teens’ ICT practices as revealed within the
directive narratives was another important finding. It would be beneficial for

230
researchers to do sense-making interviews (Dervin, 1999) where parents and teens
discuss a particular interaction surrounding ICTs. These interviews should involve indepth discussion of their moment-to-moment interactions with their worlds that would
try to uncover any internal thoughts, ideas, desires, goals, and emotions that were
directly influencing how that person oriented themselves towards their information and
technology use. Suchman (1987) discusses the responsive nature of human action. She
says that “mutual intelligibility is achieved on each occasion of interaction in reference
to situation particulars, rather than be discharged once and for all by a stable body of
shared meaning” (Suchman, 1987, p.50-51). Moreover, because the dialogical process
was also found to happen over time, it would be interesting to concentrate on how
parents’ and teens’ practices evolved in relation to one another. To do this, a
longitudinal study could be devised where researchers interviewed or surveyed teens
and parent participants once each year, or multiple times, over the course of the teens’
adolescence.
Finally, the connection between narratives, beliefs, and practices that was found
in the study opens up a methodological framework that identifies new areas of interest
and could broaden how culture is studied within LIS. Narrative was very useful in
uncovering the particular culture of the participants’ families. It would be fruitful to use
narrative methodology to explore the dynamic between teens and their parents, that
was more focused on their narratives and interpretive repertoires (Silverman, 2001)
from the beginning. The individual and family narratives that parents and teens
conveyed in their interviews depicted their relationship to ICTS and to one another

231
surrounding ICTs. This method could be used to provide insight into the dynamics
between teens and parents and the reasons behind those dynamics as understood by
the participants. Narrative methodologies have been useful in studying families (ByngHall, 1973, 1979, 1988, 1999), organizations, places (Tuan, 1991), knowledge transfer
(Darwent, 2000), decision making (O'Connor, 1997), the construction of identity
(Czarniawska, 1997). They could also be useful for gaining more detailed understanding
of how narratives are implicated in parental decision making, teen rebellion against
their parents, and how knowledge is transferred between family members, among other
aspects of family interactions around information, communication, and technology.
Implications for practice. The finding that the Latino/a teens and their parents
both have a significant influence on one another’s ICT interactions in these immigrant
families has important implications for information and media literacy. It suggests that
it could be beneficial for literacy programs that serve one or the other of these two
populations to include some information literacy as a part of their curricula, as well as
instructive techniques that can be used to impart their newly acquired knowledge to
family members. Additonally, the use of narratives by family therapists (Byng-Hall,
1973, 1979, 1988, 1999) to create more functional interrelation family patterns reveals
that family, parent, and teen narratives could possibly be employed by practitioners to
promote more functional literacy and ICT practices in both populations.
Furthermore, considering how parents helped create teens’ awareness of what
resources were available and what ICT interactions were appropriate, public and school
libraries should consider providing instruction about the extent of the resources that are

232
available online and include recreational, social, and interest driven applications that go
beyond what the field generally considers information to expand their exposure. School
and public libraries often put technical restrictions on interactions with the Internet that
compound the restrictions that children and adolescents already experience. Technical
restrictions need to be reconsidered in light of how teens’ information behaviors are
understood to cross the boundaries of their online social interactions (Meyers et al,
2009; Ito et al., 2008) and that using ICTs to explore their personal interests have been
found to be beneficial (Ito et al. 2008; Tripp, 2011).
Conclusion
This dissertation was meant to explore teens ’ICT practices in relation to their
parents’ mediation and the family context in a way that contributed to everyday life
information seeking research and provided insight on the particular practices that
evolved in Latino/a families. It used a social constructivist information practices
approach that would allow consideration of teens’ communicative and recreation
practices as information activities. Analysis was thus based on accepted understandings
within the literature that information use is dependent on context and that it can be
assembled from a variety of sources and intersects with social life activities, through a
variety of devices, mediums, formats, and applications (Chatman, 1996, 1999, 2000;
Pettigrew, 1996; Savolainen, 2007; Williamson, 1998). The mixed-method design
permitted a collection of a variety of perspectives of the parent/ teen dynamic around
ICTs and analysis revealed the complex social and physical spaces in the participating
Puerto Rican and Dominican family households. The combination of methods enabled

233
parents and teens’ practices to be viewed from the context of the other, which helped
to better explain their individual positions and the family dynamic.
This dissertation moves the exploration of teens’ and parents’ relationships in
relation to ICTs away from privacy towards information influence, interaction,
negotiation, and culture. Research on parents and teens has often focused on conflict
and privacy evasion or invasion (boyd, 2011; Ledbetter et al., 2010), however analysis of
the enthnographic type data collected for this dissertation suggests that it would be
more accurate to frame teens and parents’ practices as a dialectical process where
information disclosure and use are negotiated and renegotiated over time in relation to
one another and their roles within the technological culture of the home. Considering
parents’ and teens’ practices in relationsip help more accurately represent their
individual practices and their motivations.
Despite the strong focus the dissertation initially took on privacy and the
research protocols’ emphasis on questions concerning privacy and conflict, the results
seem to indicate very little conflict and a high level of familial negotiation at the time of
the interviews. This of course may have something to do with demand characteristic
bias, but the teen participants, especially, seemed to enjoy the process of
communicating about their lives and providing detailed answers that indicated they
were trying to be as accurate as possible. Though they may not have expressed content
they used that they felt was embarrasing, most of their descriptions concerned fairly
mundane descriptions of daily practices that were probably less subject to an internal
need to respond in a specific way.

234
While it has long been understood that parents and teens relationships are not
filled with as much conflict as is generally protrayed in the popular media (Smetana et
al., 2006), this dissertation indicates that the Puerto Rican and Dominican teens had a
stronger bond with their families and more deference to parental authority than has
generally been found for majority culture teens. Though, this was a small sample with a
great deal of demographic variety, it is striking how synchronized the findings across the
sample were. Among the families there was a strong differentiation of social roles and
the teens overwhelmingly described and were described abiding by parents rules and
deferring to their authority. This was true in homes in which teens had more familial
responsibilities and across the variations of parenting practices that parents used, from
those that were more permissive to those that were more authoritarian. In addition,
the teens did not describe viewing parents’ restrictions or monitoring as outside their
parents’ parental rights or express negative feelings about their parents’ mediation.
They also discussed few practices for evading or hiding information from parents.
Openess in their ICT activities was found to be a distinct practice that participants used
to negotiate their relationships with parents and it was a reciprocal process with parents
describing giving their teens more autonomy when teens were open with them and they
did not percieve that they were hiding anything.
The variability of the sample make it difficult to propose rationale for the lack of
conflict or teen ICT evasion in these homes. Overall, teens seemed to shape their
practices in relation with their parents’ expectations of them, which seemed to lead to
less conflict. There are a variety of reasons they might have been more likely to do this

235
than their majority culture counterparts. For instance, it is possible that, in general,
Latino/a immigrant teens might interpret their parents’ mediation differently and have a
stronger “family orientation” (Clark & Sywyj, 2012; Veliz-Moran, 2016). Latino
adolescent have been found to have a strong sense of family obligations (Villalobos &
Smetana, 2012) and this type of “familism” leads to conflict avoidance in Latino/a
families (Marín & Marín, 1991). However, it was also clear that the adolescents’
practices were grounded within the particular combinations of their experiences, such
as socio-economic status, parental English and technological proficiency and educational
status, neighborhoods, and living arrangements. Teens involvement in their parents’
acculturation and the sustainment of their family routines appeared to make them more
aware of the difficulties inherent in their parents’ experiences and more likely to show
respect and deference for them. Their descriptions of their practices demonstrated that
they were aware of their parents’ weaknesses and vulnerabilities and sensitive to their
hardships, such as the long hours their parents needed to work and their unpredictable
schedules. For some teens this sensitivity may have facilitated their ability to negotiate
the ICT social norms of their family lives and those of their other social worlds. The
findings showed that teens’ information practices (see Appendix G for the full Teen
Family Small World ICT Practices typology) were constrained by physical barriers and by
what they believed was possible within the confines of the family social structure, but
that participants also used their resources to manage their circumstances in ways that
helped them to pursue their priorities; principally maintaining the balance of their
family relationship, participating in their social worlds, and engaging with ICTs in ways

236
that helped them to explore their personal interests. It appeared that the facility and
creativity with which they were able to do this influenced their ability to meet their own
needs and the overall extension of their PEIs. It is hoped that the typology of practices
that was developed in this dissertation will demonstrate the importance of familial
contextual factors to teens’ everyday life information behaviors and that this connection
will continue to be explored.
In addition, it is hoped that this dissertation will make a significant contribution
to LIS literature through its exploration of parental mediation as the practices by which
parents influence their children’s information interactions. Scholars have identified that
parents are a significant influence and barrier on children’s information and
communication activities (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2005; O’Connor et al. 2013; Foss et
al, 2013; Meyers et al., 2009), but little is known about their specific practices. This
dissertation reveals that parents provide structures of access to devices, and implicit
and explicit rules, mediation, and encouragement that seemed to be linked with their
personal and family narratives and their beliefs about parenting and technology. The
mediation practices they chose to use and how they were integrated into their everyday
routine seemed to be directed by narratives that stemmed from their personal contexts
and framed how they appoached the world, their parental responsibilities, and the
practices they developed. The overwhelming occurrence of ICT parenting practices
suggests these practices should be studied in and of themselves and in realtion to
children’s practices.

237
The relevance of parents’ practices and the underlying system of beliefs and
stories to teens’ ICT use suggests that this type of influence should be further explored.
Exactly how parents influence their teens’ ICT habits is a critical question, especially
considering that the participating teens did not venture very far outside the boundaries
their parents set for them on content. They also generally reported habitually visiting
the same few websites each day and, for some, even the use of a basic search engine
seemed outside of their routine. While parental mediation was intertwined with
parenting practices, the very limited amount of help and encouragement to explore
given to their teens was surprising. This finding suggests that these parents were not
taking advantage of the range of educational and developmental opportunities on the
Internet, or taking a lead role in exposing their children to the variety of content
available. Having access, freedom, and/or more educated parents did not necessarily
lead to more encouragement or teens’ proficiency or advantageuous use. Also
authoritative parenting, which is generally connected with positive outcomes
(Baumrind, 1989, 1993), did not necesarily relate to technological competence and/or
extended PEIs. The most extensive PEIs reported in their survey and interviews for
three teens (T3, 5, and 6) had the fewest time restrictions and the highest overall use of
ICTs. These teens discussed seeking more varied information online from more sources
and had more clearly used ICTs to build competence in their personal areas of interest.
Additionally, teens with parents with less education, English proficiency, and technology
skills had also developed some competencies to fill that role. Level of use, however, is
not necessarily connected with the quality and competence of use and in truth it was

238
challenging to assess the extent of teens’ PEIs or their competency from the limited
survey data that was collected or interview accounts. Analysis of interview data
demonstrated that parents and the family context influnced teens’ interactions, but
they also exhibited the complexity of trying to connect demographic characteristics to
particular teen practices, as different attributes appeared to manifest in participants’
lives in diverse ways. Katz and Gonzalez (2016) have recently highlighted the need for
research on information equality to focus on how family and community contexts
contribute to the quality of teens’ access. This dissertation adds to the understanding of
adolescents’ everyday information behavior by identifying their family small world ICT
practices and drawing connections between these and broader debates on culture,
parenting, and information access, inequality, and literacy. The complexity underlying
the differences between the ICT competence that teens developed suggests that this
issue needs to be further considered from an intersectional approach that explores the
variety of instutional structures that influence the identities of Latino/a teens and
families (Zambrana, 2011).
This dissertation demonstrates the salience of parental mediation practices and
the family context as structural agents in teens’ ICT use and as research topics within
LIS. The findings show the relevance of ICT negotiation practices to teens’ overall
information use and help to extend what is understood about how their information
practices are embeddded in their everyday lives. It is the hope of the investigator that
this dissertation will make a lasting contribution to this critically important topic by
building bridges between the various literatures discussed in this dissertation

239
Appendix A
Major Findings for RQ 1
RQ 1. How do Latino/a parents mediate their teens’ Information Communication
Technolgy (ICT) practices?
1.1 Most of the specific parental ICT mediation practices demonstrated by the Latino/a
parents concur with the findings that have been established in the PM literature.
1.2 Parental ICT mediation was inextricably interwoven with general parenting practices.
1.3 Parents had rules and restrictions for teens in relation to ICTs that related directly to
their ICT use and others that were related to their concerns for teens’ health and safety
that indirectly influenced teens’ ICT use and interactions.
1.4 PM of ICT devices often concerned the use of the removal of personal devices as a
threat and a punishment. Parents used this strategy to procure teens compliance about
their ICT use, but also as a general parenting strategy.
1.5 The anticipation of occasional monitoring was used by parents as a way to provide
teens with autonomy, feel secure there was nothing to be concerned about, and as an
attempt to have teens internalize parents’ rules and restrictions so they would comply
of their own means.
1.6 Parents created a balance between the provision of privacy and monitoring.
1.7 Directive narratives were related to the ICT mediation practices that parents used
and to how family members experienced their reality.

240
1.8 Parents beliefs about parenting and technology were incorporated into their
parental directive narratives and influenced their ICT mediation practices.
1.9 Family, parent, and teen directive narratives influenced one another and were
constitutive of one another.
1.10 The polyphony of directive narratives contributed to the overall dynamic of the
technological culture that had evolved.
Major Findings for RQ 2
RQ 2. What practices do Latino/a teens use to negotiate their (ICT) interactions in
accordance with the small world of their family?
2.1 Teens’ membership in the small world of their families influenced how teens used
the resources that were available to them.
2.2 Teens’ presence in physical space influenced their interactions with ICTs.
2.3 Teens negotiated their use of ICTs in the physical space of the household to fulfill
their needs for personal space and social connections
2.4 Teens’ managed their ICT content and interaction in accordance with what they
believed their parents thought was appropriate.
2.5 Teens were involved in negotiating their parents and families’ ICT interactions.
2.6 Teens ownership of devices provided them with some autonomy and freedom
negotiating their resources.

241
2.7 Teens’ need to share or borrow devices influenced the likelihood of using them and
the extension of their personal information ecologies (PIE).
2.8 Teens had ICT related practices that were specifically connected to negotiating
parental authority
2.9 Teens’ described and were described complying with parents’ rules and restrictions
and respecting their authority.
2.10 Teens had a variety of practices to manage their social worlds in order to negotiate
their membership in the small world of their family.
2.11 The methods that teens used to negotiate the boundaries of their familial small
world in relation their other small worlds both increased and decreased the extension of
their PIEs.
2.12 Teens used mental frames to process their constraints in ways that made it easier
for teens to accept them
2.13 Teens had practices in relation to their friendships with their parents on social
media to negotiate the collapsed context of SM and connect with parents and family.

Interview Protocol for Teenagers
Thank you so much for meeting with me today. I am so happy to talk with you. I
have asked to meet with you because I am trying to learn more about how technology
and media are integrated into families’ everyday routines. I am especially interested in
learning about how families with teenagers negotiate the shared use of technologies,
the spaces of the family home, and the rules parents have for technology use in the
home and outside the home. I would especially like to use todays’ interview to explore
how you keep things private and create some personal space for yourself. I am hoping
today’s conversation will last about 60-90 mins. At this time, I want to remind you that
you do not need to answer any question that you do not want to answer and you can
stop the interview at any time. Also, do know that your identity and all your responses
will be kept confidential.
First, I want to say that when I ask about technology in general I’m using that to
mean any devices like tablets, mobile phones, gaming devices, laptops, any Internet,
social media, or app related activities, and even media content, such as TV shows,
music, movies, and ebooks. You should feel free to talk about any technology that
comes to mind when I ask about technology in general.
We are going to start with…
(1) Your favorite spaces to use technology
(2) Your least favorite spaces to use technology
(3) What you most like to do online or with your device

277
(4) How you try to create some privacy for yourself
(5) The ways that technology use is different in your family than in other
families

use it.
4) Do you mostly use this room when you’re alone or with others?
Do you tend to use (each circled tech item) in this room when you are alone or when
others are present?
Probe: In either case, when do you use (each circled tech item)? And what do you tend
to use (each circled tech item) for when you’re in this room?

7) Take me through your day starting from when you wake up paying attention to how
technology is integrated into your everyday routine. For instance, you might wake up
with a text message or an alarm on your phone, and then check your Facebook page and
so on…during school, after school, evening, bedtime?

Appendix F: Parental Mediation Typology
Parental Mediation Typology
Major Themes,
Subthemes, and
categories

Definition

Major Theme: Parental
ICT Mediation Practices

Based on Clark's (2011) understanding of parental
mediation as going beyond parental concerns over media
effects on their children. Includes parenting practices
that influence teens' relations with media and technology

Subtheme: Directive
narratives

Grounded on the Silverstone et al. (1989) concept of
family mythologies that described how the stories that
each family tells itself about itself that shape how
technologies become incorporated into the family’s small
world

Family directive
narratives

The narratives and accounts
"Yeah, we’re not a big fan
that participants express about
of technology" (Y, FI)
their identity as a family

Parent directive
narratives

"That's how I do it, yes,
yes. That's how I think I
care, that's the only way I
know that I could kinda
keep them from, you
know–especially my
oldest because like I said,
he's sixteen, you know, I
know they talk at school,
oh this weekend we're
goin' clubbing or we're
gonna go to the hookah
lounge or whatever the
case may be…yeah, you're
not goin' nowhere so
don't even think about it!
But I feel by allowing him
to do that and giving him
that freedom and
showing him that you
necessarily don’t have to

Narratives in which a parent
describes their personal
identity in relation to ICTs or
that express an idea of who
they are as parents

Example

294

be outside to have fun"
(M3, PI)

Teen directive narratives

Subtheme: Restrictive
mediation

Restrictions

Rules

Teen narratives about their
identities and/or priorities

"that's how people make
money with gaming and
that’s the step that I’m
taking too, is I’m a
professional gamer for
Gears of War" (T3, TI)

Parental guidelines developed for the home that relate to
ICT use
The development of practices
that specifically restrict teens’
interactions with ICTs (Gentile "Yeah, I try to give them
et al., 2012; Livingstone &
each an hour" (M2, PI)
Helsper, 2008; Nikken & Jansz,
2014).
“when they go to bed
Specific household rules that
they tell me…now turn it

of ICTs.
for school” (T6, TI)

295

Subtheme: Active
mediation

Active mediation has generally included parents’ discussion
with their teens about their ICT use (Eastin, Greenberg, &
Hofschire, 2006; Kirwil, 2009). The concept is extended
here to include other practices that involved parents’
active involvement with teens in relation to their ICT use.

Discussions about use

Discussions parents have with
their teenage children about
their ICT use

Help or understanding

References to parents helping
teens with ICTs

Active co-use

Actively using ICTs with
children. Builds on research
that has described co-suing
and co-playing 2002, 2008;
Joiw et al., 2016; Nikken &
Jansz, 2003, 2006; Shin & Huh,
2011

Encourage exploration

The explicit ways that that
parents were described
promoting the use of ICT
activities to teens

Practices that referred to
parents' providing alternative
Alternative suggestions or
suggestions or activities for
activities
teens as Eklund and Bergmark
(2013) have demonstrated.

"Well, it was work for him
and it was hard and we
have talked a lot about
that because that does a
lot of harm to youth"
(M4, PI, trans)
"he’s a big help and he’s
a big influence, he tells
me a lot about certain
things and all that when it
comes to technology" (T3,
TI)
"Like me and my mom go
into like, what could we
do for the house and we
look up things like that,
and for some reason I find
that really entertaining
because like, oh that
would look cute on this
wall, oh…so we do that
together" (T2, TI)
“[y]eah, she's like, [you],
go to YouTube and find
useful videos of what
they're teaching you in
school to keep yourself,
cause I'm not a big
numbers person, but she
wants me to” (T2, TI)
“always when I go out to
the store and I see a book
I bring him a book,
because before he liked
to read” (M5, PI, trans)

296

Subtheme: Devices

Choices about devices

ICT removal as threat or
punishment

Subtheme: Parental
monitoring

Supervision

Mediation practices that were focused on the material
technologies teens interacted with.
Teen: "mom she felt as if I
was responsible enough
to do it, but at the time it
wasn’t, like I had my
phone you know with

didn’t?
TEEN 3: "yeah, it was just
like a $30-dollar plan just
keep my phone on to call
her or whenever and
stuff" (T3, TI).
Warren (2001) has found that
parents use restrictive

or threat to promote some
trans)
type of behavior
The ongoing monitoring of the websites that their children
visit and their online communications (e.g., chat messages
and social networking activities) (Livingstone & Helsper,
2008). Researchers have called for a need for more
research on this aspect of mediation (Eastin et al., 2006;
Kirwil, 2009; Nikken & Jansz, 2003, 2006; Oosting et al.,
2008)
Based on Nikken and Jansz
(2016) concept of supervision
and includes the casual
monitoring of teens in the
general physical vicinity in
order to confirm that nothing
of concern is being done.

"this is where we mainly
spend our time so I could
monitor them more when
I'm here (trans)" (M2, PI)

297

Based on the Ledbetter et al.
(2010) concept of verbal
invasions. It included
references to parents asking
teens who they are talking to
and what they are doing.

"Yes, I investigate too.
What are you doing? Let
me look. Who are you
talking to? "(M4, PI, trans)

ICT device or accounts

Based on the Ledbetter et al.
(2010) concepts of telephone
and computer invasions. It
included monitoring ICT
devices, Internet histories,
online accounts, etc.

"I don’t ask her who she’s
talking to or anything, I
just see the page that
they were using, Kik, or
Messenger, or WhatsApp,
when they talk what she
says to see if they talk in
good terms, how she
presents herself, if she
knows how to defend
herself from any
questions her friends ask"
(M1, PI, trans)

Subtheme: Privacy

Extends the Padilla-Walker et al. (2012) concept of
deference. This includes parental practices that grant
children personal space based on trust

Autonomy

“before we were really on

Appendix H: Sample Consent Forms
PARENTAL INFORMED CONSENT
Your children are invited to participate in a research study entitled IN PLAIN VIEW:
LATINO/A TEENS’ USE OF ICTS TO CONSTRUCT PRIVACY IN THE FAMILY CONTEXT. This
study is being conducted by Stefani Gomez, who is a doctoral student in the
Communication, Information and Library Studies Ph. D. Program at Rutgers University.
The purpose of this research is to explore how teens integrate technology, such as cell
phones, laptops, computers, Facebook, etc., into the everyday routines of their families.
About 6-8 families and 18-35 subjects will participate in the study. Each stage of the study
will last approximately:
10-15 minutes -Survey of family members (Children 8 and older)
60-90 minutes -Family interview (Children under 14 and over 16)
25-50 minutes over two weeks - Photo-elicitation (PEI) (Parents and 14-16-year-old
teens)
60- 90 minutes – Parent interview (Parents)
60-90 minutes – Teen Interview (14-16-year-old teens)
And each individual's participation will last approximately:
90-120 mins for family members besides participating parents and 14-16-year-old teens.

309

3-4hr over the course of two weeks for participating 14-16-year-old teens
3-4hr over the course of two weeks for parents
The study procedures include:
•

All family members eight and older will be asked to fill out a survey that

collects basic demographic information. Participants will also be asked to check
off where in there house they use different technologies, like cell phones, laptops,
computers, Facebook, etc. and kids will also indicate in where in their house they
do certain activities like, homework, google searches, texting, etc.
o

Children living in the household in between the ages of 8-13 will be

allowed to participate in the survey and family interview with parental
consent, but they will not be interviewed individually.
•

The family as a whole will be interviewed about how their family uses

technologies, like cell phones, laptops, computers, Facebook, etc. The family
interview will be audio-recorded.
o

Children under eight will also be allowed to participate in the family

interview with parental consent, but will not be asked to fill out a survey
or be interviewed individually
•

Each parent will also be asked to take pictures and/or short videos that

illustrate prompts and email or text them to the investigator over the course of a
week.

310

•

14-16-year old teens will also be asked to take pictures and/or short videos

that illustrate prompts and email or text them to the investigator over the course
of a week.
•

Parents will be interviewed together. The photos and/or short videos they

emailed during the time between the family interview and their interview will be
used to direct the individual interview. Your photos and interview responses will
not be shared with your child.
•

14-16-year old teens will be interviewed. The photos and/or short videos

they emailed during the time between the family interview and their interview
will be used to direct the individual interview. Your teen’s photos and responses
to the individual interview will not be shared with you unless your child shares
something makes us worried for his /her safety or someone else’s.
This research is confidential. Confidential means that the research records will include
some information about your child/children and this information will be stored in such a
manner that some linkage between your/your child’s/children’s identity and the response
in the research exists. Some of the information collected about your child/children
includes Information concerning age, gender, ethnicity, race, marital status, education
level, employment, the devices, such as cell phones, laptops, computers, Facebook, and
other social media that are owned and/or accessed, and where they are accessed will be
collected in the survey.

311

Please note that we will keep this information confidential by limiting individual's access
to the research data and keeping it in a secure location. All digital Images, short videos,
interview recordings, and transcripts will be stored under pseudonyms and be kept on a
password protected computer that is kept in the researcher’s locked home office.
Participant contacts and the images and short videos that are sent by text message to the
researcher will be stored by pseudonyms in the researcher’s phone and the phone will be
both password and fingerprint protected. Hard copies of the interview transcripts, and
any participant elicited images will also be stored under pseudonyms and be kept in a
locked cabinet in the researcher’s locked home office. Consent and assent forms will be
stored in separate locked cabinet. The linking list that links participants’ names with the
pseudonyms that will be used in the research will be kept in a different locked cabinet
than the consent and assent forms in the researcher’s advisor’s office at Rutgers.
The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only
parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. We will
not share your 14-16-year-old’s photos or interview responses with you, except in certain
rare cases where your child or someone else is felt to be in danger. In some situations, it
may be necessary for the researcher to break confidentiality. If any photo or video is
suspected to depict bullying, we will need to discuss it with you and if someone seems to
be in danger the appropriate authorities as well. If your child threatens to harm
themselves or another person or reports any incidents of child or elder abuse (or if it is
strongly suspected), then the investigator is required to notify the appropriate

312

authorities. Also, your child should not send any nude photos. Nude photos of minors
will need to be reported to the appropriate authorities. Your child should also not send
us photos/videos or tell us any information about current, past or future crimes that are
either unknown and/or crimes that they have been convicted of and/or not been charged
with, or crimes that they may currently be participating in, as such information about
these crimes may have to be reported to the appropriate authorities.
If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional
conference, only group results will be stated. If something relating to your child is
discussed a pseudonym will be used. All study data will be kept for 10 years. After 10
years all the research data will be deleted and destroyed.
It is anticipated that there will be minimal risk as a result of participation in this research.
There is some risk that your family will uncover differences of opinion about technology
in the family interview that might cause some conflict, but we will attempt to minimize
this risk by avoiding any topics that seem contentious or cause discomfort. If a subject
does become upset or emotional while describing their family’s or their own personal
practices the researcher will move on to a different question or if the participant prefers
the interview and data collection will be stopped. The following is a list of counseling
services that can be contacted if a subject feels that it is needed.

El equipo de investigación y de la Junta de Revisión Institucional de la Universidad de
Rutgers son las únicas que se permitirá ver los datos, excepto si lo requiere la ley. No
vamos a compartir fotos o videos de su hijo de 14-16 años de edad o respuestas de la
entrevista con usted, excepto en cierto caso raro en que aparece que su hijo o alguna
otra persona están en peligro. En algunas situaciones, puede ser necesario para el
investigador romper la confidencialidad. Si se sospecha que cualquier foto o vídeo
representa la intimidación, tendremos que discutirlo con usted, y si alguien parece estar
en peligro, a las autoridades apropiadas también. Si su hijo amenaza con hacer daño a sí
mismo o a otra persona o informe de cualquier incidente de abuso de niños o personas
mayores (o si se sospecha fuertemente), el investigador tiene la obligación de notificar a
las autoridades correspondientes. Su hijo (o hijos) nunca debe tomar una foto/video que
demuestra alguien desnudo. Fotos/videos que demuestran individuales menores de
edad desnudos, tendrán que ser reportados a las autoridades correspondientes.
Además, su hijo (o hijos) no debe decir nos cualquier información acerca de los crímenes
pasados y futuros que se desconocen y / o delitos de que han sido condenadas y / o de
que no han sido acusados , como tal información sobre estos crímenes pasados o
futuros pueden tener que ser reportado a las autoridades correspondientes.
Si se publica un informe de este estudio, o los resultados se presentan en una
conferencia profesional, se presentará los resultados del grupo. Si algo relacionado con
su hijo (o hijos) se discute, se utilizará un seudónimo. Todos los datos del estudio se
mantendrán durante 10 años. Después de 10 años todos los datos de la investigación
serán eliminados y destruidos.

325

Se anticipa que participación en esta investigación habrá un riesgo mínimo. Existe un
cierto riesgo de que su familia va a descubrir diferencias de opinión en la entrevista de
la familia que puedan causar algún conflicto. Vamos evitar cualquier tema que parece
polémico o causa malestar para minimizar este riesgo. Si un sujeto se convierte en
molesto emocional, durante la entrevista de su familia o de la entrevista individual con
el investigador puede pasar a una pregunta diferente, o si lo prefiere, parar la entrevista
y recolección de datos. La siguiente es una lista de los servicios de asesoramiento que
pueden ser contactados si un sujeto siente que es necesario.

ASSENT FOR MINORS’ PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
This assent form may contain words that you do not understand. Please ask the
researcher or your parent to explain any words or information that you do not clearly
understand before signing this document.
1.

Ms. Gomez is inviting you to take part in his/her research study. Why is this

study being done? We want to understand how teenagers use their cell phones,
laptops, computers, Facebook, and other devices.
We want to find out how the ideas families have about these technologies influence the
ways teenagers use them.
It’s completely up to you! Both you and your parents have to agree to allow you to take
part in this study. If you choose to not take part in this study, we will honor that choice.
No one will get angry or upset with you if you don’t want to do this. If you agree to take
part in it and then you change your mind later, that’s OK too. It’s always your choice!
2.
•

What will happen:
(This activity is only for kids that are 8 years old and older) First, you will fill out

a survey that asks you some questions like how old you are, if you share a bedroom, and
in what parts of your house you use different devices like TV, computer, laptop, cell
phones and what parts of your house you do homework, search on google, go on
Facebook, etc. This part should take about 10-15 minutes. (Only those over seven will
fill out this survey)

334

•

(All kids can participate) Then you will hangout with your family and Ms. Gomez

in your home and talk about all the ways your family uses the TV, computer, laptop, cell
phones, and other devices. We’ll also talk about what rules your parents have for you.
This conversation should take about 60-90 minutes (all family members will participate)
•

(This activity is only for 14-16-year-old teens) During the meeting with your

family, Ms. Gomez will set up an appointment to talk with you again, at a convenient
time, sometime in the following two weeks. During this individual interview she will ask
you about the ways you use different technologies, such as your cell phone, computer,
laptop, and social media, such as Facebook and Snapchat during your everyday life.
Before your interview you should think about what we talked about with your family
and send Ms. Gomez photos or short videos that you think show the following five
situations. This activity should take about an hour over the course of two weeks. (This
activity is only for 14-16-year-old teens)

(1)

Your favorite spaces to use technology

(2)

Your least favorite spaces to use technology

(3)

What you most like to do online or with your device

(4)

How you try to create some privacy for yourself

(5)

The ways that technology use is different in your family than in other families

335

•

(This activity is only for 14-16-year-old teens) While you are taking these photos

or short videos please try not to get other people in your pictures or videos, especially
kids. If you think it’s very important to what you want to show in your pic or video to
have people in it, ask the people to face away from the camera. This part of the project
should take about 30-60 minutes over the course of a week. (This activity is only for 1416-year-old teens)
•

(This activity is only for 14-16-year-old teens) During the appointment with Ms.

Gomez to talk alone you’ll talk about your photos and why you took them. Then she will
ask you to fill in a map that shows where in your house different technology devices (ie.
TV, laptop, desktop computer, mobile phone) are located and used. After that she will
also ask you more questions about the map and how you use your devices, such as, cell
phones, laptops, computers, etc. throughout the day. This meeting should be just like a
conversation you would have with your friends or family and there are no right or wrong
answers. The conversations should last about 60-90 minutes. (This activity is only for
14-16-year-old teens)
•

(Everyone) You can skip any question you want to or stop either interview at

any time. You can also ask Ms. Gomes to delete any photos or videos you change your
mind about.

3.

What does it cost and how much does it pay?

336

You don’t pay anything to take part in this study. We will provide pizza for you and your
family to eat during the family conversation. We will pay 14-16-year-old teens a 15dollar gift card to make up for the time it takes them to take the pictures and videos and
we will give them another 15-dollar gift card to make up for the time it takes you to talk
alone with Ms. Gomez in your individual interview. If you choose to dropout before the
end of the project, you will receive the compensation for the part of the project in which
you took part.
Family Interview – Pizza (Everyone)
Photos – $15 gift card (This activity is only for 14-16-year-old teens)
Individual interview – $15 gift card (This activity is only for 14-16-year-old teens)
4.
There are very few risks in taking part in this research, but the following things
could happen:

Probably: Nothing bad would happen.
Maybe: Your answers would be seen by somebody not involved in this study. We will do
our absolute best to keep all of your contributions private. Your answers will be kept
locked up and we will call you by a pseudonym (a different name) within the research.
The people who work for us are very well trained and understand the importance of
confidentiality. We will not share your photos or anything you say during your interview
with your parents, except in certain rare cases. For instance, if the researchers learn

337

that you or someone else are in serious danger they would have to tell an appropriate
family member, such as your mother, father, or caretaker or the appropriate officials to
protect you and other people.
Very unusual: You could become upset talking about your family’s technology routines
or the reasons behind them. If this should occur, remember that you don’t have to
answer any questions you don’t want to and either you or a member of the research team
may choose to stop the project or the interviews at any time. While it is not likely, if you
become so upset that you feel it is necessary to speak with someone, the numbers and
addresses to a few counselors in the area have been provided below.

5.

Are there any benefits that you or others will get out of being in this study?

All research must have some potential benefit either directly to those that take part in it
or potentially to others through the knowledge gained. The only direct benefit to you
may be the compensation that you receive for your participation and the enjoyment of
listening to the stories and answering the questions, but you also might learn a lot about
how you and your family use technology.
6.

CONFIDENTIALITY: We will do everything we can to protect the confidentiality

of your records. This research is confidential. The research records will include some
information about you and this information will be stored in such a manner that some
linkage between your identity and your responses exists. We will keep this information
confidential by limiting other people’s access to the research and keeping it in a secure

339

location. All digital Images, short videos, interview recordings, and transcripts that are
collected will be stored under a different name and be kept on a password protected
computer located in the researcher’s locked home office. Your contact information and
the images and short videos that you send to the researcher will be stored under a
different name in the researcher’s phone and the phone will be both password and
fingerprint protected. Hard copies of the images and interviews will also be stored under
different names and be kept in a locked cabinet in the researcher’s locked home office.
Consent and assent forms will be stored in separate locked cabinet. The linking list that
links your name with the name we are calling you in the research will be kept in a different
locked cabinet than the consent and assent forms located in the researcher’s advisor’s
office at Rutgers.

7.

The research team and the Institutional review board at Rutgers are the only ones

that will have access to what you tell and send the researcher. However, in some
situations we might have to tell someone. If any photo or video is suspected to depict
bullying, we will need to discuss it with your parents and if someone seems to be in
danger, the appropriate authorities, as well. If you threaten to harm yourself or another
person or report any incidents of child or elder abuse (or if it is strongly suspected), then
the investigator is required to notify the appropriate authorities. Also, never send any
nude photos. Nude photos of minors (those under the age of 18) will need to be reported
to the appropriate authorities. You should also not send any photos/videos, or tell us any
information, about current, past or future crimes that are either unknown and/or crimes

340

that you have been convicted of and/or not been charged with or crimes that you may
currently be participating in, as such information about these crimes may have to be
reported to the appropriate authorities.
8.

The research team and the Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews

research studies in order to protect research participants) at Rutgers University are the
only that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. If a report of
this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference,
generally only group results will be stated and if we do talk about you we will use a
different name. All study data will be kept for 10 years.
Do you have any questions? If you have any questions or worries regarding this study,

Audio/Visual Addendum to Consent Form
You have already agreed to participate in a research study entitled IN PLAIN VIEW:
LATINO/A TEENS’ USE OF ICTS TO CONSTRUCT PRIVACY IN THE FAMILY CONTEXT
conducted by Stefani Gomez. We are asking for your permission to allow us to
audiotape you as part of that research study and for you to take photos and short
videos and send them to the researcher (The photo and video activity is only for 14-16year-old teens). You do not have to agree to be recorded or to send photos or short
videos to the researcher in order to participate in the main part of the study.
The photographs, videos, and recording(s) will be used for analysis by the research
team.
The audio-recording(s), photos, and short videos will not include your name and will be
labeled with a pseudonym. If you say anything that you believe at a later point may be
hurtful and/or damage your reputation, then you can ask the interviewer to delete the
recording and record over such information OR that certain text be removed from the
transcripts. Additionally, you can ask the researcher to destroy any photo or video that
you send her at any time.
You will be instructed to concentrate on taking photos and short videos of virtual and
physical spaces and to avoid taking photos in which anyone can be identified. Photos in
which you can be identified will be wither deleted or software will be used to blur your

343

face. Never send nude photos. Nude photos of a minor will need to be reported to the
appropriate authorities.
The audio recordings of the interviews and transcripts and the photographs and videos
that you take will be stored in a locked cabinet in the researcher’s home and on a
password protected computer and all subjects will be referred to by pseudonyms in the
transcripts, analysis, and in the write up of the research. After ten years, all interview
recordings, photos, and videos will be deleted and all the transcripts will be shredded.
Your signature on this form grants the investigator named above permission to record
you as described above and for the researcher to receive photos and videos from you
during participation in the above-referenced study. The investigator will not use the
recording(s) or photographs and videos for any other reason than those stated in the
consent form without your written permission.
Please sign below if you assent to allow the investigator to record you for this study.
