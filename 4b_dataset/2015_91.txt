ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Gendered Literacy through Social Media:
A Study of the Kidlitosphere Blogs
By EMILY M. SEITZ
Dissertation Director:
Ross Todd, Ph.D.

This dissertation observes and theorizes gendered literacy, a term that has so far
been poorly defined. Gendered literacy (in the United States and other Western contexts),
has been discussed as enacted by children and educators; as a quantifiable test-based
outcome; as a result of biological, cognitive differences between females and males; and,
as the result of the historically feminized U.S. educational system.
Data were sampled from 23 blogs in the KidLitosphere, a website aggregating
over 550 blogs relating  to  children’s  literature.  These  data,  along  with  data  collected  from  
interviews, were qualitatively analyzed using the constant comparative method. Research
questions included:
RQ1: What are the conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators
(parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts
for children (published authors, editors, and published illustrators); and,
children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities?
RQ2: How do the conceptions of gendered literacy identified through the
blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts for children, and

ii

children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions identified in the
literature review?
RQ3: What similarities and differences, if any, are represented in conceptions
of gendered literacy among literacy educators; creators of texts for children;
and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities?
RQ4: What patterns, if any, of resistance to the dominant conceptions of
gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed?
Prominent findings  relate  to  educators’  perceptions  of  boys’  reading  preferences
and  labeling  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books.  Other findings relate to gendered literacy
behaviors (other than reading preferences) and perceptions of these behaviors, including
roughly equal numbers of examples describing boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  advanced  
reading level, as compared to those describing girls’.  Implications for future practice
include  educators’  refraining  from  labeling of books according to boy/girl; encouraging
positive perceptions  of  boys’  reading;;  motivating  children  to  read  in  a  resistant  way  – to
read texts that would not be considered appropriate for their sex; encouraging producers
of reading materials for youth to produce more gender-neutral materials; and, fostering
children’s  reading  and  literacy  in  ways  that  do  not  focus  on  gender.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This is a project long in the making, and I extend my gratitude to a number of people and
institutions. I am extremely grateful to Professor Ross Todd, who has advised and mentored me
through the years and across the miles. I am grateful for his continual support even as I moved
abroad and my progress, at times, was slow. I am also grateful to the committee that carried me
along, offering both critique and encouragement. I give special thanks to Professor Carol Gordon
for staying on the committee into her retirement. Professor Marija Dalbello served as an early
committee member and PhD Director, and was invaluable in both roles. The outside member,
Professor Lynne McKechnie (University of Western Ontario), kindly offered to advise me based
mostly on virtual communications, but I am glad to have finally met her in person at a
conference in 2014.
The broader Rutgers SC&I community has helped ground me in the field and introduce
me to several methodologies. I am thankful for mentors when I started in the program, including
Professor Emerita Carol Kuhlthau, Professor  Dan  O’Connor,  and  Professor Marie Radford. I am
indebted  to  the  Dean’s  Office  for  help  in  handling  the  exam,  presentation,  and  writing  processes  
across continents, and for facilitating an exchange with National Taiwan Normal University in
2006. The Center for International Scholarship in School Libraries (CISSL) gave me many
examples of connecting research to practice and introduced me to academics and librarians alike;
ideas for this dissertation grew out of contacts I made with members and contributors at various
conferences hosted by CISSL. CISSL also helped when I started in the program by procuring a
fellowship through the Scholastic corporation. Joan Chabrak, the Graduate Student Services
Coordinator, was so helpful to me throughout the program – contacting faculty, receiving poster
prints, and promptly answering any questions I had about program requirements. I am also

iv

grateful to classmates whom I came to know through coursework and through shared research
interests.
Other institutions have also nurtured this project. I am grateful to several public libraries
in New Jersey: South Brunswick Public Library, Lawrence Headquarters Branch of the Mercer
County Library System, and Princeton Public Library, where I gained valuable practical
experience working in both reference and youth services throughout my years of graduate study.
We were housed at Princeton Seminary during most of the 2000s and again in fall-winter 20122013, and we lived at Taiwan Seminary in Taipei for nearly five years. Having conversation
partners in different universities, libraries, and countries has been a great aid.
I explored concepts of this dissertation in poster presentations at both the 2012
Association for Information Science and Technology conference (although I had to present
virtually due to Hurricane Sandy) and the 2014 Association for Library and Information Science
Education conference. A visit to the 2012 Kidlitosphere Conference helped me to experience in
person a community I had first experienced only virtually. I am grateful to those I interviewed
involved in this group, and also to the broader virtual community on which I have relied.
In this more than decade of study, I have given birth to three children, moved five times,
and become conversational in Mandarin. At the end of this dissertation, I feel (and am) much
older, and yet also know that this is only the beginning of my journey as a scholar. I am grateful
to family members for reading over parts of this dissertation, and for helping with the care of our
children at various crucial points along the way. I am also grateful to my family for believing in
me and offering encouragement along the way. I am also grateful to Li Qiong Ling for helping to
care for our children, from the time our twins were 4 months old, and for helping us to bridge
cultures. I am grateful to my husband for reading over drafts, for his camaraderie and patience,

v

and to our children who are a (generally unacknowledged) data point in my studies of gendered
literacy.

CHAPTER ONE
1.1 Problem Statement
Literacy, defined in this dissertation as the reading and creation of texts both
within school and outside of school, is a gendered phenomenon. In the United States and
other Western countries and cultures, literacy, especially within the context of school and
tests of verbal achievement, is conceived as easier and more enjoyable for girls and more
problematic for boys. Moreover, although the  term  “gendered  literacy”  has  begun  to  
appear in scholarly literature (i.e. Almjeld, 2008; Barrs, 2000; Orellana, 1995; Sanford,
2005/2006),  “gendered  literacy”    has  been  associated  with  multiple,  disparate  meanings,  
and a unified conceptual model has not yet been introduced. For  instance,  “gendered  
literacy”  is presented by Orellana (1995) as a concept relating to gendered texts produced
by children in the classroom. Sanford (2005/2006), like  Orellana,  presents  students’  
production  of  gendered  texts  as  a  function  of  “gendered  literacy”  but  also  presents  
“gendered  literacy”  in  relation  to  teachers’  perceptions  of  gendered  trends  in  terms  of  the
middle  school  students’  enjoyment  of  reading  (girls  enjoyed  reading,  but  boys  did  not),  
and attitudes toward school and the reading of textbooks (girls had more positive
attitudes toward school than boys and enjoyed reading textbooks more than boys).
The conception that literacy is easier for girls than for boys is lived out in terms of
quantitative measures of literacy achievement. For example, for the reading assessment
that is part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, informally known as the
“Nation’s  Report  Card” for the United States, an achievement gap in reading between
girls and boys has been consistent and measured over time since 1971. Among the  “more
than 50,000 public and private school students”  ages 9, 13, and 17 who took the test in

2

2012,  “female students scored higher in reading than male  students  at  all  three  ages”
(National Center for Education Statistics,  “Racial/ethnic and gender gaps  narrow,”  para.  2,  
2013). And in 2013, among students in grade 12, “female students scored 10 points
higher than males … with no change from either 1992 or 2009”  (Easton,  2014,  “Reading,”
para. 2).
Reactions to achievement gaps on verbal tests such  as  The  Nation’s  Report  Card  
are often extreme and panicked. Responding to the 2011 results of the writing portion of
the Nation’s  Report  Card,  a blog  entry  on  CNN  online,  states:  “When it comes to writing,
girls  are  better  than  boys.  That’s  a  generalization,  but  it’s  one  that  is  supported  by  the  
latest  writing  test…from  the  Nation’s  Report  Card”  (Krache,  2012,  para.1-2). The writing
test,  administered  in  2011  to  “national samples of 24,100 8th graders and 28,100 12th
graders” (National Assessment Governing Board, 2011, p. 1) showed a significant gap in
performance between girls and boys, for both eighth graders (19 points) and twelfth
graders (14 points) (National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress,  2011,  “Dig  Deeper  
into the Writing Results,” para. 4).
Beyond  reporting  of  dire  statistics,  opinion  pieces  add  to  the  sense  of  a  “boy  crisis”  
that needs to be remedied. For instance, in an Atlantic Monthly article  entitled,  “Stop  
Penalizing Boys for Not Being Able to Sit Still at School,”  that  was  shared  widely on
social media sites, English and Latin teacher Jessica Lahey writes that at the end of the
school year at the middle school where she teaches she realized, upon counting up
discipline slips, that she gave slips to almost twice as many boys as girls, “and  of  the  
slips…handed  out  to  boys,  all  but  one  was  for  disruptive  classroom  behavior” (Lahey,
2013, para. 1). Moreover, she concludes that the challenges she has faced in her

3

classroom  experiences  with  boys  “may have something to do with a collective failure to
adequately educate boys”  (Lahey,  2013, para. 3).
Rather than declaring a  “crisis”  in  relation  to boys and literacy, this dissertation
seeks possible roots of this issue and provides a nuanced view of the perspectives
surrounding gender and literacy in the United States. Based on the results of this
dissertation study, one explanation is that perceptions  surrounding  boys’  and  girls’  
reading have helped to create this apparent problem. For example, due to the perceptions
of boys as reluctant readers, some boys are less practiced readers than girls, and thereby
score less well than girls on tests of verbal achievement. However, the study also
provides many examples of resistance to such perceptions, moreover identifying many
examples of boys who are avid readers.
1.2 Research Questions
The  study’s  research  questions  are the following:
Research Question 1: What are the conceptions of gendered literacy among
literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers);
creators of texts for children; and, children/young adults, as represented in
their blogging activities?
Research Question 2: How do the conceptions of gendered literacy identified
through the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts for
children, and children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions
identified in the literature review?
Research Question 3: What similarities and differences, if any, are represented
in conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators; creators of texts

4

for children; and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging
activities?
Research Question 4: What patterns, if any, of resistance to the dominant
conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed?
1.3 Young  People’s  Literacy  in  the  Digital  Age
In the scholarship reviewed for this study, discussions of literacy incorporated the
reading and creation of texts through writing, drawing, and illustrating. For the purpose
of this study, reading is conceived of as one part of the larger phenomenon of literacy,
which encompasses the reading and creation of multiple text types. Moreover, this study
examines the reading practices, and perceptions of the reading practices, of children and
young adults. The study focuses on the reading of print texts, especially books, which
were the main text type mentioned among the data sampled.
Frequent reading is an integral part of the literacy learning process. According to
Krashen, for children to learn to read and write fluently, they must read extensively.
Krashen (2004) concludes, based on a lifetime of literacy research:  “Reading  is  the  only  
way, the only way we become good readers, develop a good writing style, an adequate
vocabulary, advanced grammatical competence, and the only way we become good
spellers”  (p.  37).  Moreover,  Krashen  claims  that  “free  voluntary  reading”  (p.  1), in which
children choose what they read and are not required to complete an assignment related to
the reading, is better for helping children develop literacy skills than reading instruction,
making  the  issue  of  children’s  leisure  reading  all  that  more  pressing  (p.  37).  Children’s  
reading preferences and practices, particularly outside required reading for school,
therefore warrant scrutiny.

5

The anxiety surrounding young  people’s literacy has taken a number of forms,
including the perceived  “crisis”  in  relation  to  boys’  reading  (as discussed above) along
with ongoing discussions over testing and preparation for high school or later education.
With the onset of the Information Age, the capacity to use information technology and
the development of new types of knowledge have become necessary components of
formal literacy learning. In the field of library and information science, this has meant a
retooling of what literacy means, concomitant with major changes in librarian preparation
involving a new focus on information literacy and use of multiple media. For example,
Lamb and Johnson (2010) encourage school librarians  “to  design  learning  environments  
that address the needs of 21st century  learners”  (p.  64).  In  order  to  do  this,  they  should  
collaborate  with  classroom  teachers  to  “explore  the  wide  spectrum  of  electronic  and  
interactive reading materials and consider new ways to think about infusing web-based
materials  into  teaching  and  learning”  (pp.  64-65). The literacy needs of the 21st century
are therefore seen as encompassing a variety of print and online texts and reading
experiences that allow young people to interact with texts in new ways.
Beyond exploring new media, educators should be prepared to help students deal
with the explosion of information in the digital age. A growing body of work provides
evidence that inquiry-based learning is an antidote to the problem of information
overload (see, for example, Kuhlthau, Maniotes, & Caspari, 2006). And, reading well is
fundamental for the text-focused inquiry projects characteristic of inquiry-based curricula.
As Gordon (2009) points out:
It is not uncommon to observe young people successfully searching, retrieving,
and locating more than enough information but feeling overwhelmed when they
are expected to use the information to resolve conflicting viewpoints, or
synthesize facts to create new meaning, or integrate the information with what

6

they  already  know  about  the  topic….they  may  resort  to  cutting,  pasting,  and  
plagiarizing because they lack the skills to process the information and
successfully create learning outcomes that are representative of their new
knowledge. (57-58)
Gordon discusses the behaviors students fall into when they are able to find information
but do not know what to do with information once they find it. Better reading abilities
help students make sense of information, construct new knowledge, and integrate that
new knowledge to form a new text or project.
In addition to an overwhelming amount of information, multiple access points,
and varying media types, children are dealing with a context in which the nature of
reading is also changing. This evolving complex social backdrop includes everything
from new types of literature, an increasing public interest in young adult literature, to the
proliferation of online book sellers, electronic books, and online reading.
Reading fluency is important to young people’s  learning and development, and
reading practice, beginning in childhood, is a gendered phenomenon. The dissertation
explores, through the lens of the blogosphere, how and why in the United States and
other Western societies, reading, especially school-based literacy and particular genres of
informal literacy, continue to be associated with femininity, while other forms of
informal  literacy  are  associated  with  boys  and  boys  are  perceived  as  “reluctant  readers.”
1.4 Rationale for the KidLitosphere as a Site
for the Examination of Gendered Literacy
Literacy as a gendered phenomenon is discussed from a variety of different
perspectives in both popular and scholarly literature. This study brings together these
perspectives into a unified conceptual model and examines the veracity of this model
based  on  analysis  of  a  sample  of  blogs  about  children’s  literature.  Considering  gendered  

7

reading as an important part of gendered literacy as a whole, the study seeks to
understand better  the  ways  in  which  young  people’s  reading  is  gendered  and  to  begin  to  
explain how and why reading is gendered in these ways.
According to Nichols (2002), “girls  and  boys  enter  into  formal  literacy  already  
having  been  constituted  as  particular  kinds  of  gendered  literate  subjects”  (p.  124).  In this
statement,  Nichols  stresses  the  connection  between  children’s  acquisition  of  gender  roles  
and their literacy learning. The  statement  also  assumes  children  are  “constituted” in these
ways, thereby negating the action of young people themselves. The study undertaken as
part of this dissertation examines the phenomenon of gendered literacy in terms of how
the groups responsible  for  children’s  socialization  as  “literate  subjects”  (Nichols,  2002,  p.  
124), including literacy educators, young people themselves, and creators of reading
content  for  youth,  understand  young  people’s  reading  and  literacy as gendered. For the
purpose of this study, parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers are
counted as literacy educators. Children and young adults, as readers and literacy learners,
are also included. Finally, creators of reading materials for children include editors, and
published  authors  and  illustrators  of  children’s  and  young  adult  literature.  
To understand the full range of perspectives, this study analyzes words and
images in a sample of blogs drawn from a website called the KidLitosphere, which brings
together over 550 blogs focusing on a common theme: literature for young people. Some
KidLitosphere bloggers communicate with one another via a listserv, a Facebook page,
and through their blogs; there are also two RSS feeds, and the bloggers host an annual
conference and children’s  book  award  competition.

8

The KidLitosphere blogs center around book reviews of literature for young
people,  with  reflections  on  children’s  reading  processes  and  preferences  interspersed  
throughout. This study qualitatively analyzes data sampled from a select set of blogs
according to concepts of gendered literacy identified in the research literature; identifies
new dimensions of these concepts and new or resistant concepts; and, compares/contrasts
the perspectives of literacy teachers (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and
teachers), literacy learners (children and young adults), and creators of reading materials
for youth (published authors, editors, and published illustrators). In order to clarify the
conceptions of gendered literacy identified both in the literature review and in the blog
analysis and to provide insight as to their origins, the study also uses interviews with two
KidLitosphere bloggers, including a mother who provides reader’s  advisory  through her
blog, and a female public youth services librarian. One person outside the KidLitosphere
was also interviewed, a male author of non-fiction for children and young adults, who is
vocal  concerning  issues  related  to  boys’  reading.
1.5 Rationale for Studying Blogs
Blogs are an important social medium, to be differentiated from other forms of
social media (such as Facebook and Twitter, which are platforms for so-called  “microblogging”) in terms of their relatively lengthy narratives and tendency towards a more
singular thematic focus. According to Lomborg (2009), blogs are a form of computer
mediated communication distinguished by author-determined content and asynchronous
blogger/reader interactivity (p. 3). Miller and Shepherd (2004) note that a blog’s  content  
is  characterized  by  the  blogger’s  own  comments  combined  with  links  to  other  websites  
and  that  the  blogger’s  most  recent  posts  appear  first  on  the  blog  (p.  5).  

9

Among the strengths of using blog posts as a data source for this study are their
accessibility (the ones analyzed for this dissertation are all publicly accessible) and the
fact that they can be read unobtrusively (in comparison to other types of social media and
more traditional survey research). Also, as a powerful social medium, blogs provide
sociocultural commentary, and scholars (i.e. Miller & Shepherd, 2004, p. 7) have
demonstrated that although blogs function as personal diaries in some respects, bloggers
also intend their blogs to be read by a larger social audience.
Moreover, because blogs connect people socially, Nelson (2006) discussed how
they were becoming influential in the publishing industry. Evidence suggests that blogs
of the type included in the KidLitosphere website have begun impacting the publishing,
marketing, and sale of materials for young people. For example, publishers regularly send
review copies of books to active bloggers (in order to gauge the marketability of new
books), use blogs to discover promising new authors, and benefit from the blogger
grapevine spreading the word about new books (Springen, 2011). At the KidLitosphere
conference in September, 2012, a publishing representative who was part of a panel
discussion about the importance and influence of the KidLitosphere blogs in terms of
marketing books, stated: “Newspaper  reviews  are  dead…Real  book  tours  don’t  work,”  
and  “there  are  not  enough  real  bricks  and  mortar  bookstores”  for book marketing to work
through traditional channels. Book marketing, therefore, is more ambiguous than it was
in the past. Additionally,  librarians  and  teachers  serving  youth  are  using  children’s  
literature blogs as an alternative book review source, discovering books through blogs as
well as through traditional print literary reviews (Burns, 2007; Thompson, 2010).

10

Blogs are only one of many sites in which gendered literacy may appear. Other
possible sites include book groups, book fairs, classrooms, and libraries. However, in
examining blogs, with the context of previous research on gendered literacy as a
backdrop, the goal is to develop a model of the main and resistant sociocultural themes
regarding young  people’s  reading  and  gender. The study thereby treats blogs as textual
artifacts through which broader understandings of literacy as gendered may be mapped.
1.6 Overview of Theoretical Framework and Approach
to the Study of Gendered Literacy
Both gender and literacy are contested terms associated with multiple
understandings. The  term  “gendered  literacy”  has  been used in the context of educational
research, specifically in the areas of literacy, language arts, composition, and reading.
However, the literature review for this dissertation study presented in Chapter 2 goes
beyond these areas of study to look at both scholarly and popular works in various fields
of inquiry, including psychology, sociology, library science, historical work in education,
and the context of educational testing and related research. Moreover, the research and
commentary treated in the literature review describes literacy in multiple forms – as
children  and  young  adults’  reading,  writing,  and  classroom  comportment  in  relation  to  
literacy learning. However, the data analyzed primarily refer to gendered reading, rather
than to literacy in the broader sense described in the literature review. The rationale for
painting with such broad strokes in the literature review is that in order to present a fuller
picture of the social framework comprising gender in terms of literacy, it is necessary to
draw from many different types of scholarship.

11

This section will review the conceptions of gender and literacy as well as the
general theoretical orientation undergirding the study described in this dissertation. To
start, a social constructivist view of both gender and literacy is assumed. Because of
social norms relating to gender, males and females are expected to behave differently and
may behave differently in accordance with these expectations. Behavioral differences
between males and females are thereby attributed to differences in the ways in which
males and females are socialized rather than to essential, biological differences. Similar
to the lens here applied to gender, the study of literacy behaviors examines individuals as
embedded within a social fabric of literacy practices rather than focusing only on
individual cognitive function. The ways in which gender and literacy – as constructs – are
understood, is socially regulated, and more specifically, regulated through language.
Berger and Luckmann (1966), in The Social Construction of Reality, describe the
dialectical nature of social reality to which this study ascribes:
Despite the objectivity that marks the social world in human experience, it does
not thereby acquire an ontological status apart from the human activity that
produced  it…it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the relationship between man, the
producer, and the social world, his product, is and remains a dialectical one. That
is, man (not, of course, in isolation but in his collectivities) and his social world
interact with each other. The product acts back upon the producer. (p. 57)
This constructivist approach, while acknowledging the power of socially-created
phenomena such as institutions and social norms – a power that seems to give them a life
of their own, or a  separate  “ontological  status”– makes it clear that they are socially
produced. Berger and Luckmann thereby incorporate the notion of individual agency
along with structural power, describing the give-and-take relationship between people
and the social world.

12

Judith Butler’s  (1990,  1999)  treatment  of  gender as socially-performed is helpful
for this study.  Vasterling  (1999)  refers  to  Butler’s  theorization  of  gender  and  the  body  as  
a  “radical  constructivism”  (p.  17).  A  performative  definition  of  gender  (Butler,  1990,  
1999) assumes the constructed nature of gender but is also concerned with the activity
and agency of the individual performers who are engaged in the constructing, or
performing, of gender. Butler asserts that gender norms result in gender usually being
performed as a binary (feminine/ masculine) and in ways which the performer of gender
already knows, has memorized, and rehearsed. In the U.S., men will generally (but not
necessarily) perform a Western-defined masculinity and women, a Western-defined
femininity. The focus is on the performance, but the performer is not forgotten in the
analysis of the construction of gender.
In this dissertation, the literacy practices of young people are defined broadly as
the reading and creation of texts both within school and outside of school. In terms of the
data analyzed, however, the focus is on reading. Street’s  (1984) “ideological  model”  of  
literacy practices, asserting that  “what  the  particular  practices  and  concepts  of  reading  
and writing are for a given society depends upon the context; that they are already
embedded in an ideology and cannot be isolated or treated as ‘neutral’  or  merely  
‘technical,’”  (p. 1) informs this study. It is presumed that literacy practices represent
gendered performances and that certain practices are associated with Western-defined
femininity and others with Western-defined masculinity. Key to this study is the notion
that in the U.S. (and other Western cultures), formal, school-based reading, and the
reading of particular genres (i.e. fictional narrative) are designated as feminine, while

13

other informal reading is designated as masculine, along with the perception of boys as
“reluctant”  and  remedial readers.
A challenge for the study described in this dissertation is that it looks at the
perspectives of multiple groups, including young people, along with the major players
influencing  young  people’s  uses  of  texts  (librarians,  parents,  and  teachers),  and those
(authors, illustrators, and editors) who create the texts read by young people. Based on
the findings from the literature review toward building an integrated model of the
conceptions of the intersections between gender and literacy (in scholarly, professional,
and popular texts), it was expected that members of these groups would express these
dominant conceptions in blog posts sampled from the blogs contained in the
KidLitosphere. However, there was also significant resistance to or disruptions of these
conceptions, found in the analysis of the blog posts.
The study is most concerned with the perceptions of gendered reading the
bloggers are voicing in their blog posts. However, it is also cognizant of the roles of the
bloggers as librarians, teachers, parents, and young adults, looking for patterns in the
perceptions of each group, and considering the possibility that they are constructing new
and resistant meanings of gendered literacy.
1.7 Theoretical and Practical Contributions of the Study
The study contributes theoretically in that although gendered literacy has begun
appearing in both research and popular literature (including in the media in the form of
reports on gaps in achievement between boys and girls, as mentioned in the introduction),
no one has yet brought together all the conceptions of gendered literacy to form a
cohesive model. This is a necessary step towards understanding how and why school-

14

based literacy and particular genres of informal literacy in the U.S. continue to be
associated with femininity, while other forms of informal literacy are associated with
boys  and  boys  are  perceived  as  “reluctant”  readers. In addition to contributing
theoretically, this study has practical implications for literacy education practitioners, for
whom  boys’  literacy  and  reading  practices  are  of  particular  concern,  and  for  those  who  
create reading materials for children and young adults. Developing curricula, library
programs, texts, and other reading materials that appeal equally to both boys and girls
should be a priority. Moreover, as children and young adults are active participants in
their own literacy, the study could impact them as well. Young people, who are the future
creators and educators, could learn to approach literacy with a more balanced perspective
in terms of gender, thereby beginning the work of sociocultural change regarding
gendered literacy.
The literature on gender and literacy has focused on the origins, enactment, and
outcomes of gendered literacy. Some discussions of the origins of gendered literacy have
taken a biological essentialist point of view, arguing that gendered literacy is the result of
significant biological, cognitive differences between females and males. Other
discussions of the origins of gendered literacy have taken a historical perspective,
showing how the linkage between gender and literacy is rooted in a feminized U.S.
educational system and a tradition of underachieving boys.
In terms of discussion of the enactment of gendered literacy, a major theme in the
research  literature  has  been  on  boys’  resistance  to  formal,  school-based literacies in their
reading, writing, and classroom  behaviors  juxtaposed  with  girls’  more  ready  acceptance  
of these literacy practices. Research on parents has focused on their differing perceptions

15

of  their  daughters’  and  sons’  literacy  preferences  (i.e.  Nichols,  2002)  and  mothers’  and  
fathers’  differing modeling of literacy behaviors and support  of  children’s  reading  
behaviors (i.e. Scholastic & Yankelovich, 2008). Research on teachers has emphasized
their differing perceptions and expectations of  male  and  female  students’  literacy  
preferences and performance (i.e. Orellana, 1995; Sanford, 2005/2006); and, what has
been  written  about  public  and  school  librarians’  approaches  to  gender  and  literacy  
highlights their expectations  of  children’s  (particularly  boys’)  literacy  preferences  and  
programmatic responses (i.e. Parsons, 2004). Outcome-centered discussion of gender and
literacy focuses on quantifiable gaps on standardized tests of verbal ability, with girls
outscoring boys.
The data used in the bodies of research just described, for the most part, represent
data that have been gathered at the time the studies were conducted, rather than data
taken from pre-existing texts, as in the case of the study undertaken for this dissertation,
which uses blog posts as the main data source. There also have been no studies of gender
in relation to literacy so far that examine as many different perspectives simultaneously
as this study. This dissertation therefore presents a multi-faceted analysis of gendered
reading in the U.S. and other Western cultures.

16

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
This Chapter begins by defining more fully the following terms underpinning the
study:  “gender,”  and  “literacy,”  and how gender and literacy intersect. It then provides a
review of the literature outlining the ways in which scholars understand gendered literacy.
Second,  it  assesses  the  literature  dealing  directly  with  parents’,  teachers’,  librarians’,  and  
children’s  perspectives  on  gendered  literacy,  as  well  as  gendered literacy within the
publishing industry. It thereby presents the following conceptual model of gendered
literacy, which will be fully explicated throughout the remainder of the Chapter:
Table 1
Conceptual Model of Gendered Literacy Based on Prior Scholarship
1. Gendered literacy as
enacted, or performed, by
multiple actors

Children/young adults:
a)  through  boys’  resistance  
to formal, school-based
literacy in comparison to
girls’  more  enthusiastic  
adoption of formal literacy
practice in terms of reading,
writing, and classroom
comportment

b)  through  girls’  and  boys’  
displaying differing literacy
preferences in terms of
reading and writing

Literacy educators,
including parents, teachers,
and librarians:
a)  through  parents’  
perceptions of their
daughters’  and  sons’  
literacy preferences and
mothers’  and  fathers’  
differing support of
children’s  reading  
behaviors

Creators of reading
materials for children/
young adults – the
children’s  publishing  
industry

b)  through  teachers’  
perceptions and
expectations of male and
female  students’  literacy  
preferences and
performance

c)  through  librarians’  
expectations  of  children’s  
(particularly  boys’)  
literacy preferences and
programmatic responses
2. Gendered literacy as a quantifiable achievement gap between girls and boys
3. Gendered literacy as a biological phenomenon, the result of essential, cognitive differences between males and
females
4. Gendered literacy as a remnant of the historically gendered educational system, including the feminization of the
teaching profession in the U.S. and a legacy of underachieving boys

17

A rationale for the study follows. Next, it discusses blogs as a social medium
through which to study sociocultural perceptions of gender and literacy and defines blogs
according to previous iterations in the literature.
2.1 Gender Defined
2.1.1 Gender as socially constructed. In order to discuss gendered literacy, it is
first necessary to define the core concepts of gender and literacy. The premise for this
study is that gender is an important social organizing phenomenon within the U.S. that
children learn as they develop into adults. Psychologist Sandra Bem (1993), who presents
a theory of gender in U.S. culture focusing on the overlapping lenses of androcentrism,
gender polarization, and biological essentialism, which she attest combine to produce and
maintain male dominance (p. 2) describes the subtle ways in which children acquire
cultural meanings:
Insofar as social practices communicate metamessages to the child, the
acquisition of cultural knowledge can be considered a kind of subliminal
pedagogy. Insofar as the child gradually deciphers the meaning embedded in
social practices, the acquisition of cultural knowledge can be considered more a
matter of picking up information than transmitting it; in this case, the culture itself
is more a text to be read – and read by an active, meaning-constructing reader –
than a lesson to be taught.
This simultaneous transmission and pickup of information is initiated
every time the active, pattern-seeking child is exposed to a culturally significant
social practice. (Bem, 1993, pp. 140-141)
The study described in this dissertation treats reading as an example of what Bem refers
to as a “culturally  significant  social  practice,” through which messages about gender are
communicated to children, who then make meanings from these gendered messages. To
illustrate, among this study’s  findings  is a widespread perception by educators (including
parents,  teachers,  and  librarians)  of  boys  as  “reluctant  readers.”

18

As explained by Bem (1993), this study assumes a social constructivist approach
to gender. In  this  dissertation,  the  term  “gender”  is  therefore  used  to  refer  to  the  socially  
constructed  roles  of  femininity  and  masculinity  whereas  “sex”  is  used  to  refer  to  whether  
a  person  is  female  or  male.  In  some  cases,  quoted  studies  may  use  the  word  “gender”  to
refer  to  a  person’s  sex,  but  otherwise  “gender”  refers  to  social  role,  and  “sex”  refers  to  
biological status as female or male. Social constructivist theories of gender attribute
behavioral differences between males and females to differences in the ways in which
males and females are socialized.
Connell (1987) also describes this theoretical orientation, but according to
children’s learning of gendered social roles:
The  basic  idea  is  that  this  occurs  by  ‘role  learning’,  ‘socialization’  or  
‘internalization’.  Thus  feminine  character  is  produced  by  socialization  into  the  
female role, masculine character by socialization into the male role....This
argument leads to an interest in the people and institutions responsible for the
learning, the so-called  ‘agencies  of  socialization’:  mother,  family,  teachers,  peers,  
media. (p. 49)
Connell states that males and females learn gender identities through the “agencies  of  
socialization,”  the  people  and  institutions  with  whom  they  interact  throughout their lives.
Viewed through this lens, gendered literacy practices are seen as responses to gendered
socialization. Moreover, regarding young people’s  literacy  practices in relation to gender,
therefore, this study focuses on the “agencies  of  socialization”  – parents, public librarians,
school librarians, and teachers, and young people themselves, associated with young
people’s  literacy  learning.  Specifically,  the  study  examines  how  they write about literacy
in relation to gender in blog posts and connected comments.
The larger debate over the relationship between sex and gender is complex and
unresolved, and this study defers such causal questions in favor of an attempt to

19

understand how literacy is gendered in U.S. culture. Furthermore, this project approaches
gender as a socially constructed phenomenon, underpinned by cultural learning of gender
roles which are historically maintained and transformed. In doing so, it sets aside other
theories of gendered behavior, including biological essentialism, in which biological
tendencies/traits  are  believed  to  determine  male  and  females’  differing  life  situations, and
postmodern gender theory, in which gender is treated as constructed through discourse.
Critiques of the social construction of gender have been raised. One such critique
focuses on the way in which it portrays children as submissive receptacles of social
learning. For example, Rowan, Knobel, Bigum, and Lankshear (2002) note that:
children tend to be represented in unnaturally passive ways….Sex role theory or
socialization literature has encouraged educators to provide children with a range
of  ‘socialization’  experiences….But it has been unable to account for the fact that
boys and girls do not always take on board the preferences of their teachers. (p. 45)
Children, then, are not passive participants in the socialization process. They have their
own subjectivity and can accept, challenge, or resist the roles offered them. Moreover,
they are not formed in a hermetically sealed environment; they exist in constant contact
with family members, social structures, and media.
Keeping such critiques in mind, it is therefore important to emphasize young
people’s  tendency  to  maintain  their  own  subjectivities  while  they  are  at  the  same  time
responding to their social environments. Gendered literacy practices are part of the social
environments to which youth respond, and by recognizing the influence of individual
subjectivity in terms of their responses, the study described in this dissertation adopts a
social constructivist approach to both gender and literacy.
2.1.2 Gender as performative. The work of Butler (1990, 1999) is also useful in
this discussion. In Gender Trouble, Butler (1990) goes beyond social constructionism,

20

questioning the way in which gender traditionally is accepted as a binary phenomenon,
and critiquing constructionist theories of gender in their failure to examine who is doing
the constructing of gender and how this process occurs (pp. 10-12). She proposes a theory
of gender as performative. Butler (1999) explains:
As in other ritual social dramas, the action of gender requires a performance that
is repeated [emphasis in original]. This repetition is at once a reenactment and
reexperiencing of a set of meanings already socially established; and it is the
mundane and ritualized form of their legitimation. Although there are individual
bodies that enact these significations by becoming stylized into gendered modes,
this  “action”  is  a  public  action.  There  are  temporal  and collective dimensions to
these actions, and their public character is not inconsequential; indeed, the
performance is effected with the strategic aim of maintaining gender within its
binary frame. (pp. 178-9)
Butler (1999) here emphasizes legitimation of the socially constructed values associated
with gender, conceived in dualistic terms, through repetitive enactment of these values.
Individual bodies perform gender; however, the actions are also public and through the
repetitive enactment of these values, masculine and feminine gender roles are thereby
maintained. This is how Butler conceives of gender as a performance that is both
individual and social. Her work critiques discussions of gender roles as constructions
which do not consider the activity surrounding these constructions, including how and by
whom these roles are constructed. This study treats blog narratives as sites for linguistic
performances of gendered literacy. A conceptual framework of gender as performative
will be evident in the review of the literature related to gendered literacy, as researchers
perceive that children and adults perform gendered literacy in the classroom and beyond.
In an earlier work, Butler (1988) describes what it means to say that gender is
performative:
Gender is an act that has been going on before one arrived on the scene. Hence,
gender is an act which has been rehearsed, much as a script survives the particular

21

actors who make use of it, but which requires individual actors in order to be
actualized and reproduced as reality once again. (p. 526)
In this statement, Butler compares gender to a theater script; the story described within
comes to life only when individuals act it out. Similarly, this study contends that bloggers
draw from pre-existing sociocultural scripts concerning gender and literacy in the
language and images they use in blogs.
Researchers frequently note that children begin the acting and rehearsing of
gender early on, and gender relations affect classroom behavior. For example, Blair
(2000), in her study of Canadian eighth graders in a language arts class, states that the
students
looked at the gender dichotomy they saw in the world around them and positioned
themselves accordingly. They hung out primarily in single gender groups, often
mimicking and mocking the other gender. Ridicule of those who did not clearly
conform was common. The creation of differences was a part of the process of
gendering, and the differences were used as a reminder of the importance and
impermeability of these categories. (p. 316)
According to Blair, the children she observed in this language arts class conformed to
societal gender norms by socializing in single sex groups and maintaining strict gender
differentiation by teasing those of the opposite sex and scorning those who went against
gender  norms.  Hence,  from  Blair’s  example  it  is  apparent  how  acceptable performance of
gender roles serves to model and correct social understandings of gender among children.
In another example, Orellana (1995) describes the writing assignments completed
by the elementary students she observed for her research; the writing the students
produced was markedly gendered, with girls and boys writing about different themes (pp.
695-696). When children worked together on writing assignments, it was in same sex
pairs (Orellana, 1995, p. 220). Orellana also noted patterns in the themes expressed in

22

books produced by other students that were available in the classroom library and the
books produced by the students she observed; the children mentioned the books of peers
as sources of inspiration for  their  own  books.  Orellana’s  findings thereby show how
gendered writing themes were socially transmitted and reproduced in the classroom (p.
696). Several other examples of the ways in which children perform gender in relation to
literacy are described below in Section 2.4, Gendered Literacy Enacted by Children.
In summary, gender, for the purposes of this study, is defined as socially
performed. It is assumed that through performances of gender, conceptions of gender are
reproduced and legitimated. Alternative performances (for  example,  boys’  enjoyment  of  
books that would be considered appropriate only for girls) can disrupt or resist these
conceptions of gender. The study described in this dissertation specifically observes
performances of and resistances against gendered conceptions of literacy.
2.2 Literacy Defined
2.2.1 Literacy as a social process. This study assumes learning and language to
be fundamentally social phenomena. Foundational to this concept is the work of
Vygotsky (1978), who posited that “human learning presupposes a specific social nature
and a process by which children grow into the intellectual life of those around them
[emphasis in original]”  (p. 88). Thus, the study investigates the contours of this
“intellectual  life”  in  terms  of  literacy  learning  from  the  perspective  of  teachers  of  literacy  
– parents, public adults, and from the perspective of those who create reading materials
for young people, including authors, editors, and illustrators. Orellana (1995), who
examined gendered literacy from the perspective of the literacy learners – children and
young adults – through  an  ethnographic  study  of  students’  and  teachers’  interactions and

23

artifacts produced in two bilingual (Spanish/English) U.S. classrooms, expresses it in this
way:  “A  sociocultural  perspective  on  literacy  is  rooted  in  the  belief  that  people  acquire  
literacy by interacting with others using the printed word for meaningful tasks within
particular  social  contexts”  (p.  677).
Street (1984) proposes  an  “  ‘ideological’  model  of  literacy;;”  the  aspects  he  
explores  that  are  most  relevant  to  this  study  are  the  notions  that  “the  meaning  of  literacy  
depends upon the social institutions  in  which  it  is  embedded,”   and  “literacy  can  only  be  
known  to  us  in  forms  which  already  have  political  and  ideological  significance”  (p.  8).  
Street emphasizes that literacy cannot be studied as an entity separate from cultural and
social context.
Long (2003), in a study  of  white  women’s  book  clubs  in  Houston,  Texas  in  the  
early 1990s, also discusses the social nature of reading – what  she  refers  to  as  “the  social  
infrastructure”  of  reading  (p.  8).  She  describes  the  social  relationships  associated  with  
reading,  specifically  mentioning  that  “early  images  show  mothers  teaching  children  how  
to  read”  and  also  noting  the  larger  picture  of  family  reading  as  “both  a  form  of cultural
capital  and  one  of  the  most  important  determinants  of  adherence  to  reading  in  later  life”  
(p. 9). She notes that because  the  solitary  reader’s  experience  of  “reading  feels  so  deeply  
private,”  (p.  16) reading has wrongly been portrayed only as an activity that is done
alone, when in fact reading is a social process. She describes the “social  infrastructure”  of
literacy as follows:
Not only is literacy always taught and practiced by real people in concrete social
situations,  but…  reading  lies  in  the shadow of the institutional order. It is subject
both to the dictates of the state – in  the  public  school  system  most  obviously…  -and to looser systems of cultural authority. (p. 16)

24

In other words, the teaching and practice of reading happens through social relationships
and through both public (school, for example) and private (families, for example) social
institutions.
To summarize, literacy learning is a socially interactive process. As such, the
study of literacy practice should not be studied apart from this social context, which
consists of a larger cultural and institutional web. For this reason, this study examines the
perspectives of major participants (educators, children/young adults, and creators of
reading materials for youth) in youth literacy in relation to gendered literacy.
2.2.2 Literacy as defined within specific social contexts. Moss (2007) provides
an in-depth  look  at  literacy  within  an  elementary  school  environment,  noting  that  “the  
social power schools have to define what counts as literacy is encapsulated in their
curricula  and  in  their  classroom  practice”  (p.50).  Moss’s  ethnographic research, a series
of studies in British primary schools (data collection included observation, interviews,
questionnaires, and photographs taken by some of the participants, p. 8) illustrates the
ways in which the uses of texts are controlled within the school context, how these
interact  with  assessments  of  students’  reading  ability,  and  how  such  assessments  steer  
students towards specific classroom activities. She also points out the ways in which
schools’  uses  of  and  labeling  of  texts  may  influence  the  publishing  industry’s  publication  
and production of texts, such as in chapter books and information books (pp. 96, 99-105).
Drawing  from  Moss’s  work,  this  study  considers  what  counts  as  literacy  for  girls  versus  
for boys, and how this is socially regulated.  Unlike  Moss’s  work,  this  study  looks  beyond  
the classroom to consider how sociocultural meanings in relation to gender and literacy
are performed by literacy educators, by creators of texts for young people, and by young

25

people themselves in blog posts. Treating blogs as a sociocultural site for the enactment
of gendered literacy, the study thereby looks at how gendered notions of literacy play out
in the texts of blogs and compares these enactments to a conceptual model of gendered
literacy developed through a review of the literature.
2.2.3 Literacy as the reading and creation of diverse texts. This study utilizes
an expansive concept of literacy as the reading and creation of multiple text types. This is
important  as  young  people’s  literacy  in  terms  of  other  textual  forms  beyond  print  books,  
may be ignored by adults. For example, Rothbauer (2006) notes that
young people do not seem to make the same distinction that librarians, teachers,
and parents do among the varieties of textual experience. Or rather they are less
likely, and perhaps less willing, to privilege book reading as the highest form of
literacy. (p. 21)
This  statement  speaks  to  young  people’s  tendency  to  treat  all  texts  equally  rather  than  to  
prefer one over another or to view book-reading as the most important literate practice.
Rothbauer, in this statement, also contrasts the perceptions and practices of young people
with those of their literacy teachers, including parents, librarians, and teachers.
Describing new forms of literacy, Sanford (2005/2006) writes:
Literacy now relates to a much broader set of texts including visual, multimodal,
and digital texts that appear  in  many  forms  all  around  us.…Billboards, magazines,
the Internet, text messaging, video-all are instantly available in multiple modes to
people of all ages, cultures, and classes. (p. 304)
Sanford (2005/2006) here defines literacy as the use of a broad range of texts by a broad
range of people. The International Reading Association (2012) espouses a similar view of
literacy, stating, in its position statement on adolescent literacy:
Internationally, adolescents representing a diverse range of cultural, linguistic,
and socioeconomic backgrounds engage in multiple forms of literacy throughout
their  day….these literacy experiences may include the use of traditional print
materials, the Internet, social media, instant messaging, texting, and video games,

26

all of which can be used as tools for understanding academic content as well as
forming social relationships. (p. 2)
In this position statement, the International Reading Association discusses  students’  
differing backgrounds, the myriad of texts and media now available to them, and the
range of literacy opportunities they offer, spanning the academic to the social.
Likewise, Smith & Wilhelm (2002) suggest a semiotic definition of literacy that
“would  include  the  ability  to  communicate and make meaning with various sign systems,
such as music, video, visual arts, and electronic technologies, and would build on the
interconnections  among  various  forms  of  literacy”  (p.  186).  This  “semiotic”  view  of  
literacy, encompassing various media and forms of literacy, informed the approach to this
study, although the data sampled from the blogs that were chosen from the study, mainly
described traditional print texts and the reading of books.
One term (used to describe a broader approach to literacy) that has been gaining
ground  is  “transliteracy.”  Thomas has been working experimentally on projects which
utilize this concept and also to cultivate and expand research on the term. She and others,
in an article introducing the term, define transliteracy as “the  ability  to  read,  write  and  
interact across a range of platforms, tools and media from signing and orality through
handwriting,  print,  TV,  radio  and  film,  to  digital  social  networks”  (Thomas, Joseph,
Laccetti, Mason, Mills, Perril, & Pullinger, 2007). Library and information science
scholars and librarians are exploring what transliteracy means for their profession as
literacy  learners  include  students  who  are  increasingly  comfortable  with  “fluid  
environments  and  transmedia  worlds”  (Lamb & Johnson, 2010, p. 64). For example, in
response to the ever-changing technological landscape, Dresang (2005) suggests a theory
of  “Radical  Change,”  that  is,  “based  on  the  digital  age  principles  of  interactivity,  

27

connectivity, and access,”  as a lens for examining human information behaviors,
particularly those of young people, and texts, in new ways (p. 178). And, as Gordon
(2009) points out:
Learning in an electronic age presumes visual literacy, media literacy, and
technological literacy. The electronic landscape challenges the conventions of
traditional  reading  and  what  it  means  to  be  information  literate….Reconceptualizing how we learn to read and write in print and electronic places and
how we learn how to learn in new environments is the primary educational
challenge. It has an immediate and powerful effect on what inquiry looks like in
the school library and the kinds of intervention students need to be successful.
(p.i)
Here, Gordon describes what many see as a seismic shift in reading practices in the
digital age and how these changes specifically affect school librarians as they guide
students in learning how to do research.
The broad approaches to literacy discussed above, including the reading and
creation of various types of texts using various media, tools, and sign systems, informed
the study undertaken. However, as mentioned before, the concept of reading discussed
among the data sampled was described in traditional terms, as in reading print books.
Literacy is understood as a social process (as discussed by Vygotsky, 1978) in
which young people, situated within sociocultural contexts (Street, 1984; Long, 2003),
learn to read and create a diversity of texts (including print, digital, audio, and visual).
Literacy practices are also performed within specific social contexts (in school, for
example, as explored by Moss, 2007). This study, therefore, defines literacy as young
people’s  culturally- and socially-shaped uses of a variety of texts; in considering literacy
as a gendered phenomenon, it also highlights gender as an important sociocultural aspect
of literacy practices.
2.3 The Intersection of Gender and Literacy

28

2.3.1 Shift from a cognitive to a social focus within literacy education. This
study investigates how beliefs about gender are connected to perceptions of literacy.
Gilbert (1993) discusses how throughout the 1970s and 80s, the focus of literacy
pedagogy  was  the  “ungendered, classless,  universal  ‘child,’”  and  educators  and  
researchers treated literacy learning as an individualistic, purely cognitive process (p.
212). Similarly, Millard (2003) gives a brief history of the way in which literacy began to
be viewed as the result of social rather than simply cognitive forces and the contributions
of  feminism  to  this  debate,  noting:  “As  feminists  had  already  shown  that  gender  was  
constructed through social practices [emphasis in original], the realization that literacy
itself is a set of social practices, rather than cognitive processes, became important in
explanations  of  the  interrelationship  of  (gendered)  identity  and  literacy  development”(p.  
23). Thus, gender became an important topic in the context of research on literacy.
Moreover, Gilbert (1992) states the following:
If  language  practices…are  seen  to  be  predominantly  cognitive,  predominantly  
individualistic, predominantly natural, then it is difficult to accept and
acknowledge that it is also through language that we learn how to take up
positions in our culture as women and men, wives and husbands, lovers and
friends: that we learn how to function socially in our world. (p. 188)
Gilbert, writing here as a researcher who has examined language use as a gendered, social
enterprise, suggests that such a perspective can have far-reaching social implications –
that in fact, our learning of gendered social roles is mediated through language.
2.3.2 The association of literacy with femininity. Scholars of reading and
literacy, when studying questions of gender in connection to literacy, have focused on the
notion of literacy as associated with femininity and viewed in opposition to masculinity.

29

Millard  (1994)  states  that  “in  Western  societies, reading is presented largely as a girlpreferred activity”  (p.  96).  Likewise,  Rowan  et al. (2002) note that
some discipline areas – including literacy – have a decidedly feminine image, and
appear to value female knowledge and experience over male. Indeed, it appears
that – at least for students in developed and overdeveloped countries – literacy
education in primary and secondary schools has come to be associated largely
with  women  and  women’s  business. (p. 40)
Rowan et al. (2002) thereby summarize  the  Western  world’s  widespread  association  of  
literacy with femininity. This is a largely modern understanding of literacy, and
represents a major shift in how literacy was previously gendered in Western culture.
Finkelstein and McCleery (2005) state that in 15th century  Europe,  “Mothers  who  were  
literate  began  the  process  of  teaching  literacy  in  the  home”  (pp.  106-107). Merchant-class
boys and girls could attend the town public schools, but only boys were allowed to go on
to university (p. 107). This dissertation also assumes a modern understanding of
childhood as a particular life phase. In Western Europe, for example, it was only during
the 19th century, with a rise in family incomes, the beginning of compulsory education,
and the growth of public libraries, that books were published specifically for children
(Finkelstein & McCleery, 2005, pp. 114-115).
Wittmann (1999) discusses the expansion of the reading public in 18th century
Europe and how the nature of reading changed, most notably the way in which extensive
reading of large numbers of texts, including novels and other entertaining works, took the
place of intensive reading of a small number of religious texts, including the Bible (p.
285). There was also growth in the numbers of readers, especially among the propertyowning class (pp. 287-2888). Lyons (1999) discusses the continued “expansion  of  the  
reading  public”  in  Western  Europe  in  the  19th century and more specifically, the

30

increasing numbers of women, children, and working class readers (p. 313). This resulted
as the male/female literacy gap decreased, with more and more women becoming literate
(p.  315).  Moreover,  “the  expansion  of  primary  education  in  nineteenth-century Europe
encouraged  the  growth  of  another  important  sector  of  the  reading  public:  the  children”  (p.  
324), and,  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  required  daily  working  hours  “allowed  greater  
opportunities  for  reading  among  the  working  classes”  (p.  333).  
Lyons (1999) highlights the continuing diversification among readers in the 19th
century, and also discusses the  secularization  of  women’s  reading  and the resulting
changes in the publishing industry,  stating:  “The new women readers of the nineteenth
century…had other, more secular tastes, and new forms of literature were designed for
their consumption. Among the genres destined for this new market of readers were
cookery  books,  magazines  and,  above  all,  the  cheap  popular  novel”  (p.  317). It is possible
that the gendered trends in feminine reading practice emerged from these historical
patterns.
Long  (2003),  for  example,  discusses  the  historical  background  for  women’s  book  
clubs in America. The book clubs developed in the 19th century during the period of rapid
industrialization, which led to further division between the feminine – domestic and
masculine – work (outside the home) worlds. Higher education opportunities for women
were growing but still minimal; the book clubs thereby served as a means for women to
educate themselves from within their homes (Long, 2003, pp. 36-37). Moreover, the Civil
War  “fostered  self  reliance  and  tremendous  organizational  activity  among  women,”  a  
context in which women’s  clubs  and  literary  societies flourished (p. 37). These clubs,
despite their importance in terms of social reform (Long, 2003, p. 65) and founding of

31

educational institutions (p. 52), were never considered worthy of serious study because
they  were  “leisure-time  groups”  and  also  composed predominantly of women (p. 31).
However, the book clubs and literary societies
established almost  75  percent  of  the  public  libraries  in  the  nation…began  
kindergartens, pushed for vocational education and other curricular reforms,
founded college scholarships and dormitories for women, and campaigned for
universal compulsory education. (p. 52)
In this sense, they were catalysts for education in the U.S., particularly education for
women.
Long also proposes  that  the  legacy  of  book  clubs’  focus  on  literature  and  “culture”  
may  “account  for  the  fact  that  female  undergraduates  have  been  overrepresented in
academic majors involving the appreciation of art and literature. This kind of experience
during college may contribute to the fact that reading groups attract more women than
men  even  now”  (p.  65).  Long also notes, in a discussion of the characteristics of the
books  clubs  she  studied  that  “many  women  join  reading  groups  during  the  time  they  find  
themselves  isolated  in  the  suburbs  with  young  children”  (p.  92).  The  history  of  women’s  
book clubs in the U.S. as described by Long thus also helps to show the ongoing
association of reading with femininity.
Ross (2006), referring to reading research in the United States, notes that more
than 50 years of
large-scale  studies  of  reading….have  reached  certain  fairly stable conclusions.
Women tend to read more than men; younger people tend to read more than those
over age fifty; college-educated people and people with higher annual incomes
tend to read more than those without a college education or with lower incomes;
whites read more than nonwhites. (p. 133)
This statement indicates that overall women more often than men report being avid
readers. This finding is similar to findings in surveys of young readers (discussed below

32

under Section 2.3.3, Research on how children adopt gendered literacy practices), in
which girls, more often than boys, describe themselves as avid readers.
As Millard (1994) points out in  her  work  on  gender  and  literacy,  “activities  that  
are seen as girl-preferred are surrounded with far more taboos for boys than boypreferred  activities  are  for  the  girls”  (p.97).  This  extends  to  reading  behaviors  and  
literature preferences. As a result, Millard (1994) suggests:
Because  boys  have  an  overwhelming  need  not  to  be  seen  as  ‘girlish’,  it  is  
important that books in school should be presented in ways that make them
equally attractive to both sexes if both are to be given equal access to the power
that comes from being a flexible reader. This poses a difficulty for
teachers…because  a  pattern  of  gender  differentiation  is  clearly  discernible  in  their  
pupils’  attitudes  to,  and  choice  of,  popular  reading  at  all  ages.  (p.  98)
Millard here notes that books (i.e. “girl” books, “boy” books) take on gendered values,
and teachers are hard-pressed  to  entice  boys  to  read  books  that  are  considered  “girl”  
books. However, teachers should still encourage students of both sexes to read all
different genres.
Likewise, Alloway and Gilbert (1997) present school-based literacy as gendered.
They explain that in their view the idealized literate school subject is in fact antithetical
to masculinity, which is why boys, in their adoption of the masculine, tend to avoid
reading and reject school-based literacy:
While the literacy classroom encourages them to express their inner selves, to
appreciate  the  canons  of  literature…the wider school context subordinates them
within the student-teacher  authority  structure…Meanwhile,  outside  the  context  of  
the school, boys are encouraged to understand themselves very differently. As
opposed to the social construction of literacy as feminised practice, boys are
expected to understand themselves within sets of masculinised practice. Their
subjectivity is to be marked as different from, and oppositional to, that which is
associated with the feminine. Hegemonic masculinity is not done in terms of selfdisclosure, introspection, personalised and creative expression, but rather in terms
of an outside-of-self, objectified expression. A focus on the psyche, on analysis of
self and others, on personal relations, on moral regulation, is not endorsed within

33

hegemonic standards of masculinity. (“The Literate Subject, the Schoolboy, and
Hegemonic Masculinity,”  para.  7-8)
In other words, the internal, subjective, creative focus endorsed  in  the  “feminized”  
literacy classroom is in opposition to both the school-wide context of teacher/student
hierarchy (in which teachers wield the power) and the outward focus associated with the
practice of hegemonic masculinity in the world outside school. Therefore, in order to
assimilate to hegemonic masculinity, boys tend to reject the practices of the literacy
classroom.
Few researchers address why this sociocultural association of femininity with
literacy has not always translated into significant gains for women. Gilbert (1992), for
one, suggests that although literacy is associated with femininity, such literacy is often
equated only with culturally devalued forms of literate practice. She states:
It is men who are generally regarded as being the writers of philosophy,
psychology, science, history, poetry and drama. Control of the more powerful
discourses lies with men; the lower-status written forms – the service industry of
writing such as secretarial work, family letter-writing, diary entries, genealogical
records, story-writing – are the ones dominated by women workers. (p. 192)
Thus Gilbert (1992) offers the cultural association of the more powerful cultural texts
with the work of men as an explanation for inequalities between men and women.
In summary, literacy – especially as encompassed in particular text types and
contexts (school) – has come to be associated with femininity and held in contrast to
masculinity within Western cultures. This study explores blogs as one site in which such
notions of gendered literacy may be promoted and/or disrupted.
2.3.3 Research on how children adopt gendered literacy practices. Likewise,
although scholars are interested in how children adopt gendered literacy practices, few
have discussed it in depth. The scholarship treating this theme follows the following

34

themes: the way in which children are socialized at early ages to gendered approaches to
literacy; gendered literacy in connection with mothers’  influences;;  and, girls’  tendency
toward greater frequency and enjoyment of reading juxtaposed  with  boys’  tendency  
toward less frequent reading and less enjoyable experience of reading.
2.3.3.1  Children’s  Early  Socialization  to  Gendered  Literacy. Millard (2003), in
the following passage, explains how  children’s  early  socialization  is influenced by
gendered literacy:
Children can be seen to be forming ideas about for whom a specific activity is
most appropriate, whilst being initiated into such seemingly neutral activities as
sharing a book with an adult or being supported in writing a message on a
birthday card. For in their interactions with adults as carers, or teachers, children
begin to establish a sense of their own identities and potentialities as literate
beings. (p. 23)
Children’s  interactions  with  adults,  therefore,  are  important  in  their  developing  sense  of  a  
gendered self in the process of their literacy learning.
Porche, Ross, and Snow (2004) investigate more specifically how this social
adoption of gendered literacy happens. Their findings also suggest that it manifests quite
early  in  children’s  lives.  For  example,  in  their  longitudinal  study  of a diverse sample of
83 low-income students from preschool through middle school, they found that
the early childhood data suggests the subtle beginnings of a divergence in
approach to reading with girls compared to boys. During the preschool reading
activity, boys spent less time talking with their mothers about the books they were
reading and mothers requested less information of them compared to girls. This
pattern  of  talking  about  books  may  be  related  to  boys’  middle  school  interviews,  
in which they tend to elaborate less on the process of reading, compared to girls.
(Porche et al., 2004, p. 355)
This study suggests that boys’  resistance  to  formal  literacy  begins  early  on, influenced by
the fewer verbal interactions they have with their mothers (or fathers) in connection with
books as compared to girls.

35

A large-scale study conducted by the National Literacy Trust of the U.K. also
found evidence of gendered approaches to literacy among parents and teachers of young
children. The study surveyed 1,012 parents children between the ages of three and five
(Formby, 2014, p. 12). Among the parents surveyed, 75.3% of the parents of girls versus
68.7% of the parents of boys reported that  their  child  reads  every  day;;  82.9%  of  girls’  
parents  said  that  their  child  enjoys  stories  “a  lot,”  in  contrast  to  73.7%  of  boys’  parents;;  
and,  88.7%  of  girls’  parents  reported  encouraging  their  children’s  literacy  with  a  wide  
range of behaviors and feeling  “very  confident”  in  their  ability  to  help  their  child  learn  to  
read versus 83.4% of  boys’  parents  (Formby, 2014, p. 9). From these findings, among the
parents sampled more of the parents of girls were aware of and engaged with their
children’s  literacy  than  the  parents  of  boys.  However, regarding the use of touch screens
for literacy activities, 36% parents of boys versus 28.2% of parents of girls reported that
their child uses “a touch screen more for educational activities  than  for  entertainment”  
(Formby,  2014,  p.  10).  Also,  based  on  the  responses  of  the  parents  surveyed,  “twice as
many boys as girls look at or read stories on a touch screen for longer than they look at or
read printed stories (24.0% vs. 12.0%)”  (p.  10).  In light of these findings, among the
parents surveyed, more parents of boys than parents of girls perceived their child as
preferring touch screens for literacy activities.
The study also found that 67.8% of the parents of boys versus 57.8% of the
parents of girls reported that their child looks at or reads “stories more with an adult than
on their own” (Formby, 2014, p. 10). In contrast, based on the responses of the parents
surveyed  “girls are more likely than boys to look at or read stories more without than
with an adult  (18.1%  vs.  10.0%)”  (p.  10). These findings indicate that among the parents

36

surveyed, parents of boys perceived their sons to be less independent in their reading than
parents of daughters.
2.3.3.2 Gendered Literacy in Connection with Mothers’ Influences. The
National Literacy Trust early literacy study discussed above, other than the presentation
of  findings  via  tables,  does  not  comment  specifically  on  the  association  of  parents’  sex  
with their responses. However, upon reviewing the tables, it is evident that in this study
the  parent’s  sex  is  in  several  instances  correlated  with  aspects  of  their  perceptions  and  
support  of  young  children’s  literacy.  For example, among the parents surveyed, more
mothers than fathers perceived  their  children  to  enjoy  both  “printed  stories”  and  those  
presented  “on  touch  screens.”  However,  the  difference  between  mothers  and  fathers  was  
more  pronounced  when  referring  to  “printed  stories,”  with  83.8% of mothers and 70.7%
of  fathers  responding  that  their  child  enjoyed  “printed  stories”  (Formby, 2014, p. 56).
Other  survey  items  look  at  the  extent  to  which  parents  “engage in supportive
activities when sharing printed stories and stories on a touch screen  with  their  child,”  
including:  conversing  with  their  child  “about  the  story;;”  encouraging  their  child  “to  
notice  the  pictures;;”  talking  with  their  child  “about  the  characters;;”  and  engaging  in  
“other  activities  related  to  the  story”  (Formby, 2014, p. 56). Of all these activities,
noticeable differences between mothers and fathers are  evident  in  terms  of  talking  “about  
the  characters”  of  printed  stories,  with  78.3% of mothers saying they did this versus 69.0%
of fathers; and talking with their child about touch screen stories, with 59.3% of mothers
versus 50.7% of fathers responding that they did this. However, in relation to doing
“other  activities  related  to  the  story”  in  terms  of  stories  on  touch  screens,  39.4% of fathers
and only 26% of mothers responded that they did this with their child; thus, this item is

37

the reverse of the trends described above of more mothers engaging in literacy-supportive
activities with their children (p. 56).
The results of this early literacy study then, showed that among the parents
surveyed in the U.K., more mothers than fathers perceived their children to enjoy stories.
Moreover, in relation to engaging in literacy-supportive activities with their children,
larger differences between mothers and fathers were found in terms talking with their
children about the characters of print stories and talking about touch screen stories, with
more mothers engaging in these activities. However, more fathers than mothers did other
activities with their children in connection to touch-screen stories.
Solsken’s  (1993)  ethnographic  research  over  three  years  with  primary  school  
children regarding their literacy practices both at home and in school and the relationship
of literacy learning to conceptions of gender and work led her to conclude the following:
Although children may not be assigned to social categories that determine their
literacy behavior, the evidence from my study also shows consistent patterns over
time in the choices of individual children. These patterns, I argue, have their roots
in family dynamics around literacy in which children establish an orientation
toward literacy, a way of defining themselves in relation to other people in
literacy events. (p. 10)
Here,  Solsken  affirms  children’s  volition  as  individuals  within  the sphere of influence of
their families and within the larger social context of literacy practices. She asserts that the
division  of  labor  in  society  which  results  in  mothers’  and  female  primary  school  teachers’  
exerting the most influence on young children’s  literacy  learning  “may  play  a  key  role  in  
defining literacy as a gender-linked activity and may implicate literacy in the
psychological  and  social  dynamics  of  establishing  gender  identity”  (Solsken, 1993, p.
216). In other words, Solsken (1993) proposes that because women (as mothers and
female teachers) tend to spend more time in contact with young children than men,

38

literacy  (in  its  relationship  to  children’s  psychological  and  social  development  as  
gendered beings), by default, becomes an activity associated with femininity.
Millard (1994) likewise describes how many of the girls she studied expressed
their love of reading as something shared among girlfriends, sisters, and mothers:
Girls frequently mentioned sharing stories with friends and swapping books with
each  other.  They  read  in  each  other’s  company  for  long  periods  of  time  and  
shared  reading  when  they  stayed  at  each  other’s  houses,  an  activity  that  was  never  
mentioned by the boys. Girls also mentioned sharing books with their mothers
and sister as well as their friends. When boys mentioned reading with their
mothers it was to practise their reading rather than to share a common interest in
story. No one described reading with their father and only one girl had a book that
she had chosen because her father had been reading it. (p. 102)
Millard observes that the girls in her study read often and portray reading as a pleasurable
activity they associate with their mothers and other females, whereas boys mentioned
reading with their mothers only in the context of practicing their reading skills.
In a later article, Millard (1997) writes:
One of the first survey questions asked the pupils to name the person or persons
whom they thought had been most helpful in teaching them to read. Mothers were
consistently recorded as the key influence in the early stages of learning, but
where fathers featured in the accounts it was usually as part of the parental team,
rarely alone. Mothers are seen by both sexes to play a key role in their children's
early acquisition of literacy, by organising events which involve their children's
access to books before and beyond the reach of the school. (“Family  Reading,”  
para. 2)
Millard’s  survey  results  therefore  underline  children’s  perceptions  of  their  mothers  as  
their primary literacy teachers.
2.3.3.3  Girls’  Enjoyment of Reading Versus Boys’ Less Enjoyable Experience
of Reading. Studies of larger samples of children surveying their reading preferences
have yielded similar results in terms of the links between a  child’s  sex  and reading
practices. For example, Scholastic Inc.  and  Yankelovich’s  (2008) study of 501 children

39

ages 5-17 from 25 large U.S. cities and their parents/guardians, found the following: that
frequency of reading was less for children over 8 and particularly so for boys (p. 4); that
the boys surveyed were more likely than girls to have difficulty finding books they enjoy
(p. 16); that the children ages 5-11  surveyed  selected  “Mom”  as  their  most  significant  
source  of  “ideas  about  which  books  to  read  for  fun”  (pp. 19-20); and, that parents of the
5-11- year-old  children  surveyed  selected  the  child’s  mother  as  the  person  most  likely  to  
read to or with children at home (p. 22).
A later study by Scholastic Inc. and Harrison Group (2010) found, based on “a
nationally representative sample of 1,045 children age 6–17 and their parents (2,090 total
respondents)”  (p.  4) that  “reading enjoyment, importance, and frequency all decline with
age,  especially  among  boys”  (p.  28).  For  instance,  “only 39% of boys say reading books
for fun is extremely or very important versus 62% of girls”  (p.  24).
The trends pinpointed in the studies discussed above include themes already
discussed: girls’  tendency toward greater frequency and enjoyment of reading juxtaposed
with  boys’  tendency  toward  less  frequent  reading  and  less  enjoyable  experience  of  
reading. However, the studies also provide new insights, for example, pinpointing
mothers as important literacy  teachers  within  the  family.  Also,  Millard’s  study  suggests  
that the reading practices shared between mothers and sons (one of working on reading
skills) may differ from those between mothers and daughters (one of sharing enjoyment
of reading).
As stated before, children do not wholeheartedly accept and adopt every cultural
norm they encounter. Nonetheless, the proposal for the study described in this
dissertation rests on the idea that the sociocultural milieu in which children in the U.S.

40

and other Western cultures are immersed and the beliefs about literacy that adults model
for  them  are  influential  in  children’s  socialization  process  in  terms  of  literacy.
2.3.4 Intersection of gender and literacy summarized. In summary, gendered
literacy represents a challenging intersection of gendered identity, sociocultural context,
and literacy practices. Central to defining gendered literacy are an understanding of
literacy conceived of in sociocultural terms (rather than simply cognitive) and gender
conceived of as a sociocultural construction (and gender roles as learned through family
and school interactions) rather than as a biological phenomenon. Moreover, a recurring
theme of gendered literacy research is the ways in which, within the Western world,
literacy learning and certain modes of literary interest are coded as feminine. Although
scholars have long raised concerns about the ways in which literacy is gendered, few
have synthesized a full understanding of gendered literacy. The study undertaken as part
of this dissertation remedies this shortfall through an extensive review of the literature
and creation of an integrated conceptual model of gendered literacy. Additionally,
through analysis of blog data relating to literacy practices, it examines more specifically
the perspectives of parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers,
children/young adults, and authors, editors, and illustrators in relation to the ways in
which literacy is gendered.
Although recent research on literacy has turned away from cognitive explanations
of literacy learning to focus on sociocultural explanations (including gender), research
that treats the intersection of gender and literacy is still relatively sparse; therefore, this
study adds to this growing knowledge base. A few studies (for example, Porche, et al,
2004; Solsken, 1993) have looked at how children may adopt, through family and school

41

environments, the sociocultural associations between literacy and gender. This study
addresses these gaps and adds to the existing literature by examining blogs as a site in
which sociocultural performances of gendered literacy may occur. Furthermore, it
compares the perspectives of the most prominent actors in relation to literacy learning:
the teachers of literacy, including parents, public librarians, school librarians, and
teachers; literacy learners, including children and young adults; and the creators of texts
for children and young adults – authors, editors, and illustrators.
2.4 Gendered Literacy Enacted by Children
The studies discussed in this section, spanning more than 20 years of scholarship,
treat children’s  gendered reading preferences and approaches to literacy. The majority of
these studies have taken place within the school setting (i.e. Chapman, Filipenko,
McTavish, & Shapiro, 2007; Maynard, 2002; Millard, 1997, 2005; Moss, 2007; Orellana,
1995; Smith & Wilhelm, 2002). In contrast, the study described in this dissertation
analyzes blog data as a site in which to encounter  children’s  and  young  adults’  reading
experiences outside of school, and the blogs represent a naturalistic setting in which to
gather data.
Studies suggest that girls and boys tend to read and write differently and assume
differing relationships to school-based literacy activities. In this sense, researchers
perceive children as enacting a gendered literacy – that is, exhibiting differing literacy
practices according to gender and behaving in ways that are interpreted as genderstereotypical. Review of the literature reveals two salient ways in which researchers
portray  children’s  enactment  of  gendered  literacy:  1)  through  boys’  resistance  to  formal,

42

school-based  literacy  in  comparison  to  girls’  more  enthusiastic  adoption  of  formal  
literacy practice; and,  2)  through  girls’  and  boys’  differing literacy preferences.
2.4.1 Boys resist school-based literacy; girls accept school-based literacy
more readily. Researchers note that although boys tend to resist school-based literacy,
girls more willingly participate in it. Moreover, as will be seen in the studies discussed
below,  this  takes  three  forms  in  terms  of  children’s  literacy  behaviors:  their reading,
writing, and classroom comportment.
2.4.1.1 Reading. Millard (1997), in a study of 255 students, including 121 girls
and 134 boys in nine different South Yorkshire (England) schools, describes what she
perceives as “the  gendered  nature  of  reading” (“Introduction,”  para.  2).  She notes  that  “as  
well as citing themselves more frequently as the person in the family who read the most,
more girls expressed positive attitudes, not only to themselves as readers but also to the
books they were currently reading in school” (“Self-Assessment  of  Reading  Ability,”  
para.  8).  The  female  students  in  Millard’s  study,  therefore,  tended  to  portray  themselves  
as heavy readers and articulate favorable impressions of school-based reading. Moreover,
when asked to identify the best readers in a class, both boys and girls chose to
name girls, only adding, when prompted, the names of boys whom they thought
read out loud in class well, but only if they made a positive effort. Boys, for their
part, were content to see themselves as 'doing OK' at reading, although the
number of them who expressed a positive dislike for having to read, presumably
in class reading  sessions,  was  significant.    (Millard,  1997,  “Self-Assessment of
Reading  Ability,”  para.  13)
In  Millard’s  study,  girls  and  boys  alike  perceive  girls  as  better  readers  and  girls  express  
greater enjoyment of reading than boys, particularly of required school reading.
Millard (1997) describes  other  findings  related  to  the  students’  perceptions  of  
their reading abilities, stating:

43

Many other boys suggested that now they could read they no longer needed to do
so. There were also a larger proportion of boys than girls who described learning
to read as hard, and whose accounts of their learning process suggested that
reading practice had been experienced as something of an imposition.  (“SelfAssessment  of  Reading  Ability,”  para.  6)
Many  of  the  boys  in  Millard’s  study,  then,  characterize  themselves  as  a-literate, seeing
reading as a chore, an activity to avoid although they are able to do it.
Moss’s  (2007)  research  focused  on  reading  preferences  enacted  within  the  school  
context, including 6 classes of 7-9 year olds in 4 British primary schools over a span of 2
years  (p.  60).  In  contrast  to  Millard’s  findings that the boys she studied seemed satisfied
to  view  themselves  as  merely  average  in  terms  of  reading  ability  (Millard,  1997,  “SelfAssessment  of  Reading  Ability,”  para.  13),  Moss  (2007)  notes  that  the  male  students  in  
her study did not want to be considered poor readers (p. 166). However, similar to
Millard (1997), Moss (2007) found that the boys were indeed more likely to be a-literate.
Moss  (2007)  describes  her  labeling  of  students  as  “can/don’t,”  which  she  uses  as  
shorthand for those who can read freely  but  don’t  (p.  125).  Later,  she  states:
There  were  more  boys  than  girls  in  the  ‘can/don’t’  category.  Despite  having  
passed the relevant proficiency threshold, boys in this group were more likely to
use quiet reading time to cluster in the book corner or socialize quietly with a few
friends  with  or  without  a  text  to  hand….When  they  had  made  a  choice  of  what  to  
read at home they were also more likely to abandon that choice after a few pages,
or  alternatively  stick  with  something  they  didn’t  really  like,  spinning out reading
it over many months thus obeying the requirement to be reading something with
little care for what it was. (Moss, 2007, p. 167)
Like  the  boys  in  Millard’s  (1997)  study,  the  boys  Moss  studied  resisted,  by  putting  little  
effort into, curricular reading (even when given choice over what to read).
In a study of 105 fourth and fifth grade students, Wigfield and Guthrie (1997)
found that among the students surveyed, girls overall showed greater positive motivation
in relation to reading (p. 430). And, in Gordon  and  Lu’s (2008) study of a web-based

44

summer reading program for students at a high school in the U.S. (which was
implemented in place of assigning traditional hard copy summer reading lists), among
low achieving students, boys participated at a much lower rate than girls – 42% versus 72%
(“Findings  and  Discussion,”  para.  1).  Similarly,  Greenberg, Gilbert, and Frederick (2006),
in their survey regarding the reading preferences and behavior of middle school students
– 664 in a rural U.S. school and 510 in an inner city school – found  that  “inner-city
students  reported  more  interest  in  reading  than  the  rural  students  did…and  females  in  
both  schools  reported  more  interest  than  their  male  peers”  (p.  165).  In  this  example,  
although inner-city versus rural environment correlated with interest in reading, gender
was even more salient in terms of influence.
These studies reproduce a common theme in research and writing (both popular
and  academic)  about  gender  and  literacy.  They  emphasize  boys’  resistance to schoolbased  reading  in  opposition  to  girls’  greater  acceptance  of  it.  For  example,  the  girls  in  
Millard’s  (1997)  study  were  more  likely  than  boys  to  describe  themselves  as  readers  and  
to display positive attitudes toward school-based reading. And,  in  both  Millard’s  (1997)  
and  Moss’s  (2007)  studies,  boys  were  more  likely  to  characterize  themselves  as  a-literate.
Among  the  student  participants  in  Gordon  and  Lu’s  (2008)  study  of  a  web-based summer
reading program, males numbered fewer than females. Male and female students alike
may perceive female students as better readers (Millard, 1997) and, as Greenburg et al.
(2006) observed, boys tend to characterize themselves as being less interested in reading.
A study examining data from New Zealand's National Educational Monitoring
Programme likewise finds gap in reading enjoyment between boys and girls. The sample,
“drawn from a stratified random sample of 124 schools at year 4 and 126 schools at year

45

8”  (Smith,  Smith,  Gilmore,  &  Jameson,  2012, p. 203), included “480  year  4  (grade  3  in  
the United States) and 480 year 8 (grade 7 in the United States) students”  (p.  203).  Smith
et al. (2012) found  “modest  differences in achievement and self-perception of reading
ability, but that girls reported enjoying reading substantially more than did boys”  (p.  205).  
Similarly, a study by the U.K.’s  National Literacy Trust, which in 2013 surveyed
29,422 youth between the ages of 8 and 16 regarding their reading and writing practices,
found differences between boys and girls. Results of the survey showed a gap between
boys and girls in terms of reading enjoyment, with a larger percentage of the girls
surveyed  reporting  that  they  enjoyed  reading  “very  much”  (29.1% of girls surveyed
versus 20.1% of boys surveyed). Also, 59.8% of girls versus 47.1% of boys surveyed
reported “enjoying  reading  either  very  much  or  quite  a  lot”  (Clark, 2014, p. 12).
According to the survey, “more girls than boys also read for longer periods of time. 29.1%
of girls compared with nearly two-fifths of boys (21.6%) read for one hour or longer.
Conversely, more boys than girls say that they only read for 10 minutes when they read
(boys 23.4%, girls 17.9%) (Clark, 2014, p. 13).
Studies such as those discussed in this review are backed by anecdotal evidence,
as Brian Kenney, former editor-in-chief of School Library Journal,  points  out:  “Almost  
everyone who works with children (as well as many parents) seems challenged, if not
stymied, by trying to engage boys in reading, and, especially, sustaining their interest in
reading  as  they  grow  older”  (Kenney,  September  1,  2007,  para.  4)).  Meanwhile,  girls  are  
perceived as less problematic in terms of reading.
Research and anecdotes alike present a story regarding gendered literacy that
seems simple: boys more often resist reading (particularly curricular-based reading) while

46

girls are more likely to embrace it. However, the study described in this dissertation
develops a more nuanced understanding of gendered literacy which includes the
experiences of parents, public librarians, school librarians, teachers, young people, and
those who create reading materials for young people, in their own words. Moreover, the
studies discussed above, for the most part, either focus on the school context or survey
students within the school environment. In contrast, the study completed for this
dissertation looks more  closely  at  young  people’s  reading from an outside-school vantage
point, and in using blog data, presents a less biased perspective since the participants did
not respond to a survey and were not directly observed.
2.4.1.2 Writing. Researchers have noted that children approach writing in
distinctively gendered ways. For example, Millard (2005), in describing her study of the
writing practices on  a  “castle  map”  project  of a class of 29 8 and 9 year olds in a British
working class neighborhood, notes:
Interestingly, all the non-finishers were boys, although one of the 15 girls had
made a very skimpy attempt at the castle map, preferring to head straight for the
story  booklet  which  she  filled  with  tiny  detailed  writing,  not  wanting  to  ‘waste  
time  drawing’.  All  three  boys  who  failed  to  complete  the  work  had  completed  
very little writing, although using their maps they could talk at length about their
intended stories and participated fully in class discussions. (p. 62)
Here  Millard  highlights  the  boys’  resistance  to  formal  school-based literacy as
represented in the writing project. Although the boys who had not finished the project
orally discussed their work, they resisted doing the formal written work they were
required to do. Meanwhile, in contrast to the boys, the female students embraced the
project’s  writing  tasks.
Millard (2005) further notes that in the study, boys and girls responded differently
when asked about writing processes. She writes:

47

The  boys’  positive  responses  are  typified  in  the  following  comments:
I write best on my computer at night.
I need to talk to get ideas.
I like writing poems not stories.
I love drawing. I get good ideas from film and books.
I write a lot at home and make stories from the television and computer
programmes I have seen.
In contrast, the girls already seemed to be drawing their narratives from a
different stock of home practices, which were closer to those of schooling. Their
semiotic resources were related to their narrative pleasure in fairytales and their
current friendships, which they further cemented by sharing personal and story
writing at home. (p. 63)
Once  again,  Millard,  in  interpreting  her  students’  self-reports of their literacy practices,
highlights  evidence  for  boys’  preference  for  extracurricular  literacy  and  girls’  embracing  
of curricular-oriented literacy.
The National Literacy Trust survey of 29,422 schoolchildren ages 8 through 16 in
the U.K. discussed in the previous section also found differences between boys and girls
in terms of their writing practices and attitudes toward writing. In terms of attitudes
toward writing, the study notes that 55.4% of the girls surveyed versus 38.6% of the boys
reported  enjoying  “writing  either  very  much  or  quite  a  lot”  (Clark, 2014, p. 9). Moreover,
20.9%  of  girls  versus12.3%  of  boys  reported  that  they  “they  enjoy  writing  very  much”  (p.  
9). Additionally, 8.2% of the boys surveyed reported “they  don’t  enjoy  writing  at  all”  in  
contrast to 19.2% of the girls surveyed (p. 9). In terms of writing practices, girls more
often  reported  writing  “more frequently outside class, with 31.8% of girls in 2013 saying
that they write outside class every day compared with only 21.1% of boys”  (Clark, 2014,
p. 10). Among the children surveyed, 4.2 % of the boys, in contrast to 8.7% of the girls,
reported that “they never write outside class” (p. 10). According  to  this  study’s  findings,  
then, among the students surveyed, boys were more reluctant writers than girls. In
contrast  to  Millard’s  (2005)  and  other  researchers’  findings  to  be  discussed  below,  the  

48

National Literacy Trust study did not find boys to be avid writers in regard to writing
outside of school.
Millard’s  (2005)  observations  of  boys’  preference  for  engaging  in  literacy  
activities outside of school find some support in the broader research literature. For
example,  Smith  and  Wilhelm’s  (2002)  qualitative  study  of  a  diverse  sample  of  49  middle  
and high  school  boys  in  the  U.S.  provides  evidence  of  these  boys’  rich  extracurricular  
literate lives. Based on extensive interview data and literacy logs the participants kept,
Smith  and  Wilhelm,  in  “Reading  Don’t  Fix  No  Chevys”:  Literacy  in  the  Lives  of  Young  
Men,  flesh  out  the  boys’  extracurricular  engagement  with  and  creation  of  varied  text  
types in their pursuit of hobbies and interests.
The  research  on  children’s  gendered writing  suggests  that  children’s  writing  
practices may reflect distinctively gendered approaches. More specifically, it
demonstrates the ways in which the girls in these studies more often embraced schoolbased writing while the boys resisted such projects and (with the exception of the
National Literacy Trust survey discussed above) instead preferred to write about topics of
individual interest in extracurricular environments. Like the studies on gender differences
in relation to reading, the studies discussed in this section regarding gender differences in
writing reproduce a common theme  in  research  about  gender  and  literacy:  boys’  
resistance towards school-based  literacy  juxtaposed  with  girls’  greater  willingness  
participate  in  it.  Although  these  studies  provide  valuable  glimpses  into  children’s  and  
young  adults’  literate  worlds,  the study described in this dissertation provides a unique
perspective in examining texts from blogs – texts which, unlike the texts in the studies
reviewed, are both un-solicited and produced in a relatively unobserved fashion.

49

2.4.1.3 Classroom behaviors. Scholars have also investigated how children
comport themselves in terms of classroom literacy tasks and found them to behave in
ways differentiated by gender. Maynard (2002), for example, describes what she
perceives  as  girls’  and  boys’  differing  orientations toward  literacy,  pinpointing  girls’  
teacher-pleasing  behavior  and  boys’  relative  dominance  and  risk-taking behavior as cause
for concern. Maynard (2002), in an action research study conducted with teachers in a
South Wales primary school, regarding the perceived literacy problems of the male
students in the school, found that
the  children  involved  in  this  research  supported  their  teachers’  perceptions that
compared with the boys, the girls were often self-conscious and embarrassed,
wanted to please the teacher and were more compliant. Boys, on the other hand,
tended to be dominant and competitive, were more willing to take risks, and were
less likely to do what they did not want to do. (p. 106)
Maynard  here  contrasts  girls’  compliance  with  school-based literacy activities and selfconscious  behavior  with  boys’  active  resistance  to  formal  literacy  activities.    
Blair (2000), who studied  girls’ and  boy’s  language  usage  in  a  multicultural
eighth grade language arts classroom in a working class, urban, Canadian neighborhood,
similarly  notes  boys’  disruption  of  classroom  activities:  “The  ones  who  spoke  first  and  
loudest, interrupted the most, made side comments to classmates, or mocked previous
ideas were most often the boys”  (p.  316).
Likewise, Millard (1997), in her study of British students, observed:
In  the  set  reading  times…the majority of boys found it much more difficult to
read for any sustained period of time. Girls who were talking appeared to be
sharing bits of their books or swapping them rather than causing a distraction.
Boys frequently got out of their places, allegedly to change their book, but usually
to hang round other boys' desks, once they thought the teacher had taken their
eyes off them. One boy described how reading in his class became either a race,
'it's like the first person to win or finish the book and you don't remember it at all.
You're just getting through it; you just want to finish it'; or, more usually, how the

50

period usually broke up in whispers and an ultimate confrontation with the teacher.
(“Time  Spent  Reading,  para.  5)
In  Millard’s  portrayal  of the classroom she observed she emphasizes boys’  tendency  
towards disruption, competition, and resistance towards assigned literacy activities.
In summary, according to the studies reviewed here, boys are perceived to have
brought elements of competition, distraction, and in some cases, hostility, to classroom
literacy activities. In contrast, girls are perceived to tend toward quiet obedience and selfconscious behavior in the classroom. A U.S. study examining a large sample supports the
smaller observational studies discussed in this review noting apparent gender-based
differences in classroom behavior. With a final sample of 11,300 students, the study
specifically examines the relationship between teacher assessments of elementary
students’  school  behavior  and  students’  academic  achievement (DiPrete & Jennings,
2012, p. 4). DiPrete and Jennings looked  at  data,  drawn  from  the  “Early  Childhood  
Longitudinal Study – Kindergarten cohort (ECLS – K)”  (p.  3),  relating  to  “students’  test  
scores in reading and math at the beginning and end of kindergarten, the end of first
grade, the end of third grade, and the end of fifth grade, plus teacher assessments of
academic achievement and retention in grade after kindergarten, first grade, and third
grade”  (p.  3).  Based  on  these  findings,  DiPrete  and  Jennings  conclude  “that  girls  in  
contemporary America possess advantages in social and behavioral skills over boys and
perform better on standardized  tests  from  the  start  of  kindergarten”  (p.  3).  Moreover,  they  
reject  other  scholars’  insistence  that  such  social  and  behavioral  skills  are  due  to  classbased  differences,  since  according  to  the  findings  based  on  their  sample,  “differences  in  
mean levels of social and behavioral skills by gender are actually larger than are
differences  by  poverty  status”  (p.  3).  In  this  study,  then,  like  other  studies  discussed  in  

51

this review, girls are perceived to display better classroom behavior than boys, which
may impact boys’  reading achievement.
The studies reviewed here reiterate  a  widely  found  “gap”  in  literacy  behaviors  
between  boys  and  girls:  boys’  resistance  to  school-based  literacy  versus  girls’  more  
willing participation. The studies describe in detail a persistent social differential in boygirl reading. However, although these studies represent glimpses of and attitudes toward
gendered classroom literacy behaviors, their focus on school-based literacy is limiting.
The study completed as part of this dissertation, by analyzing blogs, examines more
closely  young  people’s  approaches  to  extracurricular  reading.  Moreover, in studying
blogs as a sociocultural site for the performance of gendered literacy, it is possible to
analyze unobtrusively how multiple actors involved in the teaching of literacy and
consumption of texts for young people enact and/or resist traditional notions of gendered
literacy.
2.4.1.4 Girls and boys report differing literacy preferences. Along  with  boys’  
resistance  towards  and  girls’  penchant  for  formal  literacy,  another  enactment  of  gendered  
literacy  involves  boys’  and  girls’  differing  literacy preferences. The scholarship,
discussed  below,  focuses  on  girls’  and  boys’  differing  reading  preferences, differing
approaches to writing, and differing uses of computers in relation to writing.
2.4.1.4.1 Reading preferences. Studies  focusing  on  boys’  and  girls’  differing  
reading preferences are based primarily on reader preference surveys. For example, Hall
and Coles (1997), in a replication study, surveyed 7,976 schoolchildren (ages 10, 12, and
14) throughout England, regarding their reading behaviors. They report:
In terms of broad genre categories, the children's responses to the survey
demonstrate that, as a proportion of their total reading diet, girls read

52

comparatively more adventure, horror and ghost, animal and school-related
stories and slightly more poetry. The differences between the sexes are
particularly marked in relation to books about relationships and romance. A
greater percentage of boys' reading diet is science fiction and fantasy, sportsrelated books and war and spy stories. More boys than girls read comic and joke
books, annuals and humorous fiction. Interestingly, crime and detective works are
equally popular as a proportion of the reading diet of both sexes. This stands out
as the only such book type in the survey. Generally the data reveal very marked
differences in the subjects which girls and boys find attractive. (Hall & Coles,
1997,  “Children’s  Reading  Choices,”  para.  14)
English children surveyed for this study express different reading preferences in terms of
genre, converging only in regard to crime and detective fiction.
The  U.K.’s  National  Literacy  Trust  study  (discussed earlier) which surveyed
29,422 students ages 8 through 16 regarding their literacy practices, also found distinct
differences in reading preferences between boys and girls. The study notes that the girls
surveyed reported reading a wider variety of texts than the boys surveyed. For example,
the  girls  reported  reading  “technology-based formats, such as text messages, messages on
social  networking  sites,  emails  and  instant  messages,  as  well  as  more  ‘traditional’  texts,  
such as fiction and poems, magazines and lyrics,”  whereas more boys than girls reported
reading  “newspapers, comics and manuals”  (Clark, 2014, p. 13).
A larger study of the reading preferences of students in the U.K., What Kids are
Reading 2012 (Topping & Renaissance Learning, 2012), uses data drawn from
Accelerated Reader, educational software produced by Renaissance Learning. These data
were created from “quizzes taken by UK pupils on books read between August 1, 2010
and  July  31,  2011”  and include “results for 213,527 children in 1,237  schools” (Topping
&  Renaissance  Learning,  2012,  “Summary  and  Discussion,”  para.  1).  Based on data for
this student sample, boys read books of similar difficulty to those read by girls, but
students also showed some distinct gendered reading preferences in terms of favored

53

authors. Moreover,  “girls tended to choose  books  with  female  role  models”  (“Summary  
and  Discussion,”  para.  5). Starting  from  year  5,  a  trend  of  male  students’  preference,  
which was especially marked from year 7 onward, for non-fiction was clear (“Summary  
and  Discussion,”  para.  8), but boys were not choosing more difficult books and were not
reading non-fiction  titles  “carefully”-- as evidenced in their book quiz scores (para. 9).
A similar assessment conducted in the U.K. in 2014, also using Accelerated
Reader software collected data from 426,067 students (years 1 through 13) in 2,016
schools and for more than 6,544,973 books read over July 2012 through August 2013
(Topping & Renaissance Learning, 2014, p. iv), yielded different results. In 2014, in
contrast to previous years, “boys seem to be doing as well as girls in terms of the
difficulty  of  the  books  they  are  choosing” (Topping & Renaissance Learning, 2014, p.
17). Moreover, the reading “choices  of  boys  and  girls have become much more similar,
although  not  only  by  girls’  becoming  more  like  boys’  – the opposite is also true”  (p.  17).
Moreover,  for  the  2014  study,  in  terms  of  the  quizzes,  “boys are performing equally as
well as girls”  (p. vi). Thus, the 2014 results indicate some reversal of the trends noted in
the 2012 study in which boys from year 5 on were reporting choosing books rated as less
difficult, and in which stronger distinctions in the preferences of male students versus
female students were noted.
Although these studies are based on data collected by a for-profit company,
thereby introducing significant bias, they are still a useful barometer of U.K. children’s  
reading preferences, as the software is widely used among schools (in both the U.K. and
the U.S.).

54

Sturm’s  (2003) study of 2,000 responses to a survey administered to patrons ages
2 -18 of the State Library of North Carolina, found areas of both overlap and difference
in  boys’  and  girls’  reading  preferences.  For  example,  although  “the  top  four  categories”  
of reading preference were the same for both males and females, “the  rank  order  is  
slightly different: animals, science, sports, and literature (for girls the categories of sports
and literature are reversed)”  (Sturm,  2003,  “Results  and  Discussion,”  para.  3).  Also,  there  
were differences by sex within larger categories. For instance, girls and boys in roughly
equal numbers wanted to read about science  (Sturm,  2003,  “Results  and  Discussion,”  
para.  1),  but  within  science  as  a  larger  category,  “girls preferred geography and botany
more  than  boys,  and  boys  liked  astronomy  and  anatomy  more  than  girls” (“Results  and  
Discussion,”  para.  6).  
Millard (1994), in her study of English adolescents, found more girls were able to
identify their favorite author and more girls chose sanctioned texts and authors as
favorites (that is, ones teachers would recommend for their age group) (p. 56).
Additionally, more girls than boys described themselves as heavy readers (Millard, 1997,
“Time  Spent  Reading,”  para.  2). Similar to Hall and Coles (1997), Millard (1997) also
found that boys reported  a  preference  for  comics  (“Introduction,”  para.  5). Millard (1994)
concludes that overall  her  “research…has  provided  strong  evidence  to  support  a  prior  
perception  that  boys’  and  girls’  orientation  towards  work  in  language  – that is their
attitudes to reading and writing – becomes increasingly divergent as they enter the
secondary phase of  education”  (p.  149).
In  contrast  to  Millard’s  (1994)  conclusions  that  differences  between  girls’  and  
boys’  literacy  preferences increase with age, Davies and Brember (1993), in their study

55

of  611  students  (Years  2,  4,  and  6)  within  “a random sample of six schools within the
primary schools of one local education authority (LEA)”  (“Abstract”)  in  England,  found  
“that while there were several significant differences between the boys and girls in the
younger age range, these became progressively fewer as the age  group  increased”  
(“Abstract”). Similar  to  other  researchers’  findings,  however,  Davies  and  Brember  found  
that  “the biggest difference between the obtained and expected frequencies is that more
girls than expected chose stories and more boys than expected  chose  comics”  (“Results  
and  Discussion,”  para.  13)– providing yet another example of girls and boys
demonstrating differing literacy preferences in relation to reading content.
Millard (1994) notes that
many more boys than girls read publications connected with a hobby or leisure
interest, like Angling Times or computer magazines with facts and information,
and comics that included action-packed adventures. The girls chose magazines
about pop music and fashion, which contained far more narrative material and
personal interest stories. (p. 103)
Millard here notes  that  in  addition  to  boys’  and  girls’  differing  subject  matter  interests,  
text features may be differentially attractive to boys and girls. For example, the boys
surveyed in this study, compared to the girls, preferred leisure reading materials with
more facts and less text.
A study of the reading and writing preferences of Finnish students (ages 10 – 11:
67 boys, 78 girls),  similar  to  other  studies  discussed  in  this  section,  describes  girls’  
greater interest in reading. Girls reported being more motivated than boys to read books
and to visit the library (Merisuo-Storm, 2006, p. 117). Like other studies, Merisuo-Storm
also found that boys preferred comics and non-fiction. Regarding specific reading
preferences, the boys studied preferred comics, humor, and adventure (in that order).

56

Girls preferred the same genres but in a different order: adventure, humor, and comics (p.
117).  Moreover,  “most boys said they would hate to read poems, but stories and fairytales
were nearly as unpopular as poems. Non-fiction and poetry were genres that least
appealed to most girls. In fact for Finnish 10- or 11-year-old pupils poetry seemed to be
the  least  interesting  genre  of  literature”  (pp.  117-118). Children of both genders reported
interest in reading series books, but “boys were even more interested in series of books
than girls”  (p.  118). Merisuo-Storm (2006) sums up boys’  reported love of series as
follows: “It  is  easy  to  pick  up  a  book  that  belongs  to  a  familiar  series from the library
shelf; one can predict what the story will be like. Moreover, as it is important for boys to
know that the book they choose is not  a  ‘‘girl  book,’’ a series of books is a safer choice”  
(p. 118). Merisuo-Storm  thereby  explains  boys’  preference  for  series  as  a  function  of  
series books being convenient and predictable in terms of story, and safe in terms of
gender-coding.
In critique of the types of reading preference studies described above, Moss (2007)
states that such studies often
treat differences in genre preferences between boys and girls as a given, and ask
few questions about why or how such preferences develop. Instead, genre
preferences are understood as an expression of gendered identities which already
exist fully fledged and largely independent of the social contexts in which literacy
learning takes place. (p. 61)
Moss  hereby  criticizes  what  she  sees  as  other  researchers’  non-contextualized
investigations  into  children’s  reading  preferences  in  which  such  preferences  are  seen  as  
manifestations  of  children’s  gendered  selves. Moss presents her own research as an
alternative approach – an  approach  she  refers  to  as  “understanding  the  social  construction  
of  genre  preferences”  (p  87).  Her  studies  focus  on  the  playing  out  of  reading  preferences  

57

within the classroom -- 6 classes of 7-9 year olds in 4 British primary schools over a span
of 2 years (p. 60).
As  an  example  of  Moss’s  (2007)  more  contextualized  approach,  she  discusses  the  
boys’  (in  the  schools  that  were  the  sites  for  her research) preference for non-fiction text
as a function of their being labeled less proficient readers.
Low  proficiency  rankings  seemed  to  conflict  more  with  these  boys’  sense  of  selfesteem  than  they  did  for  girls….Non-fiction texts gave them somewhere to go.
Indeed, precisely because of the prevalence of illustration in these texts they
provided one of the few arenas where more and less able boys could meet on a
level, as it were. Boys designated as weak readers could muster their expertise in
response to such a text without having to stumble through the print to identify
what  was  going  on….This  was  an  advantage  in  relation  to  boys’  status  politics.  It  
seemed to work less well in terms of making progress with their reading. For one
net result of the strategies they employed was that many such boys simply spent
less time on verbal text. (p. 87)
Moss shows how, in the classrooms she observed, boys labeled as less able readers often
chose to read non-fiction texts, which, with their abundance of illustrations, provided a
less text-intensive reading  experience.  As  a  result  of  these  boys’  more  often  choosing  
non-fiction, Moss also perceived that they did not progress as rapidly in terms of their
reading  abilities.  Moss’s  research thereby provides a contextualized answer to the
question of why the boys in the classrooms she observed gravitated towards illustrationrich non-fiction and the effects on their reading.
McKechnie (2004) analyzed the home collections of books and other texts of
fifty-two children (most of whom were living in Southern Ontario, Canada) ages 4
through 12 and interviewed them about their collections. Like other studies discussed in
this section, McKechnie observed  differences  between  the  boys’  and  girls’  reading  
preferences, in this case measured through the contents of the children’s  personal  
libraries and nuanced through qualitative interviews with the children about their reading

58

practices and preferences. Like Moss (2007), McKechnie (2006), in follow-up interviews
with forty-three boys, found that the boys were interested in non-fiction, even noting that
“when asked which was their favorite title in their collection, many identified a nonfiction  work”  (p.  62). Unlike Moss (2007), however, McKechnie (2006) does not see this
as an indication of and/or function of weaker reading ability on the part of the boys
studied. Rather, she sees it as cause for educators, including librarians, to expand  “their
understanding of what constitutes real reading, as described and lived by boys
themselves”  and  to  develop  library  collections accordingly (p. 66).
In  terms  of  girls’  and  boys’  differing  genre  preferences,  McKechnie (2006), here
referring  to  boys’  preferences,  found that:  “Some  genres  appeared  more  frequently  and  
were different from the genres in the collections of the girls who participated in the larger
study.  These  included  fantasy,  science  fiction,  sports  stories,  and  funny  stories”  (p.  61).  
Moreover,  the  boys  shunned  certain  categories,  including  “classic  children’s  fiction”  and  
“love stories and books about groups of girls, such as the popular Babysitter’s  Club series”  
(p. 61). There was overlap in boys’  and  girls’  preferences  in  terms of some favorite series,
“like  the  Magic Treehouse books,”  but  “other series, including Captain Underpants,
Redwall, and Animorphs, were almost exclusively found on the boys’ shelves”  (p.  61).
In yet another more qualitative, contextualized study, Dutro (2003) notes the ways
in which the African-American 5th grade male classmates she studied performed
masculinity in their discussions of their literacy preferences within the classroom:
The  boys  perform  masculinities  through  their  talk  about  their  own  and  girls’  
reading preferences. All of their stated preferences center on sports and superhero  comics….When I asked them what girls like to read, the books they
mentioned  were  “books  about  Barbies,”  The Babysitters Club, American Girl
series, and The Boxcar Children series. Except for The Boxcar Children all of
these series are highly gendered. (Dutro, 2003, p. 488)

59

In  Dutro’s  account,  gendered  literacy  is  evident  as  a  function  of  reading preference.
Dutro’s  male  students,  however,  later  defied  masculinity  while  talking  about  the  
American Girl books they had been required to read for literature circles:
Kenneth’s  comment  appeared  to  clear  a  safe  space  for  positive  talk  about  the  
books. Even Anthony who claimed to dislike the books, jumped into the
conversation to defend his favorite character. After Kenneth helped to create a
space for the boys to include positive talk about these books, the conversation
turned to the books in more detail. (Dutro, 2003, p. 490)
From  Dutro’s  example  of  these  boys  who  at  first  eschewed  the  girl-friendly American
Girl books and later admitted interest when another boy tacitly approved of a change in
the conversation, children’s  potential both to uphold and disrupt dominant conceptions of
gendered literacy is evident.
Similar  to  Dutro’s  (2003)  results,  which  attest  to  the  malleability  of  the  reading  
preferences of girls and boys, a study of the book preferences and selections of a sample
of 40 first graders from four different Greater Vancouver (Canada) schools found that
“only  a  small  number  of  children  preferred  information  books,  with  little  difference in
genre preferences between boys and girls”  (Chapman, Filipenko, McTavish, & Shapiro,
2007, p. 540). However, when asked which books the opposite sex would prefer, “the
boys chose considerable more stories than information books for girls and the reverse for
boys….Like  the  boys,  the  girls  also  thought  that  boys  prefer  information  books  and  that  
girls prefer stories (Chapman et al. 2007, p. 538). In  this  case,  then,  the  children’s  true  
preferences were not necessarily the same as what would be expected based on their sex
(with boys preferring information books and girls preferring stories). Additionally, even
though “both  boys  and  girls  clearly  liked  aspects  of  books  that  might  be  attributed  
(gender-stereotypically) as more attractive to one gender  or  the  other”  (Chapman  et al.,

60

2007, p. 544), they still held stereotypical gendered expectations of what boys and girls
should prefer to read.  Chapman  et  al.  thereby  conclude  that  their  “data provide strong
support  for  the  theory  that  children’s  conceptions of gender and literacy are socially
constructed”  (p.  546).  
Among the studies discussed in this section, differing trends in reading
preferences between the male and female participants are evident. For example, the male
participants in studies by Dutro (2003), Hall and Coles (1997), McKechnie (2006), and
Sturm (2003) all expressed a greater preference (in comparison to girls) for sports-related
materials.  Many  of  the  studies  report  boys’  preference  for  comics (Davies and Brember,
1993; Dutro, 2003; Hall and Coles, 1997; Merisuo-Storm, 2006; Millard, 1994; Millard,
1997). Furthermore, McKechnie (2006), Millard (1994), and Moss (2007) all observed
boys’  preference  for  fact-filled texts containing fewer words. In the study just discussed
above (Chapman et al. 2007),  although  the  children’s  self-described reading preferences
did not always follow the stereotype of girls preferring stories and boys preferring
information books, the children, when surveyed, expected these stereotyped preferences
of children of the opposite sex.
Studies of children’s reading practices are also beginning to investigate gender in
relation to media preferences and reading. For example, a study of the attitudes toward
reading, scores on standardized reading tests, and reading responses of 199 struggling
middle school readers in Texas found that, after two months of using Amazon Kindle® ereaders during silent reading time (15-25 minutes per day at school) (Miranda, WilliamsRossi, Johnson, & McKenzie, 2011, pp. 81, 83-84), “significant increases were found for
boys on one variable - the value of reading”  (Miranda et al., 2011, p. 81). The increasing

61

popularity of e-readers is likely to fuel more studies like this one, and could examine
whether gendered patterns exist in the use of e-readers.
The studies discussed in this section primarily support the perception that girls
and boys have distinct reading preferences. Moreover, the study by Chapman, Filipenko,
McTavish, and Shapiro (2007) suggests that even when children’s  reading  preferences  do  
not match the gender stereotypes, they are well aware of existing stereotypes. However,
the studies, for the most part, do not examine in depth where these differing reading
preferences originate. The one exception is Moss (2007), who describes a selfperpetuating cycle of underachievement within the school environment as the male
students she studied, who had been pegged as less proficient readers, more often chose to
read non-fiction (less text, more illustrations) and thereby missed opportunities to engage
more challenging reading materials that might help them improve their reading. However,
Moss (2007), in focusing so closely on the classroom environment, misses the larger
sociocultural picture regarding gendered literacy. The study undertaken as part of this
dissertation examines blogs as a sociocultural site in which the perpetuation of gendered
values in connection to literacy may play out.
Brozo (2010) writes of his experiences as a high school English and reading
teacher, saying that what he has seen in the classroom match research findings regarding
boys and reading and more specifically “that males have always outnumbered females in
remedial  reading  centers”  (p. 19). Similar to other educators, he also supports the notion
of  boys’  reading  preferences  as different  from  those  of  girls’.  He suggests offering boys,
especially boys who struggle with reading or are not engaged in reading, fiction featuring
“positive  male  archetypes,”  developed from the Jungian concept of male archetypes (p.

62

14), including, for example, The Pilgrim, Warrior, King, Healer, Prophet, among others
(p. 26). He  also  suggests  offering  boys  “graphic  novels,  comic  books,  information  books,  
hobby manuals, survival  guides,  and  electronic  media”  (p.  5).  Moreover,  he notes the
importance of choice, meaning that boys can choose what they read, and control, that
boys help decide the assessments and activities they do in connection with the chosen
texts (pp. 18-19). Brozo’s tone is positive in terms of offering strategies for helping boys
to enjoy reading, but at the same time he labels boys reluctant and remedial readers.
2.4.1.4.2 Writing interests. Researchers have also observed differences in writing
between girls and boys both in terms of style and in choice of narrative content. Paley
(1984) shows how such differences in storytelling may begin quite early. In her account
of how kindergarteners enact gender through play, she says:
Every year, the girls begin with stories of good little families, while the boys
bring us a litany of superheroes and bad guys. This kind of storytelling is an
adjunct of play; it follows existing play and introduces new ideas for the
future…the  children  take over the story-plays for a more urgent matter; to inform
one another of the preferred images for boys and girls. (Paley, 1984, p. 3)
In this excerpt, Paley (1984) illustrates the connection between gendered literacy and
children’s  development  of  gender identity. In conforming to gender-stereotypical modes
of literacy (and play), they rehearse and teach one another gender roles.
In another study of early literacy, Solsken (1993) comments on what she
perceives  as  important  aspects  of  boys’  and  girls’  (K-grade 2) differing literacy
preferences. Although she prefaces the following excerpt by explaining that there were
also genres that interested both boys and girls for both reading and writing, she discusses
in detail the differences between girls and boys in the ways in which they wrote about
“fantasy  fiction,”  stating:

63

the  lead  roles  in  their  own  stories  were  almost  always  of  the  same  gender…
Fantasy stories written by boys involved themes of physical combat and
competition,  disaster  and  rescue….The  girls’  fantasy  stories  involved  searches  or  
magical transformation – wishes, potions, events that were suddenly beautiful or
strange, problematic perhaps, but not usually threatening, and problems were
never  resolved  through  violence….Male  characters  frequently  appeared  in  
supporting roles as fathers, brothers, and companions. These themes were
especially predominant in the pieces co-authored by peers, which with very rare
exceptions were always fantasy fiction and were always written in same-gender
pairs, suggesting that children were negotiating important gender issues in this
writing. (p. 209)
For Solsken (1993), the differing content in the fantasy stories authored by the boys and
girls she observed is paramount. Stories written by boys featured adventure and
competition  (often  violent)  and  almost  exclusively  male  protagonists.  Girls’  stories,  in  
contrast, more often resembled fairytales, featuring female leads and magical quests and
changes. Girl and boy authors alike favored writing about lead characters who were their
same sex. Solsken also notes that, when co-authoring stories, children chose to work with
peers of their same sex.
The work of other researchers confirms the perception of children’s  reliance  on  
gender-stereotypical literacy behaviors throughout elementary school in completing
written projects. For example, Millard and Marsh (2001), based on their research on
children’s  literacy,  conclude that boys and girls approach literacy tasks in different ways.
Here they summarize such differences:
Girls often spend time on decoration and embellishment; boys focus on action,
cartoon figures and scenarios. These differently gendered approaches to the use of
drawing  to  inform  writing  are  present  from  the  earliest  years….Clear  gender  
differences were found in the way in which drawing related to the written word in
all three classes. Girls tended to draw stylized images of children, houses and
flowers providing decoration, rather than key aspects of the text in question. In
some cases, girls produced drawings of houses and children, no matter how varied
the topic chosen. (Millard & Marsh, 2001, p. 57)

64

From  Millard  and  Marsh’s  observations,  gendered literacy may take the form of
differences in the drawings boys and girls do to illustrate narrative text in early
elementary school. The girls in this study decorated their stories with stylized versions of
houses, children, and flowers (often regardless of the narrative subject matter) while the
boys’  drawings,  in  contrast,  were action and cartoon-oriented.
McPhail’s (2008) doctoral dissertation studies whether the allowance for more
choice and inclusion of more boy-friendly topics and genres (including a comic book unit)
in the writing curriculum for first graders leads to better student writing. McPhail
summarizes:  “My analysis suggests that there were gendered literacy interests in the class
and that most students felt more free, more motivated to write, and performed at higher
levels when experimenting  with  genres  of  interest”  (from abstract). McPhail thereby
assumes the differing literacy preferences of boys and girls in the class and argues that
encouraging students to follow these gendered interests in writing results in higher
quality writing.
Merisuo-Storm (2006), in a study of the reading and writing preferences of a
sample of 10-11 year old Finnish students (also  discussed  in  the  “reading  choice”  section  
above), found a strong correlation between enjoyment of reading and enjoyment of
writing for both boys and girls (pp. 119-120).  However,  in  general,  girls’  ratings  of  
writing  were  significantly  higher  than  boys’  (p.  120).  Regarding writing preferences,
male and female students alike rated writing to a pen pal as the most enjoyable among the
choices of writing activities. Girls rated writing in a diary second best among the choices
of writing activities and writing stories as third best. Boys, on the other hand, rated storywriting or writing a letter to an author as second best (Merisuo-Storm, 2006, p. 120).

65

Exploring the  Finnish  students’  preferences for story-writing in more detail,
Merisuo-Storm (2006) notes:
Pupils had been writing stories in school from the first grade onwards and the
process  was  familiar  to  all  of  them.  ‘‘I  love  it’’  or  ‘‘I  like  it’’  were  the  answers
given by 81% of the pupils. The boys were, however, not as eager writers as the
girls. The difference between the two groups is significant…. Nevertheless, the
girls  enjoyed  writing  in  a  diary  even  more.  ‘‘Would  you  like  to  keep  a diary?’’  is  
the question in the questionnaire that divided the opinions of the two genders the
most  clearly.  ‘‘I  would  hate  it’’  replied  34%  of  the  boys,  and  30%   of them said,
‘‘I  would  not  like  it.’’  Both boys and girls found poetry the least attractive genre
of writing. However, girls’  answers  were  significantly  more  positive  than  boys’  
answers. (p. 121)
In this case, despite  these  students’  familiarity  and  comfort  with  story-writing, the boys,
in the aggregate, preferred story-writing less so than girls. And, girls preferred writing in
a diary much more so than did boys. Neither boys nor girls preferred writing poetry, but
girls rated it significantly higher than boys. None of the other studies examined for this
literature review looked at diary-writing, but based on this study, in which girls preferred
diary writing, it could be argued that diary writing is coded as a feminine literacy practice.
Orellana’s  (1995)  findings  echo  those  of  other  researchers  in  terms  of  children’s  
gendered writing behaviors; however, Orellana also shows specifically how such
behaviors are replicated and thereby cemented through classroom practice. In an article
based on her dissertation research, Orellana describes her ethnographic study of two
southeast Los Angeles elementary school (Spanish-English bilingual) classrooms
consisting of students who were mostly Central American (primarily Mexican) first,
second, and third generation immigrants.
Orellana observes that the students in Classroom B, despite having free choice in
writing topics,  “express  themselves  as  gendered  persons  through  the  topics  they  choose  to  
write about. In doing this, they create a markedly  gendered  literacy  environment”  (p.  696).

Orellana’s  “analysis  of  the  topics  revealed  a  marked  split  in  the  themes  chosen  by  girls  
and  boys,  with  minimal  overlap”  (p.  695).  For  example,  among  other  topics,  the  boys  
wrote about battles between good and evil forces, sports, superheroes, vehicles, and war
and  peace  (p.  235).  In  contrast,  the  girls’  preferred  themes  included,  for  instance,  
“personified  butterflies,  hearts,  rainbows,  and  flowers,  etc.,”  school,  and  romance  (p.
235).  The  only  topics  that  both  girls  and  boys  chose  to  write  about  “were  Animals,  
Ghosts,  etc.,  Family/Home,  Holidays,  Friends,  Disney,  and  Getting  Rich/Money”  (p.  236).  
Moreover,  Orellana  notes,  “none  of  these  were  the  most  popular  themes  for  both  girls and
boys”  (p.  236).  Furthermore,  similar  to  Solsken  (1993),  Orellana  found  that  the  girls  
tended to write only about female characters while boys tended to write only about male
characters (pp. 232-233). Like Solsken (1993), she also noted that when writing in pairs,
students tended to work in same-sex pairs (Orellana, 1995, p. 220).
Orellana (1995) concludes that the gendered literacy environment fostered in
large  part  through  the  children’s  book-writing activities is reproduced and reinforced via
the following process:
The books that they wrote were available for others to read, and were in fact the
most popular books in the class library. These books, in turn, served as important
sources of inspiration for the further production of books….The role of peer
culture in the text-production process should be underscored. Most students said
they got their ideas from the stories that their friends had written. Since most of
their friendships were divided along gendered lines, this shows how gender, as
expressed through peer relations, was used to construct literacy and how literacy
in turn served to construct gender. (p. 696)
Not only did the students follow gendered patterns in their writing, but in interacting with
one  another  and  one  another’s  texts,  they  reproduced these gendered patterns. In
Orellana’s  classroom  examples,  therefore,  children’s  use  of  gender  specific literacy

67

preferences (in this case, writing topics) became a significant vehicle for the enactment
and ongoing maintenance of gender identity and gendered literacy.
Other investigations into gender differences in writing have focused on older
students and have found continued differentiation between girls and boys. For example,
in  observing  Canadian  middle  school  students’  projects  over  a  year,  Sanford  (2005/2006)  
noted that despite having wide berth for creativity,
students repeatedly selected gender-appropriate topics and modes of presenting,
not thinking or being encouraged to consider different possibilities. For example,
most of the girls chose to write stories or poems about friends and family, going
shopping, comparing fashion ideas. Pets and other animals figured largely in the
girls' writing. Most of the boys chose to write about adventures, activities, and
humorous incidents (generally involving some type of accident and
embarrassment). Vehicles, machines, and weapons figured largely in the boys'
representations. (p. 308)
Once  again,  gender  stereotypes  play  out  in  these  children’s  literacy  practices,  boys  
focusing on action and adventure, machines, weapons, and vehicles and girls focusing on
activities of family and friends, shopping, fashion, and pets and other animals.
Millard (1997), based on her analysis of English high school students’  writing  
samples,  comments  both  on  girls’  and  boys’  differing  choices  of subject matter and
differing writing styles. Specifically, she states  that  boys’ “models  for  narrative  
composition  are  less  literary  than  those  of  the  girls”; they use a broader range of
characters than girls but these characters display “a  lack  of  empathy for the opposite sex
and their feelings.” Moreover, their writing tends to be “focused  on  action  and  the  factual  
information  provided  by  the  texts  they  read  or  the  narratives  they  watch”  (Millard, 1997,
p. 145). In  Millard’s  assessment,  therefore,  boys’  writing  tends  to  be  less  literary  and  
more action and fact-oriented  than  girls’, and although boys utilize a more diverse cast of
characters, these characters are less empathetic towards the opposite sex.

68

Although  the  contexts  for  these  studies  (for  instance,  in  terms  of  the  children’s  
ages)  are  varied,  they  present  some  patterns  in  boys’  and  girls’  writing  topic  preferences.  
For example, several of the researchers mention that family and domestic scenes, animals,
and  flowers  figure  prominently  in  the  girl  participants’  writing  (and  drawing).  On  the  
other  hand,  boys’  writing  tends  to  include  action/adventure,  superheroes,  and  violent  
struggles. These studies also note that boys and girls tend to approach writing in different
ways, for example in the ways in which they illustrate their stories (Millard & Marsh,
2001), utilize characters, or the degree to which they include verbal text (with boys
including less) (Millard, 1997).
Although Orellana (1995) looks at how the teachers worked to make gender an
important factor in the classroom literacy environments she observed (this is treated in
more detail in a later section), the other studies reviewed here do not discuss the literacy
teachers’  perspectives, which might provide insight into the perpetuation of and/or
changing of gendered norms in relation to literacy. The study undertaken as part of this
dissertation,  in  analyzing  blogs  authored  by  young  people’s  literacy  teachers,  examines
how literacy continues as a gendered enterprise. Moreover, most of the studies take place
in school settings. This study treats blogs as another important sociocultural site – a site
that can be unobtrusively accessed – for the enactment of gendered literacy. It compares
blog narratives written by literacy teachers (parents, public librarians, school librarians,
and teachers), creators of texts for children, and children/young adults, treating these blog
narratives as sociocultural artifacts in order to better understand the phenomenon of
gendered literacy. It then compares the blog narratives to a conceptual model of gendered

69

literacy developed from a review of the existing literature in an attempt to identify larger
trends in terms of gender and literacy.
2.4.1.4.3 Computer usage in relation to literacy. Almjeld’s  (2008) doctoral thesis,
“The Girls of MySpace: New Media as Gendered Literacy Practice and Identity
Construction,”  is  not  a  study comparing girls to boys; however, it provides a glimpse of
how girls may perform gender through their use of social media. Almjeld (2008) looks at
teenage  girls’  gendered  expressions  of  self  in  25  MySpace  profiles,  thereby  examining  
“the role MySpace plays in the performance of both womanhood and teenhood”  (from
abstract). Almjeld (2008) finds that “MySpace  appears  a  place  where  girls  can  speak  out  
and find society with others playing and experimenting with identity construction”  
(p.155). Boys’  MySpace  profiles  might  look  very  different from those of the girls
Almjeld studied, and although this study does no comparative analysis of this sort, it
provides a potential starting point for comparison. The study is also helpful in suggesting
how gendered literacy may be performed in the digital environment.
Williams  (2006/2007),  in  contrast,  is  more  interested  in  comparing  girls’  and  boys’  
differing uses of computers as evidence of gendered literacy, stating:
Although the uses girls put computers to seem less directly competitive than what
boys do with technology, girls often use computers for highly literate practices in
ways that boys sometimes do not. A role-playing computer game favored by girls,
such as The Sims, may involve more reading and writing than a first person
shooter, such as Half-Life, which is popular with boys. (p. 304)
Williams, in his informal observations and conversations with adolescent girls in school
settings, has found adolescent girls to be using computers as frequently as boys but using
them in ways different from  those  of  boys.  These  differences  include  girls’  less  
competitive uses and preference for computer games and pursuits that involve them in

70

more literacy-intensive  activities.  Williams’  musings  are  more  anecdotal  than  empirical;;  
however, his analysis merits further exploration in terms of the ways in which boys and
girls may use computers differently in terms of literacy.
Almjeld  (2008),  mentioned  above,  looks  only  at  girls’  use  of  MySpace  and  
concentrates on their use of MySpace as an identity-building exercise. The study
described in this dissertation, in contrast, focuses on blogs. From the pilot study
conducted prior to this study, girls (and perhaps women as well) appear to be better
represented in the blogosphere than boys, and girls use “book”  blogs  to  introduce  and  
review books they have read. Therefore, in drawing the sample for this study, care was
taken to include blogs written by males, to allow for comparison. Analyzing what these
narratives say about the bloggers’  literacy experiences in relation to gender is the focus of
this study.
2.5 Gendered Literacy Enacted by Educators and those in the Publishing Industry
Few studies have addressed gendered literacy from the perspectives of the
practitioners who traditionally guide  children’s  literacy  learning:  parents, teachers, and
librarians. Ironically,  the  focus  on  children’s  perspectives may have occluded the roles of
these practitioners. For this reason, the study described in this dissertation contributes to
the literature by examining the perspectives of these practitioners. The following section
discusses studies that address the ways in which parents, teachers, and librarians enact
gendered literacy through modeling and support of literacy behaviors and their
interactions with children. In comparing the perspectives of children to those of
practitioners, this study may also give insight into how children adopt gendered values
connected with literacy. Since the study analyzes blogs by published authors and

71

illustrators, as well as editors, the following section also discusses work that has been
done on gendered literacy as manifested within the publishing industry.
2.5.1 Parents’  perspectives. Work on the perspectives of parents in relation to
gendered literacy is scant, and when the research literature mentions parents, it does so
indirectly. For example, Cherland (1994) only alludes to the beliefs about literacy held by
the parents of the students in her sample. In her ethnography of the fiction reading
practices of seven 6th grade girls living in a Canadian community the author  dubbed  “Oak  
Town,”  she  observed:  
Cultural constructions of gender shaped the ways in which the parents at Oak
Town went about reading, as well as the ways in which they encouraged their
own children to read. In turn, those cultural discourses centered on reading
became part of the construction of gender. Thus it happened that while many of
the sixth-grade girls were reading fiction, many of the boys were not. (p. 69)
Cherland  (1994)  hints  at  the  parents’  practices  and beliefs related to literacy, emphasizing
the effect of their influence on the children – more of the girls than the boys were reading
fiction, but the reference is indirect.
In contrast, Nichols (2002) interviewed middle class Australian parents about
their perceptions  of  their  children’s  interests and found gendered patterns in relation to
these  parents’  perceptions  of  their  children’s  interests  in  literacy  activities.  Nichols’  
(2002) semi-structured interviews revealed the following regarding these parents’  
perceptions  of  their  children’s  literacy interests:
•  Boys  were  attributed  with  more  interests  than  girls;;
•  Literacy  related  activities  featured  strongly  in  boys’  perceived  ‘noninterests’;
•  Boys’  non-literacy  interests  were  much  more  diverse  than  girls’  (e.g.  camping,  
making a gaol, using numbers, being outside);
•  Most  of  girls’  perceived  interests  were  literacy  related  (e.g.  reading,
drawing, listening to stories).
It may appear that boys and girls are simply interested in different things.
However,  discourse  analysis  of  parents’  extended  accounts supports the view that

72

these descriptions are not straightforward representations of children’s  ‘real’  
preferences but discursively framed interpretations of children’s  interests.  (p.  130)
Among  Nichols’  observations,  literacy  showcases  as  an  activity that Australian parents
more often associate with their daughters than with their sons. Nichols further argues that
such  beliefs  may  result  in  “a prohibition on parents engaging in direct literacy teaching
with their young boys. If children do not show an interest, parents should not impose
practices on them. However, even when boys do engage in literacy related activities this
may  be  interpreted  as  ‘not  a  real  interest’”  (p.  141).  In this way, parents, within the home
sphere, encourage gendered beliefs  and  practice  in  connection  to  children’s  literacy.
The  research  on  parents’  enactments of gendered literacy reflects the dominant
gendered concepts discussed earlier. For example, the association of literacy with
femininity is clear in  Nichols’  (2002)  study,  in  which  parents  saw  sons  as  not  being  
interested  in  literacy,  while  they  perceived  their  daughters’  interests  as  being  mainly  
literacy-related.  Moreover,  in  Cherland’s  (1994)  study,  girls,  more  than  boys,  were  
reading fiction, presented as due to parental influence (Cherland, 1994). Fiction reading
is a literacy activity more in line with school-based literacies, and as stated earlier, the
research indicates that girls stereotypically are drawn toward these types of literacy.
On the other hand, a study by Scholastic Inc. and Harrison Group (2010), using
survey  data  collected  from  “a nationally representative sample of 1,045 children age 6–17
and  their  parents  (2,090  total  respondents)” (p.  4),  found  that  although  “boys see reading
as less important than girls  do…parents of boys and girls value reading equally”  (p.  24).
Another  interesting  finding  from  the  study  was  that  “when asked how much they enjoyed
reading when they were  their  child’s  age,  dads  and  moms mirror boys and girls today”  (p.  
25). For example, 69% of moms surveyed versus 50% of dads responded that they had

73

liked  or  loved  reading  when  they  were  their  child’s  age.  Likewise,  71%  of  girls  versus  51%  
of boys said they liked or loved reading (p. 25). This finding suggests trans-generational
gendered patterns in attitudes toward reading.
The study undertaken for this dissertation examines the blog narratives of parents
who  blog  about  children’s  literacy  and literature in order to see to what degree the
language and images they use in blogs reflects and/or resists notions of gendered literacy
identified through review of the literature. It also compares parents’  blog  narratives  with  
those of other literacy educators (librarians and teachers) and with those of young people
themselves.
2.5.2 Teachers’  perspectives. More  research  deals  with  teachers’  than  with  
parents’  perspectives.  Orellana  (1995),  who,  as  noted  earlier,  studied two Los Angeles
elementary school (Spanish-English bilingual) classrooms, discusses the ways in which
the teacher in classroom A instantiated gender as important in literacy activities:
Both gender segregation and [emphasis in original] orchestrated integration made
gender salient, and given that no other means of grouping students was used in
this classroom, gender emerged as the only [emphasis in original] variable for
categorizing students in relation to their literacy learning, and it pervaded most
interactions with both oral and written literacy. The teacher alternated boys and
girls in all seating arrangements (as a means of limiting student-student
interactions  and  thus  achieving  greater  control);;  she  emphasized  “niños”  (boys)  
and  “niñas” (girls) when she called on each group, and whenever she called on
students she began alternating by gender. (p. 697)
The teacher used gender as the primary organizing mechanism for all literacy-related
communication in the classroom, thereby invoking a gendered literacy environment.
Murphy,  like  Orellana  (1995),  observes  teachers’  attitudes  toward  gender  and  
literacy.  Murphy’s study  of  preschool  teachers’  in  daycare  centers  revealed  differing  
perceptions of the ways in which boys and girls (2-4) engaged in role play in the

74

classroom (Murphy & Elwood, 1998, p. 163). From that study, Murphy and Elwood
(1998) discuss the following insights relating specifically to preschool  teachers’  
perceptions  of  boys’  literacy:
There was a consensus among staff about  young  boys’  interest  in  mechanical  
things….These interests were then exploited to get boys interested in reading and
were developed to maintain their interest in other activities. Two potential effects
arise from this. First, it can orientate boys towards particular experiences and to
observing only certain aspects of their environment and phenomena within it.
Second, because books about vehicles and structures are usually written in a
particular style, from an early age boys may be involved with different types of
text  from  girls…If boys go to school having taken longer than girls to settle to
listening to stories and with an interest in information type books already
developed then it is likely that they will find the reading schemes for young
children, based largely on stories about people, harder to access. (pp. 164-165)
Murphy and Elwood suggest that teachers’ using boys’  interest  in  “mechanical  things,”  
such  as  “vehicles  and  structures”  to  encourage  their  interest  in  reading  but  that  the  nonfiction texts featuring  such  “vehicles  and  structures”  incorporate less narrative than other
text types. As a result, boys may be less exposed to traditional fictional narrative texts
and  have  a  shorter  attention  span  than  girls  in  relation  to  “story.”
Moore, Yin, Weaver, Lydell, and Logan’s  (2007)  study  also  focuses  on  the  
preschool environment. The participants were five female preschool teachers, and, since
the sample was the teachers rather than the preschool students themselves, many of the
study’s  research  questions  do  not  seem  suited  to  the  sample  (i.e.  “How does the level of
proficiency of literacy skills differ in males and females?; How do self-perceptions
related to reading achievement differ from male to female students?”  p.  139).  However,  
the  study  is  useful  in  that  it  examines  the  teachers’  perceptions  of  the  students’  literacy  in  
connection to gender. The authors found that the teachers perceived,  “that  female  
students seem to surpass male students in the areas of language development, word

75

recognition,  and  reading  abilities”  (p.  146). Once again, teachers are seen to approach
classroom literacy with gendered notions of literacy.
Sanford (2005/2006), in her work in a suburban Canadian middle school,
observed  the  teachers’  attitudes  toward boys’  and  girls’  literacy – specifically,  teachers’  
beliefs that girls are more interested than boys in school reading activities but that more
of the excellent students are boys:
Ms. F commented that girls are more interested in reading, noting that "a much
larger percentage of girls in my class will pick up a book and read or be really
focused" and that boys "read less by choice although there are a handful of boys
who are just as strong and involved in their reading." She also believes that girls
have a better attitude toward school, saying "girls seem more keen to read
something out of the  textbook…." However, she sees girls as not being risk-takers,
commenting that "girls won't do anything without asking me"; boys, on the other
hand, "are more eager to take the chances; they figure things out by doing it." Mr.
M suggested that girls are less naturally talented than boys, saying, "It's more
uniform with the girls; there are fewer exceptional students with the girls" and
that (even though girls are generally seen to have stronger literacy skills) boys
"write some of the best poetry, and one is a major hockey player, too." (p. 305)
Sanford’s  findings  here  match  those  of  Maynard’s (2002) (as discussed in the “Gendered
Literacy Enacted” section) regarding teachers’  perceptions  of  boys’  greater  willingness  to  
take risks juxtaposed with their unwillingness to engage in formal literacy tasks (in this
case, reading from the textbook). Maynard, like Sanford, also speculates as to whether
teachers may in fact prefer male students over female students, noting:
Female pupils tend to be rewarded for listening and doing as they are told while
male  pupils  are  rewarded  for  being  ‘funny’  and  assertive.  However,  whilst  
conveying  and  enforcing  messages  about  ‘good’  girls being compliant and docile,
it  may  be…that  teachers  actually  admire  the  ‘sparkle’  and  challenge  of  boys  and  
prefer to teach them. (p.107)
The  teachers  participating  in  Maynard’s  (2002)  study  believe  girls  are  generally  obedient  
while boys tend to be difficult and disruptive. However, these teachers also consider boys
more interesting and exciting to teach.

76

In a study more than 20 years prior, Clarricoates (1980) observed similar
dynamics in four socio-economically and regionally diverse English primary schools. She
noted the ways in which all four schools, despite their contextual variations according to
class, community, and school structures, achieved the segregation of the sexes, and she
claimed that in each case, females were subordinated (p. 207). Like Sanford (2005/2006)
and  Maynard  (2002),  she  comments  on  one  of  the  school’s  teachers’  seeming  preference  
for  boys:  “The  teachers’  perception  of  creativity  was  underscored  by  their  beliefs  in  sexroles. They saw the boys as having much more imagination, and  having  the  real  ability”  
(Clarricoates,  1980,  p.  200).  As  in  Sanford  and  Maynard’s  examples,  these  teachers’  
perceptions  of  boys’  superior  intelligence  were  juxtaposed  with  girls’  higher  curricular  
performance and willingness to complete schoolwork.
Education researcher and former educator David Booth (2002), in Even Hockey
Players Read: Boys, Literacy and Learning, writes:
At the end of every talk I give, parents and teachers line up to ask me questions,
and they are almost always about boys in literacy  trouble:  they  don’t  read,  can’t  
read,  won’t  read,  don’t  write,  can’t  write,  can’t  spell.  Those  of  us  who  are  
responsible for educating boys are deeply concerned over the plight of many of
them  who  can’t  or  won’t  enter  the  literacy  club. (p. 12)
Booth here stresses the notion that educators, including parents and teachers, perceive
“the  literacy  club,”  as  he  calls  it,  to  be  primarily  a  girls’  club,  due  to  the  perception of the
overwhelming numbers of boys with literacy problems.
To summarize the studies discussed above, teachers’  expectations of and beliefs
about students conform to the dominant notions of gendered literacy (Maynard, 2002;
Moore et al., 2007; Murphy & Elwood, 1998; Sanford, 2005/2006). At times, teachers
overtly encouraged gendered literacy through their management of the literacy classroom

77

environment (Clarricoates, 1980; Orellana, 1995). This study examines whether these
same  attitudes  appear  in  teachers’  blogs,  if  there  are  variations  on  these  attitudes,  and
how teachers resist these attitudes.
2.5.3 Librarians’  perspectives. The research literature does not deal directly
with  librarians’  perspectives  on  gendered  literacy  – a gap the study described in this
dissertation addresses by analyzing blog narratives written from the perspectives of
librarians. The professional library literature does, however, draw attention to the
perceived problem of boys and reading, describing reading programs geared toward boys
(for example, Welldon, 2005), and suggestions for collection development and best
practice in terms of encouraging boys to read (i.e. Doiron, 2003; Jones & Fiorelli, 2003;
McKechnie, 2006; Parsons, 2004). Based on this professionally-oriented literature,
librarians, like parents and teachers, express views of literacy as gendered in the ways
already discussed (that girls tend to embrace literacy while boys are less willing). The
study undertaken helps to describe better librarians’  perspectives  of literacy as a gendered
phenomenon.
Agosto, Paone, and Ipock (2007), in  a  study  of  adolescents’  perceptions  of  public  
libraries, found that females had more positive impressions of public libraries than males
(p. 399). Moreover,  in  a  study  of  men  and  women’s  use  of  a  public  library,  Applegate  
(2008) notes that her survey findings showing that men use the library much less and in
different ways from women “will  not  surprise  the  observant  public  library  director,”  (p.  
29) thereby suggesting that librarians are well aware of gendered enactments of literacy.
Applegate (2008) found  that  “more patrons are women, and women seem to make use of
a  wider  variety  of  library  resources  and  services”  and  also  that  “the strongest differences

78

between men and women appeared in the use  of  children’s  and youth collections and
services”  (men  rarely used these services) (p. 29). Therefore, adult public library patrons
also appear to enact gendered literacy practices.
Librarians, like teachers (in the classroom) or parents (in the home), may
participate in and/or resist the gendering of reading within the library context. For
example, librarians assert their influence through purchase selections, arrangement and
cataloging  of  materials,  reader’s  advisory,  or  program  planning.  The study described in
this dissertation looks for such enactments/disruptions described in blog narratives
authored by librarians and compares them both to those of other literacy educators, of
young people, and of creators of texts for young people.
On the whole, teachers, parents, and librarians present literacy as a gendered
phenomenon along the ways, based on a review of the literature, already identified –
gendered  literacy  enacted  in  two  ways:  in  terms  of  boys’  resisting  formal  literacy  and  
girls’  embracing  it,  and  girls’  and  boys’  conveying  differing literacy preferences, often in
ways that have been encouraged since early childhood, as evident in the preschool studies
(Moore et al., 2007; Murphy & Elwood,1998; Porche et al., 2004) described above.
2.5.4 Gendered literacy in the children’s  publishing industry. The publishing
industry is a world of contradictions regarding gender and literacy. On the one hand,
Deahl (2010) states that the majority of those working among the lower ranks in the
publishing industry overall are female. A study by VIDA: Women in Literary Arts
organization (2013) tallying  numbers  of  female  versus  male  authors  of  children’s  and  
young adult literature among winners of book awards also found that women were
prominent,  and  so  claims  that  children’s  publishing  is  female-dominated seem warranted,

79

at least in terms of author recognition. However,  a  historical  study  of  children’s  literature  
showed that male characters are more prevalent than female characters, thereby
suggesting  male  bias  in  children’s  publishing (McCabe, Fairchild, Grauerholz,
Pescosolido, & Tope, 2011). The section that follows discusses these trends.
2.5.4.1 Most publishing industry employees are women. Deahl (2010), in
reference to the Publisher’s  Weekly salary survey, states: “85%  of  publishing  employees  
with less than three years of experience are women” (para. 1). Later, the article,
referencing Columbia University’s  Publishing Course, discusses why this might be:
Lindy Hess, director of the graduate Columbia Publishing Course, said that
publishing,  like  teaching,  has  been  a  field  that’s  traditionally  been  ‘more  open’  to  
women. Hess said she also assumes that there are more female English majors out
there—which may be because women like to read more than men—and that’s  
reflected in the industry. At Columbia, the program has been 80% women and 20%
men for the past four to five years. (Deahl, 2010, para. 9-10)
Additionally, as Deahl points out, because publishing is a female-dominated industry, it is
low-paying compared to other industries, and there is a significant pay gap between
women and men within the industry (para. 12). In this sense, then, women are
marginalized even within the female-dominated publishing industry. Thus, factors of
tradition and salary combine to make it difficult for the publishing industry to attract
more men.
2.5.4.2 VIDA studies of literary recognition. VIDA: Women in Literary Arts
organization’s  (2013) study of major (reaching back five years) and minor (for the year
2013) children’s  and  young  adult  book awards indicated that of the 17 awards reviewed,
13 had more female author winners than male. In some cases the gap was large, as in the
following cases in which there were more than twice as many female winners as males:
Booklist Editor’s  Choice  Books  for  Youth, 2013, 39 females versus 17 males; the

80

American Library Association Coretta Scott King Award, 2009-2013, 12 females versus
4 males; the Young Adult Library Services Association William C. Morris YA Debut
Award, 2009-2013, 24 females versus 2 males; the Association for Library Service to
Children Newbery Medal, 2009-2013, 16 females versus 6 males; School Library Journal
Best Books of 2013, 48 females versus 23 males; and, the American Library Association
Stonewall Book Award, 2009-2013, 12 females versus 4 males. VIDA’s  study  indicates  
that women authors are well-recognized  in  the  areas  of  children’s  and  young  adult  
publishing. However, VIDA does not provide industry statistics regarding authorship
overall, having determined that “achieving an accurate count of books published by even
just the major five houses proved to be a difficult and unwieldy task, given the
labyrinthine nature of online and print catalogs  produced  by  these  publishers.”  Moreover,  
they were unable to “access all the information…needed to accurately count every title
published  in  the  past  year”  (VIDA,  2013).  
An earlier tally by VIDA of author recognition in terms of adult literature paints a
different picture, in which male authors are dominant. In  2009,  VIDA  also  assessed  “the
gender distribution of several major  book  awards  and  prominent  ‘best  of’ lists.”  The
result was a ratio of 592 male authors to 295 female authors (King, 2010, “Best  of  2009”).
VIDA’s  historical review of major literary awards yielded a similar count: 929 males to
454 females (King,  2010,  “Historical  Count”). VIDA’s  count  of  two  of  the  major  
children’s  literature  awards  showed  that  more  men  have  won  the Caldecott Medal
(through 2010), an annual award  given  to  “the  artist  of  the  most  distinguished  American  
picture book  for  children”  (ALSC,  2014), – 49 male authors versus 23 female authors
(from 2000 – 2010, there was only 1 female winner), while, in contrast, more women

81

than men have won the Newbery (through 2010), an annual award given to "the author of
the most distinguished contribution to American  literature  for  children”  (ALSC,  2014):
59 female authors versus 29 male authors (King,  2010,  “Historical  Count”).
2.5.4.3 Children’s  publishing  – male bias in content. The  children’s  publishing  
industry, from the perspective of one study, is male-biased in terms of content. According
to McCabe, Fairchild, Grauerholz, Pescosolido, and Tope (2011), their findings regarding
male versus female character inclusion in United States-published  children’s  books  
present a glaring imbalance, in which female characters are underrepresented. The study,
which included winners of the Caldecott medal (1938-2000); Little Golden Books (1942 1993); and books listed in the Children’s  Catalog (1900-2000), examining data gathered
from  “titles  and central  characters  in  5,618  books”  (p. 203) found that
compared to females, males are represented nearly twice as often in titles and 1.6
times as often as central characters. By no measure in any book series (i.e.,
Caldecott award winners, Little Golden Books, and books listed in the Children’s  
Catalog) are females represented more frequently than males. (McCabe et al.,
2011, p. 197)
This  relative  absence  of  female  characters  compared  to  male  characters,  the  study’s  
authors conclude, represents a “symbolic  annihilation”  of  women  in  children’s  literature  
(p. 199). McCabe et al. find this troubling because they assert that “children’s  books  are  a  
celebration, reaffirmation, and dominant blueprint of shared cultural values, meanings,
and  expectations”  (p.  199). Therefore, the relative absence of female characters in books
for children, they fear, contributes to the marginalization of women in U.S. society. These
scholars’ use of character inclusion as a sole proxy measure for male versus female
presence  in  children’s  literature  is  an  oversimplification, however. Without looking in
more  detail  at  the  books’  content, including plot and lesser characters than those who

82

might be included in the title or a simple description, the study provides an incomplete
view. Nonetheless, their perspective is important to bring to the discussion on gendered
literacy within publishing, especially as a counterpoint to the common perception that
children’s  literature  in the U.S. is universally a female-dominated space.
Among those who express  this  perception  of  children’s  publishing  as  femaledominated, Robert Lipsyte (2011), author of young adult literature (particularly of books
that are marketed toward boys), in a New York Times essay, states,
At the 2007 A.L.A. [American Library Association] conference, a Harper
executive said at least three-quarters of her target audience were girls, and they
wanted to read about mean girls, gossip girls, frenemies and vampires. Naturally,
authors  are  writing  for  this  ready  group.  The  current  surge  in  children’s  literature  
has been fueled by talented young female novelists fresh from M.F.A. programs
who in earlier times would have been writing midlist adult fiction. Their novels
are bought by female editors, stocked by female librarians and taught by female
teachers.  It’s  a  cliché  but  mostly  true  that  while  teenage  girls  will  read  books  
about boys, teenage boys will rarely read books with predominately female
characters. (para. 8-9)
Overlooking for the moment Lipsyte’s  use  of  hearsay  by  one  publisher  to  characterize  the  
whole industry, his commentary is representative of a common cultural misperception of
children’s  literature:  that  it  is  wholly geared toward girls and women and that the femaledominated professions of education, librarianship, and publishing are interested only in
literature that is marketed toward girls.
Similarly, British  author  of  children’s  picture  books,  Jonathan  Emmett  (2015),  
dedicates an entire blog, entitled Cool not Cute!, to what he views as the main problem
behind boys and reading – a lack of picture books that young boys find appealing, so that
they are less eager to read from an early age. He set up the blog in response to his own
experiences and findings regarding female/male imbalance within the children’s  
publishing industry. Emmett claims that this imbalance, with far more females than

83

males, extends to teaching and librarianship, and is also reflected in a female majority
among  purchasers  of  illustrated  children’s  books.  
In conclusion, although the children’s  publishing industry appears to be femaledominated, particularly in terms of authors recognized, it is still marked by androcentric
biases in terms of a lack of female characters. What has been written about gender in the
publishing industry, for example, regarding possible biases in hiring, publishing,
reviewing, and subject matter, however, is meager. The study described in this
dissertation tries to make up for this lack by including analysis of blog posts and
comments written by published authors and illustrators and editors in relation to literature
for young people and gender.
2.6 Gendered Literacy as a Quantifiable Achievement Gap
Another strand of research, which includes studies that for the most part have
larger sample sizes than the studies previously discussed, points to differences between
boys and girls in terms of achievement measured through test scores. For example, on
standardized  tests  of  verbal  ability,  especially  those  of  reading,  girls’  scores  generally  
exceed those of boys.
2.6.1 Media attention to gendered literacy. According to Greenburg, Gilbert, &
Frederick  (2006),  “there  is  a  consensus  in  the  field  that  reading  patterns  and  practices  are  
highly gendered and become increasingly so during the adolescent years, with females
significantly  outscoring  males  on  administered  measures”  (p.  160).  Moreover,  the verbal
achievement gap between girls and boys is a popular media topic. A report by the Center
on Education Policy (2010), as a result of evaluating state proficiency test scores
(beginning  from  2002  through  2007/08),  found  that  boys’  scores  in  reading trail (by as

84

much  as  10  percentage  points  in  some  states)  behind  those  of  girls’  across  the  elementary,  
middle, and high school levels. This report generated a lot of press and public interest.
For example, it prompted New York Times op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof’s  piece,  
“The  Boys  Have  Fallen  Behind”  (March  27,  2010).  Following  this  article’s  publication  in  
the New York Times,  Kristof  followed  it  up  with  a  post,  entitled  “The  Male  Half  of  the  
Sky,”  on  his  blog  (March  27,  2010).  As  of  September  7,  2010, this blog post had received
537 reader replies, and it provided an important forum for public discussion of the Center
on  Education  Policy’s  report.  Gender  differences in education and literacy generate
intense public debate. Gender, for most people, remains a core of both their personal and
social identities, and such  reports  and  statistics  prey  upon  people’s  fears  about  one  aspect  
of the gendered literacy phenomenon – that is,  “the  boy  problem.”  “The boy  problem,”  
which represents a sub-debate within the larger issue of gendered literacy and has
prompted headlines, books, and school programs designed to respond to anxiety over
boys’  literacy  gap, has been treated in the blogosphere, and the dissertation study
comments upon this where applicable. (See McKechnie, 2006, for a succinct discussion
of  “the  boy  problem”  phenomenon).
2.6.2 Achievement gap studies. According  to  the  Nation’s  Report  Card  (2007),  
students’  reading  scores  in  a  U.S. educational survey have reflected a gender gap for the
past  15  years.  In  2007,  fourth  grade  females’  scores  were  7  points  above  boys’ and eighth
grade  girls’  scores  were  10  points  above  boys’ (Lee, Grigg, & Donahue, 2007). In the
U.K., results from the 2011 General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams
showed the most significant gender gap to date in terms of top-scoring students, with 26.5%
of girls receiving the top score versus 19.6% of boys (Richardson, 2011, para. 2). In

85

explaining possible reasons for the gap, the spokespeople quoted invoke common
stereotypes of gender and literacy, gender and classroom behavior, and boys’ and  girls’  
relationship to the educational system overall. For example, Richardson (2011) describes
commentary by Ian Toone, of the Voice teaching union, stating:
that GCSEs are achievement tests rather than measures of innate intelligence and
thus favour pupils who apply themselves "in a dedicated and industrious manner."
"This is a trait which is more typical of girls than boys - who are more easily
distracted and prefer to focus on one thing at a time," he claims…."Boys are
encouraged to be more active from an early age, whereas the restless movements
of baby girls are pacified. "Hence, girls develop the skill of sitting still for longer
periods of time, which is useful for academic pursuits like studying for
GCSEs."…This is often evident right from when children start school, with girls
tending to be more ready to sit down and concentrate on reading or writing than
some boys. (para. 9-10, 12-14)
This commentary suggests that the GCSE exam requires long term commitment to
studying in order to do well, that Toone (who is quoted) believes that girls tend to be
more driven than boys to prepare for the GCSE exam, and that girls have been
encouraged (while boys have been discouraged) since infancy to develop the skills
necessary for sitting and studying – skills for which they are further rewarded, when they
start school. Richardson (2011) also cites Schools Minister Nick Gibb,  “who believes
ensuring boys can read well in  the  early  years  is  the  answer”  (para.  15). Gibb says, "the
gap often begins in primary schools, with poor reading skills a barrier. We need to
intervene early on to make  sure  that  boys  can  read  well….”  (para.  16). Gibbs thereby
faults the gap in reading abilities between boys and girls for the gap evident in GCSE
exam scores.
Similar to the gap in the GCSE exams, on the Organisation for Economic CoOperation  and  Development’s  (OECD)  Programme for International Student Assessment
(PISA) in reading, girls perform better than boys. The purpose of the PISA is to assess

86

the “extent  to  which  students  near  the  end  of  compulsory  education  have acquired some
of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern society,
particularly in mathematics, reading and science”  (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2014, p. 23).The  PISA  is  given  to  students  “aged between
15 years 3 months and 16 years 2 months at the time of assessment and who are enrolled
in school and have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling”  (p.  22).  Students are
enrolled in all different types of schools and not all are enrolled full-time. In 2012, the
results for approximately 510,000 students in 65 countries and economies showed that,
“on average across OECD countries, girls outperform boys in reading by 38 score points.
While girls outperform boys in reading in every participating country and economy, the
gap is much wider in some countries than in others”  (p.  199).  A gap  of  “25  score  points  
or  less”  occurred in both low-performing and high-performing countries (p.  199)  and  “in
14 countries, girls outperform boys by at least 50 score points. All of these countries
score below the OECD average, except Finland, which performs above the OECD
average in  reading”  (p.  199).  Based  on  these  results,  the  gaps  in  reading  between  boys  
and girls may be considered not just a phenomenon limited to the U.S. and the U.K., as
discussed just prior, but an international phenomenon. Results of an earlier PISA found
that “girls  read  more  for  enjoyment  than  boys  in  all  countries  and  economies,  except  
Korea. On average across OECD countries, there is a 20 percentage-point gender gap in
reading  for  enjoyment”  (OECD,  2011,  p. 1). These findings provide further evidence for
the notion of reading as a feminized practice among young people, and also introduce the
possibility of an international dimension to the issue.

87

Following the reporting of the PISA results, explanations of what the results mean
and their educational and political implications ensue. For example, following the 2009
PISA, Finland’s  education  minister  placed  the  blame  for  Finland’s  overall  drop  to  third  
place on  “a decline in reading, especially among boys” (BBC, 2010, para. 3). The reading
gap between boys and girls, therefore, has been an ongoing source of contention and
debate.
A number of scholars have used the OECD PISA data for further study. For
example,  Marks’  (2008)  macro-analysis of trends in gaps between girls and boys in
reading and mathematics scores in the OECD’s  2000  PISA project data showed that
The gender gaps in reading and mathematics are highly correlated and the
magnitude of the gaps reflect the implementation and success or otherwise of
policies designed to improve the educational outcomes of girls. Policies designed
to  improve  girls’  educational  outcomes  are  likely  to  reduce  the  gender  gap  in  
mathematics but increase the gender gap in reading. (p. 106)
Marks reached this conclusion after reviewing the data relating both to student and
country  characteristics  including  (among  others):  students’  occupational  expectations;;  
inequality of household disposable income by sex; modernization (assessed through gross
domestic product and proportion of adults attaining higher education); societal gender
inequality  (ascertained  through  percentage  of  the  country’s  workforce  represented  by  
women and gender gap in wages); and percentage of gross domestic product spent on the
welfare state (p. 95). Marks notes that his findings may “reflect the success of policies in
individual  countries  promoting  the  educational  outcomes  of  girls”  (p.  106)  but offers little
else in the way of analysis of the findings.
In their analysis of OECD PISA data, Chiu and McBride-Chang (2006) examined
the correlations between sex and the following variables: socioeconomic status; number

88

of books at home; reading enjoyment; culture (nationality); and school affiliation in their
relationship to the variable of reading performance (as measured in test scores) of a
representative (from 43 countries) sample of 199,097 fifteen-year-old students. They
found that sex was associated with reading enjoyment (more girls than boys surveyed
enjoyed reading) and that number of books at home was associated with reading
achievement.  They  note:  “although  most  of  the  variance  in  reading  achievement  in  
relation to gender can be explained by the context in which reading is taught and learned,
boys may be at somewhat more risk than girls for reading problems  across  cultures”  (p.  
358). Thus, the PISA data suggest that boys tend to enjoy reading to a lesser degree than
do girls, and that girls tend to be higher achievers in terms of reading.
Ma (2008) also examined the OECD PISA data but from the perspective of
“school  effectiveness”  theory.  In  this  theoretical  orientation, “family  characteristics,  
home  influences,  and  family  social  and  cultural  values”  are  treated  as  inputs  (p. 441) into
the  school  environment,  which  then  “processes”  students  (school  variables include both
school context, i.e. teacher/student ratio, and school climate, i.e. school policy). Student
achievements are then viewed as outputs (p. 442). Ma analyzed the data using two-level
hierarchical linear modeling, in which students were one level and schools the second
level in order to determine, both nationally and comparing cross-nationally, the extent of
between-school variation in terms of intra-school gender differences in performance in
math, reading, and science literacy (p. 443). At the level of international comparison, Ma
(2008) found that:
gender differences in reading were most substantial in magnitude and most
widespread in scope. Males and females performed equally well across all schools
in mathematics in nine countries. In science they performed equally well in 14

89

countries. Romania was the only country in which males and females performed
equally well across all schools and all subjects. (p. 454)
From this analysis, a pattern of gendered literacy achievement in which females exceed
males in reading performance is consistent among the 41 nations represented in this
analysis.
Other quantitatively-focused studies have analyzed both national and local
educational data to examine claims relating to gender gaps in academic performance. For
example, Husain and Millimet (2009) examine the claim promoted in popular literature
of an educational crisis for boys in the U.S. by analyzing gender gaps in a nationally
representative data set on kindergarteners through third graders (p. 39). Husain and
Millimet (2009) report:
In the end, we  find  mixed  evidence  of  a  ‘boy  crisis’  during  early  primary  school  
when analyzing differences in mean math and reading test scores. The gap in
math, where boys are widely cited as outpacing girls, is only statistically
significant for whites, but does significantly widen over the first 4 years in school
for whites as well as a few select sub-populations of children of other races. The
gap in reading, on the other hand, favors girls and is fairly sizeable, especially for
Hispanics, but does not widen over the first 4 years of school except for poor
black and Hispanic public school students. (p. 44)
Therefore,  although  they  shy  away  from  calling  the  gender  gap  a  “crisis,”  Husain  and  
Millimet acknowledge the gap in reading favoring girls. They also find a gap in math
among white students favoring boys.
In another quantitative study of gaps between girls and boys in relation to verbal
abilities, Savage, Carless, and Ferraro (2007) studied whether, for a sample of 382
English children, basic reading ability assessed at age 5, awareness of phonemes, and
variables  relating  to  student  background,  could  predict  students’  test  and  classroom  
performance at age 11. They found that early reading ability (assessed at 5 years of age),

90

special educational need, and phonological awareness (when controlling for early literacy
skills and student background variables) significantly predicted all outcome measures of
students at age 11. Moreover, they  found  “that gender predicted performance on the
writing test, the English total test score, as well as the English teacher assessment, with
girls outperforming boys on these measures”  (p.  737).  They  found  no  difference  between  
boys and girls on math performance (p. 737). This study thereby highlights an apparent
gap between the female and male participants on verbal performance measures.
A  “large-scale longitudinal study involving more than 1,000 6-year-old preschool
children in 55 different preschool groups and a cross-validation sample of 1,100 children
on  the  following  school  year”  (Lundberg, Larsman, & Strid, 2012, p. 307) in Sweden
looked more  closely  at  children’s  phonological  awareness  for  possible  insight  into  the  
apparent gap between girls and boys in verbal abilities (p. 308). Teachers trained the
preschool students regarding “phonological  awareness  and  letter  knowledge”  during  an  8month period. Students were tested before and also following this phonological training
program. Students’  socioeconomic  status  and  sex were both significant in terms of
phonological  awareness,  “with students in less favorable socioeconomic environments
showing less  phonemic  awareness”  (p.  317),  and  girls displaying a greater degree of and
greater improvement in phonological awareness both before and after undergoing the
training program (p. 317). Lundberg, Larsman, and Strid (2012) conclude that
“phonological  awareness  is  highly  teachable  and  modifiable”  (p.  318)  and  “that more
practice yields higher performance at least for children with low initial performance”  (p.  
318). The effect of socioeconomic status the researchers suggest may be attributable to
“the critical importance of a stimulating home environment”  (p.  318). Likewise, since

91

phonemic awareness, based on their findings, is “a highly modifiable ability, the
observed gender difference in phonological awareness cannot easily be explained in pure
biological terms. The clear advantage of girls over boys might be attributed to differences
in early stimulation  of  relevant  language  functions”  (p.  318).    In other words, Lundberg,
Larsman, and Strid suggest that girls’  early  language  development  may,  on  average,  be  
encouraged  more  than  boys’, and this is why girls tend to start with an advantage in
phonemic awareness.
Alloway and Gilbert (1997), like Lundberg, Larsman, and Strid (2012) above,
found both sex and  socioeconomic  status  to  be  significantly  correlated  with  students’  test  
performance. Unlike some of the other studies in this section, however, Alloway and
Gilbert (1997) draw particular attention to the importance of looking at socioeconomic
status  in  terms  of  interpreting  students’  test scores. For example, their analysis of
standardized test results in New South Wales, Australia revealed that:
the New South Wales state average for girls is higher than for boys. However the
data also indicate that the 10-point socio-economic ranking of students' families is
strongly associated with children's literacy skills performance. While girls, at
every step in the 10-point socio-economic scale, score higher than boys whose
families share the same ranking, boys with the highest socio-economic ranking
still fare better at literacy-related tasks than girls up to the first five points of the
socio-economic scale. The data also show how boys with a socio-economic
ranking of 10 still score below the state average for girls, and how boys with the
lowest socio-economic  rankings  score  worse  than  any  other  group…. In brief,
given the same ranking in terms of the socio-economic resources available to their
families, boys generally do less well than girls. (Alloway & Gilbert, 1997,
“Gender,  Literacy  and  Difference,”  para.  1-2)
In this study, then, although sex was  salient  as  a  predictor  of  children’s  literacy  
performance, socio-economic factors must also be taken into consideration when looking
at achievement test scores.

92

Similarly, Entwisle, Alexander, and Olson (2007), in their longitudinal study of
children in the Baltimore city (U.S.) school system, draw attention to socio-economic
variables. Entwisle et al. found that in their sample, reading skills (as measured through
grades, classroom behavior ratings, retention rates, and parental expectations regarding
their  children’s  reading  achievement  in  school)  of  girls  were  higher  than  boys’  but  only  
significantly so for children in the lower socio-economic bracket (using federal meal
subsidy qualification as a proxy) (p. 119). The researchers suggest that
the  interaction  of  students’  home and school experiences may hold the key to how
SES and gender interact in the schooling process. The cultural enrichment and
support for education that middle-class parents tend to give both sons and
daughters can serve as a counterweight to alienation that boys generally feel
toward school. That is, if boys generally find adjustment to the student role more
difficult than girls do, then middle-class boys benefit from having parents who are
more likely to reinforce the values and habits that are conducive to success as a
student. (Entwisle et al., 2007, p. 117)
Here Entwisle et al., as they attempt to determine what may give boys from middle class
homes an edge over those from poorer backgrounds, stress the important socializing
influences of parents according to socioeconomic status. They acknowledge that boys of
all walks of life may find the school environment less comfortable than girls do; however,
middle income parents may better prepare their boys to succeed in school by encouraging
school-conducive behaviors and attitudes. Therefore, Entwisle et al. deem  students’  
socio-economic status (especially for boys) a crucial predictor of their academic
achievement.
The following study takes a different approach to quantitative assessment,
investigating whether interest in a text affects  boys’  and  girls’  performance  on  a  test  of  
reading comprehension. Oakhill and Petrides (2007) studied the relationships among the
variables of gender, reading comprehension, and interest in the text. They assessed the

93

reading comprehension of 32 9- and 10-year-old students (16 girls and 16 boys) in the
U.K. on two different passages, one about spiders (which the researchers had chosen as
likely to appeal to boys), the other one about children evacuated during World War II.
They found that the boys preferred the text about spiders while the girls preferred the text
about children in World War  II.  Moreover,  the  boys  “showed significantly better
comprehension  for  a  text  that  was  considered  to  be  the  more  ‘boy-friendly’,  and  which  
they themselves expressed a greater  interest  in  reading,  whereas  the  girls’  performance  
was not related to their expressed interest”  (Oakhill & Petrides, 2007, p. 231) Hence, in
this  study,  the  boys’  performance  may  have  been  influenced  by  their  interest  in  the  text.  
The authors note that their findings mirror those of other researchers and posit the
following as an explanation of the results:
If girls perceive reading as sex-appropriate and, therefore, a more acceptable
activity, they might be more likely to read well regardless of their interest in a
particular text. However, if reading is regarded as sex-inappropriate for boys, then
they may require an additional incentive, such as a particularly interesting text, in
order to read well. (p. 231).
Here,  the  children’s  gendered  literacy preferences are evident in that the girls seem to be
more intrinsically motivated (in this case, without needing the extra incentive of an
interesting text) to perform well in formal literacy tasks.
Much of the research on gendered literacy has centered on test-based evaluations
of  children’s  abilities,  and,  as  such,  has  construed  gendered  literacy  in  terms  of  a  sexbased gap in achievement. Although some studies have also treated questions of socioeconomic status or nationality in regards to reading difference, the persistent concern of
scholars investigating the achievement gap is how verbal performance (as measured
through testing) differs between boys and girls. This achievement gap is a major

94

consideration not only for educators or for children themselves, but also for parents and
others. The study described in this dissertation differs in approach by considering
gendered literacy as the result of persistent sociocultural beliefs, or perceptions. However,
the study also, in analyzing blog narratives, looks for mentions of the widely cited
achievement gap in verbal performance, since it is also possible that public awareness of
this gap may serve to reify sociocultural beliefs about gender and literacy. Although the
dissertation study is limited by a focus on blogs, blogs represent a valuable cultural
barometer, especially since they are an unsolicited data source and bloggers use them to
reflect (in a less self-conscious way than in a survey or interview, for example) on
literacy as gendered.
2.7 Gendered Literacy as a Biological Phenomenon
Researchers once claimed that any differences females and males displayed in
verbal, math, and science performance were the result of biological differences between
the sexes (and the topic continues to be debated). For example, epidemiological
(population based) studies have indicated a higher prevalence of reading disabilities
among males than females (Berninger, Nielsen, Abbott, Wijsman, & Raskind, 2008).
Moreover, Thompson (1987) tested the prediction that from a sample of 7-year-old New
Zealand children, girls would rely more than boys on direct processing (rather than
phoneme  recognition)  in  reading  words.  The  study’s  results  supported  Thompson’s  
prediction:  “The  results  indicate, at least under performance conditions of time
constraints, a greater reliance on average by boys than girls in processing of phonological
segments”  (p.  218).  Thompson’s  study  therefore  may  point  to  some  cognitive  differences  
in the ways in which girls and boys process text. Furthermore, in a study of a sample of

95

36 English students (18 girls, 18 boys) of different ethnicities and average reading ability,
for the boys studied (and not for the girls), visual skill performance, especially on a test
of visual short-term memory, and performance on a standardized reading test were highly
correlated (Huestegge, Heim, Zettelmeyer, & Lange-Küttner, 2012, pp. 119, 123-124).
These findings have a place in the full discussion of gendered literacy and deserve
to be considered in addition to the social and cultural values attached to literacy in
relation to gender. However, it is important not to over-determine the role of biology in
gendered literacy. Philosophy professor Stephen Asma (2011) of Columbia College
Chicago, for instance, argues for a middle ground in which both biology and culture
provide  useful  analytical  lenses.  He  suggests:  “Regarding  the  sex/gender  issue,  then,  we
should  be  asking,  among  other  things:  Which  traits  are  malleable,  and  to  what  degree?”    
He laments the way in which humanities scholars have shunned science, criticizing what
he  calls  their  “biophobia.”  
In stark contrast, cognitive neuroscientist Cordelia  Fine’s  (2010)  book,  Delusions
of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences, presents a harsh critique of
biological essentialism. Fine coins the phrase  “neurosexism”  to  describe  popular works
(see, for example, Sax, 2005; Gurian, 2011) that use biological explanations to describe
differences between males and females, even as social influence is often ignored. Fine
states:  “although  certain  popular  commentators  make  it  seem  effortlessly  easy,  the  sheer  
complexity of the brain makes interpreting and understanding the meaning of any sex
differences  we  find  in  the  brain  a  very  difficult  task”  (p.  133).  For  example,  in  discussing
explanations of sex differences in the brain according to investigations of the effects of
fetal testosterone on brain development  and  behavior,  she  notes  that  “foetal  testosterone  

96

has  become  the  explanation  of  choice  for  gender  inequality  in  science”  (p.  129),  despite  
the  fact  that  “higher  foetal  testosterone  in  nonclinical  populations  has  not  been  
convincingly linked with better mental rotation ability, systemising ability, mathematical
ability,  scientific  ability  or  worse  mind  reading”  (p.  130).  
Fine also reviews the history of brain research on sex differences. Regarding
neuroimaging, she makes the point that although brain science has made great strides in
this area it is new and not yet well-developed; therefore, it is perilous to jump to
conclusions regarding behavior based on brain scans (154). Moreover, she notes the
concept  of  “neuroplasticity”  which  means  that  “what  we experience and do creates neural
activity  that  can  alter  the  brain,  either  directly  or  through  changes  in  gene  expression”  (p.  
236). In this sense, essentialism in relation to cognitive function is not supported.
Moreover, Fine points out that brain differences should not be used to explain behavioral
difference  because  of  the  “principle  that  brain  difference  can  yield  behavioural  similarity”  
(p.142). Brain differences between males and females, then, do not necessarily point to
behavioral differences. Also, scientific findings are influenced by social beliefs and
norms. For example, citing both historical and current examples of scientific and popular
texts on cognitive and psychological differences between men and women based on
images of the brain, Fine asserts  that  “functional  neuroimaging  technologies  have  brought  
the  fresh,  modern  zing  of  neuroscience  to  old  stereotypes”  (147).  In  this  sense,  Fine  
argues that neuroscience is being used to support and explain gender stereotypes.
Neuroscientist Lise Eliot (2009), in her book, Pink Brain, Blue Brain, takes a
more balanced approach to the discussion of cognitive function and sex difference. She
contends that small differences might be exacerbated by environmental influences. For

97

example, Eliot contends that spatial skills primarily are the result of teaching and
experience rather than of innate ability (pp. 231-235). Moreover, she believes that males
(at least within the U.S.) in general are given more opportunities to develop spatial skills.
Eliot discusses the SAT as an example, positing that males generally outperform females
on  the  math  section  because  of  males’  superior  spatial  skills,  which  they  have  honed  as  a  
result of learning and practicing. She claims, based on her review of research in this field
and the fact that roughly a third of the questions on the math portion of the SAT involve
geometry  (p.  230),  that  “spatial  skills  are  a  major  reason  why  males  outperform  females  
on the math SAT exam and probably explains how they beat them on other math and
science  tests  as  well”  (p.  230).  Eliot  also  looks  at  research  concerning  cultural  stereotypes  
related  to  math  and  science,  concluding,  “Math,  science,  and  computer  brilliance  are  
simply not feminine, as Barbie, Mean Girls, and much else in popular culture tells us.
Girls  figure  this  out  distressingly  early”  (p.  239).  Hence,  Eliot  places  blame  on  iconic  
cultural representations of gender which dissuade girls from developing the skills that
would help them perform on the math and science portions of the SAT, and more broadly,
from wanting to study and pursue careers in math and science.
Wallentin (2008) also presents a balanced discussion of the issue of sex
differences in relation to the brain. In a critical review of studies relating to language
development, cognitive processes, and sex differences, Wallentin acknowledges that
although certain disorders that affect language (autism, stuttering, and dyslexia, for
example) are more common in males than females, no clear evidence exists to suggest
whether the associated language problems are due to cognitive differences or to some
other phenomenon (p. 181). Moreover, Wallentin  concludes  that  although  “a small but

98

consistent female advantage is found in early language development…this seems to
disappear during childhood. In adults, sex differences in verbal abilities, and in brain
structure and function related to language processing are not readily identified”  (p.181).  
Therefore, girls may display an initial advantage in language development, but by
adulthood, males and females are roughly even in verbal ability.
Fausto-Sterling’s  (1985)  critique  of biological determinism regarding gender
sums up the understanding of the role of biological evidence in terms of gendered literacy
that is foundational to this dissertation study:
Some scientists and social theorists (myself included) no longer believe in the
scientific  validity  of  this  framework.  Such  thinkers  reject  the  search  for  ‘root  
causes,’  arguing  instead  for  a  more  complex  analysis  in  which  an  individual’s  
capacities emerge from a web of interactions between the biological being and the
social environment. Within this web, connecting threads move in both directions.
Biology may in some manner condition behavior, but behavior in turn can alter
one’s  physiology.  Furthermore,  any  particular  behavior can have many different
causes. (pp. 7-8)
In examining gendered literacy, it may be helpful to state that although some biological
differences may exist (causation unknown) in terms of the cognitive processes of males
and females, powerful social forces also help to shape the literacy practices of boys and
girls, women and men.
It is difficult to ascertain whether a biological determinist or a more balanced
view of biological cognitive difference between women and men is normative. Examples
of both are to be found among the research and popular literature alike. A trend includes
popular works (i.e. Sax, 2005; Gurian, 2011) marketed toward educators favoring the
essentialist approach, which exaggerates cognitive differences between males and
females and uses such differences to explain gendered behavioral differences. The study
undertaken as part of this dissertation examines the degree to which biological

99

explanations used to explain gender differences are apparent in the blog narratives of
literacy educators, young people, and creators of texts for young people. As such, this
dissertation helps fill the gap in knowledge regarding which beliefs concerning biological
and cognitive sex differences constitute perceptions of literacy as gendered.
2.8 Gendered Literacy as Remnant of an Historically Gendered Educational System
Another important perspective on sex difference in relation to gendered reading
and literary practices is the historical context of gender and education. Since this study
focuses on the U.S., the discussion is limited to U.S. Scholars have defined gendered
literacy in part as the offshoot of a gendered educational system. Moreover, this
scholarship follows two main themes: 1) the feminization of the teaching profession and
2) a historical  pattern  of  boys’  under-achievement, which this section will address.
2.8.1 The feminization of teaching. Prior to the advent of formal coeducation in
America, boys and girls in colonial times were educated in  “the  dame  school  or  woman’s  
school, in which a woman took care of a small group of children and taught them their
ABCs,  usually  in  her  home”  (Hansot  &  Tyack,  1988,  p.  749).  In  the  mid  1700s,  the  
schools moved out of the home into a public building. Women were employed by the
town  to  teach  children  of  all  different  grade  levels  in  “summer  school”  (p.  749).  In  these  
schools, as in family life and in the colonial dame school, a female teacher taught girls
and boys together. When, in the post-Revolutionary period, girls gained access to the
more formal public schools, only schools in the large, wealthy, northeastern and southern
cities were single sex schools. In rural areas, coeducation was the norm because of the
higher cost associated with single sex schools. Moreover, the coeducational aspect of the

100

rural district schools echoed other common coeducational cultural practices like Sunday
school and daily family life (p. 750).
The  teaching  of  children  from  the  beginning  was  women’s  sphere.  However,  
paradoxically, it was not until after the American Revolution that girls were allowed to
enroll  in  the  more  formal  “winter  district  schools”  (Hansot  &  Tyack,  1988,  p.  749).  
Additionally, the first district school teachers were male, but gradually (starting in the
early 19th century), women joined their ranks (p. 749). Hansot and  Tyack  note  that  “girls’  
admission to public schools was closely connected with the concurrent feminization of
teaching, justified by the analogy of the female teacher as mother. Mothers were expected
to socialize their children in the family, teachers their  pupils  in  the  school”  (p.750).  
Women were therefore seen as better suited to the work of teaching, which was viewed as
requiring the same skills as mothering, and people recognized that formal education of
girls could better prepare them for teaching.
Even as public education for children in New England in early America became
coeducational, girls and boys were schooled with different expectations and purposes.
School was a means to prepare children for their separate future adult roles as men and
women. Hansot and Tyack (1988) write the following:
Advocates of the education of women during this time used largely conservative
arguments: not that schooling would prepare girls for careers outside the home but
that it would make them better mothers and wives. They believed that investing in
what would later be called the human capital of women would increase the
literacy and good moral and civic character of the next generation. By the 1830s
co-education had become the norm despite the fact that Americans took special
pains to separate the spheres of men and women and to create elaborate rationales
of gender differences. (p. 749)

101

In this way, coeducation arose in concert with the strict separation of the sexes in adult
social roles, and the education of girls particularly was seen as the key to ensure the
literacy and morality of future generations.
After the mid-19th century, elementary school teachers increasingly, and
eventually predominantly, were women. As a result,
by 1888 women composed 63 percent of the teaching force in the United States as
a whole, and 90 percent in its cities. This proportion increased over the next
decades. In 1921-22 women filled about 86 percent of elementary school teaching
positions, whether public or private, and 100 percent of kindergartens. They also
had increasing access to positions of genuine authority in the supervisory ranks of
elementary education. (Monaghan, 1994, p. 30)
Based  on  Monaghan’s  (1994)  assessment,  it  is  evident  that,  in  the  U.S.  for  much  of  the  
19th and 20th centuries, women dominated the teaching profession.
Ashley and Lee (2003) describe a similar feminization of teaching in England.
They note that in England following World War II:
The post war baby boom placed enormous pressure on infant schools and
departments and it was assumed that women teachers would be needed to take
these classes. Women were perceived to have the sort of maternal and caring
instincts attributed to their sex and it was these personal qualities that were seen
as essential for the education of infants. (p. 41)
Ashley  and  Lee’s  account  highlights  the  cultural  belief,  similar  to  that  espoused  in  
America, that women are naturally more nurturing than men and thereby more inclined
towards the work of teaching children.
Upon  examination  of  women’s  role  in  higher  education in the U.S., the
development of teaching as a feminized profession in the U.S. becomes clear. Conway
(1974) discusses  women’s  access  to  higher  education  in  the  U.S.  and  women’s  ownership  
of teaching and other service professions. Conway argues that the development of
coeducation in U.S. higher education did not serve women well because it perpetuated

102

the  practice  of  women’s  education  as  complementary  and  inferior  rather  than  equal  to  
that of men. Even at Oberlin College, widely upheld as the epitome of liberal education
for  women,  women’s  intellects  were  “considered  only  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  
services  they  might  provide  for  men”  (p.  6).  The  female  students  provided  “a  domestic  
work-force”  for  the  college,  cooking,  cleaning,  and  doing  the  laundry. Moreover, they
were admitted to Oberlin to encourage the psychological well-being of the male students
-- to provide them with the best possible study environment (p. 6).
Conway (1974) claims that only women who attended the selective female-only
colleges founded post-Civil War were independent intellectuals. Many such women did
not  marry;;  “their  minds  had  been  trained  along  lines  which  required  discipline  and  
independent effort, and they expected to put this training to a practical use which was not
to  be  found  within  the  narrow  confines  of  domestic  life”  (p.  8).  Ironically,  however,  such  
women  went  on  to  found  the  “women’s  professions”  – service professions, including
teaching,  which  Conway  believes  solidified  traditional  beliefs  about  women’s  roles into
professional roles.
The feminists involved in the development of these professions, though radical for
their  time,  did  not  question  “the  acceptance  of  sex-typed roles for women because
evolutionary biology told them that there was a separate nurturing female temperament
which  was  complementary  to  that  of  the  male”  (Conway,  1974,  p.  8).  Conway  therefore  
disparages  the  expansion  of  the  women’s  professions  “as  a  conservative  trend  by  which  
the potential for change inherent in changed educational experience was still-born and
women’s  intellectual  energies  were  channeled  into  perpetuating  women’s  service  role  in  
society”  (p.  9).  Conway  believes  women  were  not  able  to  take  full  advantage  of  their  

103

access to higher education, instead aligning themselves to the service professions, such as
teaching and nursing, and developing these professions according to stereotypically
feminine characteristics.
In regards to teaching, not only were most school teachers women, but most
reading textbooks were authored by women. According to Monaghan (1994), based on
her  study  (relying  mostly  on  primary  and  bibliographic  sources),  “even  before  the  turn  of  
the century women had a virtual monopoly on the authorship of primers”  (p.32).  An  
exception  was  that  women  did  not  produce  “‘phonetic’  readers:  textbooks  that  had  
diacritical markings placed not merely on the new words listed at the beginning or end of
a  story…,  but  on  the  actual  reading  texts”  (p.  32).  This  was  because  “men alone had the
linguistic  training  or  technical  ability,  it  was  assumed,  to  do  so”  (p.  32).  However,  going  
forward, women were the main writers of textbooks focusing on stories. Since primarily
women  were  writing  children’s  literature,  “they  could  often  be found as coauthors or
authors  of  the  new  ‘literature’  texts  that  appeared  soon  after  the  turn  of  the  century”  
(p.33).  Such  textbooks  used  shortened  versions  of  children’s  stories.  Monaghan  (1994)  
explains why women became important in the textbook industry  as  follows:  “the  
feminization of the teaching force and, even more important, of the normal school and
supervisory  levels  of  education,  was  designating  women  as  ‘experts’  by  default”  (p.  38).  
Large numbers of women, in the first part of the 20th century, continued to author
textbooks. As the Great Depression and World War II slowed textbook production,
women were still important to the industry, but they began to lose dominance. During the
Depression,  women’s  representation  in  both  academia  and  in  the  professional realm
(including teaching) decreased (Monaghan, 1994, pp. 35-37). Furthermore, following the

104

war, with the help of the GI bill, more and more men attended college and then went on
to pursue advanced degrees, including in education (Renzetti & Curran, 2003, p. 103).
Because mostly men were pursuing advanced education degrees, men, rather than women,
were considered to be qualified to conduct reading research (Monaghan, 1994, p. 34). As
a result, men came to be seen as reading experts uniquely qualified to author textbooks,
and so men (sometimes co-authoring with women) came to dominate textbook authorship
(p. 39). This change occurred partly as a result of the move away from a literature-based
approach towards a scientific approach to education. The effect on the teaching of
reading was to encourage a focus on silent reading (due to its supposed efficiency), the
development of standardized reading tests, and increased research (p. 34).
One of the factors in this dissertation study is how teachers understand and
respond to gendered literacy. In analyzing the blog posts and comments of literacy
educators, young people, and creators of texts for young people, it looks for ways in
which they address the phenomenon of teaching as a historically feminized occupation
(within the U.S.). Although the feminization of teaching was not found to be an important
part of the blog narratives, it was still a useful lens in terms of analysis of the data.
2.8.2 Underachieving boys. As Rowan et al. (2002) state,  “For  the  most  part,  
people agree that there is a  problem  relating  to  boys’  literacy  levels  but  disagree  about  the  
origin  of  the  problem  and  about  the  ways  it  should  be  dealt  with”  (p.  29). Educators
worry  about  boys’  underachievement  not  just  in  literacy but in other academic areas as
well.  This  is  not  only  a  contemporary  concern.  Historically,  boys’  achievement  has  also  
been a source of worry, as boys (at least, in America), have tended to lag behind girls.

105

For example, Hansot and Tyack (1988) note that by the mid-19th century in the U.S.,
documents show
that girls had access in coeducational schools to roughly the same educational
resources as boys and studied basically the same subjects with the same teachers.
Girls received higher grades than boys and were promoted from grade to grade in
larger proportions. In high schools, in particular, girls outnumbered boys by a
large margin. (p.758)
From this example, it would seem that in America, girls have long tended toward higher
achievement than boys. In  this  sense,  perhaps  girls’  higher  academic  achievement  
presaged the gendered literacy trend. Although female achievement has often been seen
as socially threatening, the gender gap in reading takes on new resonances in
contemporary society, as boys are now seen as falling behind.
Similarly, Skelton (2001) discusses  how  “ideas  that  schools  are  ‘failing  boys’  and  
that  they  construct  and/or  can  challenge  particular  dominant  images  of  masculinity…have  
a  long  history  and  are  not  phenomena  of  recent  times”  (p.  12).  She  describes  this  history  
in England starting with the socially and gender-stratified educational system of the
Victorian era, the introduction of compulsory education in 1880 and free education in
1891 (p. 13), and a movement towards equality in education in the 1940s that was not
realized until the 1960s and 70s (and even then only in terms of social class rather than
sex) (p. 15). The feminist movement led to more attention focused on girls’  education.  As  
girls began surpassing boys in quantified achievement measures, educators concentrated
on boys. The  men’s  rights  camp  claims  that  boys  are  now  the  disadvantaged  group.  
Feminists  “argue  that  what  is  happening  now  is  mainly  that  girls  are  doing  better  within  
the  system,  rather  than  that  boys  are  doing  less  well”  (Barrs, 2000, p. 287).

106

Maynard (2002) traces a parallel trajectory in the educational history of Wales (pp.
10-13), noting that the 1980s were a time of continual striving for equal opportunity in
schools but also a time of making schools more girl-focused. The 1990s, in contrast,
brought a concern  for  boys’  underachievement (p. 13). In Australia, a similar historical
shift, from worrying about equal opportunities for girls to the underachievement of boys
and differing literacy practices, occurred (Alloway & Gilbert, 1997).
In  the  U.S.,  women’s  superior educational achievement was puzzling in the face
of continued pay inequality. Mickelson (1989) entertained several different theories as to
why women achieved despite the job ceiling but found that none of them adequately
explained it. She offered instead the idea that women may not value educational gains in
the same way that men do and that this should be examined (Mickelson, 1989, p. 59).
Maynard (2002) writes that in the U.K., boys’  contemporary underachievement is
often  blamed  on  the  “missing  men”  and  “the  feminised  school”  phenomena. Missing men
refers to absent fathers and to the single-parent home context in which the mother may be
raising her son alone. In this context, it is argued, boys’  role models for masculinity may
come from TV, comics, and video games rather than from fathers themselves (p. 18). The
feminized school refers to the tendency for school to be an environment in which female
teachers supposedly unconsciously adopt teaching practices that are better for girls and
utilize materials better suited for girls. Even testing, it is now claimed, is better matched
to  girls’  supposedly  innate  abilities  than  to  boys’  (p.  19).  This feminized school argument
possibly emerged out of the historical context of the feminization of teaching just
described. Even the fact that certain teaching styles and materials are seen as

107

differentially beneficial to girls and boys is evidence of a pervasive cultural belief in a
gendered literacy.
Maynard (2002) suggests that the obsession in Western countries with the
underachievement of boys may be related to recognition of the salience of literacy in a
global economy. It may also be that as long as boys outperformed girls in science and
math,  boys’  literacy  problems  were  ignored.  There  may  also  be  concern which stems
from the fact that as the under-achievement of boys crosses traditional class barriers, it
becomes  “‘too  close  for  comfort’”  for  those  in  middle  and  upper  classes  and  so  receives
more attention (Maynard, 2002, p. 18).
Maynard (2002) also lists the various teaching approaches that have been used to
try to help boys perform better, such as:
the introduction of single-sex teaching; an increase in the number of male teachers
and male role-models in schools; the adoption of boy-friendly teaching strategies
and assessment methods; the motivation of boys through the establishment of
links between (predominantly male) sports, learning and literacy; and the
inclusion on school reading lists of the kinds of books boys prefer. (p. 19)
The  methods  Maynard  (2002)  mentions  here  include  examples  of  schools’  commitment  
to  gendered  literacy  through  male  teachers’  modeling  of  literacy  behaviors,  single-sex
classrooms, sports-themed literacy and curricular use of boy-preferred literature.
What  is  the  success  of  such  strategies  in  terms  of  encouraging  boys’  literacy?  
Some research suggests that such tactics have not been particularly fruitful. For example,
Sokal and Katz (2008) describe that in their quasi-experimental study of 119 Canadian
third and fourth grade low-achieving (in reading) boys, that for the boys working with
male teachers, “that  neither  male  reading  teachers  nor  computer-based reading had a
significant effect on boys' reading performance when compared with the alternative”  (p.

108

88). Sokal and Katz, based  on  their  study’s  findings,  therefore,  urge  caution  in  terms  of  
making policy decisions regarding instituting male teachers for male students or
incorporating technology into the reading curriculum.
The study discussed in this dissertation analyzes blog posts and comments by
educators, young people, and creators of texts for young people to see if, and in what
ways, the legacy of underachieving boys impacts ongoing discussions of gender and
literacy.
2.9 Study Rationale
2.9.1 Lack of a full definition of gendered literacy. Literacy and reading in the
U.S. (and other Western cultures) is a gendered phenomenon; more specifically, it is
promoted as a feminine domain. This study seeks to provide an integrated conceptual
model of gendered literacy. Although researchers present the phenomenon of gendered
literacy from a variety of different standpoints, they have not yet produced a unified
explanation.  Guzzetti,  Young,  Gritsavage,  Fyfe,  and  Hardenbrook’s (2002) review of
literature regarding gendered literacy in Reading, Writing, and Talking Gender in
Literacy Learning represents one attempt at achieving a more complete understanding of
gendered literacy. However, their approach is limited. For example, they restrict their
review to “complete  reports  of  qualitative or observational studies that investigated text
or text-based  activity  with  informants  drawn  from  or  situated  in  classrooms”  (Guzzetti  et  
al., 2002, p. 9). Hence, they exclude survey research and more quantitative studies, and
the studies they review are classroom-based (p. 9). Furthermore, they focus their
discussion on implications for pedagogy rather than working to build theoretical
understanding of gendered literacy, as this study does.

109

2.9.2 Overview of a model of gendered literacy. As explored in the literature
review  above,  previous  studies  have  discussed  how  gender  is  “done”  in  terms  of  literacy  
practices and classroom interactions, particularly how children themselves enact it. The
research so far points to two main ways in which gendered literacy is enacted by children:
1) in terms of boys resisting school-based literacy while girls are embracing school-based
literacy; and, 2) girls and boys displaying differing literacy preferences. Gendered
literacy is also enacted by educators – by teachers, in their differing expectations of and
perceptions of male and female students and in their gendered management of the literacy
classroom; by parents, through their modeling of literacy behaviors and beliefs about
their  children’s  literacy  preferences; and by librarians, specifically in their expectations in
terms  of  boys’  literacy  and  programmatic  responses to this  perceived  “boy  problem.”  
Researchers have also investigated the interactions between gender and literacy as
variables in studies with a more quantitative approach, presenting gendered literacy as a
quantifiable outcome, usually in terms of girls outscoring boys on standardized tests of
verbal ability. In other cases, researchers have portrayed gendered literacy as a result of
biological, cognitive differences between females and males. Still other researchers have
addressed the historical context of gender in relation to literacy, focusing on the
feminization of the teaching profession  in  the  U.S.  and  a  legacy  of  boys’  
underachievement. Additionally, recent studies have addressed gender dynamics within
the publishing industry.
2.9.3 Overview of the methodologies previously used to study gendered
literacy. Scholars have used diverse methodologies to study gender and literacy, and this
review has covered a range of approaches. Qualitative analyses have included:

110

examination  of  children’s  writing  samples;;  observation  of  classroom  literacy  activities;;  
surveys of and interviews with children regarding reading preferences and writing
process; action research with teachers; observations of mother/preschool child reading
interactions;;  ethnography  in  a  classroom  setting;;  content  analysis  of  teen  girls’  My  Space  
pages, and historical reviews. More quantitative approaches have included: experimental
research regarding  the  relationships  among  variables  such  as  children’s  sex, reading
preferences,  and  reading  comprehension;;  larger  scale  studies  comparing  boys’  and  girls’  
performance on standardized tests of verbal ability; and, experimental research regarding
the ways in which children process texts.
2.9.4 Gaps in the research on gendered literacy. The thrust of the studies
discussed in this literature review has been to examine how gender and literacy are
related, and they have, for the most part, shown that children perform literacy in ways
indicating that literacy is culturally promoted as a feminine activity, more appropriate for
girls than for boys. The studies address the gendered dimensions of literacy practice that
children learn as they become literate, particularly within the school context. However,
individually they do not present any summary of what gendered literacy is. Also, the
studies only scratch the surface as to how literacy is promoted in this way and how this
cultural belief system is maintained.
Based on the assumption that blogs represent a significant site for the social
performance of gendered literacy, this study qualitatively analyzes a sample of blogs
from the KidLitosphere, an important social networking space within the blogosphere for
people whose primary work and/or recreation center around literature for children and
young adults. The analysis focuses on adding to, nuancing, and identifying possible

111

resistances to a model of gendered literacy presented by scholars in the following ways:
as enacted in terms of girls and boys approaching literacy in differing ways as well as by
educators, as a quantifiable achievement gap (usually discussed in terms of standardized
test scores), as the result of cognitive differences between males and females, and as the
result of a historically female-dominated educational system. Specifically, the analysis
addresses the perspectives of literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school
librarians, and teachers), creators of reading materials for children (published authors,
editors,  and  illustrators  of  children’s  and  young  adult  literature),  and  of  children  
themselves.
2.9.5 Importance of social media. Social media are interwoven with the fabric of
daily life, both at the individual and social levels, particularly for people who have
regular internet access and frequently use social media. Some scholars (see, for example,
Turkle, 2011) have alleged that social media are in fact socially-isolating. Moreover, they
argue that the virtual interactions social media provide are, on the one hand, convenient
and easy but on the other hand, (unlike real friends and acquaintances), easily put off or
ignored altogether. Moreover, social media isolate people by claiming time and energy
that could be directed toward face-to-face interactions and relationships. However, other
researchers disagree. For instance, reports by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, a
U.S. non-profit organization that, using a combination of phone (random sampling),
online, and qualitative surveys, along with government, private, and academic research,
“produces reports exploring the impact of the internet on families, communities, work
and home, daily life, education, health care, and civic and political  life”  (Pew  Internet,  
2012,  “About”  section,  “Our  Mission”),  suggest  otherwise.  

112

One such report, “The Social Side of the Internet” (Rainie, Purcell, & Smith,
2011), states that social media users overwhelmingly identify themselves as members of
social groups:
Groups and their members are using all kinds of digital tools to bind themselves
together and some of the most innovative involve social networking sites like
Facebook (used by 62% of the internet users in our survey), Twitter (used by 12%
of internet users), blogs, and texting (used by 74% of the cell phone owners in our
survey):
48% of those who are active in groups say that those groups have a
page on a social networking site like Facebook
42% of those who are active in groups say those groups use text
messaging
30% of those who are active in groups say those groups have their own
blog
16% of those who are active in groups say the groups communicate
with members through Twitter (p. 4)
Findings like these present a snapshot view of the significance of social media, including
blogs, and suggest that social media, for the most part, may be complementary to and
enhance people’s  social engagement.
The report further notes that,
those who are active in social media are among the most heavily involved group
participants: 82% of those who use social networking sites such as Facebook say
they are active in groups vs. 77% of the internet users who are not users of such
sites; and 85% of Twitter users are active in groups vs. 79% of the online
Americans who are not Twitter users. (Rainie, Purcell, & Smith, 2011, p. 6)
Based on these data, social media use correlates strongly with social group involvement.
The report includes a break-down of the types of social groups survey respondents
claimed to be active in, finding that: “11%  are  active  in  literary,  discussion,  or  study  
groups  such  as  book  clubs”  (p.  6).    Additionally, it describes differences between women
and men regarding group involvement, stating:
Women are more likely than men to be active in church groups, consumer groups,
support groups, parent groups, literacy groups and performance groups among

113

other things. At the same time, men are more likely than women to be connected
to groups involving sports or sports fan activities, veterans, and gaming groups.
(p. 7)
What is noteworthy in these findings for the purposes of this study is that users of social
media are active in book clubs and other literary pursuits and that among these bookclub-joining users of social media, women are better represented than men. Due to the
correlations between social media use and gendered social group involvement, social
media are an important site for gendered literacy.
2.9.6 Choosing to study blogs (over other social media). Why study blog posts,
rather than Facebook updates, or tweets, or text messages? For the purposes of analysis,
blog posts provide longer narratives, thereby yielding richer data, than other types of
social media. For example, a tweet must consist of 140 characters or less whereas a blog
post can be as long as needed. Furthermore, blogs are historically older than other forms
of social media, so examining blog posts may give a sense of trends over time (some of
the blogs examined in the study date back to 2004). Additionally, blogs, in general, are
publicly accessible, so they can be accessed unobtrusively.
Nelson (2006), in an article touting the promise of blogs for potential authors and
for the publishing industry, illustrates how blogs were becoming significant:
Blogs have created a new point of entry for outsiders into the book publishing
industry….Writers are using blogs to build audiences that strengthen book
proposals. As a result, many publishers have offered book deals to bloggers over
the last few  years….Professionals at all stages of the publishing process are
blogging. Readers have launched literary blogs, fan blogs, and genre blogs.
Librarians are writing about issues in library science, new acquisitions, and
funding. Booksellers access blogs for news and recommendations, and sometimes
they  “cyber  sell”  a  book that they really like through a blog. Web sites…support  
blogs on industry-related topics and monitor blogs for news. Literary blogs
contain novel reviews, personal essays, information about authors, and links to
news about books. Literary bloggers offer sharp opinions and commentary about

114

positive and negative trends in the publishing industry. Several publishers have
launched blogs. (p. 6)
Writers, readers, librarians, booksellers, and publishers have actualized many of these
predictions (from 2006) of their use of blogs as a crucial point of social connection
regarding books.
For example, the KidLitosphere blogs are influential both within the community
of Kidlit bloggers as well as in the wider worlds of teaching, and the publishing,
marketing and sale of materials for young people. Sarah Bean Thompson (2010), a young
adult librarian who is also a KidLitosphere blogger, explains, in an article published in
Voice of Youth Advocates (a major professional magazine for youth services librarians),
how she, in her roles as a blogger, reader, and librarian, uses the KidLitosphere blogs. As
a  blogger  and  reader,  she  states:  “I admit it-blogging is one of my biggest addictions. I
love to see what other people are reading and hear their thoughts on the books, and I like
that I can share my opinions along with them”  (Thompson,  2010,  p.  470).  As  a  young  
adult librarian, Thompson claims to use book blogs (she cites two examples from the
KidLitosphere) as a source for reviews beyond those published in professional journals,
thereby  aiding  her  in  reader’s  advisory  and  collection  development  work.  Moreover,  she  
says  that,  for  her,  the  blogs  serve  as  “an  extension of the teen advisory group”  
(Thompson, 2010, p. 470). Speaking of her relationship as a young adult services
librarian  to  the  youth  in  her  library’s  teen  advisory  group,  Thompson  explains  how  
reading teen book blogs extends her outreach capacities for teens in the library. She states:
These teens also rely on me to keep them up-to-date about new books to read.
Reading about what other teens are reading and looking forward to expands the
feedback from my local teen advisory group into a large group of book lovers. (p.
470)

115

Thompson’s  comments  are  anecdotal  and  represent  only  one  librarian’s  viewpoint,  but  it  
is likely that other librarians are using the KidLitosphere blogs in the same manner.
Similarly, KidLitosphere blogger Elizabeth Burns (2007), in School Library
Journal (the dominant U.S. school librarian professional journal),  states:  “Book blogs are
fast becoming an important aspect of the children's literature world, and if you're not
already plugged into these resources,  you  should  be”  (p.  40).  Burns presents school
librarians with a convincing list of potential reasons to consult book blogs:
Say you've just read a book and want to rave (or rant) about it, or you need to
figure out which books to buy on a limited budget. Where can you turn? Sure,
there are print publications, such as School Library Journal and the Horn Book.
But as great as those magazines are, you may want more in the way of diverse
opinions and extended reviews, not to mention a place to get answers to your
questions  or  connect  with  fellow  bibliophiles….Blogs are a rich source for
reviews….Blogs also offer publishing  news…,  author  interviews…, and the latest
Newbery award gossip. (pp. 40-41)
In this commentary, Burns, like Thompson (2010) above, emphasizes the social functions
of blogging and blog-reading  as  well  as  librarians’  consultation  of  book  blogs  as  sources  
of alternative and more in depth book reviews, interviews with authors, and publishing
and book award news.
In yet another example, a Publisher’s  Weekly  piece discusses the growing
influence of mother-authored  blogs  reviewing  children’s  books  within  the  publishing  
industry.  The  article  states  that  such  bloggers,  for  the  most  part,  “consider themselves
children’s  book  bloggers  who happen to be moms—rather  than  ‘mom  bloggers’”  
(Springen, 2011, para.15). Quoting marketing and publicity directors for well-known
children’s  book  presses,  the  article  notes  that  publishers  are  paying  attention  to  children’s  
literature blogs and taking advantage of them as marketing opportunities. As an example,
“Candlewick, which reaches out to about 450 mom (and dad) bloggers, offers them

116

review copies and reader prize  packs”  (para.  16).  In  another  example,  the  article  quotes  
Simon  &  Schuster’s  children’s publishing division marketing director: “ ‘For us,
especially with fewer and fewer places for us to be able to sell picture books in terms of
bricks-and-mortar, we really need  to  look  to  other  sources,’ says  Rettino”  (para.  6).  In  
this way, bloggers are important to publishers in that they review and potentially help sell
new books.
The  article  also  claims  that  the  “mom  blogs”  are  sometimes  a  way  that  publishers  
discover new talent. For instance,
Ree Drummond (aka The Pioneer Woman) became a blogging sensation, then
author of The Pioneer Woman Cooks, and then author of the bestselling picture
book Charlie the Ranch Dog. When she blogged about how she wrote the story,
she got more than 800 comments. Kate Jackson, senior v-p, associate publisher,
and editor-in-chief  of  HarperCollins  Children’s  Books,  found  Drummond’s  blog,  
and  the  two  decided  the  family’s  colorful  pooch  would  make  an  ideal  picture  
book star….
Jackson  “dips  into”  at  least  five  or  10  blogs  (and  not  always  the  same  ones)  
every  day,  she  says…. She often learns about new blogs from links on the sites of
her  favorite  writers,  such  as  Drummond.  “Your  antenna  is  always  up,”  she  says.  
“Where  is  the  next  great  children’s  book  coming  from?” (Springen, 2011, para. 910)
In  this  case,  Ree  Drummond’s  blog was key to her becoming a published author of a
children’s  book  and  that  Kate  Jackson,  of  HarperCollins  Children’s  Books, reads blogs
daily, always with the notion that she may discover a promising, publishable new writer.
Although  Drummond’s  blog  is  not part of the KidLitosphere, it does point to a trend in
publishing that affects bloggers such as those included in the KidLitosphere.
2.9.7 Blogs defined. The Pew Internet & American Life Project website describes
blogs as follows: “Blogs, or online journals, are a way for internet users to express
themselves creatively or to document their experiences. About one in ten internet users
contribute  to  a  blog;;  one  in  three  internet  users  read  blogs”  (Pew Internet & American

117

Life Project,  2012,  “Research  on  blogs”).  This  description  stresses  what  users  do  when  
they blog (creatively document their lives) and incorporates U.S. statistics (2010) on
blogging behaviors.
Lomborg  (2009)  defines  the  blog  more  specifically  as  “an  author-driven,
asynchronous and informal genre of CMC that uses various modalities and entails some
interactivity”  (Lomborg, 2009, p. 3). In other words, blogs represent a form of computer
mediated communication characterized by the following features: the author (blogger)
primarily determines the content; and, readers of the blog have the opportunity to interact
with the blog (usually by posting comments), but their interactions with bloggers in this
sense are asynchronous. Moreover, bloggers use various modalities to create the blog
while readers also use various modalities to read the blog.
Miller and Shepherd (2004), in another article discussing the purpose of blogs,
claim  that  “there  is  strong  agreement  on  the  central  features  that  make  a  blog  a  blog.  
Most commentators define blogs on the basis of their reverse chronology, frequent
updating,  and  combination  of  links  with  personal  commentary”  (p.  5).  The  important  
points in this definition include the elements of time – active blogs are frequently updated
and the most recent posts appear first on the blog – and content, which consists of the
blogger’s  own  commentary  combined  with  links.  Moreover,  Miller  and  Shepherd  believe  
that  blogging  comprises  two  main  forms  of  social  action:  “self-expression and
community  development”  (p.  7).  As  Miller  and  Shepherd  state,  “Even  as  they  serve  to  
clarify  and  validate  the  self,  blogs  are  also  intended  to  be  read”  (p.  7).  In  other  words,  
although there is a diary-like component to blogging, blogs also serve as a means for
developing social networks.

118

2.9.8 Usage and purpose of blogs. Like Miller and Shepherd (2004), Nardi,
Schiano, and Gumbrecht (2004)  conceive  of  blogging  primarily  “as  social  activity”  (p.  
222). In contrast to other scholars who focus on the diary-like aspects of blogging, they
link  blogging  to  social  purposes:  “Blogs are a manifestation of diverse social motives, in
which the inscriptions in the blog communicate specific social purposes to others”  (p.  
225). In this sense of encompassing social communication, blogs are a significant
window through which to view the social world. In their ethnographic study of 23
informants and their blogs, Nardi et al. (2004) categorized the motivations for blogging
(some bloggers expressed more than one) among their informants as the following:
1. Update others on activities and whereabouts
2. Express opinions to influence others
3.  Seek  others’  opinions and feedback
4.  “Think  by  writing”
5. Release emotional tension. (p. 225)
The blogs examined in this pilot  study  primarily  review  children’s  and  young  adult  
literature. As such, the bloggers do not write extensively about their personal lives, nor
do they write in a confessional style. Therefore, they most closely follow Nardi  et  al.’s  
(2004) descriptions  of  “express  opinions  to  influence  others,”  “seek  others’  opinions  and  
feedback,”  and  “‘think  by  writing’”  on  the  list  above.
On the other hand, Nardi et al. (2004), although noting the social purposes of
blogs, also observed that the bloggers they studied favored very little interactivity in their
relationship with their blogs’  readers.  They  state:  “Many bloggers liked that they could be
less responsive with blogging than they could in email, instant messaging, phone, or face
to face communication. They seemed  to  be  holding  their  readers  at  arm’s  length”  (p.
228).

119

In other words, although blogs help bloggers develop social networks, they also serve as
a means to broadcast the self without much interactivity with blog readers. Nardi et al.
(2004) also note that,  among  their  study’s  participants,  “The  relationship  between  blogger  
and reader was markedly asymmetrical. Bloggers wanted readers but they did not
necessarily want to hear a lot  from  those  readers”  (p.  227),  and,  “bloggers wanted to
express themselves without the ‘threat’ of immediate feedback. When feedback came, it
was often in other media, after time had passed. Blog comments were infrequent and
often said very little”  (p.228). Bloggers, therefore, seem to see their blogs as a safe (safe
in the sense of not attracting immediate attention) venue in which to tell stories and share
opinions.
In  contrast  to  other  scholars’  focus  on  the  Internet’s  capacity  for  identity-bending
recreation, Miller and Shepherd (2004) note that
Bloggers…seem  less  interested  in  role  playing  than  in  locating,  or  constructing,  
for themselves and for others, an identity that they can understand as unitary, as
real….To  the  extent  that  the  blog  has  become  a  widely understood and shared
rhetorical  convention,  it  functions  as  a  site  of  relative  stability….The  blog  might  
be understood as a particular reaction to the constant flux of subjectivity, as a
generic effort of reflexivity within the subject that creates an eddy of relative
stability. Infinite play, constant innovation, is not psychically sustainable on an
indefinite basis. In a culture in which the real is both public and mediated, the
blog makes real the reflexive effort to establish the self against the forces of
fragmentation, through expression and connection, through disclosure. (p. 11)
Miller and Shepherd, then, comment on the blog as a site in which bloggers actually
construct a more fixed identity, for the benefit of both themselves and their readers,
perhaps in response to other functions and locations of computer mediated
communication which allow for more subjective interpretations. Miller and Shepherd
view blogs as a genre characterized by reflexivity and personal revelation in the service
of anchoring the self and protecting the self from fragmentation.

120

2.9.9 Blogging trends. The writing of the blogs that provide the bulk of data for
the study  is  referred  to  as  “macro-blogging,”  in  contrast  to  the  “microblogging”  that  users  
of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter engage in when they post status
updates (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, & Zickuhr, 2010, p. 2). According to the Pew Internet
& American Life Project report, Social Media & Mobile Internet Use among Teens and
Young Adults, micro-blogging has gained in popularity, particularly among youth, while
macro-blogging has declined:
Since 2006, blogging by teens has dropped from 28% of teen Internet users to
14% of online teens in 2009. Teens are now beginning to resemble their elders in
their likelihood of blogging, as about 12% of adults have consistently reported
blogging since February 2007. This decline is also reflected in the decline of the
number of teens who say they comment on blogs within social networking
websites – 52% of  social  network  using  teens  report  commenting  on  friends’  
blogs within these sites, down from 76% commenting in 2006. (Lenhart, Purcell,
Smith, & Zickuhr, 2010, p. 24).
Therefore, fewer teens are now blogging (a percentage on par with adults), and fewer are
commenting  on  others’  blogs  accessed  through  social  networking  sites.  Nonetheless,  
macro-blogging (that is, authoring traditional blogs) is still an important form of social
media among adults overall. Additionally, older adult bloggers have actually increased in
numbers:
The prevalence of blogging among adults as a whole has remained consistent
because the decline in blogging among young adults has been marked by a
corresponding increase in blogging among older adults. For example, in
December 2007, 24% of online 18-29 year olds reported blogging, compared with
7% of those thirty and older. By 2009, that difference had nearly disappeared—
15% of internet users under age thirty and11% of those ages thirty and up now
maintain a personal blog. Among adult internet users, blogging is equally
common among men and women; whites, black and Hispanics; and those with
low and high levels of income and education. (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, &
Zickuhr, 2010, p. 24).

121

According to the Pew Internet research, then, the percentage of age 30 and over bloggers
increased, and likelihood of blogging is roughly the same based on educational and
income level, race (black, Hispanic, white), and sex.
2.10 Literature Review: Summary
Although scholars have begun to refer specifically to the phenomenon named
“gendered  literacy,”  no  one  has  yet  brought  together  the  various  definitions  to  form  a  
cohesive picture of the phenomenon. The study undertaken for this dissertation thereby
addresses a major gap in the literature overall by positing an integrated conceptual model
of gendered literacy based on the existing literature, including 1) gendered literacy as
something  enacted  both  by  children  and  by  the  educators  concerned  with  children’s  
literacy, including parents, librarians, and teachers; 2) gendered literacy portrayed as a
quantifiable outcome, usually in terms of girls outscoring boys on standardized tests of
verbal ability; 3) gendered literacy portrayed as a result of biological, cognitive
differences between females and males; and, 4) gendered literacy portrayed as an artifact
resulting from the historical feminization of the teaching profession in the U.S. and a
legacy  of  boys’  underachievement.  (See the introduction of this chapter for a table
describing the conceptual model).
The study then examines blog narratives authored by literacy educators (parents,
public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for children (published
authors, editors, and published illustrators); and, children/young adults, and compares the
notions of gendered literacy expressed within those blog narratives with those identified
in the literature in order to both nuance and expand the phenomenon known as gendered
literacy.

122

CHAPTER 3 METHODS
The purpose of this study is to examine gender as it relates to literacy in the
United States from a variety of perspectives, including those of literacy educators
(parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers), children and young adults,
(literacy learners), and creators of reading materials for children (editors and published
authors  and  illustrators  of  children’s  and  young  adult  literature). It also compares the
conceptions of gendered literacy identified through data analysis to conceptions identified
in the literature review with the goal of creating a conceptual model of gendered literacy.
This section begins by first describing gaps in the literature to which the study
responds. Second, it describes the goals of the study and research questions. Third, it
discusses the meta-theoretical perspective underpinning the study and then, more
specifically, the qualitative methodology as well as the rationale for analyzing data
collected from the KidLitosphere blogs. Fourth, the pilot study is outlined in detail. Fifth,
the data collection procedures and analysis are described.  Finally,  the  study’s  limitations  
are discussed.
3.1 Responding to Gaps in the Literature
The study fills a gap in the  scholarship  on  “gendered literacy,” a conceptual term
that, although used more and more in both research and popular literature (including in
the media in the form of reports on gaps in achievement between boys and girls), has not
yet been fully described. A more cohesive model of gendered literacy is important in
terms of understanding how and why school-based literacy and particular types of
informal literacy in the U.S. continue to be associated with femininity, while other forms
of informal literacy are associated with boys and boys are perceived  as  “reluctant  readers.”  

123

In this study, gender is defined as socially constructed (through repeated
performance) and literacy as the socially-learned reading of multiple text types in
multiple contexts. As described in the literature review, studies relating to gendered
literacy,  with  few  exceptions  (Cherland,  1994;;  McKechnie,  2004,  2006  “Spiderman”;;  
Nichols, 2002; Scholastic & Harrison Group, 2010; Scholastic & Yankelovich, 2008;
Sturm, 2003), have focused on the context of school, either surveying children regarding
their attitudes toward curricular reading or surveying them about extracurricular reading
from within the classroom space. The study of gendered literacy from within the school
produces a view of gendered literacy that highlights girls rather than boys, due to
perceptions of girls as more enthusiastic readers than boys. The study described in this
dissertation, in contrast, takes a new approach to the discussion by looking at gender and
literacy practice from within the blogosphere, and as will be seen, a view of boys as
enthusiastic readers, similar to girls, is evident in the data.
The literature on gendered literacy presents multiple concepts of gendered literacy.
One of these concepts is of gendered literacy as an enactment. Gendered literacy is
enacted by children 1) in terms of boys’ resistance of school-based literacy in contrast to
girls’  embrace  of school-based literacy (DiPrete & Jennings, 2012; Gordon & Lu, 2008;
Maynard, 2002; Millard, 1997, 2005; Moss, 2007; Smith, Smith, Gilmore, & Jameson,
2012; Smith & Wilhelm, 2002) and, 2) girls’  and  boys’ differing literacy preferences (i.e.
Chapman et al., 2007; Dutro, 2003; Hall & Coles, 1997; McKechnie, 2004; Topping &
Renaissance Learning Ltd, 2012). Gendered literacy is also enacted by educators. For
example, parents perform gendered literacy in the ways in which they model literacy
practice to their sons and daughters (Cherland, 1994) and hold differing expectations of

124

literacy practice for their sons and daughters (Nichols, 2002; Scholastic & Harrison
Group, 2010). Although  there  is  a  significant  body  of  literature  relating  to  young  people’s  
enactment of gendered literacy, there is a lack of  literature  relating  to  parents’  
perspectives on gendered literacy. This study will make up for this by examining blog
narratives and comments written by and referring to the perspectives of parents.
Literature on librarians’  perspectives  on  gendered  literacy is equally lacking, and
it is practice- (rather than research) oriented. Librarians enact gendered literacy through
the  ways  in  which  they  develop  collections  and  programs  to  deal  with  the  apparent  “boy  
problem”  in  relation  to  gendered  literacy  (Doiron, 2003; Jones & Fiorelli, 2003; Parsons,
2004).  The  literature  on  teachers’  perspectives  is  more  robust.  Teachers  enact  gendered  
literacy  through  their  differing  expectations  of  female  and  male  students’  verbal  abilities  
and literacy behaviors (Maynard, 2002; Moore et al., 2007; Murphy & Elwood, 1998;
Sanford, 2005/2006) and through their control of the literacy classroom in ways which
draw attention to gender (Clarricoates, 1980; Orellana, 1995). The study described in this
dissertation makes up for the gaps in the literature regarding the perspectives of librarians
and teachers towards gender and literacy by examining blog narratives authored by and
representative of the perspectives of both groups. In examining these blog narratives, the
study focuses on  educators’  understandings of gender in relation to  young  people’s  
literacy, thereby providing explanation as to why educators enact gendered literacy in the
ways described in the research literature.
Research on how gendered literacy is enacted by the children’s  publishing
industry appears primarily in the news media, focusing on the relative lack of female
representation within the industry,  and  using  this  as  an  explanation  of  the  perceived  “boy  

125

problem”  – that is, the perception that boys do not enjoy reading and do not read as much
as girls (i.e.  McKechnie,  2006  “Becoming  a  reader”). The beliefs of authors, illustrators,
and editors in relation to gender and literacy have yet to be fully addressed, and this study
does so by analyzing blogs representing these perspectives.
The  literature  on  gendered  literacy  as  enactment  has  focused  on  children’s  
performance of gendered literacy, and as discussed earlier, most of these performances
have been examined from within the school context. This study, in examining gendered
literacy as performed by multiple actors within the blogosphere, provides a new approach.
Researchers and the media have also treated gendered literacy as a quantifiable
outcome, usually discussed in the context of  girls’  superior  performance  on  standardized  
tests of verbal ability. Although this literature is not found to be part of the discussion of
gender and literacy among the blogs sampled, it provided background for perceptions
how gender and literacy are connected.
Researchers have also portrayed gendered literacy as resulting from differences in
biological, cognitive function between females and males, and such portrayals range from
conservative biological determinist views to more balanced arguments combining nature
and nurture. This literature spans a broad array of texts, including scientific research
literature, the media, and popular practice-oriented education books. However, the
present study contributes to the discussion by looking at the degree to which these
debates are a part of blog narratives relating to gender and literacy.
Lastly, other scholarship has treated gendered literacy as an artifact resulting from
the historic feminization of the teaching profession in the U.S. and a legacy  of  boys’  
underachievement. The present study looks specifically at which, if any, aspects of this

126

historical narrative appear in blog posts relating to gender and literacy, finding, in the end,
that this perspective is represented in only a small number of blog posts and comments
among the blogs sampled.
3.2 Research Goals
In reviewing the literature, although researchers have begun to use the term
“gendered  literacy”  (i.e.  Almjeld,  2008; Barrs, 2000; Orellana, 1995; Sanford,
2005/2006), they have defined it in many different ways, no one having yet aggregated
these various definitions to arrive at a complete understanding of the phenomenon. To
this end, the study fills a gap in the literature by bringing together these theoretical
insights to arrive at a multi-faceted, nuanced view of gendered literacy. The goals of the
study are therefore two-fold:
1. To develop an empirical model of gendered literacy that articulates patterns
and resistances in the ways in which literacy educators (parents, public
librarians, school librarians, and teachers), literacy learners (children and
young adults), and creators of reading materials for young people (published
authors, editors, and published illustrators), understand the connection
between literacy (particularly reading) and gender in U.S. culture.
2. To compare this model to a conceptual model based on previous literature.
3.3 Research Questions
Research Question 1: What are the conceptions of gendered literacy among
literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers);
creators of texts for children (published authors, editors, and published

127

illustrators); and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging
activities?
Research Question 2: How do the conceptions of gendered literacy identified
through the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts for
children, and children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions
identified in the literature review?
Research Question 3: What similarities and differences, if any, are represented
in conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators; creators of texts
for children; and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging
activities?
Research Question 4: What patterns, if any, of resistance to the dominant
conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed?
3.4 Methodological Approach
Overall, a social constructivist view of both gender and literacy is assumed in this
study. Because of social norms relating to gender, males and females are expected to
behave differently. Behavioral differences between males and females are thereby
attributed to differences in the ways in which males and females are socialized rather than
to essential, biological differences. Similar to the lens here applied to gender, the study of
literacy behaviors should examine individuals as embedded within a social fabric of
literacy practices rather than focusing only on individual cognitive function. The ways in
which gender and literacy are understood is socially regulated, and more specifically,
regulated through language.

This qualitative study shares the characteristics of naturalistic inquiry identified
by Lincoln and Guba (1985), including a natural setting, the use of a human instrument
(principal investigator as researcher), purposive sampling, inductive data analysis,
emergent design, tentative application, focus-determined boundaries, and special criteria
for trustworthiness (pp. 39-43). The setting is the KidLitosphere, a website bringing
together over 550  blogs  addressing  various  aspects  of  children’s  literature;;  a  purposive  
sample of 23 blogs was drawn both for representation of the groups of interest and for the
blogs’  topicality  relating  to  gender,  reading,  and  youth  when  blog  posts  and  comments  
were sampled from those blogs. Data were read through and analyzed inductively using
the constant comparison method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to identify themes, which were
then coded to facilitate analysis. See Table 6 for examples of the ways in which the data
were coded. The study design was not determined from the start, but followed the
exploratory approach inherent to naturalistic inquiry. Because this is a qualitative study,
conclusions made based on the findings are limited in scope. However, this dissertation
provides a detailed rendering of the KidLitosphere context with the goal of facilitating
transferability, that is, facilitating other  researchers’  use of the study’s  findings  in  other  
social contexts. The findings are trustworthy in that the data analyzed, which are quoted
extensively in the Findings sections, Chapters 4-7 of the dissertation, clearly present the
phenomenon of gendered reading from the perspective of the bloggers and commenters.
Additionally, confirmability of the study is facilitated through detailed description of the
procedures followed.
More specifically, the study follows the “grounded  theory”  approach  outlined  by  
Glaser and Strauss (1967). This approach was taken because although gendered literacy

129

has been discussed from a variety of perspectives, a full, nuanced conceptual model has
yet to be introduced. Moreover, an extensive exam-outcome-based literature in regard to
gender and verbal performance (discussed in Chapter 2, Section 2.6, Gendered Literacy
as a Quantifiable Achievement  Gap”  above)  already  exists.  An  interpretive  approach  
looks at the conceptions of gender and literacy that help to produce the social framework
in which a consistent achievement gap, with female students outperforming males, occurs.
Although data coding and analysis follows the grounded theory approach, the study
began  with  “a  provisional  ‘start  list’  of  codes,”  as described by Miles and Huberman
(1994, p. 58). This list of codes issuing from a conceptual model of gendered literacy,
developed from the literature review and from the research questions, were the lens
through which the data were analyzed. Thus, the generation of theory began, in part,
during an initial phase of exploring the literature.
Starting with existing literature and general concepts of gender and literacy
formed from this body of literature, the groups to be studied – literacy educators (parents,
public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for children (published
authors, editors, and published illustrators); and, children/young adults – were decided.
The KidLitosphere blogs were chosen as the site of the study because the bloggers
represent all the groups of interest and because the blogs represent a natural setting in
which themes of gender and literacy are eminent. In choosing the blogs from which to
sample data for analysis, representativeness of the groups of interest, but also theoretical
saturation, for example including blogs that were mentioned as frequently read, were
considered. Also, analysis of blog data shaped subsequent interview inquiries.

130

Many possible data points exist for the study described in this dissertation.
Qualitative content analysis of blog posts allows for an unobtrusive way in which to
study gendered literacy and to examine multiple perspectives. Interviews with individual
bloggers were also used to clarify further the conceptions of gendered literacy identified
in the model. However, interviews do not provide the main source of data since they
represent an obtrusive means of gathering data. Similarly, written sources of data directly
solicited from the participants – for example, prompting participants to write about
gender in relation to literacy – would also be an obtrusive way in which to examine the
phenomenon. Qualitative analysis of blog content was therefore the main method used,
while interviews were used for triangulation and to provide a secondary data source.
3.5 Pilot Study Design
At the time of the pilot study, the KidLitosphere had not yet been decided upon as
the site from which to choose the blogs. Also, the pilot study focused to a greater degree
than the final study on aspects of the blogs analyzed, such as the scope of the blog’s  
influence. Nonetheless, the pilot study helped with decisions regarding which groups of
people to focus on for the final study and highlighted the need for a clearer coding
framework in the analysis of the blog data.
3.5.1 Choosing blogs for analysis. Based on trying various key word
combinations and search engines, many of which yielded blogs having little to do with
gendered literacy, Firefox web browser and the Google  advanced  search  function,  “All  
these words,” within the domain: .blogspot.com, were used to search:  “read  girl  boy  blog.”  
A blog was included only if the blogger was a parent, teacher, public or school librarian,
or  a  child/young  adult.  Additionally,  the  blog’s  topic/content  had to focus on

131

children’s/young  adult  reading/literacy  and  had to have been updated within the past
month.
3.5.2 Data analysis. The following questions guided the data analysis for the pilot
study:
1. What  is  the  blog’s  main  purpose?  
The “About”  statement  and/or  the  first  post were read to answer this question.
2. What  concepts  does  the  blogger  associate  with  children’s/young  adults’  
reading/literacy?
These were based on qualitative analysis of sentences containing the words
“read”  (and variants, i.e. reads, reading).
3. Are  these  concepts  of  children’s/young  adults’  reading/literacy  the  same  or  
different among blogs by parents, teachers, public and school librarians, and
children?
Blogs’  expressed  concepts  of  reading/literacy were compared.
4. What concepts of gendered literacy do the blogs express or embody?
The “About”  statement  and/or  first  post were read to answer this question.
Concepts were assigned according to those identified in the research literature
as well as any new and/or resistant concepts identified in analyzing the data.
5. How  do  the  concepts  of  children’s/young  adults’  reading/literacy  connect,  or  
not, to concepts of gendered literacy?
6. Are the concepts of gendered literacy the same or different among blogs by
parents, teachers, public and school librarians, and children?
The blogs’  stated  purposes  and  concepts  of  gendered  literacy were compared.

132

7. What  is  the  scope  of  the  blog’s influence?
How many people have looked at the blog? (if available, from counter
function)
How  many  people  follow  the  blog?  (if  available,  from  “Followers”  section)
How many comments (from readers) does each sample post have?
Who  is  the  intended  audience  (as  stated  in  the  “About”  section  or  first  post)?  
Who  comprises  the  actual  audience  (as  reflected  in  the  comments)?  Authors’  
characteristics were identified through names, stated occupation, photos,
linked blogger profile, etc.
How  may  the  blog’s  comments  be  characterized?
Does the blog author belong to a community of other bloggers? This was
determined  by  examining  the  number  of  blogs  in  the  blog’s  blogroll,  the  
number of comments posted by other bloggers listed in the blogroll, and the
number  of  references  to  other  blogs  in  the  blogger’s  posts.  
3.6 Pilot Study Results
3.6.1 Bloggers’  characteristics. For the pilot study, a small sample of blogs was
examined in order to help determine the feasibility of using blog data to answer the
research questions. The pilot study examined three blogs—one by a male schoolteacher,
one by a teenage girl, and one by a mother (who is a school librarian). To determine these
bloggers’  characteristics,  the  blogs’ “About”  statements,  first  posts,  Blogger  profiles,  and  
photos (if available) were reviewed. Among the bloggers, the mother/ school  librarian’s  
posts were the longest, with an average of 561words per post (including the post title),
based on the three posts examined (three most recent consecutive posts, as of September

133

28, 2010). For this pilot study, the three most recent (as of September 28, 2010)
consecutive posts were analyzed.  For  the  male  teacher’s  blog,  The  Boy  Reader, posts
from June 15 and 16, 2010, and September 1, 2010 were analyzed.  For  the  teenage  girl’s  
blog, Frenetic Reader: YA Book Reviews and Such, posts from September 26, 27, and 28,
2010 were analyzed.  For  the  mother’s  blog,  Books for My Boy and Yours: A Blog about
Books that Boys Will Enjoy Hearing and Reading, posts from September 4, 12, and 22,
2010 were analyzed. This blog related  to  themes  identified  in  the  male  teacher’s  blog  
(The Boy Reader), so for Books for My Boy and Yours: A Blog about Books that Boys
Will Enjoy Hearing and Reading, the October 10, 2010 post, which was the fourth
consecutive post following the September 4, 12, and 22, 2010 posts, was also analyzed.
The three blogs share a common primary purpose – to review books. However,
the  male  schoolteacher’s  blog  specifically  reviews  books  for  boys,  while  the  teenager’s  
blog  reviews  young  adult  fiction,  and  the  mother/school  librarian’s  blog  reviews  early  
elementary books.
Since such a small number of blogs was examined, the data set was limited for
this pilot study. Therefore, it was only possible to identify potential patterns and to
compare the blogs to one another. The  bloggers’  motives  in  starting  their  blogs were
identified, along with the blogs’  possible  spheres  of  influence  based  on  the  following  
measures:  number  of  “followers,”  number  and  content  of  comments  in  the  posts  analyzed,  
and the intended versus the actual audience for these blogs (based on the blogger’s  
“About”  section  or  first  post  and  blog  readers’  comments).  The  blogger’s  degree  of  
connection with other bloggers was also estimated by examining blog rolls and the

134

number of times the bloggers referenced other blogs. Appendix A is a table showing how
the pilot study analysis was organized.
3.6.2 Bloggers’  motives. The  bloggers,  based  on  their  “About”  statements,  
expressed different motives for starting their blogs. The male teacher stated that he would
like  to  introduce  boys  to  “books  besides  Captain  Underpants”  (01/03/2008,  first  entry).  
The  mother’s  motive  in  starting  her  blog  is  both  personal  and  public,  combining  her  roles  
as  both  mother  and  school  librarian.  She  states  that  she  wants  to  raise  her  young  son  “to  
be  a  reader.”  She  also  hopes  her “blog  helps  others  encourage  boys  to  read.”  In this sense,
her motive is similar to that of the teacher, who wants to help boys find good books to
read,  except  that  the  teacher,  in  his  “About”  statement,  names  boys  as  an  audience  rather  
than  their  caregivers  or  teachers.  The  female  teen  blogger’s  motive in starting her blog, as
she  states  in  her  “About”  page,  is  ambiguous:  she  states  that  her  reason  for  starting  the  
blog  is  her  “extreme  and  frenetic  (hence  the  blog  title)  love  of  reading.”  A  reader  could
infer from this that her motive is to keep track of what she reads, to share her reading
with others, or a host of other reasons.
3.6.3 Bloggers’  experiences  of  children’s/young  adults’  reading. In order to
examine  bloggers’  experiences  of  young  people’s  reading,  each sentence containing the
words  “read”  (and  variants,  i.e.  reads,  reading) in each blog post sampled, was archived.
Other words related to reading—watching, listening, observing, noticing, consuming,
etc.—had been considered as search terms, but reading was the way bloggers typically
described literacy practice. A brief description of each sentence was recorded. Then
similar ideas were combined. Finally, after a list of sentences for each blog describing the

135

main themes of each post had been written, the sentences were compared across the blogs.
The images in the blog posts and in the blog frame were also examined.
Blogging  represents  a  secondary  experience  of  children’s/young  adults’  
reading/literacy;;  it  is  the  blogger’s  reflection  on  the  primary  experience  of  
children’s/young  adults’  reading/literacy.  In this sense, this study treats blog narratives as
proxies for reading and literacy practice. However, these narratives are a valuable
window onto the gendered sociocultural conceptions and expectations encompassing
children’s/young  adults’  reading/literacy.  
3.6.3.1 Reading children’s/young adult books as daily practice. The bloggers are
similar in  their  experiences  of  children’s  and  young  adult  literacy.  All  three  bloggers  
conceive  of  reading  children’s/young adult books as a pleasurable daily practice. The
male teacher reads at home in the evenings and while on vacation; the female teenage
blogger, based on her daily postings of book reviews, reads all the time; and the
mother/school librarian blogger reads with her son before he goes to bed in the evening.
However, the mother/school librarian also presents reading with her son as a
chore, something to be done at the end of the day even when they are both tired. She
brings anxiety to the task, expressing her fear that school-based reading will become
something her son resists. She describes her diligence in taking him to the library weekly
and  selecting  books  for  them  to  check  out.  Her  son’s  school  homework  is  to  read  for  15  
minutes each day and record the books he has read in a reading log. This blogger does not
think reading should be assigned as homework; she implies that reading together should
already be a home practice and is judgmental of other parents who she imagines would
not read to their child unless it is required as homework. She notes that she has read to

136

her son daily since he was an infant. At the same time, she states that she finds reading
with her son (as he works to become an independent reader) frustrating. However, she is
pleased that her son stays focused while reading at bedtime even though he is tired. Thus
this mother’s  account  of  her  experience of helping her son form as a reader relates the
experience as one characterized both by pleasure and stress.
3.6.3.2 Planning future reading. All three bloggers dedicate sentences in their
blogs to planning what they will read next. For the male teacher, this primarily takes the
form of his search for books that reluctant readers will enjoy. The female teen blogger
mentions pleasure reading she is planning to do or lists books she has recently bought.
The mother plans what to read next in the context of what she will read with her son to
help him develop as a reader (i.e. working up to longer books). Moreover, the male
teacher and the female teenage blogger both mention suspense as a pleasurable aspect of
reading. The male teacher and the mother both express the belief that certain texts are
better suited to boys. The teacher mentions that reluctant readers (especially boys) prefer
short texts that require less time spent reading. Similarly, the mother recommends a book
that  “celebrates  boys’  imaginations”  and  non-fiction early readers about animals; she
feels that many boys, like her son, enjoy reading about animals and prefer books that
don’t  need  to  be  read  from  beginning to end.
3.6.3.3 Teaching reading. Both the male teacher and the mother discuss reading
in the context of teaching, and both mention reading aloud as a part of teaching reading.
However, they mention different aspects of teaching reading. The male teacher also
comments on the  boys’  book  club  he  manages  and  his  sense  of  responsibility for
encouraging reluctant readers, especially by providing  them  with  the  “perfect”  book. The

137

mother also discusses the following aspects of teaching reading: reading together with her
child, choosing books for him to read, taking him to the library weekly, and teaching the
mechanics of reading (particularly her frustration associated with this).
3.6.3.4 Other unique aspects  of  children’s/young  adults’  reading addressed by
the bloggers. The male teacher and the mother blog about other unique aspects of
children’s  and  young  adults’  reading. For example, the male teacher describes reading
children’s  books  and  finding  good  children’s  books  (especially  ones  suited  to  reluctant  
readers) as requiring time and money. He typifies the process of converting reluctant
readers (whom he describes as usually male) as hard work, requiring significant outputs
of time and money to find good books and the right books (the ones that will win over
reluctant readers). He is also the only blogger of the three who specifically mentions
reading  reviews  and  actively  seeking  recommendations  of  children’s  books.  
The mother contributes a unique perspective in her commentary on reading as
homework. She does not think reading should be called homework, judges other parents
for not reading to their children unless required to do so, and fears that school-based
reading will become something her son resists. Her perspective is also unique among the
three blogs examined in that she focuses on quantities, for example in terms  of  books  (“a  
nice  pile  of  books,”  “a  bag  full  of  books”  from  the  library);;  words  (her  son  feels  
accomplished  when  “he  has  read  all  of  the  words);;  facts  (“these  books  are  packed  with  
facts.”);;  and  in  terms  of  the  numbers  of  times  she  and  her  son  have  read a book (reading a
book multiple times helps her son develop a sense of story and memory for plot).
3.6.3.5 Concepts of gendered literacy expressed or embodied by the blogs. By
reading  the  blogs’  “About”  statements,  first  posts,  and  images,  the  main  concepts of

138

gendered literacy expressed or embodied by the blogs were assessed. These concepts
include those identified in the research literature as well as any new and/or resistant
concepts identified in analyzing the data.
The blogs authored by the male teacher and by the mother share concepts of
gendered  literacy.  Both  draw  from  the  concepts  of  boys’  resisting  literacy  and  girls  and  
boys having differing literacy preferences.  The  female  teen  blogger’s  blog  embodies  the  
concept  of  girls’  embracing  literacy, both in and out of school (in reading, writing). She
also introduces a new concept, which, based on further searching, seems like it will recur.
This is the phenomenon of the extreme female teen reader and extreme blogger – she
posts book reviews on her blog on a daily basis. Moreover, she states that her motive for
starting  the  blog  is  her  “extreme  and  frenetic  (hence  the  blog  title)  love  of  reading.”  
No examples of resistance to the dominant conceptions of gendered literacy were
found in this sample.
3.6.3.6 Blogs’  influences on blog readers. The blogs were also examined in terms
of their plausible scope of influence, based on several measures. For example, Blogger
has  a  “followers”  function.  The  female  teenage  blogger  had  accumulated  the  most  
“followers”  – 787 – of the 3 blogs. The male teacher had 70  “followers,”  and  the  mother
had  no  “followers”  section  on  her  blog.  The  male  teacher’s  blog  (of  the  posts  analyzed)  
garnered the most comments – 10  total  (7  females  and  3  males).  The  female  teenager’s  
blog posts listed 7 comments. The mother’s  blog  listed  no  comments.  
The comments were categorized according to their content – some comments fit
more  than  one  category.  The  most  common  theme  of  the  comments  on  the  male  teacher’s  
blog was affirmation of the blogger’s  description  of  the  teacher’s  role  in  relation  to  

139

reluctant readers. The second most common category was that of extraneous friendly
comments. Other themes included expressions of gratitude for book recommendations,
affirmation  of  the  blogger’s  description of reluctant but proficient readers, reflection on
the  commenter’s  own  experience  with  her  reluctant  reader  son  (two comments),
suggestions of websites or blogs to visit (two comments), and an expression of gratitude
to the blogger for visiting the  commenter’s  own  blog.  
Comments  posted  on  the  female  teenager’s  blog  (of  the  posts  analyzed)  were
characterized according to the following two categories: expressions of gratitude for the
blogger’s  book  recommendations  and  affirmations  of  the  blogger’s book reviews. The
mother’s  blog  received no comments on the posts analyzed.
The  intended  versus  the  actual  audience  for  these  blogs,  based  on  the  blogger’s  
statements  in  the  “About”  section  or  first  post,  and  the  comments  of  the  posts  analyzed,
was also noted. In the case of the male teacher, the intended audience is different from
the  actual  audience.  The  teacher  refers  to  “my  boy  readers”  and  mentions  that  he  wants  to  
broaden their reading preferences  beyond  “Captain  Underpants,”  a  series  published by
Scholastic that is suggested (by Scholastic, on the Scholastic website) for readers ages 710. In this sense it would seem that his audience is elementary school-aged boys.
However, the comments posted to his blog entries (among those analyzed) are written by
teachers,  parents,  school  librarians,  and  children’s  literature  authors  and  illustrators.
These commenters (rather than elementary school-aged  boys)  represent  the  blog’s  true  
audience. The female teenage blogger does not specifically mention who she intends her
audience to be. All of the comments to her posts were by other female readers, with ages
ranging from high school to college to early 20s. All, based on their comments, are avid

140

readers, including some avid readers of young adult fiction. One commenter is also an
aspiring writer of young adult fiction, and one is an aspiring young adult librarian. The
mother intends others in a position to “encourage  boys  to  read”  as  her primary audience.
She  specifically  mentions  “parents,”  but  since  the posts analyzed did not receive any
comments, the actual audience for her blog cannot be assessed.
3.6.3.7 Bloggers’  connection  to  other  bloggers. In analyzing the blogs, the degree
to which the blogger belongs to a community of other bloggers was also assessed. This
was accomplished by examining blog rolls – the list of blogs the blogger supposedly
follows or otherwise supports and therefore includes on their own blog as a list of links
with  the  blogs’  titles.  The  female  teenager’s  blog  roll  was the largest, containing 24 blogs.
The  male  teacher’s  blog  roll  included  12  blogs.  The  mother’s  blog  had  no  blog  roll.  In  
terms of a blog roll, then, the female teenage blogger is the most well-connected. The
number of times the bloggers referenced other blogs in the posts analyzed was tallied.
The female teenage blogger was also the most well-connected to other bloggers in this
regard, mentioning two other blogs among her posts. The male teacher and mother did
not reference any other blogs in the posts I read. I also examined the number of
comments  posted  by  other  bloggers  listed  in  the  blog  author’s  blog  roll  as  another  
measure  of  the  blogger’s  connection  to  other  bloggers.  The  male  teacher’s  posts  were  
commented on by four bloggers listed in his blog roll. The female teenage blogger,
despite having an extensive blog roll, did not receive any comments on her posts from
other  bloggers  in  her  blog  roll.  On  this  measure,  the  male  teacher’s  blog  was  the  most  
well-connected to other bloggers.

141

3.6.3.8 Discussion of pilot study. This pilot study pointed to the feasibility of a
larger project. It showed the value of blogs for studying literacy practice in connection to
gender. Blog data offer advantages over other means of studying experiences of reading
(observation, a traditional testing environment, interview), and this study shows how
studying blogs allow for a rich analysis of how different subjects view, understand, and
explain their reading practices and their encouragement of others’  reading. Blogs lend
themselves to such analysis, and allow the researcher to observe bloggers’ stated reasons
for reading, along with their  “role”  in  helping  others  to  read  (dutiful  teacher,  concerned  
parent, enthusiastic reader, etc.). However, the pilot study also led to an expansion of the
categories of types of bloggers to include published authors, illustrators, and editors.
Because blogs are interactive in nature, they allow the bloggers to share resources and to
interact directly with other bloggers and readers. Beyond this, blogs offer unique
perspectives on gender and reading. In most cases, gender is less often a stated focus, but
bloggers invariably raise the question in discussing their experiences, their passions, or
their understanding of the value or meaning of reading.
3.7 Final Study: Procedures
Due to the insights gained by analyzing blog data in the pilot study, together with
the goal of studying an aggregation of blogs representing the perspectives of more groups
than were represented in the limited pilot study, the KidLitosphere organization/website
was explored as a possible starting point for a the study. Following initial skimming and
review of the KidLitosphere blogs, the KidLitosphere was identified as an important site
for the discussion of issues relating to gender and literacy.

142

3.7.1 Sampling and data collection. A theoretical sample of blogs was selected
based  on  the  principal  investigator’s  attendance  at  the  KidLitosphere  conference  in  
September of 2012. The conference was also helpful in terms of confirming that the
KidLitosphere as a community, is composed mainly of women. Head counts conducted
by the principal investigator at two of the panel discussions revealed 41 women and 5
men at the first session, and 40 women and 2 men (including the presenter) at the second
session.
One of the blogs chosen for analysis was the blog of the conference organizer.
Another blog was of a presenter at the conference. Yet another was that of a blogger who
served on a panel at the conference. Many of the other blogs were selected based on a
process of snowball sampling from the blogs of these presenters and panelists (for
example, blogs included in their blog rolls). Others were selected from the membership
lists of the KidLitosphere blogs.
Because there are eight types of bloggers of interest in the study: parents, public
librarians, school librarians, teachers, young people (children and young adults), and
published authors, editors, and published illustrators, data were sampled from two blogs
of each type, one by a male, the other by a female, for a total of sixteen. One more blog
by a father, for a total of two fathers, is included due to the lack of bloggers who are
fathers in the KidLitosphere. Similarly, B8, by a male librarian, is included even though
another blog by a male librarian had already been included, because so few male
librarians are represented in the KidLitosphere. B18, by a well-known male author/
illustrator, is included, even though another one by a KidLitosphere presenter had already
been  included,  based  on  the  presumption  that  the  majority  of  authors  of  children’s  books  

143

are women. B4, by a mother, is included even though a blog by a mother had already
been included, because so many of the posts discuss gender, literacy, and reading. B21 is
also chosen for inclusion based on the relevance of its posts to gendered literacy. Two
other blogs, B22 and B23 (although they are different from the previously decided-upon
types), are also included because they are mentioned as frequently read blogs by other
blogger/panelists at the KidLitosphere conference. Bloggers’  and  commenters’  selfdescriptions of their roles are taken at face value. In the process of analyzing the data, in
determining bloggers and commenters’  roles,  if  they  refer  to  their  own  children  (even  if  
mentioned in another comment within the collected data set), they are counted as parents,
or if they refer to their students, they are counted as teachers (or a school librarian, based
on whether they mentioned the library as the setting for their work). A child’s  perspective  
is counted as  a  child’s  perspective  even  if  it  is  recounted  by  an  adult. The following table
describes the blogs:

It should be noted that initial attempts to locate a blog authored by a boy were
unsuccessful. This included examining blog rolls and following links from linked blogs,
along with posting  to  Facebook  asking  for  leads  from  the  principal  investigator’s  
professional and personal circles. One response was received, but the blog, which is not a
part of the KidLitosphere and is authored by a young adult male, deals exclusively with
comics and television adaptations of comics. Although the focus on comics is relevant
(based  on  the  perception  of  comic  as  a  “boy”-preferred text type), the blog is so unlike
the other blogs sampled in the study that it was not analyzed for this study.
Prior to collecting data, exploratory procedures were tried. Keywords  “boy girl
read”  were  entered in different orders searching two different blogs: B5 and B6. The
order of the keywords did not make much difference in terms of the number of posts
retrieved; for example, the first one, B5, is capped at 10 posts retrieved no matter in what
order  the  terms  are  searched,  and  searches  for  “boy  girl”  or  “girl  boy”  also  retrieve  10  
posts and result in the same posts retrieved, just displayed in a different order. For B6,
searching  “boy  read  girl”  retrieves  32  posts;;  “read  boy  girl”  also  retrieves  32  posts, as

149

does  “boy  read  girl.”  For this blog, then, all the results were included in the sample
because for some of the blogs the results were much fewer.
In addition to their theoretical significance, blogs from which data were sampled
met the following requirements: they had been updated within the past month at the start
date of data collection (January 2, 2013); were easily searchable through the use of a
search engine included within the blog itself; and, yielded meaningful (defined here as
relating to my conceptual model of gendered literacy, presenting new or resistant
dimensions of it, or introducing new concepts of gendered literacy) results when searched
with the keyword search, “boy  girl  read.”  In most cases, this produced a large number of
relevant posts. In two cases when  a  search  of  “boy  girl  read”  yielded  no  results  (B16,
B18), the search terms were truncated  to  “boy”  and  “girl,”  and  two  separate  searches  
were conducted (in  these  two  cases,  using  “read”  as  a  separate  search  term  retrieved  too  
many results to be useful). Keyword searches were thereby used to draw the smaller
sample of blog posts. In one case, B17, there was no search function located within the
blog itself and so data collection consisted of scrolling through the blog page by page and
doing  separate  searches  on  “boy,”  “girl,”  and  “read”    for  each  page.  Data collection
continued through Feb. 8, 2013. Collected posts were gathered from the searches even
they were not immediately obviously relevant.
3.7.2 Data analysis. Blog posts in which the keywords “boy,  girl,  read”  appear,
and of the comments (if any) posted by readers of the blogs were read closely and themes
were identified. Comments posted to the blog were important in order to get a sense of
the  blog’s  audience  and  the  blogger’s  possible  influence  of  this  audience.  In the process
of data analysis, in order to focus analysis on the text in the sample, posted videos or

150

links to outside texts were excluded from the analysis. Blogs were examined using the
Firefox web browser. For each post drawn for the sample, a screen shot image was saved,
and the text and images were copied and pasted into a Microsoft Word document. The
screen shots were examined only when there was a question regarding the copied and
pasted text. The Microsoft Word document was therefore the version of the text used for
coding, as it also allowed for the insertion of Blog #, comments and codes, and rapid
identification of those textual markings later. Ten of the blogs from which data were
sampled (and from which examples were used in the findings sections) included
statements prohibiting direct quotation or  made  similar  “all  rights  reserved”  statements.
Data collected from those blogs, when discussed in the findings sections (Chapters 4-7),
are paraphrased, rather than quoted directly. Although the blogs analyzed for this
dissertation are publicly archived materials and freely open to the public, this seemed a
reasonable  way  to  show  deference  to  authors’  intentions.  
Coding of the data followed procedures outlined by Miles and Huberman (1994).
As they suggest, data analysis began with a start list of codes issuing from the conceptual
model of gendered literacy (developed from the literature review) and research questions
(also issuing from the literature review) (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 58). The principal
investigator first reviewed all the data, blog by blog, and highlighted important text. The
provisional list of concepts relating to gendered literacy developed from the literature
review, detailed below, were the starting point for coding:
Gendered literacy as enacted, or performed, by multiple actors:
* Children/young adults:

151

a)  through  boys’  dislike of formal, school-based literacy in comparison to
girls’  more  enthusiastic adoption of formal literacy practice in terms of
reading, writing, and classroom comportment and,
b)  through  girls’  and  boys’  displaying  differing  literacy  preferences in
terms of reading and writing.
* Literacy educators, including parents, public librarians, school librarians, and
teachers:
a)  through  parents’  perceptions  of  their  daughters’  and  sons’  literacy  
preferences and mothers’  and  fathers’  differing  support  of children’s  
reading behaviors
b)  through  teachers’  perceptions  and  expectations  of  male and female
students’  literacy  preferences and performance
c)  through  librarians’  expectations  of  children’s    (particularly  boys’)  
literacy preferences and programmatic responses
* Creators of reading materials for children – the  children’s  publishing  industry
This framework describing gendered literacy as enacted by multiple actors
(children and young adults; educators including librarians, parents, and teachers; and,
creators of texts for children) therefore influenced the approach to the data. However,
while analyzing the data, new concepts were also identified. Moreover, some of the
concepts of gendered literacy initially flagged as important in the literature review were
not salient in or were completely absent from the sampled data (for example, gendered
literacy as a quantifiable achievement gap). Findings were compared among the different
types of bloggers. Three thorough readings of the data set and six interactions with the

152

data in terms of organizing and revising the codes were accomplished to ensure
intracoder reliability.
In the analysis process, comments posted to a blog are treated as separate from the
main blog post, but if the comments follow the same theme as the main post, that was
reflected in how they were coded. Often a conversational thread originating in the blog
post is subsequently taken up by the commenters and so the original post and comments
are categorized under the same code. When the initial coding was finished, a master list
of the initial codes identified was developed, and codes for which only one or two texts
had been identified were noted.
List of Codes:
1. Authors’  labeling  of  books  as  “boy  books”  and  “girl  books”
2. Authors’  perceptions  of  boys’  literacy  preferences (matching traditional notions)
– only 1 text
3. Biological phenomenon, the result of essential, cognitive differences between

This list was then treated to two thematic semi-structuring processes. First, codes that
were thematically similar were grouped together and most of the codes for which there
were only one or two example texts were set aside. If there were only one or two example
texts but it was suspected that more examples would be found in a third reading of the
data, the code was kept at that point. Another loosely-organized thematic list of codes
was then developed:

160

1. Gendered literacy as a complicated and debated issue
Gendered literacy as a troubling issue
Parents’  perceptions  that  books  and  reading are unwelcoming to boys:
a) Parents' perceptions that there are not enough "boy books" available
b) Parents' perceptions that there are not enough "boy" chapter books (but
plenty of picture books and YA books)
c) Parents' perceptions that there are plenty of "girl books" available
Resistance:
a) Resistance, children's perception that gender should not be an important
factor in terms of reading preferences
b) Feminist perspective on gendered literacy – only 1 text
c) Resistance, literacy educators' perceptions that gender should not be an
important factor in terms of reading
d) Resistance, parents' perceptions that gender should not be an important
factor in terms of reading
2. Educators’ perceptions  of  boys’  literacy  preferences matching the following
traditional categories: non-fiction, comics, graphic novels, sports books,
adventure, fantasy, science fiction, gross humor, magazines, stories with male

In constructing the above list and in preparation for a third reading of the data, a
more balanced approach in terms of gender was taken, which resulted in the adding of
categories (some of which were later removed due to there not being a significant number
of  examples).  For  example,  the  category  “fatherhood  and  authorship” was added because
there was a “motherhood  and  authorship”  and  in  the  second  reading  of  the  data,  there  had  
been  examples  of  “fatherhood  and  authorship”  that  had  been ignored at that point.
Another  example  was:  “references  to  men  in  the  publishing  industry,”  added  to  account  
for  the  fact  that  “references  to  women in the publishing industry”  had already been
identified. Ultimately, “references  to  men  in  the  publishing  industry”  was set aside
because five or fewer examples had been identified.  Two  other  examples  were:  “Male  

166

authors  commenting  on  writing  the  voice  of  a  female  protagonist,”  added  to  balance  the  
category  of  “Female  authors  commenting  on  writing  the  voice  of  a  male  protagonist;;”  
and  “Girls’  iconic  gendered  books,”  added  to  balance  the  category  of  “boys’ iconic
gendered  books.”  Both  “male authors commenting on writing the voice of a female
protagonist”  and  “girls’  iconic  gendered  books”  were later eliminated due to having five
or fewer examples in the data. However, these categories were added at the point of the
last reading of the data toward the goal of being conceptually thorough.
After a third reading of the data, the codes were reevaluated. At this point, codes
for which five or fewer examples (not including the interview transcript data) were
identified were set aside. Finding there were still too many codes to work with reasonably,
codes for which there were nine or fewer examples (not including the interview transcript
data) were then set aside. This left 40 codes, and further revision and refining resulted in
the following list of 35 codes (with headings):

the findings.
3.7.3 Interviews. In order to triangulate blog post data and the conclusions made
from the analysis of the blog posts, data analyzed for the study also include transcripts of
interviews with a select sample of three people, who were theoretically sampled based on
their roles and expertise. Interviewees include: B4 blogger, a mother whose blog provides
reader’s  advisory; B7 blogger, a public librarian who is the Youth Materials Specialist of
a  major  public  library,  a  reviewer  of  children’s  books  for  prominent  publications,  and
was the 2012 KidLitosphere conference organizer; and, a male author of non-fiction for
children and young adults, who also teaches classes for Library and Information Science

170

Masters  students  and  who  is  a  recognized  opinion  leader  in  terms  of  boys’  reading and
also vocal in the debate surrounding Common Core.
Interviews were conducted by the principal investigator via Skype (Skype was
used to dial a landline), and two were recorded and later transcribed. One interviewee did
not wish for the interview to be recorded. The interviews were conversational and loosely
structured, guided only by the following questions asked of the interviewee: “Do  you  
think gender and literacy/reading are related? Why? How?”  Throughout the interviews,
questions asked were for clarification or to ask the interviewee to expand further their
thoughts on a topic raised either during the interview or on their blog. For example, in the
interview with B7 blogger, a female public librarian, after being asked to elaborate on her
mentioning on her blog the lack of sports fiction for girls, she stated:
It's becoming slightly more common, but I am still waiting for the girls on a
soccer  team  series….We have girl horseback riders, we have gymnastic clubs,
we've got babysitters' club, where is the sports team series of girls? Where's the
softball game? … Where's the soccer team series? (Interview 2 transcript, 2013).
Notes were kept during all the interviews. Because the main data analyzed in the study
are from blogs, it was not possible to do member checking in the same way that would be
possible in a qualitative study in which the researcher interacts directly with participants
and informants. Therefore, validity is also ensured through surrogate member checking
by conducting interviews with two of the bloggers, along with a participant outside the
KidLitosphere.
Because the interviews were conducted following coding of the data sampled from
blogs, the interview data were treated to the coding structure developed from the blog

171

data, described above. However, new themes were also identified in the interview data.
As with the the blog data, they were analyzed using the constant comparative method.
3.8 Limitations
This study analyzes blog narratives focusing on commentary about literature for
young people as a sociocultural site in which concepts of gendered literacy are performed
with regularity. Blogs are only one of many possible such sociocultural sites that could be
examined, and so a focus on blogs is a major limitation of the study. Although interviews
with select bloggers provide a triangulated data source, blog narratives, as the main data
source, also represent a less direct sociocultural view of gendered literacy in that the
bloggers’  commentary  more  often  reflects  on  and  reviews  literature  for  young  people  
rather than directly commenting on literacy as gendered. However, analysis of blog
narratives also presents an unobtrusive way in which to observe both explicit and implicit
reflection on gendered literacy.
Blog narratives sampled from the KidLitosphere website represent the major
“voices”  and  perspectives  in  terms  of  literature  for  young  people,  as  the  blogs  are  written  
by people across the U.S. and feature commentary on English-language literature
published in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. That said, bloggers are self-selected
commentators, who write from a variety of motives, and online access, along with the
ability to blog, influences the demographics of the bloggers represented in the
KidLitosphere. Representation is also skewed by factors inherent to blogging practice,
such as the platform chosen (the data sampled are from publicly-available blogs and can
be accessed by anyone online) and the desire (or not) for developing social networks.
Additionally, the blogs, which are theoretically-sampled, rather than randomly sampled,

172

represent only a small slice of the KidLitosphere, which consists of over 550 blogs. The
blog posts and associated comments comprising the data set also represent only a small
slice of the blogs from which data were sampled. Therefore,  the  study’s  findings,  
although not generalizable, may be transferable to other settings.
Likewise, determining the actual influence these blogs have in the wider world is
difficult, and many of these bloggers see themselves as part of a KidLit community of
people  with  a  passion  for  children’s  literature  that  is  separate  from  the  wider  world.  
However, the KidLit bloggers are also aware of beliefs about gender and literacy that
exist in the wider world and at times, respond to and resist these views. In that sense, the
study contributes theoretically to a model of gendered literacy by articulating both
traditional and resistant patterns in relation to beliefs about the connections between
gender and literacy.

In summary, the salient characteristics of gendered literacy according to the data sampled
for this study include literacy  educators’  labeling  of  books  for  young  people  according  to
“girl”- and  “boy”-preferred, literacy  educators’  perceptions  of  boys  and  girls having
differing reading preferences, and a perception of boys as reluctant and less advanced
readers,  along  with  descriptions  of  young  people’s  expressions  of  gendered  reading  
preferences. However, other characteristics  include  young  people’s  descriptions  of  
resistant reading preferences – that is, not conforming to what would be considered
gender-normative preference; descriptions of books, series, and genres that are reported
to appeal to both boys and girls; and approximately equal numbers of examples referring
to boys’  and girls’ love of reading and/or advanced reading level.
The table displayed below gives examples of how blog data were coded according
to the sub-claims and counter claims based on the data.

ones for his sister, and he practitcally (sic) starts
twitching with anticipation of getting his hands
on  them.”  (parent, F)
Note: Some examples were coded in multiple
ways. This example would also have been
coded as Boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  
advanced reading level, and Children’s  
expressions of resistant – that is, not
conforming to what would be considered
gender-normative preferences.
B3  (2011):  “I realy (sic) like the book Dork
Diaries. It is a lot like Diary of a Wimpy Kid. It is
about a girl that goes to a new school, a new
bully and a new crush. She only has two friends.
It is very funny. She is a very good artist. She is
not at all popular I think a lot of people will like
it. I liked it because it was very funny.”  (child,  F)

for boys?…there  are  some  great  series  out  there.  
On one extreme, easy to read and extremely
funny are the Captain Underpants books.”  
(author, F, in response to question by male
librarian)
B4 (2010):  “I too have a daughter that didn't like
the girly books. And she also didn't want to read
a lot of the early reader books.”  (parent, F)
B12 (2011): “I love the review, and the pictures
are wonderful! So did your 8 year old really
enjoy and understand the book? I considered
getting it and reading it to my 7 year old (2nd
grade) but worried it might be too much for
him.” (commenter/parent, F)
B4  (2010):  “Also popular among my more
reluctant boy readers: Secrets of Droon series,

story  about  bravery,  loyalty,  and  friendship.”
(teacher, F)
B3  (2009):  “You all constantly surprise and
please me with your ability to read good stuff and
show what people say about boy readers isn't
always true. For instance, some say that guys
don't read. Period. Or that guys stop reading after
4th grade. Well, all the reviews you've sent show
differently.”  (librarian,  M)
B22 (2012): “But  I  don't  think  that  it's  this  
familiarity and affection that makes me
appreciate this book so strongly. I don't even
think it's because I was a teenager in Baltimore
too. (Although I will hand this book especially to
any girl who is or has ever been a teenager here the landmarks do make us smile.)”  (librarian,  F)
B5 (2009): “I  don’t  think  that  very  young  
children  can  tell  the  difference  between  a  “boys”  
book  and  a  “girls”  book  unless  the  concept  is  
presented to them by someone else. I think that if
they go in thinking that the book is for everyone,
then they have a better chance of liking the
book.”  (commenter)
B4 (2010):  “It's a very multicultural, openminded, gay-accepting book, working earnestly

B13 (2009):  “So if you're not a Goth girl, don't
go browsing about the bookstore looking at the
cover  and  thinking  ‘this book is simply not
intended for me where is the zombie section
anyway?’  Because you'll be missing out. First of
all the Goth girl, Sophie Blue, is pretty cool.
Funny, resourceful, a talented artist, wears
fishnets and combat boots to gym class, tough,
bitter and sarcastic but in a charming way. She's
really not bad for a guy to hang out with for a
good chunk of the story.”  (parent,  M)
B4  (2010):  “I've never been much of a nonfiction reader, so those aren't the books I kept
from my childhood, they aren't the ones I pick up
for birthdays, they aren't the books I gravitate
toward at the library. Am I denying them a "boy"
genre because I am such a girl?”  (parent,  F)

(Claim 4, Counter claim A)
Educators (parents, librarians, and teachers) disparage
“boy”  books (including non-fiction, comics, graphic
novels, and gross humor) as less literary than other
reading materials. (Claim 1, Sub-claim 6)
Parents perceive that there are not enough "boy books"
available. (Claim 2, Sub-claim 5)

Thirteen  references  are  to  women  in  the  children’s  
publishing industry, versus five to men. (Claim 4, Subclaim 1)
Educators do not expect girls to prefer what are
commonly  perceived  to  be  “girl”-preferred texts, or
boys  to  prefer  “boy”-preferred texts. (Claim 1, Subclaim 4, Counter claim C)
Educators perceive that gendered literacy is a
biological phenomenon, the result of essential,
cognitive differences between males and females.
(Claim 2, Sub-claim 6)

Educators  disparage  “girl”  books  (including  romance,  
chicklit, pink books, and princess-themed) for their
lack of depth, saccharine cuteness, and promotion of
feminine stereotypes. (Claim 1, Sub-claim 7)

reading lots of comics and adventure stories
when  he  was  a  boy.  That’s  not  a  bad  thing  at  all.  
But one day his seventh grade teacher told him
that he was reading widely, and it was time he
began to read deeply.”  (author,  F)
B4  (2010):  “I find that early chapter books is the
one place that's lacking, for boys specifically there are options, but not a lot, especially not
among recently published books.”  
(commenter/parent, F)
B3 (2012):  “My  editor  asked  me  to  write  a  “boy  
book”  like  my  Ruby  Lu  books.  “Just  make  him

B3  (2009):  “Another big myth is that guys won't
read books with girls as main characters. I know
for a fact that's not true because some of you
have written reviews and said that you liked the
book even though the main character was a girl.”  
(librarian, M)
B4  (2012):  “I've got a daughter and two sons, and
the Max and Ruby books -- some of our favorites
-- are completely accurate. I find the whole
debate of nature/nurture tedious, in the end. I
have one mild son and one nutball -- but
together, they're two boys in every stereotypical
way.”  (commenter/parent,  F)
B8 (2010):  “Why are grownups so obsessed with
romance and kissing and all that mushy stuff?
In a nutshell, I have no idea. Personally, I fastforward through love scenes, never write them,
and have my heart set on buying lots of cats
instead of getting married.”  (librarian, M,
interviewing a boy)
B3  (2009):  “Your two main characters are
thirteen and eleven-year-old boys. Was it hard to
get into minds of boys and write about them?

CHAPTER 4 PERCEPTIONS OF THE GENDERED READING PREFERENCES
OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS
4.1 Claim 1: Perceptions of Gendered Reading Preferences
This category includes more examples than any other category from the data (226
incidences – this includes the sub-claims and does not include counter claims). The
overall claim to be made in this section, based on the data, is that gendered reading
preferences, particularly in terms of educators’  perceptions  of  boys’  reading  preferences
and labeling  of  “boy” and  “girl”  books,  are prominent. This larger category is supported
by seven sub-claims. Related counter claims, also based on the data analysis and coding
of resistant themes, are listed beside the sub-claims they refute:

4. Educators expect boys to prefer male protagonists and girls to prefer
female protagonists. They also assume that girls are more likely than
boys to read a story featuring a protagonist of the opposite sex. (parents
– 16, librarians – 4, teachers – 2)
Counter Claim B (addressing Sub-Claims 1-4 above): Bloggers and
commenters express the belief that  a  child’s  sex  should  not  influence  
the child’s reading preferences. (parents – 7, children/young adults –
5, adults of undetermined role – 2, illustrator – 1)
Counter Claim C (addressing Sub-Claims 1-4 above): Educators do
not expect girls  to  prefer  what  are  perceived  to  be  “girl”-preferred
texts,  or  boys  to  prefer  “boy”-preferred texts. (parents – 8, librarians
– 3, teachers – 2)
5. Parents perceive that their childhood identity as a girl, or experience
with children of only one sex, determines their qualifications to judge
the reading preferences of children of the opposite sex.
6. Educators disparage “boy”  books (including non-fiction, comics, graphic
novels, and gross humor) as of less value than other reading materials.
(librarians – 5, teachers – 4, parents – 3, adults of undetermined role – 2)
7. Bloggers  and  commenters  disparage  “girl”  books  (including  romance,  
chick lit, pink books, and princess-themed) for their lack of depth,
saccharine cuteness, and promotion of feminine stereotypes. (librarians –

The theme of perceptions of gendered reading preferences also included
“educators’  perceptions  of  girls’  reading preferences according to the following: realistic
fiction, princess- themed fiction, stories with female protagonists, books with pink covers,
and non-fiction as narrative.”  However, since only eight examples were identified among
the data sampled, these examples are not discussed in depth here.
4.2 Discussion of Claim 1, Sub-Claims and Counter Claims
4.2.1 Sub-Claim 1: Bloggers’ and  commenters’ labeling  of  books  as  “girl”and  “boy”- preferred. Bloggers and commenters (librarians – 29, parents – 23, teachers
– 12, authors – 5, children – 3) label books as  “girl”- and  “boy”-preferred (72 incidences).
Twenty-nine references to  books  as  “boy”  and  “girl”  books  represent the perspectives of
librarians, 23, those of parents, and 12, those of teachers. There are also 5 examples

180

representing authors and 3, children. A comment by a female public librarian, who does
not have a Master’s  degree in Library or Information Science but is counted among the
librarians in terms of her role and experience, referring to a  “boy”  book,  reads:
On the funny side, I've brought book one in the series Nathan Abercrombie,
Accidental Zombie, by David Lubar….David  Lubar  is  the  guy  who  wrote  the Weenies
books, which, if you were a 9-year-old boy, might be all you needed to hear. (B22, 2010)
In this example, the librarian labels the ideal, typical audience for a book and a book
series by the same author as  “a  9-year-old  boy.”  The direct labeling used here as a
presumed  aid  to  reader’s  advisory  is  found  in  several  other  examples. One example by B6
blogger, a male teacher, directly invites girls to read a book he has just reviewed (B6,
2010). As  in  the  previous  example,  the  label  is  offered  in  the  context  of  reader’s  advisory.  
The teacher labels the book for girls and  also  directly  addresses  “girls”  as  the  book’s  
perceived ideal audience.
Of the 29 examples for this sub-claim representing the perspectives of librarians,
18  refer  to  “boy”  books,  7  refer  to  “girl”  books,  and  4  refer  to  both.  Of  the  23  examples  
representing parents’  perspectives, 5  refer  to  “boy”  books,  7  refer  to  “girl”  books,  and  11
refer  to  both  “boy”  and  “girl”  books. Of the 12 examples representing teachers’  
perspectives, 2  refer  to  “boy”  books,  9  refer  to  “girl”  books,  and  1  to  both. Of the 5
examples representing authors’  perspectives,  4  refer  to  “boy”  books,  and  1  refers  to  “girl”  
books. Of the 3 examples representing children’s  perspectives,  2  refer  to  “boy”  books,  
and  1  refers  to  “girl”  books.  Overall, 31 examples  refer  to  “boy”  books,  25 to  “girl”  
books, and 16 to both “girl”  and  “boy”  books.  
In the following example a mother, who is also a homeschooler and was

181

previously a classroom teacher, comments on a request for reading suggestions for a girl,
and, in doing so, refers to both  “boy”  and  “girl”  books:
She might try Cynthia Rylant's Cobble Street Cousins. Girly, but with different
types of girls. Also, since she's into books that are traditionally "boy" books, my
son went from Fly Guy right into Dav Pilkey's Ricky Ricotta series and those were
the books that really catapulted him into reading independently this year. Another
traditionally "boy" series she might enjoy is Nate the Great and that's not such a
big leap from Fly Guy. (B4, 2010)
Although the mother,  engaging  in  reader’s  advisory as in the previous examples,
recommends  “boy”  books  for  a  girl,  she still makes a strict  demarcation  between  “girl”  
and  “boy”  books,  labeling them  “girly”  and  “traditionally  ‘boy.’”  In  this  sense,  genderlabeling  of  young  people’s  reading  materials  is  juxtaposed  with  more  flexible  ideas  
surrounding what young people should read.
Another mother refers  to  “in  between”  books  that  should  appeal  to  both  boys  and  
girls,  but  while  claiming  to  be  an  “idealist,”  still  notes  a  distinct  separation  between  “boy”  
and  “girl”  books,  stating:  “I feel like there are very girly books and very boyish books
and then there is everything in between and that should all be fair game. *sigh* I guess I
am an idealist” (B4, 2010). In  this  sentence  it  is  unclear  if  the  mother  is  stating  that  “all”  
the  books  should  be  “fair  game,”  meaning  they  can  be  read  by  both boys and girls, or if
only  the  “in  between”  books  should  be  “fair  game.”  In either case, although she pictures
herself  as  an  “idealist,”  gender-labeling  of  young  people’s  reading  materials, as in the
previous example, remains part of her worldview.
4.2.2 Counter Claim A: Resistance to the labeling of books as “girl”- and
“boy”- preferred. Despite  the  gendered  expectations  of  educators  toward  children’s  
reading preferences demonstrated in the sample, 21 examples of resistance are also found.
Bloggers and commenters (parents – 10, adults of undetermined role – 6, teachers – 2,

182

librarian – 1, child – 1, author – 1) resist the labeling of  books  as  “girl”- and “boy”preferred (21). In the study overall, resistance takes the form of either not following, or
actively opposing gendered  expectations  in  regard  to  young  people’s  literacy.  In  this  case,  
the greatest number of examples of resistance to the labeling of books as “girl”- and
“boy”- preferred represent the perspectives of parents (10) and focus on not producing
gender-based reading lists for boys and girls, not expecting boys not to want to read
books with female protagonists, encouraging children to read whatever they find
interesting, and commenting in relation to experiences of reading with children and
seeing that their reading preferences do not follow rigid gender demarcations.
Comments by other adults,  designated  “miscellaneous” (6) because their roles
cannot be determined from the information available, follow the same patterns as those
made by parents, but also include 2 very specific comments – one, a reaction to a talk
given by Jon Scieszka at the American Library Association conference, and the other, a
comment regarding the rigid preservation of social norms relating to masculinity.
The  reaction  to  Jon  Scieszka’s  speech  is  in  the  form  of  a  letter,  written  by  an  adult  
female,  responding  to  Scieszka’s  talk  and  to  the  concept  behind  his  “Guys  Read”  
movement, stating that the gender roles Scieszka described do not depict all boys (for
example,  not  all  boys  are  hockey  fans),  and  if  books  are  marked  or  categorized  as  “guy”  
books, girls will be less willing to read them, and some boys will still not be interested in
them (B21, 2012). This letter represents active resistance to Scieszka’s labeling of books
as  “boy”  – preferred, and it also connects gender norms in relation to other activities, here
invoking  hockey  as  an  example  of  a  “boy”  – preferred sport, to gender-labeling of books.
The other comment, focusing on the rigidity of social norms surrounding

183

masculinity, presents the gender-labeling beginning with insistence on genderappropriate clothing for baby boys morphing into the gender-labeling of children’s  books:
It just seems that, around what we currently teach very small children, the rules
bend easier for girls than boys. Baby girls might be dressed in blue overalls, but a
baby boy won't be put in pink ones. A 3 year old girl dressing up as a construction
worker would get a smile, while a 3 year old boy dressing up as a princess would
be told "oh, don't let your dad see that, ha, ha, ha." And on and on and on. Until
we end up talking about "girl" books and "boy" books as though the books had
genders themselves. (B4, 2010)
In  this  excerpt  the  adult  female  commenter’s  perception  that  the  taboo  against  boys’
violation of social norms associated with masculinity is stronger than that of girls
violating the rules of femininity is also evident. Although this commenter draws a
connection between gendered clothing, beginning in infancy, and gendered reading, she
discusses the stronger taboo against the violation of social norms associated with
masculinity only in relation to gendered clothing. However, subsequently, the theme of a
social taboo against boys reading feminine books will be taken up in Section 4.2.6
discussing the expression of the belief that a  child’s  sex should not influence the  child’s
reading preferences.
Like  the  commenter’s letter  to  Jon  Scieszka  described  above,  a  female  librarian’s  
comment to a parent in the library represents active resistance against the labeling of
books  as  “girl”  and  “boy”  books. She describes how upon overhearing a father in the
library reprimanding his preschooler son  for  choosing  “girl”  books  from  the  shelves,  she  
approached him and, upon seeing that the boy had chosen Olivia (Ian Falconer) assured
the father that Olivia is  everyone’s  favorite.  She  also  expresses  dismay  that  the  father  was  
so upset at the choices of such a young child (B7, 2012). This librarian thereby
challenges  the  father’s  notion  that  the  well-known Olivia book is for girls, resisting his

184

gender-labeling of the books his son is choosing in the library.
Two comments coded according to resistance to the labeling  of  books  as  “girl”  
and  “boy”  books are by teachers. One notes that in her 28 years of teaching and her
experiences reading with her own children and grandchildren, gender-labeling of books is
meaningless and unnecessary. Moreover, she recognizes the taboo against boys reading
books that might be considered feminine, expressing her distaste for boy-centered reading
lists,  which  she  feels  contribute  to  boys’  feeling  shame over enjoying reading books that
would be considered appropriate for girls. She adds that in her experience of reading
aloud with children, the books they chose as their favorites were the ones with the most
interesting stories, unrelated to whether the protagonist was male or female (B21, 2012).
The  teacher  here  comments  on  the  concept  of  “boy”  books,  legitimized  through  lists  of
recommended reading for boys, lists which she perceives as causing boys to feel that they
are not allowed to read books that would be considered more appropriate for girl readers.
The teacher also stresses the importance of story quality as an indicator of whether
children will enjoy the story over whether the protagonist is male or female.
The one comment by an author (Lenore Look) relating to resistance against the
labeling  of  books  as  “girl”  and  “boy”  books highlights  an  editor’s  request that she write a
“boy”  book:    “My  editor  asked  me  to  write  a  “boy  book”  like  my  Ruby  Lu  books.  “Just  
make him like Ruby,  except  a  boy,” she  said.  But  I  didn’t  want  to  do  that.  How  can  you  
make  a  boy  like  a  girl?  You  can’t”  (B3,  2012). Here, Look highlights the role of the
publishing industry in gender-ing books through requests made of authors. Although she
later  states,  “BTW,  Alvin  isn’t a  ‘boy  book’  any  more  than  Ruby  Lu  is  a  ‘girl  book.’ If
guys limit themselves to reading only about guys …,  they’ll  miss  out  on  some  really  

185

fantastic  books,  including  Ruby  Lu” (B3, 2012), she nevertheless upholds the notion of
inherent differences between girls  and  boys  in  describing  the  impossibility  of  making  “a  
boy  like  a  girl”  (B3).  
The one comment by a child, a tween girl (B1 blogger), coded according to
resistance to the gender-labeling of books, equates her resistance with feminism:
Gary Paulsen has a reputation of being an author for boys. In fact, my brother is a
big fan of Lawn Boy (even though he really doesn't like to read). But, I do not
like being told what is a boy book and what is a girl book, I am a feminist, as you
probably guessed already. (B1, 2011)
Blogger  B1  specifically  resists  the  notion  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books,  relating  it  to  her  
stance  as  “a  feminist.”  She  also  notes  that  her  brother,  whom  she  paradoxically  
characterizes as a reluctant reader, enjoys reading books by Gary Paulsen, whose books
are generally perceived as being more appropriate for boys than for girls.
In summary, 72 examples of educators’  labeling  of  books  as  “girl”- and  “boy”preferred are evident among the data, and most of these are by librarians (29) and parents
(23). Moreover, in two cases in which mothers claim to be more balanced in their views,
they still rely on rigid  differentiation  between  “boy”  books  and  “girl”  books  in
recommendations for reading. However, 21 examples of resistance to gender labeling are
also found, and they range from suggestions, such as not producing gender-labeled
reading lists or encouraging children to read what interests them, to more active
opposition, as in the  librarian’s  directly  challenging  a  father’s  insistence  that  his  threeyear-old son  not  choose  “girl”  books  in  the  library.  Other themes from this section
include the  following:  a  social  taboo  against  boys’  violating  masculine norms that is
perceived to be stronger than for girls’  violating  feminine  norms;;  and the perception that
masculine social norms are enforced from the time of infancy (as in, gendered clothing).

186

4.2.3 Sub-Claim 2: Educators’  expectations  of  boys’  reading  preferences.
Educators (librarians – 39, parents – 11, teachers – 3) align boys’  reading preferences
with the following: stories with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science fiction,
adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring vehicles, and
magazines (53). Of the examples for this code, most are reading suggestions and reviews
of books matching what are perceived to be “boy”  preferred  categories.  The research
literature (i.e., Davies & Brember, 1993; Millard, 1994; McKechnie , 2006; Moss, 2007)
on  children’s  reading  preferences documents, to some extent, the notion that these
categories tend to be boy-preferred. However, the literature (Chapman et al. 2007) also
suggests  that  children’s  self-described preferences may differ from that which children
perceive to be gender-appropriate. In this sense, the relationship between individual
reading  preference  and  social  perceptions  of  children’s  reading  preferences remains
unclear. Moreover, the work of Dutro (2003) with African-American male students
shows that children can be encouraged, within certain contexts, to step outside gendered
reading boundaries.
Librarians account for 39 of the examples describing  boys’  reading  preferences
according  to  themes  perceived  to  be  “boy”-preferred, followed by parents (11), and
teachers (3). Of the 39 examples representing the perspectives of librarians, 23 are from
B3, a blog written primarily with an audience of boys in mind, and the bloggers are two
male public librarians working in youth services. A typical example from B3, a review of
a graphic novel, reads: “If you like high action, plot twist, great artwork, space adventure,
green slime and a mouse with a mission, this is definitely the Graphic Novel for you!!!!!
Great stuff!!!!!!!”  (B3,  2010).  At  times,  B3  blogger  directly addresses boy readers, as in:

187

“one of your fellow reader guys, Jedi-J.T, wrote a review of the first
Barnstormers/Sluggers book”  (B3,  2009). Moreover, the reviews are of books the
librarians  presume  would  be  “boy”-preferred. Overall, in terms of the alignment  of  boys’  
reading preferences with  texts  that  are  traditionally  perceived  as  “boy”  texts,  the  
perspectives of librarians are best represented among the data sampled.
4.2.4 Sub-Claim 3: Iconic boy books. Bloggers and commenters consistently
mention certain books and/or series,  coded  “iconic boy books,”  in  reference  to  boys’  
reading (43, including 3 examples mentioning more than 1 of the series). Some books are
mentioned only in connection with girl readers, but since there are five or fewer examples
(books mentioned include Frances  Hodgson  Burnett’s  The Secret Garden, Laura Ingalls
Wilder’s  Little House on the Prairie, and Stephenie  Meyer’s  Twilight), they are not
discussed in depth. Books identified as “iconic boy books” are those that are frequently
mentioned and almost always mentioned in relation to boy readers. They include the
following:  Dav  Pilkey’s  Captain Underpants series  (19  examples),  Jeff  Kinney’s  Diary
of a Wimpy Kid series (10), Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series (9),  and  Gary  Paulsen’s  
Hatchet – 4.
A male school librarian states outright that from what he has seen, most readers of
Captain Underpants are boys (B10, 2012). A comment from an interview with a female
public librarian (youth collection specialist for a major Northeastern public library)
supports this, as she states:
I have boys who like Junie B Jones, I have boys who like Franny K. Stein, um,
that's one of the rarer characters that a boy will check out all the books of. But,
you know, and then I have girls that read Captain Underpants, but not to the same
extent. (Interview 1 transcript, 2013)
This excerpt pinpoints Captain Underpants as a series attracting very few female readers,

188

in contrast to two “girl”  series which have a male readership.
The following comment about the Captain Underpants series – “My son
absolutely loves Captain Underpants books, and they are the first series of books that he
has wanted to read  completely  independently”  (B4, 2010) – is typical of other comments
about the series, in which it is described as a gateway to solo reading for boys.
Other examples from the data in which the Captain Underpants series is
mentioned also describe the series as a gateway text for young boys, particularly for those
who are reluctant readers. However, unlike the example just mentioned, other examples
of Captain Underpants disparage it as potty humor unworthy of adult attention and a
popular text that should only be used as a catalyst to encourage reluctant reader boys to
read better, more serious literature. For example, in the course of criticizing a teacher for
discouraging a young boy from reading Captain Underpants, a mother states:
I think Captain Underpants is dreadful with it's [sic] lowest common denominator
kind of potty humor, but I would recommend it to a reluctant reader who likes that
kind of book. The graphics, the actual kinesthetic appeal to the book, all make it
worthy of being read. If a child is reading, I saw [sic] it's a good thing. Lay off the
judging. (B4, 2010)
Although the mother, in this statement, is critical of the teacher, she is also critical of the
Captain Underpants series,  calling  it  “dreadful,”  and  describing  the  humor  as  appealing
to  the  “lowest  common  denominator.”
Like the Captain Underpants series,  Jeff  Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid series
stands out as an iconic text – it is frequently mentioned in the data sampled as a boy
favorite. A typical comment by a boy, whose review of the book is posted to blog B3
(maintained by male librarians, working in youth services in a public library), reads:
Jeff Kinney really writes funny stuff! (My Nannah doesn't get some of it, but that
is okay, because she is a girl.) Greg Heffley is the boy writing the diary about his

189

day to day life. He writes about his family and friends and stuff that happens to
him in school. It has lots of funny cartoons in it too. Two of my favorites were
about a guy riding a skateboard and the second is about the things you can get
away with saying when there is a substitute teacher. I can hardly wait to read the
next book about Greg and his brother Rodrick. (B3, 2008)
Notable  in  this  review  of  the  first  book  in  the  series  is  the  boy’s  comments  that  his  
“Nannah”  (presumably  his  grandmother)  does  not  understand  it  “but  that  is  okay,  because  
she  is  a  girl,”  (B3, 2008), thereby presenting the book as a for-boys-only text. The boy
reader’s  focus  on  the  male  protagonist  (Greg) and the cartoons reiterate assumptions
about boy-preferred themes.
Boy readers and parents give positive reviews of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. However,
a female librarian/mother, B22 blogger, is critical of the series, particularly because of the
lack of moral character demonstrated by the protagonist – a middle school boy. The one
concession she makes, and at the same time comparing the series to Captain Underpants,
is that the series can serve as a catalyst for the reading of reluctant boy readers, who
would otherwise choose not to read:
When I initially reviewed this book, my main reaction was: Ick [emphasis in
original]. As the mother of boys, I imagined my own children exhibiting the
unremitting lack of consideration that mars Greg's every action, and it broke my
heart to think of a child so devoid of empathy. Doesn't mean I haven't
recommended the book. There are some middle grade boys - boys who think
fantasy is a ridiculous waste of time, boys who read Calvin & Hobbes and maybe
Captain Underpants - and when I see those guys, I press Diary of a Wimpy Kid
into their hands.
This mother/librarian finds Diary of a Wimpy Kid so questionable that she would
recommend it only as an option for boys who might otherwise read only comics or
Captain Underpants. In this paragraph, the mother/librarian disparages two “iconic  boy  
books,” Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Captain Underpants and, in scorning Calvin and
Hobbes, also does not count comics as a valid reading choice for boys.

190

As with the Captain Underpants series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, even when
presented in a favorable way, is still linked to reluctant boy readers. For example, a
mother writes:
Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Definitely! These are the perfect book for such a kid. Just
enough text to keep it book-like, but also enough art to keep it visual. Hilariously
funny - my husband read them as well, chortling to himself the whole time. Also
is a bit naughty and has cool-factor for reading at school. All this and a movie tiein too...what more could a reluctant reader want? :)
My son has also lately been enjoying Zac Power books. I haven't looked at them
too closely, but they seem to be more on the action side than the funny side. (B4,
2012)
Referring both to her husband and son’s  reading of the  series,  the  mother’s  comments  
support the notion of the series as an “iconic  boy book.” In  noting  that  the  series  is  “cool”  
enough  for  “reading  at  school,”  and  there  is  “a  movie  tie-in,”  she  adds  to  the  perception  
that even boys who would not otherwise want to read (or would be embarrassed to be
caught reading books) will read the series.
Examples mentioning the Percy Jackson series are primarily written by boys (5),
although there are also 3 examples by librarians, and 1 by a parent. The comments
written by boys are reviews of books in the series posted on B3, a blog with an intended
audience of boy readers and hosted by male public youth services librarians. A typical
example reads:
One of my favorite books that I read was the Percy Jackson series. Percy is a
teenage boy who is a Greek demigod. He goes to a camp called Camp Half-Blood
and trains there for fighting because Percy goes on multiple quests. He meets two
friends at Camp Half- Blood; Grover and Annabeth. The three friends go on
quests everywhere….I liked this series because ther [sic] is action on every page.
Plus  I  never  stopped  reading  Riordan’s  books [sic]. Rick Riordan is my favorite
author. (B3, 2012)
In  this  review,  the  boy,  noting  that  one  of  the  books  in  the  series  is  a  “favorite,”  focuses  
on  the  constant  “action”  in  the  plot  as  his  main  reason  for  liking  the  series.  He  also  states  

191

that  Rick  Riordan,  the  author  of  the  series,  is  his  “favorite  author.”
A review by a male public youth services librarian (posted to B3) of another book
(Grace  Lin’s  Where the Mountain Meets the Moon) with a female protagonist references
the Percy Jackson series as an incentive to encourage boys to read the series, stating:
Does Minli ever get to change her family's fortune? You'll just have to read to
find out!! But I will tell you this--things change in a way Minli could never have
predicted!! This is one terrific book, guys! It's not a slam-bang action fantasy like
The Lightning Thief but it will keep you turning pages. (B3, 2009)
This referencing the Percy Jackson series in an attempt to entice boy readers to try a book
with a female protagonist supports the iconic status of the Percy Jackson series  as  a  “boy”  
series.
There are also a few cases in which girls write reviews of these “iconic  boy books”
or adults mention them  as  children’s  favorites  without  labeling  them  “boy”  books.  For  
example, a reference to Captain Underpants made by a mother – addressing what she
imagines  as  other  parents’  frustration  with  the  series  as something they hope their
children quickly grow out of liking– does not specifically refer to boy readers. Similar to
the other examples, it refers to the series as a gateway to books that are perceived to be
more sophisticated and of higher quality (B11, 2007).
Five references to Diary of a Wimpy Kid and three references to Percy Jackson
among the data sampled are by female readers. However, two of the references to Diary
of a Wimpy Kid are actually reviews of another series called Dork Diaries, in which Dork
Diaries is  presented  as  a  sort  of  “girl”  version  of  Diary of a Wimpy Kid,  as  in,  “I really
like Dork Diaries. It's a GREAT BOOK! I like it because it's like Diary of a Wimpy Kid
and I like that. It's about a girl named Nikki Maxwell who goes to a new  school”  (B3,
2011). Reviews of the Percy Jackson series by girl readers are similar to those written by

192

boy readers – positive reviews focusing on the  novels’  suspenseful, exciting plots.
The discussion of the “iconic  boy  series,” including Dav  Pilkey’s  Captain
Underpants series  (19  examples),  Jeff  Kinney’s  Diary of a Wimpy Kid series (10), and
Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series (9), described above as such because of the number
of times they are mentioned among the data sampled in reference to boy readers,
illustrates  educators’  insistence  on  gender-labeling of books,  particularly  of  “boy”  books.  
In that these series are mentioned as “boy”  favorites,  not  only  by  educators  but  also  by  
boys themselves, boys also perceive that  these  are  “boy”  books, thereby having
internalized the gendered label.
4.2.5 Sub-Claim 4: Educators’  expectations  of  children’s gendered
preferences for story protagonists based on whether they are female or male.
Review of the data provides evidence that educators (parents – 16, librarians – 4, teachers
– 2) expect boys to prefer male protagonists and girls to prefer female protagonists. They
also assume that girls are more likely than boys to read a story featuring a protagonist of
the opposite sex (22). Most of the blog posts and comments coded according to this subclaim represent the perspectives of parents (16), followed by librarians (4) and teachers
(2). In  some  cases,  the  blogger/commenter’s statement is an expression of the appropriate
audience for a particular book:
Throughout the adventure, Will Parker is a wonderfully flawed hero on which to
rest the hopes of mankind. He is often petty and too quick to temper, sometimes
childish and even lazy. He is, thus, easy to identify with. A young man will
recognize his own flaws in Will (as will a still-seeking adult) even as Will
becomes more and more aware of these deficiencies and learns to correct them.
(B13, 2009)
In this example, B13 blogger,  a  father,  pinpoints  whom  he  believes  to  be  the  book’s  
target audience – “a  young  man”  – and explains why this audience will identify with the

193

book’s  male  protagonist.  In  other  cases,  a  comment  speaks  to  the  commenter’s  previous
experience  of  girls’  preference  for  female  protagonists  and  boys’,  for  male  protagonists,  
as in this  mother’s  comment: “Brynn prefers to read books about girls, because she's
such a girly-girl, but she will happily read books about boys if they are good. But I'm not
sure the opposite is true. My little brother wouldn't read "girl books" no matter what (B4,
2009). In  this  comment  the  perception  that  the  taboo  against  boys’  reading  “girl”  books  is  
stronger  than  girls’  reading  “boy”  books,  a  theme  to  be  further  developed  later  in  this
section, is also evident.
4.2.6 Counter Claims B and C (addressing Sub-Claims 1-4 above):
Resistance to the notion of gendered reading preferences. Although, as discussed in
the  section  prior,  educators’  perceptions  of  young  people’s  gendered  reading  preferences  
include  the  assumption  that  a  child’s  sex  determines  his/her  preferences  regarding  the  
protagonist of a story, with boys wanting to read about boys and girls preferring to read
about girls, there are also incidences of resistance to this notion among the data sampled.
In these examples of resistance, bloggers and commenters (parents – 7, children and
young adults – 5, adults of undetermined role – 2, illustrator – 1) express the belief that a
child’s  sex  should  not influence the  child’s reading preferences (15).
The greatest number of examples of resistance come from parents (7 examples),
while children and young adults are second (5). Also represented are one illustrator and
two adults whose roles are not able to be determined from the text. Prominent among
these examples is the notion that a gender neutral approach  to  young  people’s  reading  
preferences is particularly  important  in  terms  of  boys’  reading,  given  that  the  taboo  
against boys reading what are perceived  to  be  “girl”-preferred texts is much stronger than

194

against girls reading what are perceived to be boy-preferred texts. A blog post on B21
(the blog of a prominent literary  magazine  focused  on  reviews  of  children’s  literature)
written by a mother (who is also founder and president of a library board and informal
teacher), illustrates that theme. The mother believes boys, due to homophobia and a lack
of  tolerance  for  boys’  behaving  in  ways  that  would  be  considered  effeminate,  face  much  
stricter reading taboos than girls, so that it is much more difficult for boys to read any
book that would be considered feminine, whereas girls, due to feminism, have a broader
range of choices. She mentions classics as an example, stating that no one would have a
problem with girls reading Sherlock Holmes, Homer Price, or works by Mark Twain or
Robert Louis Stevenson, but boys reading Jane Austen, the Brontës, or Louisa May
Alcott, might be ridiculed. The  mother’s  resistance  to  the  gender-segregation of
children’s  reading  choices focuses on allowing boys to read books (all classics mentioned
in this example) featuring female protagonists, but she also calls for greater general
acceptance  for  both  boys’  and  girls’ reading choices, warning against the tendency to
gender-label books (B21, 2012).
Another example written by a young adult (F) in Australia, relates her experience
working in a bookstore, in which she regularly meets parents who are concerned with
purchasing books that are gender-appropriate for their daughters and sons. She offers a
composite of her experiences, stating that if she recommends that a parent buy the Percy
Jackson series for a girl, the parent will often respond that Percy Jackson is  a  “boy”  book  
and could she recommend something more appropriate for a girl. Even when she tells the
parent that she really enjoyed the series herself, the parent refuses her suggestion and
buys something with sparkles – typically girly. She notes parents reacting in a similar

195

manner when she recommends The Sisters Grimm series for a boy. The young woman
vehemently  opposes  the  notion  of  “boy”  books  and  “girl”  books,  expressing  how  much  
the  parents’  rigidly  defined  gendered  conceptions  of  what  their  sons  and  daughters  should  
be reading bothers her. She also actively resists perceptions of the gender-appropriateness
of books in recommending (through her work in a bookstore) books to parents that they
perceive to be gender-inappropriate for their daughters and sons (B21, 2012).
Another example is from a much younger child – a boy. Although this example is
written by a mother, it is treated here as representing the  child’s  perspective.  The  example
is  a  mother’s  description  of  her  young  son’s  enjoyment  of  a  series  about  fairies,  his  
subsequent realization that the books would be perceived by outsiders as inappropriate
for him (as a boy) to read (resulting in his hiding the books before a friend came over to
play), his fear of the shaming he might face from other children as a result of having the
books in his possession, and his moving beyond the limitations of those expectations.
Later, her son resumes his resistant, voracious, and omnivorous reading practices, reading
anything he himself deems interesting (regardless of whether or not it would be
considered appropriate for a boy). In this example, the strong taboo against boys reading
what would be perceived as girl-appropriate books is also evident (B21, 2012).
Another counter claim (addressing Sub-Claims 1-4) describing the data and
illustrating resistance to the notion of gendered reading preferences is the following:
Educators (parents – 8, librarians – 3, teachers – 2) do not expect girls to prefer what are
perceived to be “girl”-preferred  texts,  or  boys  to  prefer  “boy”-preferred texts. (13) Most
of these examples are represent the perspectives of parents (8 out of 13), followed by
librarians (3) and teachers (2). In one example, a mother writes that it would be a shame,

196

if, due to gender-labeling of books, girls would pass up the opportunity to read classics
like The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Treasure Island or that boys would not read
works by Laura Ingalls Wilder and Louisa May Alcott. She also states that when
choosing books to read to her sons when they were young, she took a gender-neutral
approach, not focusing on the sex of the protagonists but simply sharing a myriad of good
stories with them (B21, 2012). The mother expresses dismay over the gendered
expectations regarding reading audiences for childhood classics and tells of her own
commitment to reading many different stories to her own sons, without presuming them
to prefer stories with male characters.
However, even the examples that are resistant, in that the blogger or commenter is
encouraging children to broaden their reading preferences, can still be gendered in the
expectations they express. For example, in one book review by B6 blogger, a male
teacher, he resists gendered norms of reading by encouraging boys to read the book, but
he also clearly labels the book as more appropriate for girls than for boys (B6, 2011).
To summarize, an important theme among the perceptions of the gendered
reading preferences of children and young adults is educators’  expectations  of  children’s  
gender-based reading preference in relation to the protagonists of the stories they are
reading. Specifically, educators (parents – 16, librarians – 4, teachers – 2) expect boys to
prefer male protagonists while girls prefer female protagonists, and they assume that girls
are more likely than boys to read a story featuring a protagonist of the opposite sex (22).
However, examples of resistance to this notion of  children’s  gendered  reading  
preferences are also found, with  expressions  of  the  belief  that  a  child’s  sex  should  not  
influence the child’s  reading preferences and also refusals to make assumptions that girls

197

will  prefer  “girl”-preferred text or that boys  will  prefer  “boy”-preferred texts. As with the
examples relating to expectations of gendered reading preferences, parents are also best
represented among the examples of resistance.
4.2.7 Sub-Claim 5: Parents’ gendered perceptions of their abilities to judge
children’s  reading  preferences. When reviewing literature for young people,
commenting  about  posted  reviews,  or  discussing  issues  of  children’s  reading  preferences,  
parents indicate that their childhood identity as either a boy or girl, or experience with
children of only one sex, determines their qualifications to judge the reading preferences
of children of the opposite sex. (14) The degree to which, for example, having daughters
would seem to make one an expert on literature for girls or having sons would seem to
make one an expert on literature for boys, is striking. All but one of the examples is
drawn from B4. Moreover, all of the examples are written by women, and 12 of the 14
examples are written by mothers. For two of the women, it is unclear as to whether they
are mothers. One of the examples is written by a female public youth services
librarian/mother about an author/mother. B4 blogger is a mother with two daughters, and
one of the main functions of her blog  is  reader’s  advisory  (answers  to  requests sent to her
by e-mail). Here are two examples from B4, in the context of a blog post regarding
recommended reading for a boy. The first is the following comment by B4 blogger: “If he
were a girl, I would have a  hundred  ideas  of  what  to  nudge  him  toward  next.  But  he’s  not.  
He’s  just  a  great,  young  reader.  And  I  hope  he  continues  to  love  reading.  But  I  don’t  
know what the next captivating book might be for him (B4, 2010). The second, also
written by B4 blogger, is: “But  I  don't  actually  have  a  boy,  and  no  doubt  people  have  all  
sorts of different ideas of what would be just perfect. Do tell, in the comments”  (B4,

198

2010). In both cases, the blogger asks her readership for help in recommending books for
a boy because of her perception that her experience of having daughters makes her unable
to recommend books for boys.
In relation to gendered literacy, then, adults’, and in this case, particularly women
(all the examples are by women) and mothers’ (12 of 14 examples), rely on gendered
perceptions of their ability to advise young readers. Their perceptions are gender-based in
two different ways. First, they see this ability as tied either to their childhood experience
as a boy or girl, thereby assuming that, for example, if they grew up as a girl, they could
refer  girls  to  books  they  themselves  enjoyed  reading.  Second,  they  relate  their  reader’s  
advisory ability to the sex of the child/ren they have experience raising. Hence, a mother
with daughters perceives herself as well-qualified  to  recommend  “girl”  books. In contrast,
there was one example in which a female librarian/mother expressed her confusion as to
why  readers  would  have,  at  the  beginning  of  reading  a  novel,  confused  a  novel’s  narrator  
for a girl, since the female  author  of  the  book  has  sons  and  should  therefore  “know”  boys  
and  how  to  write  a  “boy”  voice.  In  this  sense,  the  female  author’s  experience  with  sons  is  
seen as more important than her identity as female, thereby emphasizing gender as a
social, behavioral experience rather than anything inherent in the sexes – and yet, the
female librarian still  assumes  a  strict  division  between  a  “boy”  voice  and  a  “girl”  voice.    
4.2.8 Sub-Claim 6: Educators’  disparagement  of  “boy”  books. Another way in
which educators (librarians – 5, teachers – 4, parents – 3, adults of undetermined role – 2)
enact gender-labeling  of  children’s  reading  preferences and texts is by disparaging “boy”  
books (including non-fiction, comics, graphic novels, and gross humor) as less literary
than other reading materials. (14) Each  of  these  types  of  “boy”  texts  is  discussed  below.  

199

Educators disparage non-fiction as a textual form that is boring and of lower
worth than fiction. For example, B4 blogger states: “Lots of kids go for nonfiction for a
long time before they ever go for fiction, and any reading is of course fine”  (B4, 2010). In
this statement, by equating non-fiction  with  “any  reading”  and  presenting  it as a gateway
to reading fiction, she implies that it is of a lower caliber than fiction. In another example,
a parent (who presumably is a mother, although it is not entirely clear) is incredulous at
her  son’s  fascination  with  reading  basketball  stats:   “(I like bball, but stats?! The box
scores do seem to have jump-started his reading confidence, though)”  (B4, 2010). Of note
in  this  example  is  the  parent’s  puzzlement  over  why  a  child  would  want  to  read  
something as boring as basketball scores, coupled with the assumption that reading
material of this type is acceptable only insofar as it serves as a bridge to other,  “higher  
quality” reading.
In another example describing non-fiction as boring, a female commenter (of
undetermined role) states:
I spent most of my life convinced that I hated nonfiction--because all it was, was
pages and pages of diagrams or dates or drawings of airplanes, right? No, that's
just what the kid in front of my [sic] in all my classes (always arranged
alphabetically, for years) read. He was a totally stereotypical boy reader, and I
saw what he read and wanted no part of it. I still don't like things that read like
textbooks, but memoirs, histories, those kinds of things, I love. (B4, 2010)
The commenter to B4 explains that non-fiction is only palatable to her in the form of a
narrative,  as  in  “memoirs,  histories.”  Textbooks,  diagrams,  or  charts,  the  types  of  nonfiction  read  by  the  “stereotypical  boy  reader”  who  sat  in  front of her in school, are
unacceptably boring.
Comments like those just mentioned are supported among the data sampled from
the transcript of an interview with an author of non-fiction for children and young adults,

200

who,  criticizing  educators’  confusion  of  what  he  refers  to  as  “literacy  goals”  and  
“socialization  goals,”  states:  “The problem is that you are hoping that reading is going to
accomplish this empathic ability. Then you're not going to see reading a book that is
using engine sizes of military aircraft in the Korean War as valid reading” (Interview 3
transcript, 2013). He believes  that  because  of  educators’  widespread  contention  that  
reading  should  help  develop  readers’  “empathic  ability,”  (the  “socialization  goal”  of  
reading) and because non-fiction does not always do this, non-fiction is thereby
invalidated  as  an  educational  tool.  He  also  notes  that  ‘traditionally all summer reading
lists  have  been  fiction”  (although  he  acknowledges  that  the  choices  have  begun  to  include  
some non-fiction, mostly in the form of biographies) (Interview 3 transcript, 2013). At
several points in the interview, he defends non-fiction as a “boy”-preferred genre, which
he presents as widely underappreciated or appreciated only when presented in the form of
a story. He notes that his eight-year-old  son’s  preferred  bedtime  reading  is  “an  almanac”  
and uses this example to demonstrate that educators need not be so preoccupied with
narrative:
And, I think, here's the key thing, I'm pretty sure that the female world in America
is the set of people who write, edit, publish, and purchase books for elementary
school kids. By purchase, I mean, the moms in the bookstore, the school librarians,
the public librarians. And almost universally you hear in that world when you
praise non-fiction it's that it's not just facts. As if, it needs to have story,
otherwise it's dry. Well I can tell you from my son's experience and many boys
his age, dry is good. (Interview 3 transcript, 2013)
Here he contrasts  the  “female  world”  of  writing,  editing,  publishing,  and  purchasing  
books for children and its insistence on story with the world of his son and other boy
readers  who  enjoy  reading  “dry”  facts.  
Another theme of the examples that are disparaging toward  “boy”  books is that of

201

presenting comics and graphic novels as easier to read than regular text. A typical
example, written by a commenter to B4, reads:
I have a similar issue, as two of my kids are great readers but have just been going
through a very long phase where they basically only read comics. I've really gone
back and forth on how/whether I should try to get them to read other things. NOT
that there's anything wrong with comics, I supply them with good comics….
HOWEVER, not all text comes in speech bubbles. I would like my kids to
encounter an actual paragraph every once in a while. (B4, 2010)
This parent is concerned that children need to be encouraged to read materials other than
comics because the comics are not sufficiently complex to help them develop their
reading  skills,  thereby  implying  that  these  texts  are  not  to  be  considered  “real”  reading.  
Similarly, B22 blogger, a female librarian, in the context of describing the only
conditions under which she would recommend Diary of a Wimpy Kid for reading – to
reluctant boy readers who read nothing except comics (like Calvin and Hobbes) –
presents comics as less than ideal, stating: “There's nothing wrong with Calvin and
Hobbes (I think it was Mo Willems who stated that for the record, and I thank him), but it
can't hurt to give a kid another author to read”  (B22,  2008).  She  presents  comics  as  a  last  
resort, something read only by boys who would otherwise not read.
The examples representing librarians’  perspectives relating to the disparagement
of comics and graphic novels, as in the non-fiction  author/interviewee’s comments listed
above, point to larger institutional prejudices against comics and graphic novels as lower
quality textual forms that are accepted only as bridge texts for reluctant readers. For
example, one female public youth services librarian points out that a comic book has
never won the Newbery Award and the American Library Association has no designated
award for comics (B7, 2012). On B10, a female commenter congratulates a librarian for
reviewing superhero books and including them as part of his  school  library’s  collection,

202

adding that she has been disappointed to encounter both school and public librarians who
feel that superhero-themed books should not be part of a library collection (B10, 2011).
In summary, comics are not considered for awards and they are sometimes excluded from
library collections for youth, despite being widely-read by youth and particularly, by boys.
The non-fiction author/interviewee also comments on what he perceives as an
institutional preference for fiction:
YALSA …used to have a Best Books for Young Adults. They've now changed
that award to Best Fiction because they've decided to eliminate non-fiction. They
have a non-fiction prize. But there's no discussion of current books for teen
groups to consider that can include non-fiction.… And so that's what worries me
is the kind of complacency that reading is story, that fiction is more important
than non-fiction. And I think once you have a kind of rigidity and blindness I do
think some readers are going to not be noticed. And I think in this case those
readers tend to be boys. (Interview 3 transcript, 2013)
In this excerpt, the author discusses the Young Adult Library Services  Association’s  (a  
division  of  the  American  Library  Association)  focus  on  fiction  in  its  “Best  Books”  
category and his fear that, as a result, boy readers of non-fiction will be left out of
discussions of quality literature for young people.
In yet another example of the disparagement of perceived boy-preferred genres, a
public youth services librarian intimates that sports fiction for boys is generally of low
quality. She says she is behind on reading sports fiction for boys and her embarrassment
that she failed to write about the one interesting book that she did read in which the male
protagonist actually played sports (B7, 2013). Here, she implies that boys’  sports fiction
is usually unworthy of her attention and often does not include a protagonist who is an
actual player of the sport described in the story.
The sampled data have no examples of actual teachers voicing their
disparagement  of  “boy”  books; rather, the examples are all relayed from experience of

203

teachers’  voicing disparagement, as in B4  blogger’s  posting  of  this  parent’s  comment:
When we told [the teacher], at conferences, how much he was enjoying his
chapter books, she said that she's trying to encourage all of them to read picture
books  too,  to  emphasize  ‘core  concepts,’  by  which  I  think she meant things like
story arc, character development, etc. She said that there are some really great
picture  books  that  the  kids  can  enjoy,  and  without  those  ‘core  concepts,’  they  will  
be in trouble in higher grades, and she added, sort of offhand, that  “Captain
Underpants won't  be  winning  any  awards.”  (B4, 2010)
In  the  excerpt,  the  parent’s  interaction  with  the  teacher  indicates  the  teacher’s  elevation of
picture books as preferred reading for young children to experience the major concepts of
narrative rather  than  chapter  books.  The  teacher’s  disparagement of Captain Underpants,
an iconic boy-preferred text, is also evident.
4.2.9 Sub-Claim 7: Disparagement  of  “girl”  books. Bloggers and commenters
label books for young people according to gender by describing their disapproval of
certain  books  according  to  certain  qualities  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books.  The  previous  
section  discussed  “boy”  books;;  this  section  will  discuss  the  “girl”  books,  according  to the
following sub-claim: Bloggers and commenters (librarians – 4, parents – 3, children – 2,
adults of undetermined role – 1)  disparage  “girl”  books  (including  romance,  chick lit,
pink books, and princess-themed) for their lack of depth, saccharine cuteness, and
promotion of feminine stereotypes. (10)
Four examples by librarians express disapproval  of  “girl”  books  (4),  followed  by  
parents  (3),  children  (2),  and  one  commenter  of  undetermined  role.  Librarians’  
disparagement  of  “girl”  books  focuses  on  a  dislike for romance (a male librarian calls it
“mushy  stuff,”  B8, 2010) and for chick lit, maligned for a lack of depth, both in terms of
emotions explored and character portrayal (B23, 2008).  Parents’  disparagement  of  “girl”
genres focuses on a dislike for the color pink and sparkles. One mother, for example, says,

204

“UGH to the sparkly  pink  section  in  general”  (B4, 2010). Another (also a librarian),
reviewing a new book series  marketed  to  tween  girls,  describes  one  of  the  “slim  sparkly  
books”:  
It wasn't just the weak characterization, the bright-cute tone, the cloying and
hideous falseness of the whole thing. It was the way it was trying to do this to my
daughter…. They were trying to sell her an identity, complete with likes and
dislikes, interests and outlooks. Come on! Here's a self all ready made, for those
little 'tweens who aren't so sure who they are. You have nothing to lose...but your
soul. From its compulsive dichotomization (I'm sporty, and she's into music!) to
the quiet menace of its insistence on girls' having crushes on boys (you WILL be
heterosexual and obsessed, you WILL care without end about what others think of
you), I hated it, hated what it offered as a story, hated what it was trying to tell my
child about herself. (B4, 2009)
This mother, B4 blogger, criticizes not only the  packaging  of  the  books:  “with pink and
glitter and cutesy illustrations”  but  also  rails  against  the  tween  girl  identity  characterized  
by dichotomized interests and heterosexual boy-craziness, marketed through this book
series. Although B4 blogger is feminist in her critique of the book series, she assumes
that her daughter and other girls will be drawn in by all the qualities that make it a book
marketed to tween girls – the pink covers, boy-crazy female main characters, and
simplistic narration.
Every one of the four examples referring to perceptions that girls will prefer
princess-themed texts discussed here refers to the creation of "princess culture" by the
publishing industry and the media. For example, B7 blogger, a female public librarian of
a major U.S. library system, faults Disney with making the Grimm stories un-palatable
for boys by overplaying the princess aspects of the stories and eliminating violence and
bloodshed (B7, 2012). B7 blogger defines the Disney fairytale audience as girls-only and
names a focus on princesses as the main reason why girls would prefer these stories and
the lack of violence or other frightening elements as the reason why boys would not

205

prefer these stories. She thereby assumes that girls will identify with princesses and boys
will identify with the villains.
B13 blogger, a father, offers a similar assessment of Disney princess movies,
without specifically naming girls as the preferred audience, although he mentions that all
his children (two girls and a boy) enjoyed Tangled, the movie he contrasts with the
Grimm version of the Rapunzel:
Here's what the Grimm's versions have in common with Tangled:
1. Hair
2. Desirable vegetation
3. Involvement of royalty
4. Magical tears
That's about it.
I won't spoil anything about Tangled except to say that the filmmakers have made
Rapunzel a princess because the world can't have enough Disney Princesses. She
also has eyes so large they make anime drawings look subtle and understated.
(B13, 2011)
B13 blogger, like B7 blogger above, comments on Disney Princesses as a profitable
commodity and  criticizes  Disney’s  interpretations  of  the  original  stories.
The child commenter mentioned in this category, who disparages the perceived
“girl”-preferred genre – romance, is a middle school boy who writes fiction for fun. He,
in  an  interview  with  his  author  mother,  specifies  that  his  novel  is  “science fiction and
adventure. And mystery, too. But no  romance”  (B8, 2010).  He  says  he  would  not  “waste  
words”  on  romance.  Moreover, in an e-mail exchange with the male youth services
librarian,  who  asks  the  boy,  “Why are grownups so obsessed with romance and kissing
[emphasis in original]…?”  he  responds,  “In a nutshell, I have no idea. Personally, I fastforward through love scenes, never write them, and have my heart set on buying lots of
cats instead of getting married” (B8, 2010). In  linking  romance  and  “love  scenes”  in  
stories to his own aversion to someday getting married, he implies that the romance of

206

both stories and real-life are a girl-preferred feminine domain that he detests. Moreover,
he delineates clearly between femininity and masculinity, to the point of
overcompensation, perhaps out of fear that his love of writing will result in his being
labeled  feminine.  This  also  speaks  to  the  social  taboo  surrounding  boys  reading  “girl”  
texts,  which  is  perceived  to  be  stronger  than  for  girls  reading  “boy”  texts.  
4.3 Summary/Connection to Research Questions
4.3.1 Response to RQ1. In answer to the first research question posed in this
dissertation – RQ1: What are the conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy
educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for
children (published authors, editors, and published illustrators); and, children/young
adults, as represented in their blogging activities? – perceptions  of  children’s  and  young  
adults’  gendered  reading preferences represent the largest body of examples drawn from
the entire data sample and are therefore a key piece of the puzzle that constitutes
gendered literacy.
Of the examples included in Claim  1:  Perceptions  of  Children’s  and  Young  
Adults’  Gendered  Reading  Preferences,  educators’  labeling  of  books  as  “boy”  and  “girl”–
preferred are most prevalent among the ways in which educators enact these perceptions
in the data (72 examples), followed by educators’ aligning boys’  reading preferences with
the following themes: stories with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science
fiction, adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring vehicles,
and magazines (53). Also important the nearly exclusive mention of certain book series,
coded  “iconic boy books,”  in  reference  to  boys’  reading,  both  as  a  perceived  and  
expressed preference (43). Other ways, albeit to a lesser extent than the others, in which

207

educators  enact  perceptions  of  children’s  and  young  adults’  gendered  reading  preferences,
are through expectations that boys prefer male protagonists and girls prefer female
protagonists (along with the assumption that girls are more likely than boys to read a
story featuring a protagonist of the opposite sex) (22); parents’ perception that their
childhood identity as either a boy or girl, or experience with children of only one sex,
determines their qualifications to judge the reading preferences of children of the
opposite sex (14);;  educators’  disparagement  of  “boy”  books (including non-fiction,
comics, graphic novels, and gross humor) as less literary than other reading materials
(13);;  and,  educators’  disparagement  of  “girl”  books  including romance, chick lit, pink
books, and princess-themed) for their lack of depth, saccharine cuteness, and promotion
of feminine stereotypes (10).
4.3.2 Response to RQ2.To answer to the second research question addressed in
the dissertation – RQ2: How do the conceptions of gendered literacy identified through
the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts for children, and
children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions identified in the literature
review? – the conceptions of gendered literacy identified in the literature review are
reviewed below:
1. Gendered literacy as performed by multiple actors, including children and
young adults, literacy educators, and those in the publishing industry.
2. Gendered literacy as a quantifiable achievement gap between male and female
students.
3. Gendered literacy as the result of biologically-based cognitive differences
between males and females.

208

4. Gendered literacy as the remnant of the historically gendered educational
system (in the U.S.).
The data coded according to perceptions of gendered literacy relates to the first concept
of gendered literacy presented in the literature review-based conceptual model, in which
gendered literacy is seen to be enacted, or performed, by multiple actors, including
children and young adults, literacy educators, and those in the publishing industry.
4.3.3 Response to RQ3. The third research question posed in this dissertation –
RQ3: What similarities and differences, if any, are represented in conceptions of
gendered literacy among literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians,
and teachers); creators of texts for children (published authors, editors, and published
illustrators); and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities? – is
addressed by discussing the representation in the data (categorized according to Claim 1:
Perceptions  of  Children’s  and  Young  Adults’  Gendered  Reading  Preferences) of all these
perspectives.
In terms of Sub-Claim 1: labeling of books  as  “boy”  and  “girl”–preferred,
librarians (29) are represented most in terms of labeling, with parents a close second (23),
and teachers (12), authors (5), and children (3) also represented. Among the examples
included under Sub-Claim 2: perceptions  of  boys’  reading preferences align with stories
with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science fiction, adventure, non-fiction,
sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring vehicles, and magazines, librarians are the
writers of the most examples (39), with parents (11) and teachers (3) represented to a
much lesser extent. In terms of Sub-Claim 3: the almost exclusive mention of certain
book  series,  coded  “iconic boy books,” in relation to  boys’  reading,  both  as  a  perceived  

209

and expressed preference, parents are the main commenters (18 examples), with children/
young adults (11), librarians (9), authors/illustrators (2), and 1 teacher also represented.
Among comments relating to Sub-Claim 4: educators’  expectations  that  boys  prefer male
protagonists and girls prefer female protagonists, and their assumption that girls are more
likely than boys to read a story featuring a protagonist of the opposite sex, parents are
represented the most in the data (16 examples), followed by librarians (4) and teachers
(2).
Sub-Claim 5 describes a unique way in which parents enact the perception of
gendered reading preferences – by perceiving that their childhood identity as either a boy
or girl, or experience with children of only one sex, determines their qualifications to
judge the reading preferences of children of the opposite sex (14). Among comments
illustrating Sub-Claim 6: disparagement of “boy”  books (including non-fiction, comics,
graphic novels, and gross humor), librarians (5) and teachers (4) are equally represented
in the data, with parents (3), and adults of undetermined role (2) also represented. Among
the comments illustrating Sub-Claim 7: disparagement of “girl”  books,  the  representation  
is similar, with librarians (4) and parents (3) leading, with 1 comment by an adult of
undetermined role. However, comments by children (2) are also represented in the data
coded according to this category.
The overall trend in the data is that librarians and parents are the main
commenters regarding perceptions of the gendered reading preferences of children and
young adults. Nonetheless, comments by children and young adults are important in
terms of the mention of certain  book  series,  coded  “iconic boy books,” in  relation  to  boys’  
reading, both as a perceived and expressed preference; in terms of comments in the data

210

disparaging  “girl”  books;;  and,  in  the  labeling of books  as  “boy”  and  “girl”–preferred.
4.3.4 Response to RQ4. For the fourth research question – RQ4 What patterns, if
any, of resistance to the dominant conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among
the blog posts analyzed? – the most prominent form of resistance to the perception of
gendered reading preferences (Counter Claim A) comes from educators in response to the
labeling  of  books  as  “girl”  and  “boy”  books  (21). Of these resistant comments, 10
represent the perspectives of parents, while 6 represent other adults of undetermined role.
The examples also include 1 by an author, 1 by a child, 1 by a librarian, and 2 by teachers.
Counter Claim B: the expression of the belief  that  a  child’s  sex  does  not  and/or  
should not influence their reading preferences (15 examples) is also an important form of
resistance to the perception of gendered reading preferences, as represented in the data.
Among these comments, parents (7 examples) are best represented, and children and
young adults are second (5 examples). However, the comments also include two by
adults of undetermined role and one by an illustrator.
According to Counter Claim C, educators also resist the notion of gendered
reading preferences by expressing resistant expectations of children's literary preferences
(that is, not expecting that girls should like what are perceived to be girl-preferred texts
and that boys should like what are perceived to be boy-preferred texts) (13), and as in the
other two forms of resistance, parents are the main commenters (8). Comments by
librarians (3) and teachers (2), however, are also represented. Looking at the study
sample overall, comments by parents accounted for most of the resistant examples in
terms of the three categories of resistance discussed in this section.
Although  what  is  most  evident  among  the  data  is  the  labeling  of  young  people’s  

211

reading preferences and  of  texts  according  to  “boy”  and  “girl,”  broader issues are also
evident. Educators’  gender  segregation  of  young  people’s  reading  preferences devalues
certain text types, especially in the context of the discussion of text-types that are
tolerated only as bridge texts to help reluctant reader boys learn to enjoy reading
including, the “iconic  boy books” Captain Underpants and Diary of a Wimpy Kid, as well
as non-fiction, comics, graphic novels, and gross humor. As in examples citing boys’  
enjoyment of reading lists and tables,  contrasted  with  educators’  disapproval  of  this  type  
of reading, there is a bias in favor of knowledge gained from story over factual
knowledge.

212

CHAPTER 5 GENDERED LITERACY BEHAVIORS AND
PERCEPTIONS OF GENDERED LITERACY BEHAVIORS
5.1 Claim 2: Gendered Literacy Behaviors and
Perceptions of Gendered Literacy Behaviors
Claim 2 states that gendered literacy behaviors (other than reading preferences, as
described separately) and perceptions of these behaviors are important among the data
sampled. The findings classified according to this claim account for 203 total incidences
and thematically cover a broader range of sub-themes than the other claims. However, the
unifying theme is that they represent expressions and perceptions of gendered literacy
behaviors, in contrast to the reading preferences and related perceptions discussed in the
other sections. For example, while other sections deal with girls’  and  boys’  specific
expressed reading preferences or perceptions of what they would want to read, this
section discusses broader examples of their expressed enjoyment of reading. Sub-Claims
include the following:
Table 8

6. Educators perceive that gendered literacy is a biological
phenomenon, the result of essential, cognitive differences between
males and females. (parents – 11, educator of undetermined type – 1 )
7. Female authors and educators represented in the data discuss the
integrity  of  female  authors’  writing the voices of male protagonists.
(authors – 7, librarians – 2, parents – 1)

5.2 Discussion of Claim 2, Sub-Claims
5.2.1 Sub-Claim  1:  Mothers’  compared  to  fathers’  reading  with  their
children or encouraging  their  children’s  reading. There are 42 examples are of
mothers'  reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading,  compared  
with 32 examples  of  fathers’  reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  
reading. This section will first discuss the examples referencing  mothers’  reading  with  
their  children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading  and  then  discuss  examples  
referencing  fathers’  reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading.
5.2.1.1 Mothers. Blog posts and comments relating to  mothers’  reading  with  their  
children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading may be organized according to the
following sub-themes: mothers reading to or with their children – reading that is usually
described as a sustained activity in the relationship between mother and child, mothers
recommending books (often to other mothers), mothers selecting books (borrowing or
purchasing  books  and  seeking  reader’s  advisory), and adult/young adult daughters
sharing books with their mothers. Overall, the examples for this sub-claim account for 42
of the total examples for the overall category of gendered literacy behaviors.

214

Twenty-four of the examples relate to mothers reading to or with their children.
Many of these examples describe books mothers have enjoyed reading aloud to or with
their children. For example, a commenter to a post on B22 writes:
Thank you sooo much for reviewing this book! I was drawn in by the cover art
right away and bought the 2 compilation books. Now, every night my six year old
and I can't wait for bedtime so we can read 2 more Tashi stories…. Tashi seems
like a great alternative to the sometimes boring Magic Tree House series. I
recommend these books to anyone with a little boy! (B22, 2010)
In this example, the mother highlights the nightly bedtime reading she does with her son
and her recommendation of the Tashi book series (Anna Fienberg, Barbara Fienberg, and
Kim Gamble) specifically for boys. Another example of a mother (commenter)
describing specific reading selections and experiences  reads,  “I read aloud to him The
BFG, which was a lot of fun, and also The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which
really  made  an  impression  on  him  (to  my  surprise)”  (B4, 2010).
In another example under the larger theme of mothers reading to or with their
children, a mother describes her fifteen years of experience reading both with her sons
and with other children and conversing about books with them as part of book clubs (B21,
2012). This  blogger’s  description  includes  not  only  reading she does with her own
children but also with other children in her community; moreover, these are activities that
she has consistently engaged in over a long period of time.
Mothers’  role  in  book  selection  for  their  children,  through  borrowing  or  
purchasing  books  and  soliciting  reader’s  advisory,  is  another  sub-theme of this category
and accounts for 16 examples in the larger category of mothers' reading to/with their
children  and  encouragement  of  their  children’s  reading. For example, in this post, from
B22, a mother comments, “Thank you so much for this post! I am always looking for new

215

books for my daughter, especially in summer. I have printed this post and I'm off to the
library  now!”  (B22, 2010). In this comment, she notes she has been influenced by a post
about  reader’s  advisory  and  intends  to  borrow  the  book  from  the library. In saying that
she  is  “always  looking  for  new  books,”  she  implies  that  helping  to  provide  her  daughter  
with reading material is an ongoing priority for her. A mother/commenter to B4 states,
I have made a few purchases of books he might like (Nate the Great, The Great
Brain series, various youth Star Wars chapter books, The Graveyard Book, etc.)
but nothing seems to spark much lasting interest. I am hoping for the day when I
will see him so engaged in a book that he will make the effort to return to it until
he has finished it, but I am also wary of being pushy on the subject. I would be
grateful for suggestions of other books or series that might appeal to him. (B4,
2010)
This  mother  is  seeking  reader’s  advisory  for  her  son  and  mentions  books  she  has  
purchased for him previously. Like the mother in the previous example, finding reading
materials that will interest and engage her child is an ongoing priority.
A commenter for B12 responds to a post, saying, “I love the review, and the
pictures are wonderful! So did your 8 year old really enjoy and understand the book? I
considered getting it and reading it to my 7 year old (2nd grade) but worried it might be
too much for him (B12, 2011). Here, a mother is considering obtaining a book for her son
and seeking further clarification as to whether it would be appropriate for him.
In another example of this sub-theme of  mothers’  seeking  books  for  their  children,
a woman (presumably a mother), in response to posts by a dad blogger of a
homeschooling family, who posts reviews (in dialogue form) of the books their family
has read together, states: “I love your kid reviews. I've now called my husband over two
weeks in a row to read your transcription of your discussions. What a great way for dad
and kids to bond – over  books”  (B12).  Implied  here  is  the  notion  that  the  commenter  

216

would  like  for  her  husband  to  learn  from  the  dad  blogger’s  example  of  reading  books  
with his children – and perhaps, that he does not often read with his own children.
Ten examples deal with mothers’  recommending  of  books  to other readers of the
blogs – in many cases, other mothers. For example, a commenter on B4, says, “My son
and I read Dunderheads by Paul Fleischman this week. I love the drawings, he loves the
story, and it's a fitting recommendation since it's a tale about a group of seemingly no
good students giving an unfair teacher the what-for”  (B4, 2010). This comment is in
response  to  a  mother’s  writing  to  B4  blogger  in  search  of  reader’s  advisory  for  her  son  
and  the  son’s  teacher’s  insistence  on  picture  books  as  the  preferred  textual  examples  of  
core narrative concepts. Educators’  valuing  of  linear,  story  narratives  over  other text
types, including non-fiction, comics, and graphic novels is a theme that was discussed
earlier in detail in the section describing Claim 1, Perceptions of the Gendered Reading
Preferences of Children and Young Adults, Sub-Claim  6,  Educators’  disparagement of
“boy”  books.
B4 is a blog dealing primarily with  reader’s  advisory,  and  B4 blogger comments
that she receives more responses to requests for reading suggestions for girls than for
boys:  “it’s  easier  to  recommend  a  book  for  someone  you  feel is a lot like you: a reading
girl,  or  a  former  reading  girl,”  she  observes.  In  support  of  this,  in  an  interview  with  B4
conducted for this study, she states (in answer to a question regarding her blog readership)
that her readership consists mainly of women and librarians (Interview 2 notes, 2013).
Moreover, of readers who solicit reading recommendations, 99% are women, 80 to 90%
are mothers, and the other readers consist of aunts, teachers, and godmothers. However,

217

in terms of children for whom recommendations are sought, she estimates an even
balance between boys and girls (Interview 2 notes, 2013).
Five examples refer to young adult and adult daughters and mothers sharing
books, such as this mother’s  comment  on  B4:  “My daughter just bought this book this
week, read it, and handed it over to me, saying, ‘You  should read this. It's a good book’”  
(B4, 2010). B4  blogger  responds  to  this  comment,  saying,  “I  always  love  it  when  they  
hand a book over to me with that seriousness and generosity. It's sort of the recompense
for losing the bedtime story reading”  (B4, 2010). In saying this, B4 blogger legitimizes
the  commenter’s  experience  by  also  claiming  it  as  her  own  –her own daughters have
offered her books  to  read.  It  also  suggests  the  way  in  which  mothers’  and  daughters’  
sharing of texts begins in early childhood but continues into the tween and teen years and
on into adulthood. These examples, in effect, are the  result  of  mothers’  sharing  reading  
with their daughters from the time their daughters were young. In yet another example (a
comment on B4), a woman reflects on both her childhood reading of Frances Hodgson
Burnett’s  A Secret Garden and of listening to it on audiotape with her mother as an adult,
saying,
Thank you for updating; when I read your original post, I wondered whether I
misremembered my adult rereading, in which my experience was extremely
similar to yours. I remember the first chapters word for word, I think of it as
Mary's book, I have tremendous attachment to my memory of the story, and then I
listened to it on tape with my mom a few years ago, and we were both very
surprised and puzzled at its (sexist, racist) weirdness as Colin takes over the story.
The funny thing is, in retrospect it was a book that I read many times in childhood,
but not all the way through. It isn't that I never read the end, but it was the
beginning I read over and over, and that meant so much to me..... (B4, 2009)

218

In this example, the reading experience shared by a mother and her adult daughter
involves not only reading the text together but also discussing the sexism and racism they
perceive in the story.
In the example which follows, in contrast to the others just mentioned, the mother,
rather than the daughter, is the implied recommender of a text. A young girl, reviewing a
book by Enid Blyton that her mother read as a child, writes,  “My  mom  read  St  Clares  [sic]  
when she  was  little,  so  I  read  it  too”  (B3,  2011),  indicating that she read the book at her
mother’s  suggestion.
5.2.1.2 Fathers. In terms of fathers’  reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging
their  children’s  reading, three comments  describe  adults’  fond  memories  of  their  fathers’  
reading to them when they were children. One commenter  describes  her  father’s  reading  
aloud the Dealing with Dragons series to her when she was twelve as one of her most
cherished memories (B23, 2011).
Children mentioned range in age, from older children, like the pre-teen in the
previous example, to the kindergartener in the following example, in which a father
expresses  his  dismay  over  his  daughter’s  insistence  on  labeling  reading  materials  
according to gender, and the way in which he and his wife resist the gender-labeling by
encouraging their young daughter to read what she wants to read rather than what would
be  a  “girl”-appropriate text. He adds that, as a result, her reading choices have
significantly expanded (B21, 2012). In this example, as in previous examples, a very
young child is portrayed as readily gender-labeling books.
Of the examples relating to fathers’  reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging
their  children’s  reading, 12 are posts or comments from B17, the blog of an African-

219

American male illustrator/author. Eight of the examples from B17 describe  the  blogger’s
helping his son with homework, as in when he prefaces his news about finding a literary
agent by stating that before he could blog about his good news, he had to drive home
from doing an author visit at an elementary school in another part of the state, then listen
to his son read aloud, and then read the grocery list his wife had forgotten to take with her
to her over the phone (B17, 2008). This example highlights the fact that helping his son
with reading homework is one of his responsibilities as a father and also demonstrates his
struggle to balance work and home duties.
Other  examples  from  B17  recount  the  blogger’s  sharing leisure reading with his
son, as in an example in which he shares his excitement at the prospect of first reading
and then sharing a book series, that he labels as appropriate for boys, with his son (B17,
2008). In this example, B17 blogger also specifically labels the books as appropriate for
boys. However, in another excerpt,  he  asks  his  son’s  teacher  if  he  can  start reading
chapter books, including the Junie B. Jones (Barbara Park) series, featuring a first-grade
female protagonist, with his son (B17, 2007). Therefore, B17 blogger, in choosing a
series with a female protagonist, demonstrates a flexible approach to gender in terms of
choosing reading materials for his son.
5.2.2 Sub-Claim 2: Boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  advanced  reading  level,  as  
compared with girls’. Twenty-seven  examples  discuss  boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  
advanced reading level, as compared with twenty-four for girls.
5.2.2.1 Boys’  love  of  reading. References to boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  
advanced reading level are found in five different blogs and account for 27 examples.
Comments  relating  to  boys’  love  of  reading  consist  of  descriptions  of  younger  boys  who  

220

enjoy being read to and also those of boys who are already reading independently. Boys’  
writing is also mentioned in two comments. These examples stand in stark contrast to
Sub-Claim 3, the perception that  boys  are  both  “reluctant”  and  less  advanced  readers, to
be discussed later.
Eleven comments relate to mothers reading with sons. Two more comments
describe parents reading to sons, but it is not clear whether the parent is a mother or
father. More specifically, these comments often refer by title or author to the books the
parent and child have shared together, as in the following comment in response to a blog
post on B4:
Our first chapter book was also James and the Giant Peach. We moved on to Esio
Trot after that, then Ramona the Pest, now we're doing The Mouse and the
Motorcycle. My son is 4 and-a-bit but sounds a lot like the boy in the letter. I love
the comments here and will be bookmarking this when we're done with Ralph and
need some more books. (B4, 2012)
Like the mother who wrote this comment, many parents share their reading
recommendations or their intentions to read other books mentioned on the blog.
Six comments mention  boys’  independent  reading, and these examples also stand
in contrast to the widespread perception of boys as reluctant and remedial readers.
Among these comments, some also describe boys being read to, especially boys who are
making the transition to reading independently. For example,
I'm on the bandwagon with this one as well, being one of 3 girls but now faced
with a 6 year old son who loves reading. I highly recommend (for his age) Three
Tales of My Father’s  Dragon by Ruth Stiles Gannett. He has fallen hopelessly in
love with these quiet, wonderful, just-on-the-edge-of-scary stories, and he can
read 90% of it by himself. (B4, 2010)
In this comment, as in the example above, the mother mentions the specific title of a book
she and her son, an advanced reader (this is implied based on the fact that the series she

221

mentions is geared toward the reading level of an 8 year old), have enjoyed. She also
suggests,  in  the  first  line  “being one of 3 girls but now faced with a 6 year old son who
loves reading”),  that,  as  a  female,  she  finds  it  difficult  to  envision  the  kinds of books her
son will enjoy. This topic was explored in more detail in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.7, Claim
1, Sub-Claim 5 – Parents’  perception  that  their childhood identity as either a boy or girl,
or experience with children of only one sex, determines their qualifications to judge the
reading preferences of children of the opposite sex – section of the findings.
Examples referring  to  boys’  love  of  reading and/or advanced reading level are
directly counter to the perception of boys as both  “reluctant”  and  less  advanced  readers.
Some of these examples compare reading to satisfying a hunger. For example, a mother
commenting on B4 notes: “My 7 1/2 year old son has been an avid reader since he was 4
1/2, starting with the Magic Tree House books. He ate those up….”  (2010).  Other similar
comments include: “When it arrived in the mail, my son, a voracious reader of both
chapter books and comics, pounced on it, read it from cover to cover immediately and
then  refused  to  hand  it  over”  (B13,  2009);;  and,  “My son is now three and is still
devouring  books  at  an  incredible  rate”  (B4,  2009).  
Another important sub-theme is that of re-reading the same books again. For
example, a mother states:
I also have to especially thank the reader who suggested My Father's Dragon -we read it on a long airplane journey about three weeks ago, and my son adored -a-DORED -- it (and so do I, actually). It has been in constant rotation ever since
(as in, we finish it, and we start right back at the beginning). (B4, 2009)
The three-year-old boy mentioned in this example loves My  Father’s  Dragon  (Ruth Stiles
Gannett) so much that he asks his mother to read it to him over and over again. Here is
another  example,  a  review  written  by  a  boy,  posted  on  B3:  “I enjoyed this book so much

222

that I read it twice and I cannot wait to read the second book The StoneKeeper's Curse in
this series. I recommend this book”  (B3,  2010). These  examples  illustrating  boys’  avid  
enjoyment of books are directly counter to the perception of boys as reluctant and less
advanced readers (Claim 2, Sub-Claim 3), a perception to be discussed in detail in a
following section.
Three comments included in boys’  love  of  reading  refer  to  boys’  writing,  
including a ten-year-old boy who enjoys writing. His mother writes of her son:
I too have a reader/writer. He's ten and is constantly on the computer typing like a
maniac….He's  also  an  avid  reader.  Dark Omen did a fabulous job and seems very
self assured. And has a great imagination. I loved the interview. I'm going to have
my son come in and read it. Maybe it'll help him when the other kids make fun of
his love of writing. (B3, 2011)
In this comment, the mother responds to a post on B3 describing an interview the B3
blogger,  a  male  librarian,  had  done  with  the  son  (“Dark  Omen”)  of  a  female  author  of  
science fiction for young adults. The mother responds to this story of a boy who loves
writing by referring not only to her own son’s  love  of  reading  and  writing  but  also  to  the  
ridicule he has faced from peers because of it.
5.2.2.2 Boys’  advanced  reading. References  to  boys’  advanced  reading include
parents’ expressions of concern with keeping advanced readers away from texts that
would not be considered age-appropriate. For example, here a mother commenting on B4
describes the difficulty she is facing in finding books for her two-year-old son:
He is very articulate, and LOVES books….Thing is, he has a fairly long
attention span, so all the picture books that are meant for his age just have too few
words per page to really keep us going (I'm thinking The Gruffalo, Duck in the
Truck, John Burningham, Maurice Sendak, etc). But, many proper books (here
I'm thinking of things like Roald Dahl, Paddington, etc) have too few pictures (he
still does like to have *some* pictures) and occasionally are just too scary or
grown up….Basically it feels like I've found all the things that hit the mark in

223

terms of length of story and age appropriateness (which seem to be in a bit of a
conflict maybe?) – but I'm sure there must be more out there. (B4, 2009)
The mother is looking for books appropriate for her young son, a precocious reader, that
will satisfy his love for longer stories but also have enough illustrations along with gentle
subject matter (not  “too  scary”). Another comment, by a public elementary teacher
relating  to  boys’  writing  refers  to  disadvantaged  kindergarteners’  advanced reading and
writing, stating that most of her students are able to read and write. They can compose
sentences and print legibly, and she makes a point of saying that it is not just the girls
who are doing well but also the boys (B17, 2009). Here, the teacher directly articulates
the normative perceptions – that kids, and particularly boys, in poverty are doomed to
underachieve – and identifies the ways in which her kindergarten students are breaking
those norms. Moreover, she celebrates the achievement of learning to read for both girls
and boys.
5.2.2.3 Girls’  love  of  reading and/or advanced reading. Of the references to and
by girls who love to read and/or who display an advanced reading level, 12 are written by
parents, 7 by adult women reflecting on their love of reading starting in childhood, 3 by
children and young adults, and 2 by librarians. Comments may be characterized
according to 5 major sub-themes: 1) reading a large number of texts; 2) the ability to read
very fast; 3) precocious reading; 4) the discussion of girls’  reading in direct opposition to
boys and/or masculinity; and 5) spending a large amount of time reading. The sub-themes
overlap in the data in the sense that some comments were characterized by more than one
sub-theme.

224

Twelve of the comments relate to girls reading a large number of texts in terms of
quantity. For example, a mother, reflecting on her own love of reading as a girl and
following a discussion of how to engage her son in reading, states:
As a child who needed books like I needed air to breathe (I recall rummaging
around in the basement once for something, anything new, and magically
discovering the Narnia books in a box), it's hard for me to comprehend not having
a deep level of engagement in reading. Do you think I am expecting that he
should make a leap into lengthier chapter books too early? (B4, 2010)
In this excerpt, the commenter describes her childhood need for books – a need that drove
her to read every book in her house – as equivalent  to  needing  “air  to  breathe”  and
describes her anxiety  over  her  son’s  reading. She is concerned that because her son does
not read in the same way she did as a child, he will not be a good reader. She notes that,
except for non-fiction or certain fiction series, he will start books but not finish them, and
is not yet interested in reading chapter books.
A young teen, B1 blogger, refers to her project to read all the winners of the
Newbery Medal, an annual award given by the American Library Association to the
author  of  a  work  of  children’s  literature: “When  I  was  ranking  these,  I  had  fun  thinking  
again about each book. It is amazing how many  of  them  I  really  did  like!”  (B1, 2010).
Her dedication extended to reading even those books she did not enjoy in order to meet
her goal of reading them all. As  in  the  examples  of  boys’  love  of  and  advanced  reading,  
girls’  love  of  reading is also described as equivalent to eating, such as “voracious  reader”  
(two examples – B4, 2010; B22, 2010), “voracious  lifetime  girl  reader”  (B4, 2010), “a
child hungrily reading everything in sight”  (B4, 2009), and  “I  started  devouring  books  the  
day I learned to read, but not a single one of my six brothers has ever picked up a book
voluntarily”  (B4, 2010).

225

A second sub-theme (6 comments) is that of an ability to read very fast. For
example,  B1  blogger,  a  young  teen,  describes  how  she  read  a  book:  “It is also a short, fast
book to read (I plowed through it in under 2 hours), which makes it a great summer
reading book”  (B1, 2011). Other  examples  mention  “turbo-charged  skimming”  (B4,
2010),  “a  fast  reader/skimmer”  (B4, 2010),  “an  inordinately  fast  reader”  (B4, 2010),  “a  
super  fast  reader  child”  (B4, 2010),  and  “I  read  freakishly  fast”  (B4, 2010).
The third major sub-theme is that of describing instances of girls’  precocious  
reading (6 examples),  as  in,  “My daughter is an excellent reader and pushed herself”  (B4,
2010),  or  “In K Diana was reading way out there beyond anything that made sense,
James and the Giant Peach etc, but she loved,  too,  an  illustrated  ABC”  (B4, 2010). Blog
posts and comments fitting this sub-theme,  similar  to  blog  posts  discussing  boys’  
precocious reading, are often accompanied by mothers’ comments about monitoring their
daughters’ reading to make sure they are not reading anything objectionable and also
women reflecting on their own precocious childhood reading. For example, a mother
describes her  daughter’s  reading  habits:  
She loves imagination and fantasy. She really liked Time  Traveler’s  Wife, until I
found out she was reading it and stopped her (due to adult content). This is why I
say she likes somewhat complex plots – the time travel complexity of the story
line she really liked. (B4, 2010)
This mother is both concerned about protecting her daughter, an advanced reader, from
“adult  content”  and  about  helping  her  daughter  find  sufficiently  complex  reading  material.  
Another woman reflects on her childhood reading:  “Just to make you feel better (maybe?),
I read pretty much every book in my parents' library by the time I was in 5th grade and
that included some seriously disturbing stuff…and  I  turned  out  just  fine”  (B4, 2010).
Mothers’  concerns  with  preventing  their  children  from reading age-inappropriate material,

226

in light of this statement, are unfounded and represent yet another means, in addition to
gender-segregating, to try to determine their children’s  reading  choices.
Three comments categorized in the larger category of girls’  love  of  reading  and/or  
advanced reading level mention reading in direct opposition to boys and/or masculinity,
which, when juxtaposed with the  many  examples  of  boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  
advanced reading discussed just prior, appears illogical.  One  commenter  notes,  “I too, of
course, would have LOVED to be a tomboy as a child–I was an aspirational tomboy!–
only temperamentally was happier making a cake or reading a book than climbing over a
fence!”  (B5, 2008). Reading, along with baking, here is identified as a girlish activity
whereas tomboy (girls behaving like boys) behavior is defined as more active, for
example,  “climbing  over  a  fence.”  Similarly,  in  response  to  B4  blogger’s  post  regarding  
her  daughter’s  refusal to read The Diary of Anne Frank, other non-fiction, or anything
related  to  realism,  including  realistic  fiction,  a  mother  complains,  “Try being a voracious
lifetime girl reader and having boys – who prefer  sports”  (B4, 2010). Here, the mother, in
calling  herself  a  “lifetime  girl  reader”  and  contrasting  that  identity  with  that  of  her  sportsloving sons, associates reading with femininity and sports with masculinity.
The last major theme of the comments related to girls’  love  of  reading  and/or  
advanced reading level is that of spending a large amount of time reading (2 comments).
For example, one mother states:
Right now, I'm reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to my barely 5 year
old and she is enthralled. Like, she weaseled 4 chapters out of me on Sunday and
decided yesterday we need to start reading during the day since bedtime keeps
getting in the way of more story. (B4, 2012)
In this example, the mother describes sharing a book that would be considered at the
reading level of an older child, with her daughter, and bedtime reading is supplemented

227

with  daytime  reading  to  satisfy  the  daughter’s  growing  reading  appetite.  The emphasis on
“more story”  in  this  excerpt  echoes  what  the non-fiction author interviewed for this study
perceives as a preoccupation with narrative resulting in institutional bias against other
textual forms. He states that “the moms in the bookstore, the school librarians, the public
librarians”  insist  that,  for  example,  non-fiction  “needs to have  story,  otherwise  it's  dry”  
(Interview 3 transcript, 2013).
Another  mother  describes  her  young  daughter’s  tendency to read into the night:
I have a daughter who just turned 8 and our challenge is she just can't stop reading
and it doesn't make her tired. I try putting her to bed earlier but even as late as 10
after reading for 2 1/2 hours she still wants to keep reading. (B4, 2010)
The girl in this example happily reads to herself in bed, long past her bedtime, and as
such, exemplifies the voracious girl reader. Nonetheless, many examples of voracious
boy readers, as described earlier, are found among the data sampled. These examples
stand in contrast to the perceived reluctant boy reader, as described below.
5.2.3 Sub-Claim 3: Educators’  perception  that  boys  are  both  “reluctant”  and  
less advanced readers. Educators (including librarians – 10, parents – 9, teachers – 7,
author – 1, adults of undetermined role – 1, also 1 child) perceive that boys are both
“reluctant”  and  less  advanced  readers  (29). The  term  “reluctant  reader”  is thereby
associated with boys (with the exception of two examples among the data in which
reluctant reader girls are mentioned), and this label is also paired with an assumption that
boys are less advanced readers. In one example, B1 blogger, a girl reader, recommends a
book  with  a  male  protagonist  based  on  potential  appeal  “for reluctant boy readers,”  
thereby  directly  linking  the  terms  “boy”  and  “reluctant  reader”  (B1,  2011).  
Most numerous among the examples for this category are comments made by
librarians – ten of the twenty-nine  examples.  A  male  librarian  states  outright:  “Yeah,

228

reading is enjoyable and educational – and most guys don't think the two can ever go
together!! That's one reason I run this blog – to prove that those two words CAN go right
next  to  each  other”  (B8,  2010).  In  this  statement,  he  indicates  that  boys’  distaste  for  the  
educational aspects of reading represents his primary motivation for maintaining the blog.
A  female  school  librarian’s  comment  is  more  subtle.  She  writes,  of  author  Brian  Jacques,
that boys, if they enjoy reading, often like Jacques’ Redwall series, but the books are
large so that boys who are hesitant to read may be put off by their size (B9, 2006). In
specifically  stating  that  boys  like  the  author’s  books,  if they enjoy reading, she implies
that many boys do not enjoy reading. Another comment is written by the male
illustrator/author of B17, but, in noting that as part of a state library association
conference  he  was  a  panelist  for  a  discussion  focusing  on  encouraging  boys’  reading, he
points  to  librarians’  perceptions  that  boys  in  particular need prodding in order to
overcome their tendency towards reluctance to read (B17, 2012).
Parents’  perspectives (9) are also significant. B4 blogger, in response to a request
for  reader’s  advisory,  writes,  
My hunch is that he likes to be read to because for him reading is still hard. It's a
lot of work to get through words on the page, and sometimes seeing so many sort
of defeats a kid before he starts. A graphic novel slips the words by in unoverwhelming (sorry for non-word) bubbles…  (B4,  2010)
In this excerpt, B4 blogger, herself a parent of daughters who enjoy reading, suggests a
graphic novel as ideal for a boy who does not enjoy reading. B4 blogger also assumes
that since the boy does not enjoy reading, he is not a skilled reader.
Similar to the example just mentioned, a father notes,
Let’s  not  forget  to  mention  how  attractive  Frankie Pickle may look to educators
eager to convert new readers. For my son, who loves reading, Frankie Pickle was
simply an  extra  delectable  treat.  But  it’s  [sic] comic book elements could be a big

229

draw for reluctant readers as well, perhaps providing just the ticket to the
marvelously rich and delightful world of literature. (B13, 2009)
Although his own son is an eager reader, the father refers to the perceived problem of
reluctant readers and suggests that this series featuring a male protagonist and with many
similarities  to  a  “comic  book”  may  appeal to reluctant readers. He  suggests  its  “comic  
book  elements”  as  a  bridge to texts of higher literary value, a theme that is also discussed
in , Chapter 4, Section 4.2.8, Claim 1: Educators’  perceptions  of  children’s reading
preferences and  labeling  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books, Sub-Claim 6, Educators’  
disparagement of “boy”  books (including non-fiction, comics, graphic novels, and gross
humor) as of less value than other reading materials.
Another example, a comment by a male (all that can be determined is that he is an
older brother) mentions that he was able to convince his younger brother, whom he
describes as a typical reluctant reader, to read the Encyclopedia Brown series (B23, 2007).
The examples by teachers refer less directly than the previous examples to the
perception of boys as reluctant readers. One example is when a male teacher, in a book
review on his blog, implies that fourth grade boys are selective (rather than voracious)
readers (B6, 2007). Another example, by B17 blogger (as in the librarian example just
mentioned) refers  to  teachers’  perceptions  of  boys’  dislike  of  reading  by  mentioning  a  
school conference in which he participated as a speaker, the purpose of which is to
motivate  boys’  reading (B17, 2011). A school would only hold such an event because the
school’s  educators perceive that boys need to be encouraged to read.
One  example  refers  to  an  author’s  perspective  and  is  a  quote  by  the girl blogger (a
young teen) of B1, from her interview with author Jon Scieszka. In response to a
question about why he started the “Guys Read” blog, Scieszka states:  “I started GUYS

230

READ to help just boys because as a group, boys struggle with reading more than girls
do”  (B1,  2010). Scieszka began the site as a response to the perceived problem of boy
readers, and as in the other examples mentioned, the linkage of reading difficulties with
boys is thereby reinforced.
5.2.4 Sub-Claim 4: Educators’ perception of reading as unwelcoming to boys.
Educators (including librarians – 11, parents – 3) perceive that books and reading are
unwelcoming to boys. Nine comments from this section are from B3 and one from B8;
both blogs have the aim of encouraging boy readers, specifically because the blogs are
meant to make up for the lack of acceptance and encouragement boys are perceived to
face as readers. Seven of these comments protect the male librarian-managed blog space
by symbolically making female readers – either girls who write book reviews and send
them in or female authors the bloggers interview – into  “honorary  guys.”  These
comments have been coded as evidence of the perception that books and reading are
unwelcoming to boys because the male librarians, while allowing females to share the
blog space, have to make these female guest commenters into  “guys”  in  order  to  do  so.  
For example:
Now, just to be clear--even though this blog is primarily for boys, we don't mind
if girls write in. We want to know about good books and, if girls can tell us about
some, we don't mind….In fact, we're so glad to hear from them that we give them
the greatest honor we could possibly bestow--we make them HONORARY
GUYS!! [emphasis in original] (all this generosity is further proof--as if any more
is needed-- of the awesome greatness of boys!) (B3, 2011)
In this statement the male librarians/bloggers clarify that females are only allowed to
share the blog space with boys within certain limits. In order to share the space, by
having their book reviews posted, they must be labeled “honorary  guys,” and boys should
be lauded for their willingness to share the blog space with girls.

231

Two other examples from B3 picture the male librarian in masculine poses, i.e.
flexing a muscle and holding up a book with that same arm, or, in another case in B8,
wearing  a  “got  books?”  t-shirt,  the  caption  describing  the  male  librarian  as,  “striking his
MANLIEST pose and showing that he is a walking advertisement for guy reading”  (B8,  
2012). The  male  librarians’  behaviors  here represent overcompensating responses to their
perceptions of the social association of reading with femininity.
In  another  example,  B4  blogger  refers  to  the  world  of  reading  as  an  “enchanted
garden”  she  has  always  been  a  part  of  and  refers  to  the  sudden  realization  that  boys  were  
“standing outside the garden gates”  (B4,  2010).  A commenter picks up on the metaphor
and recommends B12, by a father/homeschooler blogger who reads with his children,
“for anyone with a boy looking in sadly on the secret garden of girl lit”  (B4,  2010).  These
examples  portray  the  world  of  children’s  reading  as  girl-dominated and a place where
boys feel unwelcome. In another similar post, B4 blogger muses, “What Does It Mean to
Be a Boy?...In truth, I have (of course) no answer to the question in my headline. But it's
something I think about, in all sorts of ways: life, school, literature. Many of the things I
love  seem...inhospitable  to  boys”  (B4,  2011).  Through  the  metaphor  used  here  of  boys’  
facing a closed door, barring them from entering the world of literature and reading,
once again, the association of reading and literacy with femininity, rather than
masculinity, is seen, and is presented as a distinction learned from an early age.
5.2.5 Sub-Claim 5: Parents’  perception  regarding  a  lack  of  “boy  books.”
Parents perceive that there are not enough "boy books" available. (13) Eleven of the
examples are from B4, a blog by a mother of two daughters (also an editor, but not of
children’s  books), and all of these are written by mothers. As  stated  prior,  this  blog’s  

232

readership, in the blogger’s  estimation,  is  primarily  female. The trend is a perception that
there  are  enough  “boy  books”  for  young  children  and  young  adults  but  not  as  much  for
those in the elementary and middle grades. For example, a mother writes:
There are a wealth of options for girls, and not so many for boys. I worry as my
son gets older about what I will find for the in-between stage - I think as he gets
older there are a lot of science fiction options, but for the elementary years there
seem to be less choices. (B4, 2010)
This  sentiment  is  echoed  in  the  mothers’  statements mentioned above, which are
responses to a post in which B4 blogger comments that when  she  writes  about  reader’s  
advisory for girls, she receives more responses than when she writes about boys. To
illustrate, she writes,  “Posts about books for girls get about 3 times the response rate that
posts about books for boys get. The post about the brother and sister? A whole bunch of
people  recommended  for  her,  and  didn't  have  anything  for  him”  (B4,  2010).  In  response  
to the post, seven comments by mothers relate to having had trouble finding suitable
reading materials for sons or the perception that other parents do. In one case, a mother
notes that although she does not have trouble finding reading materials now for her young
son, she projects that she soon will,  stating,  “I've  certainly  heard  it  said  before,  but  my  
son's only three so there's lots of options for him yet. Somehow I never really thought
until  now  that,  hey,  this  is  going  to  be  my  problem  soon,  too”  (B4,  2010). In this case, she
implies that reading the thread of comments has reminded her of the general perception
that it is more difficult  to  find  boys’  books  and  now  presents  a  “problem” she is about to
face. Another comment in this section is by a school librarian (also a mother), who
laments the difficulty of finding humorous books that are appropriate for boys (B6, 2012).
5.2.6 Sub-Claim 6: Educators perceive that gendered literacy is a biological
phenomenon, the result of essential, cognitive differences between males and females.

233

All but one of the examples regarding the perception that gendered literacy is the result of
biologically-based cognitive differences between males and females can be attributed to
parents. The one comment not attributed to a parent may actually be a parent, but there is
not enough information to identify the commenter definitively as a parent. Several subthemes are apparent in the comments for this category. One sub-theme is the perception
that boys learn to read later than girls. Another is the perception that girls and boys have
innate differing reading preferences and, relatedly, that girls are somehow wired to enjoy
reading while boys are not. Finally, another sub-theme is the perception that boys are
more active than girls and so are less inclined to enjoy school-appropriate behaviors,
including reading.
The first sub-theme, the perception that boys learn to read later than girls, is
evident in the following mother’s  response to B4 blogger’s post bemoaning the fact that
she receives more reading suggestions for girls than for boys. She comments: “Part of the
problem is that most boys don't read as early as girls, which means that there are rows
and rows of pink, sparkly chapter books with  titles  like  ‘The Pet Fairy’  (B4,  2010).  Here  
the  commenter  connects  the  lack  of  early  readers  marketed  for  boys  with  boys’  reading
ability, which she claims develops  later  than  that  of  girls’.  
The  blogger  for  B13,  in  a  post  titled  “Boys,  reading,  and  what  to  do  about  it,”  
discusses  his  ambivalent  views  on  the  perceived  “crisis”  surrounding  boys’  literacy  but  
also announces the imminent debut of a blog to discuss literature for teen boys, noting:
“And when it comes to reading, it certainly seems, based on a quick scan of the available
titles in the teen section of my local Barnes and Noble, that teenage boys are certainly

234

doing less of it than girls. So efforts like Guys Read and Guys Lit Wire seem more than
warranted”  (B13,  2008).  In  response,  a  commenter  states:  
Michael has a pile of international research about boys' brain development and the
"reading gap" that begins early and too often widens as they grow. He was
inspirational and informative. His speaking gigs are on his website. If the topic
interests you, he is a one-man juggernaught [sic]/advocate for boys' literacy. (B13,
2008)
The commenter points  to  the  work  of  Michael  Sullivan  (children’s  librarian, library
director, and adjunct instructor in several universities), which emphasizes the reading
problems and preferences of boys specifically. The commenter expresses tacit agreement
with  Sullivan’s  conclusions  regarding  the  early-onset  “reading gap”  between  boys  and  
girls  by  stating  that  she  finds  him  “inspirational.”
Another sub-theme for this category is the notion that girls and boys have innate
differing reading preferences. For example, a mother states:
But, practically, as the parent of a 3.5-y-o boy and a 14-month girl, I have already
discovered that both children some [sic] stereotypically gendered preferences that
are, as far as I can tell, totally innate. My son has been fascinated with truck and
diggers from a young age. My daughter, so far, is much more interested in
pictures of other babies than he ever was. Generally, I think we can say that there
are certain qualities of literature that, on average, may be more or less likely to
appear [sic] to boys or girls. I will be delighted to keep on offering good books of
all kinds to both of them, but I am also not going to try to bend them to my
gender- neutral will when it comes to reading. I'm just going to give them what
they enjoy. (B4, 2010)
This example  is  included  here  rather  than  in  the  section  discussing  educators’  perceptions  
of  boys’  and  girls’  differing  reading  preferences because of the way in which the mother
assumes  these  differing  interests  are  “totally  innate”  and  her  insistence  that  although she
herself  has  a  “gender-neutral  will”  in  regard  to  reading  preferences,  her  children  do  not  
conform to it.

235

A related sub-theme is a perception that girls are predisposed to enjoy reading,
while boys are not:
I started devouring books the day I learned to read, but not a single one of my six
brothers has ever picked up a book voluntarily. My husband and his three brothers
start looking green around the gills when asked to read. Of my male friends,
perhaps one or two read for leisure; the rest tend to roll their eyes when their
wives talk books with me. I'm tempted to think from this that there most [sic] be
SOME genetic predisposition at work. (B4, 2010)
The commenter states that among her male relatives and friends, she knows very few
who enjoy reading. She softens the last sentence above by saying that, based on her
experiences,  she  is  “tempted  to  think”  that  the  reason  her  female  relatives  and  friends  
enjoy  reading,  while  her  male  relatives  and  friends  do  not  enjoy  reading,  is  a  “genetic  
predisposition.”  However,  by  invoking  the  biological  terminology  – “genetic  
predisposition”  – she suggests a biological determinist stance regarding males and
reading.
A closely-related sub-theme is the way in which bloggers and commenters discuss
boys as more active than girls. A mother comments:
I have a 5-year-old boy and a 3-year-old girl, so I guess we make good anecdata
for untangling birth order from gender? ;) They are both pretty crazy and active,
but my son is more so. My daughter is sometimes snuggly or likes to put things in
order. My son is only happy if he's creating something or destroying it and his
favorite thing is to use things (anything) in a manner for which they were not
intended to be used… Without any real justification, I think birth order is linked
to bossiness, but I really do think boys are a lot more active and crazy than girls.
Even when they're little babies, I had to babyproof to the nines for my son, and
everyone I know who was lackadaisical about it had girls. I came into parenting a
staunch gender neutralist, but had to change my tune somewhat-- although I
believe there's a ton of overlap. I love seeing my daughter's energy, confidence,
and even defiance as evidence of that. (B4)
The mother directly describes her belief that boys are more active than girls, illustrating
by describing her son as more active than her daughter – an activity level that she

236

perceives as beginning in infancy, as she states that she felt that she had to baby-proof her
house for her son to a degree more extreme than friends with girls had to baby-proof.
Although she tempers her message by saying that her girl is also active and that there is
“overlap,”  she  insists  that  “boys are a lot more active and crazy than girls.”
Similarly,  another  commenter  who  describes  herself  as  “Mom  of  boys”  states:    
I have two boys, so I can't respond to the girl/boy dynamic, but I can say (from
my perspective) that the older boy is a sweet, cerebral, energetic five year old. His
three year old younger brother, however, is that force of chaos you so describe. Is
it because he is three? Or is it because he is a boy? Or is it because he has an
angelic older brother? I dunno. I do know the family with two girls the same ages
as our boys spends most of the time with us with their mouths agape asking
questions like, "Are they always so energetic? Is it safe to let them run around like
that?" (B4, 2012)
The implication in both this statement and the one prior is that boys are more active than
girls and that this tendency toward greater activity is directly linked to their being male.
One comment in this category also describes school as unsuitable for boys
because  of  boys’  (assumed)  less willingness to sit still. For example, B4 blogger writes:
“What Does It Mean to Be a Boy? In truth, I have (of course) no answer to the question
in my headline. But it's something I think about, in all sorts of ways: life, school,
literature. Many of the things I love seem...inhospitable to boys. I see my girls in school,
watch them thrive, and wonder at the extent to which school (especially elementary
school, with its focus on behaving yourself and being orderly)  seems  to  be  tough  on  boys.”  
5.2.7 Sub-Claim 7: Female authors’ and educators’ discussion of the integrity
of  female  authors’  writing  the  voices  of  male  protagonists. Seven of the ten comments
are excerpts from interviews with female authors. For instance, a female author of young
adult literature, when asked about writing from a male perspective says that boys’  talk  is
more  terse  than  girls’, they do not as freely express their emotions or their problems even

237

though  they  experience  emotions  similar  to  girls’  (B2, 2008). This author notes marked
differences  between  writing  the  voices  of  boys  and  girls,  indicating  that  her  “boy”  
dialogue is less verbose. She  expresses  assumptions  about  boys’  communicative  
behaviors, including that they have more trouble expressing emotion than girls and that
their speech uses fewer words and is less focused on emotion than that of girls.
Two comments refer to spending time with boys in real life as the key to writing
believable  male  characters.  For  example,  another  female  author  states,  “I  guess  I’ve  
known enough boys through my life, well enough that the knowledge was just in there for
me  when  I  needed  it”  (B3,  2008).  Similarly,  the  author  from the B2 interview mentioned
above comments that her previous experience as a teacher allows her to understand the
ways in which boys talk (B2, 2008). The assumption is that the way in which boys
communicate is fundamentally different from that of girls. In another instance, in
reference to a male protagonist that other readers have felt to be inauthentic, to the point
of mistaking the protagonist for a girl for much of the novel, B7 blogger, a librarian,
states that the author, a mother, has two sons, as  a  means  to  defend  the  author’s  
credentials for writing a male voice (B7, 2012). Here, the assumption is that there is a
particular knowledge to be learned about boys’  speech as different from that of girls.
Other  comments  speak  to  a  female  author’s  ability  to  write a convincing male
voice, as when B7 blogger, a librarian, writes of a particular female author that she does
not think anyone would fault that author with writing an inauthentic voice for the boy
narrator in her novel (B7, 2012). And a mother states, “I think there are a bunch of more
contemporary fiction authors who really get boys though….But there are female authors
who seem  to  really  get  boys  as  well”  (B4, 2010. Here, it is assumed that male authors

238

would  “get”  boys  better  than  female  authors,  although  there  are  some  female  authors  who  
are up to the task. Similar to the previous examples, the  knowledge  of  boys’  
communicative behavior is assumed to be different from  that  of  knowledge  of  girls’.
Two  comments  refer  to  the  author’s  feeling  of  knowing  the  characters  well.  One  
female author, writing about doing historical research prior to writing a novel, states:
“The emotional aspects of the boys seemed to evolve as I did the research and outlined
the plot. By the time the actual writing started, I knew these boys pretty well”  (B3,  2009).
Another states,
There was this character in my head that I really loved—a youngest boy with a
whole bunch of brothers. And he was trying so hard to be a man among the men
of his family and  yet  he  wasn’t  really  like  them….I  had  to  write  the book to find
out what would happen to him. (B3, 2010)
This excerpt emphasizes the notion of a boy struggling to follow and fit in with his
brothers and fathers, and suggesting that their masculinity should be the characteristic
that binds them together. This assumption of a unifying masculinity, in this case focused
on the  presentation  of  the  boys’  “emotional  aspects”  in  the  process  of  the  author’s  
creating a convincing narrative, represents yet another way in which the segregation of
boys’  and  girls’  reading  materials  may  occur.  
5.3 Summary/Connection to Research Questions
5.3.1 Response to RQ1. In answer to RQ1 – What are the conceptions of
gendered literacy among literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians,
and teachers); creators of texts for children (published authors, editors, and published
illustrators); and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities? – the
conceptions of gendered literacy identified in this section, representing a range of
behaviors, are reviewed below:

239

1. Forty-two examples are of mothers' reading with their children or encouraging
their  children’s  reading,  compared  with  thirty-two examples  of  fathers’  
reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading.  
2. Twenty-seven  examples  discuss  boys’  love  of  reading and/or advanced
reading level, as compared with twenty-four for girls.
3. Bloggers and commenters perceive  that  boys  are  both  “reluctant”  and  less  
advanced readers. (librarians – 10, parents – 9, teachers – 7, author – 1, adults
of undetermined role – 1, children – 1) (29)
4. Educators perceive that books and reading are unwelcoming to boys.
(librarians – 11, parents – 3) (14)
5. Parents perceive that there are not enough "boy books" available. (13)
6. Educators perceive that gendered literacy is a biological phenomenon, the
result of essential, cognitive differences between males and females. (parents
– 11, educator of undetermined type – 1) (12)
7. Female authors and educators represented in the data discuss the integrity of
female  authors’  writing the voices of male protagonists. (authors – 7,
librarians – 2, parents – 1) (10)
Considering the overall picture for the sub-claims detailed above, the data
examined presents slightly more evidence of mothers’ involvement in their children’s  
reading  than  fathers’,  but the disparity is small. Moreover, there are roughly equal
numbers of examples of boys’  reading  in comparison to girls’  reading.  However,  
perceptions that boys dislike reading and that there are not enough materials available
that  are  suitable  for  boys’ reading  abound.  Also,  adding  to  the  perception  of  boys’  books  

240

as  distinct  from  girls’  books  is  commentary  surrounding  female  authors’  ability  to  write  a  
credible male voice.
5.3.2 Response to RQ2. A response to RQ2 – How do the conceptions of
gendered literacy identified through the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators
of texts for children, and children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions
identified in the literature review?) – first requires a review of the theoretical conceptions
of gendered literacy identified in the literature review:
1. Gendered literacy as performed by multiple actors, including children and
young adults, literacy educators, and those in the publishing industry.
2. Gendered literacy as a quantifiable achievement gap between male and female
students.
3. Gendered literacy as the result of biologically-based cognitive differences
between males and females.
4. Gendered literacy as the remnant of an historically gendered educational
system (in the U.S.).
Comparing the theoretical conceptions listed above to the sub-claims described in this
section, most of the sub-claims exemplify #1 (gendered literacy as performed by multiple
actors). However, B4  blogger’s  comment  here  also  speaks  to  #4, gendered literacy as the
remnant of the historically gendered educational system (in the U.S.):
What Does It Mean to Be a Boy? In truth, I have (of course) no answer to the
question in my headline. But it's something I think about, in all sorts of ways: life,
school, literature. Many of the things I love seem...inhospitable to boys. I see my
girls in school, watch them thrive, and wonder at the extent to which school
(especially elementary school, with its focus on behaving yourself and being
orderly) seems to be tough on boys. (B4, 2011)

241

This comment refers to the perception of school as a feminine domain and the behaviors
associated with femininity that the school environment supposedly fosters, including
sitting still and behaving well. Such assumptions about school as a feminine environment
may stem from the historical predominance of female teachers in elementary education in
the U.S.
5.3.3 Response to RQ3. In response to RQ3 – What similarities and differences,
if any, are represented in conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators
(parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for children
(published authors, editors, and published illustrators); and, children/young adults, as
represented in their blogging activities? – based on the sub-claims for this section
(detailed above), perceptions of  boys’  attitudes  toward  reading  and  literacy may be
compared  with  boys’  expressed  attitudes. For example, two sub-claims deal with
educators’  perceptions:
1. Sub-Claim 3: Bloggers and commenters perceive  that  boys  are  both  “reluctant”  
and less advanced readers. (librarians – 10, parents – 9, teachers – 7, author – 1,
adults of undetermined role – 1, children – 1) (29)
2. Sub-Claim 4: Educators perceive that books and reading are unwelcoming to
boys. (librarians – 11, parents – 3) (14)
In  contrast  to  these  examples  relating  to  educators’  perceptions  of  boys’  reading  and  the  
“unwelcoming”  social  climate  surrounding  boys’  reading, 27 examples relate to boys’  
expressed love of reading and/or advanced reading level. Moreover, a code titled “boys’  
expressed  dislike  of  literacy  activities”  was  part  of the original coding scheme, but due to
having nine or fewer examples, it is not discussed in depth here. However, four of the

242

examples are notable in that they are ones in which either a boy describes himself or a
boy’s  relative  (in  two  cases,  a parent, and in one case, a sister) describes him as not liking
to read but then adds exceptions to suggest  that  the  “reluctant”  reader label is incorrect.
For instance, B1 blogger  says  of  her  brother:  “Gary Paulsen has a reputation of being an
author for boys. In fact, my brother is a big fan of Lawn Boy (even though he really
doesn't  like  to  read)”  (2011).  Similarly,  a  parent  describes  a  son  as  follows:
He has a harder time staying engaged when he is reading. We read out loud every
day and he loves it, but is not as comfortable reading himself. He will pick up
Captain Underpants (read an entire one yesterday morning before getting out of
bed, first book all the way through on his own in one sitting ) and likes funny
stories. He  loved  Judy  Bloom’s  Superfudge series too, but we read that series out
loud. (B4, 2010)
In  each  of  these  examples,  despite  the  sister  and  parent’s  mentioning  instances  in  which  
the boy referred to has enjoyed reading, they insist on communicating the perception that
a boy dislikes and, in the second excerpt, has difficulty with reading.
For Sub-Claims 3 (relating to the perception that boys are  “reluctant”  and  less  
advanced readers) and 4 (the perception that books and reading are unwelcoming to boys),
librarians’  perspectives  are dominant. One perspective on gendered literacy unique to
parents in terms of the data sampled is  the  perception  that  there  are  not  enough  “boy  
books.” Parents are also prominent among examples for Sub-Claim 3 (perception that
boys  are  “reluctant”  and  less  advanced readers).
In reviewing the coding of the data, it was apparent that incidences of fathers’  
reading with children had been neglected because of the original creation of multiple
categories. One example, which originally had been categorized under  “Male  authors  
who  are  fathers  discuss  their  involvement  in  their  children’s  literacy  and  work/parenting  
balance,” points out a book series as being appropriate for boys and mentions the

243

blogger’s  intention  to  read  the  series  and  then  read  them  with  his son (B17, 2008). This
example was later included in the larger category of fathers’  reading  with  their  children  
or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading. Moreover, B12 blogger is a homeschooling
father/illustrator whose entire blog focuses on his sharing books with his own children,
and these examples had been coded under other categories. Later, they were also
categorized as fathers’  reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading.
However, among the data sampled, mothers (42 examples) are still more prominent than
fathers (30 examples) in terms of reading with their children or encouraging their
children’s  reading.  Even for Sub-Claim 2 – Twenty-seven  examples  discuss  boys’  love  of  
reading and/or advanced reading level, as compared with twenty-four for girls – mothers
play  a  prominent  role  in  boys’  reading,  as  eleven  of  the  examples  relate to mothers’
reading with sons.
5.3.4 Response to RQ4. RQ4 asks: What patterns, if any, of resistance to the
dominant conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed?
In terms of the sub-claims discussed in this section, Sub-Claim 2, which refers to boys’  
love of reading and/or advanced reading level, was originally labelled as a counter-claim,
but since there are more examples of  boys’  than girls’  expressed  love  of  reading  and/or  
advanced reading level (24), it was later combined with the sub-claim  relating  to  girls’  
love of reading, presenting a comparison, as follows: Twenty-seven examples discuss
boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  advanced  reading  level,  as  compared  with  twenty-four for
girls. Therefore, although boys’  love  of  reading  and/or  advanced  reading  level may be
considered a counter claim in relation to the other codes relating to societal perceptions of

244

boys’  literacy,  in  terms  of  actual  numbers  of  examples  among  the  data  sampled,  it  is  more
normative than resistant.

245

CHAPTER 6 GENDERED READING PREFERENCES
6.1 Claim  3  Boys’  and  Girls’  Gendered  Reading  Preferences
Gendered reading preferences,  in  terms  of  boys’  and  girls’  expressed  differing  
reading preferences, are third most prominent among the conceptions of gendered literacy
evident in the data – 123 total incidences. Two sub-claims relating  to  boys’  and  girls’  
gendered reading preferences can be made about the data coded according to this larger
category. Resistance to these claims is found in the form of the instances in which
children express resistant (that is, not conforming to preferences that would be considered
gender-normative) reading preferences and in which certain titles and series are
mentioned as appealing to both girls and boys.
Table 9
Claim  3,  Boys’  and  Girls’  Gendered  Reading  Preferences – Sub-Claims and Counter
Claims
Sub-Claim/Counter Claim

Incidences

1. In sixty-seven examples, girls’  reading  preferences match what are
perceived to be traditional girl-preferred text types (stories with female
protagonists, mermaid-themed fiction, books with pink covers and/or
pink illustrations, horse-themed fiction, realistic fiction, non-fiction in
narrative form, romance, and princess-themed fiction).
2. In fifty-six examples, boys’  reading preferences match what are
perceived to be traditional boy-preferred text types (including stories
with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science fiction,
adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring
vehicles, and magazines).
Counter Claim A: Children’s  resistant  – that is, not conforming to
what would be considered gender-normative preferences (as
described in Sub-Claims 1-2 above) – reading preferences are
evident.
Counter Claim B: Specific children’s  books  and  series  are reported
to appeal to both boys and girls. (children/young adults – 14,
librarians – 5, parents – 5, adults of undetermined role – 3, teachers
– 2)

6.2 Discussion of Sub-Claims and Counter Claims
6.2.1 Sub-Claim 1: Girls’ reading preferences matching traditional
perceptions. In sixty-seven examples, girls’  reading  preferences match what are
perceived to be traditional girl-preferred text types (stories with female protagonists,
mermaid-themed fiction, books with pink covers and/or pink illustrations, horse-themed
fiction, realistic fiction, non-fiction in narrative form, romance, and princess-themed
fiction). The number of examples listed below totals more than 67 because some
examples fit two or more categories.
The text types can be divided as follows:
Female protagonists (23)
Mermaid-themed fiction (13) (note: this includes some examples of perceived
interest)
Pink covers or illustrations (13) (note: this includes some examples of
perceived interest)
Horse-themed fiction (10) (note: this includes some examples of perceived
interest)
Realistic fiction (10)
Non-fiction in narrative form (2)
Romance (2)
Princess (2) (note: this section  discusses  only  examples  which  refer  to  girls’  
expressed interests; other examples which refer to perceived preferences for
these texts are discussed in the section on Claim 1 (gendered literacy

247

preferences, in terms of educators’  perceptions  of  boys’  reading  preferences
and labeling  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books).
6.2.1.1 Female protagonists. (23) Most of the posts and/or comments mentioning
girls’  favoring  stories  with  female  protagonists are authored by children and young adults
(16) because the main purpose of two of the blogs from which data are sampled – B3 and
B8 – is to publish reviews written by young people. The male public librarians (youth
services) who are the main authors of those  blogs  frequently  post  children’s  reviews  of  
reading materials sent to them by e-mail. The other posts and comments represent the
perspectives of parents (2), teachers (1), librarians (2), an author, and an editor. All of the
posts and comments, even if not written by children or young adults, represent the
perspectives of girls in relation to their reading preferences (for  example,  a  daughter’s  
reading preference described by her mother). Overall, the main theme of the comments is
girls’ preference for fictional female protagonists.
Among the 23 comments  relating  to  girls’  interest in stories with female
protagonists and the 10 comments referring to realistic fiction, 6 are reviews of a series
called Dork Diaries (Rachel Renee Russell) incorporating female protagonists and
realistic fiction. Two girl readers liken the series to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series (Jeff
Kinney) but with a female protagonist, as in:
I really like Dork Diaries. It's a GREAT BOOK! [emphasis in original] I like it
because it's like Diary of a Wimpy Kid and I like that. It's about a girl named
Nikki Maxwell who goes to a new school. There is a mean girl named
Makenzie, the most popular girl in the school. She has to be at three places at
once because she promised everyone she would be there. She meets two friends,
Chole [sic] and Zoe. (B3, 2011)
Dork Diaries, with a female protagonist, cast of female characters and plots involving
popularity contests, conflicts between friends, and social intrigue, is a girl-favored series,

248

as there were no reviews of this series written by boys in the data collected from 2
librarian blogs (B3 and B8) soliciting reviews from young people. Diary of a Wimpy Kid,
in contrast, garners three reviews by girls (on B3) as well as by boys (although still many
more written by boys). The notion that girls are less reluctant to read a book featuring a
male protagonist than boys to read a book featuring a female protagonist is upheld, at
least in the sample data for these two series, Dork Diaries and Diary of a Wimpy Kid,
from  two  blogs  featuring  young  people’s  book  reviews.
Four  of  the  23  comments  relating  to  girls’  preference  for  female  protagonists  refer
to the Junie B. Jones (Barbara Park) series, early readers with a female protagonist,
following  Junie’s  life  from  kindergarten  through  first  grade.  This  popular  series,  like  
Dork Diaries, also does not have any reviews by boys in the data collected from B3, a
blog soliciting reviews from young people (data collected from B8, the other blog posting
reviews by young people, contains no reviews of Junie B. Jones).
A reference to Junie B. Jones written by a mother and posted on B4 depicts the
series as an iconic girl-preferred text in the context of a school-based book club:
I volunteer  in  my  kids’  school  and  am  leading  a  book  group  this  year….There is a
mixture of girls and boys and a variety of opinions about what makes a book
great. All the kids are proficient readers who are able to read a chapter or 2 on
their own during the week and come to group ready to discuss what they
read. The  problem  is  that  we  don’t  know what to read next. The girls want Junie B.
Jones, the boys want Diary of A Wimpy Kid, and the teachers want something that
will interest and challenge the kids but that isn’t  something  they  would  normally  
read in their free time. (B4, 2010)
In  this  excerpt,  the  mother’s  description  of  the  quest  for  a  suitable  reading  choice  for  the  
book  club  clearly  differentiates  the  girls’  reading  preferences from  the  boys’,  
characterizing the girls as asking for the Junie B. Jones series (mentioned above as a girlpreferred series) and the boys as asking for Diary of a Wimpy Kid (also discussed in

249

educators’  perceptions  of  children’s  literacy  preferences as an “iconic boy-preferred”
series) to be chosen.
6.2.1.2 Mermaid-themed fiction. (13) Comments relating to books about
mermaids appealing to girls, including both perceptions and expressed interest, are found
in three of the twenty-three blogs. The perception that mermaid books are most
appropriate for girls is apparent in  the  data,  as  in  this  female  librarian  blogger’s  review  of  
a  book  from  B22:  “A beautiful, summery read for girls is the Emily Windsnap series by
Liz Kessler. Emily is an average English girl who one day discovers that she is half
mermaid! This leads to gorgeous undersea discoveries and adventures along with a fair
bit of drama  with  her  family  and  friends”  (B22,  2010). The review specifies that this is a
book  “for  girls.”  
The introduction to an interview with the female author/illustrator of B16,
describing  her  children’s  book  about  the  annual  artists’  mermaid  parade  in  Brooklyn,  
New York City (the interview is posted on her blog), presents the perception that
mermaids appeal to girls as universal:
What little girl doesn't love mermaids!...Every year thousands of spectators watch
this art parade in Coney Island. This book turns the spectacle into a dreamy
backdrop for a little girl's fantasy. The award-winning book is stuffed with
colorful gouache illustrations and sure to delight fanciful girls. (B16, 2009)
The  interviewer  uses  the  word  “girl”  three  times  in  this  short  excerpt,  emphasizing  that  
girls  are  the  appropriate,  and  possibly,  only,  audience  for  the  author/illustrator’s  new  
book.  Later,  in  the  actual  interview,  when  asked,  “why do you think little girls love
mermaids?”  the  author/ illustrator  replies,  “Mermaids are magical, shiny and beautiful.
They spark the imagination. They stretch the boundaries of reality which children do
quite  naturally….I think mermaids help little girls feel their gorgeous femaleness, as well

250

as feel smart and strong (B16, 2009). The author/illustrator (B16 blogger) introduces a
feminist  perspective  in  her  assertion  that  mermaids  “spark  imagination”  and  help  girls  
“feel  smart  and  strong,”  but  still  echoes  the  interviewer’s  perception  that  the  key  audience  
for  her  illustrated  book  is  “little  girls.”  
The young adult blogger of B2 describes a trilogy about mermaids she loved as a
child and her determined quest to find it as an adult, when she had forgotten the title.
Although she remembered the name of the main character and the ending, the librarians
were unable to help her. Her quest finally ends when she is sent one of the books she
loved as the reward in a contest held by an author of young adult literature. In reflecting
on the experience of reading the book, she notes that, as the first book about mermaids
that she had ever read, it led to a lifelong obsession with books about mermaids (B2,
2010).
The  comments  posted  to  B2  in  response  to  the  blogger’s  story  of  the first book
about mermaids she ever read indicate that mermaids are also loved by many of the
female readers of her blog. Eight comments refer to enjoying books about mermaids.
Some of the comments include recommendations for further reading. In one response, the
commenter indicates a willingness to read the books recommended by B2 blogger,
confirms her shared interest in books about mermaids, and ends by recommending other
books about mermaids. In this sense, the recommendation process reinforces the
perception that mermaids are a girl-preferred theme in fiction (B2, 2010).
6.2.1.3 Pink covers or illustrations. (13) Data categorized according to this code
are from nine of the twenty-three blogs, and the perspectives of librarians (4 comments)
and parents (3 comments) are best represented among these statements relating to the

251

perception that books with pink covers or illustrations appeal to girls. A sub-theme of
these comments is expression of resigned disgust with the idea that girls are attracted to
the pink. Three comments  refer  to  girls’  expressed  preference  for  pink  books.  
B7 blogger, a female librarian (youth collection specialist for a major
Northeastern public library), in reviewing the Fancy Nancy (Jane  O’Connor  and  Robin  
Preiss Glasser) series, takes up the sub-theme of resigned disgust toward pink covers. She
says that as a librarian, her initial reaction to the pink covers is that, like similar pink
books of little substance, they’re  designed  simply  to trick girls into reading them.
However, upon actually reading the series, B7 blogger realizes the books are somewhat
good (B7, 2013). Although she half-heartedly recommends Fancy Nancy, she also
expresses  dismay  that  the  series’  pink  covers  will  attract  girls’  attention  and that many
books with pink covers are of low quality. She thereby resists the association of the pink
covers with girls but also assumes that girls will want to read the Fancy Nancy books
because of the pink covers.
In a similar vein, a mother explores her dissatisfaction with the pink, glittery
covers of the books in the fairy series her son wanted to read as a five-year-old but then
hid after realizing that he might be made fun of for reading them. She expresses
frustration  that  the  books’  pink  packaging  may  entice  only  girls  to  read  the  books  (B21,
2012). She resists the idea that only girls should want to read a book with a pink cover;
however, she also  assumes,  despite  her  son’s  preference  for  the  book  as  evidence to the
contrary, that the pink will only appeal to girls. A comment by B7 blogger, the female
public librarian just mentioned, in an interview, also supports the idea that some boys will
indeed  read  this  type  of  book:  “... I had a boy come up once and he was like I want all

252

your fairy books.…So that's the thing. You make all these assumptions and a kid just
walks up  and  blows  them  all  to  pieces”  (Interview 1 transcript, 2013).
Another  mother,  a  commenter  on  B4,  describes  her  daughter’s  affinity  for  pink  
books and her parenting strategy for steering her daughter away from them:
I try to let her love pink glitter and purple (drowning victim) lipstick and
everything covered in Princesses and have faith that my smart, savvy little girl
will grow out of it just like I did. But I also try to expose her to anything I can that
will speed that growing out of it process up some. (B4, 2009)
This  mother  treats  her  daughter’s  infatuation  with  pink  princess  books  (this excerpt is
thereby counted as a reference  to  both  “pink”  and  “princess”) as a phase soon to be
grown  “out  of,”  while  at  the  same time aggressively providing her with other reading
materials  to  encourage  distance  from  what  she  refers  to  as  “that miserable pink mess”  (B4,
2009).
A less resistant attitude is taken by a blogger who works as a librarian (though she
does not have the MLS), as she reviews the Babymouse series: “Babymouse, by Jennifer
Holm, is almost irresistible to girls, with its cute – but not cutesy - black and white and
pink  art”  (B22, 2012). Comments by teachers that fit this code reiterate the perception
that pink book covers and illustrations appeal to girls, for example, when B6 blogger
labels a book displaying the title in pink letters as most appropriate for tween girls,
adding that he suspects boys will not want to be seen with a book with pink (B6, 2011).
B12 blogger, an author/illustrator and homeschooling dad, also perceives the
Babymouse series as appropriate for girls but faces resistance from his older son. He asks
his children “Who likes the Babymouse series?”  and all of the children reply that they
like  it,  but  the  father  does  not  hear  his  son’s  answer,  so  he  asks  him  specifically.  His  son  
replies, and the father, son, and one of the daughters continue the dialogue as follows:

253

Son (age 10): I said "me." You just couldn't hear me over them.
Dad: So it's okay with you that Babymouse is a girl. And that the books are pink?
Son: I don't care about that.
Dad: You're still cool? You're still macho?
Daughter: There IS one that is not pink. It's a Halloween Babymouse. Babymouse,
Monstermash. It's ORANGE! If you want to get a boy started on the series, read
Monstermash to him first. Get him started on the orange one and then move to
pink. Next read Babymouse, Puppy Love because that's hilarious. (B12, 2009)
In  this  example,  the  father’s  expectation  that  the  series  is  more  suitable  for  girls  because  
the protagonist is female and the covers are pink is quickly resisted by his son who, in
response  to  his  father’s  heckling, states:  “I  don't  care  about  that.”  This example is also
coded  as  “children’s  expressed  resistant  reading preferences”  because  in  this  case,  the  son  
defies  the  father’s  expectation  that  he  should  dislike  the  series  because  the  main  character,  
Babymouse, is a girl. Moreover, the sister supports her brother by suggesting that boys
might indeed be interested in the series. However, she does suggest that boys start with
the Halloween-themed book in the series with an orange, rather than pink, cover.
Moreover, when her father (B12 blogger) asks her why the Babymouse series is her
favorite,  she  replies,  “Because she's hilarious. And she's pink. And she's cute. And her
books  are  really,  really  good,”  (B12, 2009) thereby declaring her own preference for the
pink cover. B12 blogger also color-codes  the  text  for  his  children’s  names  (the terms
“daughter”  and  “son”  were  substituted  for  their  names  in  the  excerpt  above)  on the blog
according to gendered norms, highlighting the names of his daughters with pink and
orange  and  his  son’s  name  in  blue.  
An interview with B7 blogger indicates that the son of B12 blogger is not alone,
among boys, in his enjoyment of the Babymouse series. As part of her response to a
question  about  which  themes  in  children’s  literature  “would be considered more
appropriate for girls and which ones would be considered more appropriate for boys”  she  

254

describes the Babymouse series, saying:  “…Jenny Holm does the Babymouse books,
which are universally pink. Some of them are orange and slightly other colors, but um
mostly they're pink and she has a lot of boy fans and she talks about that”  (Interview 1
transcript, 2013). Moreover, B7 blogger mentions the series as a counter-example to
demonstrate how absurd (in her opinion) it is that not one of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid
books (earlier described in the findings as an “iconic  boy”  series) has been published with
a  pink  cover.  She  laments  that,  despite  her  “rallying  for  pink,”  the  Valentine’s  Day  theme  
of the most recent book in the series, and her reassurances to people she knows in
publishing  that  “it's the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The boys are going to pick up a pink
book. They're going to be walking  around  with  a  pink  book,”  (Interview  1 transcript,
2013), it was decided to make the cover brown because the people she talked to felt that
“no boy  will  pick  up  a  pink  book”  (Interview 1 transcript, 2013). The publisher thereby,
ignoring  the  advice  of  a  children’s  literature  expert  that  the  popularity of the series will
cancel out the taboo represented by a pink cover, produces the book with a brown cover.
In doing so, the publisher reinforces the normative perception that boys will not read a
book with a pink cover.
6.2.1.4 Horse-themed fiction. (10) References to books about horses appealing to
girls span four of the twenty-three blogs from which data are sampled and include both
perceptions and expressed interest. Seven comments are written by mothers in response
to  B4  blogger’s  blog  post  entitled,  “We  Recommend:  Horse  Books  for  Girls”  (2011)  
requesting suggestions  for  books  about  horses  and  refer  to  either  the  mothers’  childhood  
love  of  horse  books  or  their  own  daughters’  love  of  horse  books.  For  example,  “I can't

255

remember if King of the Wind has any outright cruelty or death in it, but I do remember
loving this  book  when  I  was  a  girl,”  (B4,  2011)  and,  
My 9 yo daughter is horse crazy and loved all of the Misty of Chincoteague books
as well. There is also a historical fiction series called Horse Diaries (by various
authors...the first title is Horse Diaries #1: Elska) that are written in the voice of
the horse and are set in different time periods. The protagonists are young girls
and the girls and horses are quite heroic. (B4, 2011)
Here, the mother mentions two horse-themed  series  that  her  “horse  crazy”  daughter has
enjoyed reading and describes why she perceives the Horse Diaries series to be so
appealing:  the  stories,  narrated  by  horses,  are  about  “heroic”  girls  and  horses.
Other comments for this code are written by a teacher, a school librarian, and an
author. The comment by the male teacher clearly defines the assumed audience for a
horse book he reviews on the blog as 10-12-year-old girls (B6, 2011). Another comment
by  a  male  school  librarian  defines  a  reviewed  book’s  audience  in  the  same  way. He
suggests the Breyer Stablemates series as a high interest series that will appeal to girls
and circulate well. The review is included as part of a post describing the top ten
circulated books for his school library for the 2010-2011 school year (B10, 2011). The
comments by a female author, excerpted from an interview with her by B2 blogger,
discuss her childhood obsession with horseback riding. Since she was from a large family
and her parents did not have extra money for riding lessons, she saved up her own gift
money to pay for riding lessons. However, she did not learn to ride well until the age of
fifty, when her husband gave her the birthday present of riding lessons. She took lessons
alongside little girls, feeling clumsy and inadequate at first, but gradually gaining skill.
She also describes how her husband began horseback riding because she spent so much

256

time riding and he wanted to spend time with her. Her novel about centaurs was inspired
by her love of horses (B2, 2012).
6.2.1.5 Realistic fiction. (10) Of the ten examples referring to realistic fiction, one
is by a mother, one is by an editor, one is by an author, one is by a librarian, and six are
by girls. Six of the ten refer to the series Dork Diaries (as mentioned above), and two
refer  to  Phyllis  Reynolds  Naylor’s  Alice series. One of the comments relating to the Alice
series is written by a girl reader of the series and the other is written by the author herself
reflecting on letters she has received from readers – letters which she claims guide her
writing of the series. The  girl  reader’s  enthusiastic  review  of  one  of  the  books  in  the  
series  reads,  “I wrote a review on this book because it is my favorite book. I love this
book because it is reality, adventure, and mystery all in one”  (B3,  2012).  She  describes  
the book as  her  favorite  and  pinpoints  the  representations  of  “reality”  as  one  of  the  most  
important aspects. The other comment on the Alice series is excerpted from a Washington
Post interview with the author (posted by B9 blogger), Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, and
talks about how fan mail (about 20 – 30 letters per day) guides her writing of the series in
that it helps her know what her young readers are worried about and interested in reading
about. She describes how these fans, the girls who have read the Alice books, identify
with or otherwise respond to the realism of the series by divulging personal (relationshipfocused) secrets in the letters they write to her (B9, 2006).
6.2.1.6 Non-fiction in narrative form. (2) Two comments (categorized  under  girls’  
reading preferences matching traditionally girl-preferred text types) refer to a preference
for non-fiction in the form of narrative. B5 blogger, a female teacher recounts her
childhood reading preferences:  “I have to confess to having been a narrative girl — be it

257

Helen Keller’s  autobiography,  a  book  on  Albert  Schweitzer,  or  one  of  those  Childhood of
Famous Americans (don’t  worry,  I  know  they  are  faction)  — I liked my facts presented
as story.”  B5  blogger’s  statement is similar to the following comment from B4:
I spent most of my life convinced that I hated nonfiction--because all it was, was
pages and pages of diagrams or dates or drawings of airplanes, right? No, that's
just what the kid in front of my [sic]  in  all  my  classes…read. He was a totally
stereotypical boy reader, and I saw what he read and wanted no part of it. I still
don't like things that read like textbooks, but memoirs, histories, those kinds of
things, I love. (B4, 2010)
B4 commenter, a female, shares  B5  blogger’s  preference for narrative forms of nonfiction. Moreover, she labels the non-fiction reference-type reading choices of the boy
whose desk was in front of hers in grade school “stereotypical.”
6.2.1.7 Romance. (2) Only two specific references to romance were found in the
data. One of the two references to romance is by an editorial intern for a major literary
magazine consulted by librarians and teachers for reviews of literature for young people,
who, in a post on B21, recalls her reading preferences of chick lit and realistic coming-ofage novels. Her recollections focus on the angst of teenage love depicted in the novels
she read and the way in which she could connect to the female protagonists of the stories
(B21, 2011).
The other comment referring to romance is by a female teacher, commenting on
B6  in  response  to  the  blogger’s  (a male teacher) review of the young adult series, I'd Tell
You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You (Ally Carter), which features a female
protagonist and other female characters from an all-girls prep school (actually a school
for CIA spy training), and romance. The teacher states that the girls at the junior high
where she works always have the books in the series, which she describes as light in tone
but smart, checked out of the library (B6, 2010). The  teacher’s  comment  thereby  

258

confirms  the  male  teacher’s  assessment  of  the  appropriate audience for the eloquent and
engaging series as 12-year-old girls (B6, 2010).
6.2.1.8 Princess-themed fiction. (1) The other references to princess-themed texts
found in the data sampled are discussed in the section on Claim 1: Gendered reading
preferences,  in  terms  of  educators’  perceptions  of  boys’  reading  preferences and labeling
of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books. The one reference to a princess-themed  text  describing  a  girl’s  
expressed  interest  is  the  following  comment  by  a  mother  describing  her  daughter’s  
preference for princess-themed  texts:  “For my girly-girl daughter, sometimes that means
a slew of pink princess chapter books that give me migraines. I don't relate to them, but
she  does”  (B4,  2012).  In  this  example,  the  mother  pinpoints  “pink  princess  chapter  books”  
as  her  daughter’s,  whom  she  describes  as  stereotypically  “girly,”  preference.  Moreover,
the  hyperbolic  “girly-girl”  label  reinforces the notion of feminine identity forming in
childhood and  the  way  in  which  that  identity  is  associated  with  “pink”  and  “princess.”
6.2.2 Sub-Claim 2: Boys’  expressed  reading  preferences matching traditional
perceptions. In fifty-six examples, boys’  reading preferences match what are perceived
to be traditional boy-preferred text types (including stories with male protagonists,
comics, graphic novels, science fiction, adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross
humor, stories featuring vehicles, and magazines).
In this section, examples mentioning “iconic boy” texts (Captain Underpants,
Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Percy Jackson) are included only if they also mention other
text types (of those listed above), and some of the examples fit into more than one
category.  Of  the  examples  referring  to  boys’  reading  preferences matching traditional
boy-preferred text types, the greatest number (28) refer to a preference for male

259

protagonists (i.e., mentioning reading books with male protagonists, or, in the case of one
blog,  depict  a  boy  reader’s  drawings  of  male  protagonists).  A  typical  review  written  by  a  
boy reader (posted on B3) reads:
A boy finds that he has a super power. He can run so fast that you can hardly see
him. But when the government and several companies all owned by the same
villain find out about his powers, the family shuts themselves in. But that won't
stop the villain from getting his way. When he captures the parents, the boy must
rescue them from the villain's evil clutches. The villain figures out how to take
his powers away and use them for a super-powered army. Can the boy get his
powers back, rescue his parents, and defeat the villain? (B3, 2012)
In this example, the boy reader focuses on the male  protagonist’s  superpowers and heroic
actions, including saving his parents from and defeating a dictator/mogul villain (owns
the government and businesses), throughout the review.
Also  included  in  the  data  are  comments  by  parents  referring  to  their  sons’  
preference for stories with male protagonists. For instance, a mother here credits a series
with a male protagonist (along with gross humor) with helping her son develop an
interest in  reading:  “My eight year old loves the series Horrid Henry which I believe I
discovered on this blog. Amazing breakthroughs with that!”  (B4,  2010).
In  terms  of  boys’  reading  preferences, the second most commonly mentioned
preference is for comics. For instance, B22 blogger (public librarian/mother) here
describes  her  sons’  reading  preferences:  “They  are  also  huge  fans  of  the  Marvel  
comics Genext and Runaways. Also Axe Cop”  (B22,  2012).  In another example, B20
blogger, a male book designer/editor, describes his own preference for comics as a teen
and  his  connecting  that  preference  to  an  editorial  project:  “Sidekicks, here is a project that
I thought would be easy. After all its [sic] comics related and I spent a good portion of
my high school career face  down  in  them  (nerd!)….Wrong”  (B20,  2011).  In  a  similar  

260

example, a male public librarian (youth services) recalls purchasing superhero comics as
a boy: “When I was a kid comics cost 25 cents and one of the comics I bought every
month was called World's Finest and it stared [sic]  Batman  and  Superman”  (B8,  2011).  
As comics were once quite inexpensive, it makes sense that they were a popular reading
material for young people; as to why boys particularly enjoyed them is less clear, except
to say that the subject matter – superheroes, fighting villains and saving the innocent with
the help of superpowers – has been constructed as masculine. Although the cost of
comics has risen substantially over the years, it remains a favored text type. B3 blogger,
also a male public librarian (youth services), while interviewing a male author (and
former writer for Cartoon Network and Disney) for the blog, asks the author about his
reading of comics as a child:
Who was your favorite comic character when you were a boy? Do you have a
favorite character now?
Who was my favorite comix [sic] character as a boy - Hmmm. Truth is I was
never really a super-hero kind of comics reader (though that would be the cool
answer!). I did love Peanuts and reading the Sunday Comics pages was a ritual
for me. These days I really like Pearls Before Swine because the characters are so
great... and because my son, who also likes to make cartoons is a big fan. (B3,
2008)
The exchange between the librarian and the author demonstrates the following: the
librarian’s  presumption  that  the  male  author  would  have  enjoyed  reading  comics  as  a  
child;;  the  author’s  expressed  preference  for  newspaper  comics  (including  Peanuts) as a
boy and simultaneous acknowledgement that  he  “should”  have  enjoyed  superhero  comics  
(in  replying,  “that  would  be  the  cool  answer!”);;  and,  the  author’s  own  son’s  preference  
for comics, including both reading them and drawing them.
Expressed preference for other traditionally boy-preferred text types are
mentioned in the data in this order: graphic novels (7), science fiction (6), adventure (5),

261

non-fiction (5), sports (5), fantasy (2), gross humor (2 – both refer to Horrid Henry, one
to both Horrid Henry and Captain Underpants), vehicles (2), and magazines (1). Some of
the examples counted among these referenced more than one category.
A concept introduced in the section on educators’  perceptions  of  children’s  
reading preferences –institutional and social biases against non-fiction – is also evident in
comments referring to preferences for non-fiction. In  the  following  example,  a  mother’s  
comment recognizes the bias against non-fiction (coupled with the elevation of story),
saying, “My 5 year old boy loves the Roald Dahl stories for kids, as well as anything
factual (book about volcanoes, animals, etc... I know these are not story books, but
anything a kid likes reading is good, no?)”  (B4,  2010). Her questioning at the end is also
resistant,  implying  that  her  son’s  reading  of  non-fiction is fine by her, although he is not
reading the preferred narrative fiction.
In  contrast,  in  another  case,  a  mother’s  personal  bias  matches  the  institutional  bias  
against non-fiction:  “My son (7 – about to be 8) was not interested in reading. What
books he brought home from the library were non-fiction – generally about animals. He
has  always  loved  "fact"  books”  (B4,  2012).  The  mother  does  not  count  her  son’s  reading  
of non-fiction as reading.
6.2.3 Counter claim A:  Children’s  resistant  reading preferences. Children’s  
expressions of resistant – that is, not conforming to what would be considered gendernormative preferences (as described in the sub-claims above) – reading preferences are
evident (43). Of the resistant examples, 24 reference resistant preferences expressed by
males, 17 reference resistant preferences expressed by females, and 2 refer to both
females and males. Eight of the 43 total examples refer to adults reflecting on their

262

resistant reading choices as children. Six of the 43 examples are parents describing their
daughters’  resistant  reading  preferences.  Of  those,  three  are  by  mothers,  one is by a father,
and for two, there is no definite indication as to whether the parent is a mother or father.
Eleven of the 43 examples  are  parents  describing  their  sons’ resistant reading preferences,
and all eleven are written by mothers. Nine of the 43 examples are written by children
(one is a dialogue among a father, son, and two daughters, but the resistant perspective is
that of the son), and of those, five are written by males and four by females.
An example of a parent writing about  a  daughter  who  prefers  traditionally  “boy”  
books reads:
We have a 6-yo girl who is just as interested in books on football, soccer, the
vessels and characters of Star Wars and space in general than anything else. Other
favorites are Amelia Bedelia and Knuffle Bunny. So, in particular in our house the
concept that there are 'girl' books and 'boy' books is well, simply not true. (B4,
2010)
The  mother  comments  on  her  daughter’s  resistant  preference  for  books  about  sports  and  
science fiction – themes that are perceived to be boy-preferred. An example of a mother
writing about her 7-year-old son  who  enjoys  reading  traditionally  “girl”  books focuses
on his enjoyment of books and series with female protagonists, including Anne of Green
Gables, Betsy-Tacy, A Little Princess, and The Secret Garden (B21, 2012).
Some examples, like two by educators, a librarian and teacher, focus on a specific
text  in  order  to  illustrate  children’s resistant reading preferences. A female teacher here
refers to her experiences of using Alice in Wonderland as a curricular text: “Having
taught Alice for a billion years I can say with assurance that it is definitely not a girl book
in  the  sense…suggested. In my experience, boys tend to like it as much and even more
than  girls  in  my  classroom”  (B5, 2009). Her commentary focuses on the notion that

263

although Alice in Wonderland features a female protagonist, many of her male students
enjoy the story as much or more than the female students.
A male public librarian (youth services), writing about boys’  reading  choices,  
mentions boys’  reading Nancy Drew graphic novels as an example of a resistant reading
choice:
Another big myth is that guys won't read books with girls as main characters. I
know for a fact that's not true because some of you have written reviews and said
that you liked the book even though the main character was a girl. (I saw a couple
of guys today curl up in the library with Nancy Drew graphic novels!) What guys
want is a GOOD STORY [emphasis in original]. Give us that and we'll like it. (B3,
2009)
This example uses the Nancy Drew books in order to de-bunk  the  myth  of  boys’  refusal  
to read books with female protagonists, and it emphasizes  the  notion  of  “good”  stories  
superseding perceived gender-appropriateness of a book, a theme to be further discussed
below.
The two examples in this section referring to both boys and girls share a focus on
the notion that children respond best  to  books  that  are  “good”  rather  than  based  on  a  
perception of which sex is the appropriate audience for the book. For example, a mother,
writing about her experiences reading with her two sons and with other children, writes
that no child has ever told her that they did not like a book she had read with them based
on the fact that it was more appropriate for the opposite sex, and she claims that the most
important  thing  is  that  the  book  is  “good”  (B21, 2012).
Similarly, in reference to this post, a teacher/mother/grandmother writer
comments that  her  children  and  students  enjoyed  “good”  books,  and  she  chose  “good”  
books to read with them. Some of their favorite books had female protagonists, others
had male protagonists, and the sex of the protagonists did not much relate to whether

264

books were deemed favorites (B21, 2012). This example reiterates the idea introduced in
the  first  example  of  “good”  books  as  accessible to children of either sex. It is also clear
that in this  teacher’s estimation, normative perceptions of whether a book is for girls or
for boys is based primarily on the sex of the protagonist(s). In all of the examples
mentioned,  the  definition  of  a  “good”  book  is  ambiguous.  It  could  refer  to  the  quality  of  
the writing or to whether the story is sufficiently interesting. However, it is an important
descriptive umbrella term in that it is presented as a textual quality that supersedes
gender-appropriateness in terms of relevance to children.
Of the nine resistant  examples  representing  children’s actual voices, all nine are
book reviews. Four of the examples are coded as resistant because they represent
preferences for protagonists that are the opposite of the sex of the child reader. Of those
four examples, one is coded as resistant because it represents a girl expressing a
preference for a book with a male protagonist, while the other three are coded as resistant
because  they  represent  boys’  expressing  a  preference  for  a  book  with  a  female  
protagonist. For example, a boy reader writes of a book in the Sardine in Outer Space
series (Emmanuel Guibert): “Don't turn this book away Just because the main character is
a girl, [sic] this series is full of missing brains to scamcorders. when [sic] I read this book,
I was laughing all night”  (B3, 2008). Here, the male reader acknowledges the perception
that boys would not read the book because the protagonist is female and asks fellow male
readers to overlook that fact.
Four  of  the  nine  resistant  examples  representing  children’s  actual  voices  are  
coded as resistant because they represent resistant choices in terms of genre. Two of

265

those examples are girls reviewing non-fiction. For instance, in the following example, a
female reader reviews a work of non-fiction about pirates:
This book is awesome! It tells you all about the history of pirates. Discover the
unseen world of Pirates. The Punishments are listed too. There is a treasure map
where people think treasure is hidden. There [sic] weapons are listed. Here are
some weapons: Greanade [sic], ax, cutlass and pistol. (B3, 2011)
In this example, the female reader, a prolific reader and contributor of reviews to B3 (a
blog maintained by male public librarians focusing on boy readers but also accepting
reviews by girl readers) expresses high praise for a work of non-fiction and also discusses
the  pirates’  weapons.  
6.2.4 Counter claim: Gender-neutral children’s  books and series. (29)
Specific books and series are reported to appeal to both boys and girls; among the 29
examples, 14, although mostly written (or in one case, transcribed) by adults, represent
the perspectives of children. Of these 14, 12 are written by mothers giving the
perspectives of their own children or of other children with whom they have interacted.
For  instance,  one  is  written  by  a  mother  who  volunteers  at  her  children’s  school,  advising  
a book club:
There are 6 members of the group, all in second grade. There is a mixture of girls
and boys and a variety of opinions about what makes a book great….We will be
finishing our first book selection, The Boxcar Children, this month. None of the
kids  would  have  chosen  this  book  because  they  thought  it  looked  “boring,” but 3
chapters into it, they were all hooked. (B4, 2010)
This example is noteworthy in its mention of a book club as a potential space in which
gender barriers regarding reading preferences may be overcome. The other two examples
of  the  14  representing  children’s  perspectives  (although written by adults) are by a female
school librarian and a female teacher.

266

Four  of  the  29  examples  represent  mothers’  perspectives;;  three  are  written  by  
adult females of undetermined roles; two are by B10 blogger, a male school librarian;
two are by B6 blogger, a male teacher; and two represent the perspectives of female
public librarians. The examples representing the perspectives of adults are speculative,
for example, projecting that a book will be popular with both girls and boys, as when B10
blogger, a male school librarian, predicts that a particular title will attract the attention of
many children – both boys and girls (B10, 2012).
Other examples reflect on the popularity of certain titles in terms of their appeal
for  both  males  and  females.  For  instance,  a  mother  states:  “This must be one reason
(among many others) why Harry Potter was so popular: boys  and  girls  could  relate  to  it”  
(B4, 2010). One other example is by B2 blogger, a female young adult, who mentions a
novel that she and her younger brother had trouble sharing, each wanting to be the first to
read it (B2, 2007).
In terms of titles specifically referred to among the 29 examples, one mention was
made of the author Maurice Sendak (B4, 2010); additionally, one of his books, In the
Night Kitchen (B4, 2010), was mentioned in another comment. Both of these posts are
written  by  mothers  describing  their  children’s  preferences.  Two  comments  from  B4,  one  
by a mother and another by a female of undetermined role, refer to the works of Judy
Blume, especially to the Fudge series (B4, 2010).
From B4 also comes a post about the Warriors (Erin Hunter) fantasy series; B4
blogger,  after  describing  her  daughter  and  other  children’s  love  of  the  series  along  with  
her  own  distaste  of  the  series,  concludes  that  she  should  simply  accept  them  “because  if
they can reach through all the miles and pounds of bullshit that separate 10 year old boys

267

and girls from each other, then they  are  a  power  to  be  respected”  (B4,  2010).  A  
commenter  responds,  “Having worked in the kids room of a library till very recently, I
could find my way to the Warriors shelf with my eyes closed”  (B4,  2010),  supporting  B4  
blogger’s  claim  of  the  series’  popularity.
Brian  Jacques’  Redwall series is mentioned on two blogs. B9 blogger, a female
school librarian, notes children of both sexes in her description of the series. She says that
boys enjoy the books if they enjoy reading but the length of the books can scare off boys
who do not enjoy reading. She also notes that girls enjoy the books, and she was
acquainted with one girl who would not buy a purse unless the large hardcover version of
the book would fit in the purse (B9, 2006). B9 blogger, in this description, typifies boys
as reluctant readers, but describes the series as appealing to both male and female readers.
A mother commenting on B4 echoes,  “My own now adult daughter LOVED Redwall…”  
(B4, 2010).
Other series that are mentioned twice or more include the following:
Judy Moody (Megan McDonald, illus. Peter H. Reynolds), mentioned twice
(B4, 2010; B21, 2012)
The Hunger Games (B21, 2012; B4, 2010)
Beverly  Cleary’s  The Mouse and the Motorcycle (B4, 2010; B4, 2010), along
with one other title by Beverly Cleary, Beezus and Ramona (B21, 2012)
Judi  Barrett’s  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (B4, 2010), along with a
reference to Judi Barrett (B4, 2010)

268

Between the two counter claims explored in this section, the examples of resistance
number 72 altogether, and so represent a significant counterpoint to the 123 examples in
which children’s  gendered  reading  preferences  are  evident.  
6.3 Summary/Connection to Research Questions
6.3.1 Response to RQ1. What are the conceptions of gendered literacy among
literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of
texts for children (published authors, editors, and published illustrators); and,
children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities? To answer RQ1,
gendered reading preferences,  in  terms  of  girls’  (Section 6.2.1)  and  boys’  (Section 6.2.2)
gendered reading preferences, are the third most prominent among all the conceptions of
gendered literacy evident in the data. Of those reading preferences, girls’  expressed  
reading preferences matching what are perceived to be traditional girl-preferred text types
(stories with female protagonists, mermaid-themed fiction, books with pink covers and/or
pink illustrations, horse-themed fiction, realistic fiction, non-fiction in narrative form,
romance, and princess-themed fiction) (67 examples) are most  evident,  followed  by  boys’  
expressed reading preferences matching what are perceived to be traditional boypreferred text types (including stories with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels,
science fiction, adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring
vehicles, and magazines) (56 examples).
6.3.2 Responses to RQ2 and RQ4. RQ2: How do the conceptions of gendered
literacy identified through the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts
for children, and children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions identified
in the literature review? The examples of gendered reading preferences as expressed by

269

boys and girls fit with the first part of the literature-based conceptual model – 1)
gendered literacy as performed by multiple actors, including children and young adults,
literacy educators, and those in the publishing industry – and also align with the girls and
boys displaying differing reading preferences aspect of that concept discussed in the
literature review. The literature review (i.e. Topping & Renaissance Learning, 2012;
Moss, 2007; McKechnie, 2006; Merisuo-Storm, 2006) particularly documents  boys’  
expressed preference for comics, non-fiction, science fiction, and sports. The findings for
the  dissertation  add  to  the  knowledge  base  about  boys’  and  girls’  expressed  reading
preferences by qualitatively examining a large body of data in depth, adding to the
categories of both expressed and perceived interests, including, for girls, princess themed
fiction, chick lit, horse-themed fiction, mermaid-themed fiction, and books with pink
covers and/or pink illustrations; and, for boys, stories with male protagonists, comics,
graphic novels, science fiction, adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor,
stories featuring vehicles, and magazines.
However, in answer to RQ4 (What patterns, if any, of resistance to the dominant
conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed?), the
findings for this section also include 43 examples of resistant reading preferences
(preferences that would not be considered gender-normative). The resistant examples are
so numerous that it could be argued that these expressed reading preferences constitute a
norm, rather than a minority.  Of  the  “resistant”  examples (as discussed in Chapter 4,
Section 4.2.5 – Claim 1: Educators’  perceptions  of  children’s reading preferences and
labeling  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books; Sub-Claim  4,  addressing  educators’  expectations of
children’s  gendered  preferences  for  story  protagonists  based  on  whether  they  are  female

270

or male), in defiance of the belief that girls are more likely to cross gender boundaries
when it comes to reading preferences, 24 of the referenced resistant preferences are
expressed by males, while 17 referenced resistant preferences expressed by females, and
2 referred to both females and males.
6.3.3 Response to RQ3. What similarities and differences, if any, are represented
in conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators (parents, public librarians,
school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for children (published authors, editors,
and published illustrators); and, children/young adults, as represented in their blogging
activities? In response to RQ3, the findings for this section discussing gendered reading
preferences, in terms  of  boys’  and  girls’  expressed differing reading preferences, are
compared with the findings for the most prominent among the conceptions of gendered
literacy: educators’  perceptions  of  children’s reading preferences  and  labeling  of  “boy”  
and  “girl”  books (Chapter 4).
One sub-claim of Claim 1, perceptions of children’s reading preferences and
labeling  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books, is the following: educators align boys’  reading
preferences with the following: stories with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels,
science fiction, adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring
vehicles, and magazines (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3). The number of examples (53) is
roughly the same as the number of examples (56)  of  boys’  expressed  reading  preferences
matching what are perceived to be traditional boy-preferred text types (including stories
with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science fiction, adventure, non-fiction,
sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring vehicles, and magazines).

271

Claim 1, Sub-Claim 4 (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.5): Educators expect boys to prefer
male protagonists and girls to prefer female protagonists. They also assume that girls are
more likely than boys to read a story featuring a protagonist of the opposite sex. (22) – is
also evident in terms of Claim 3 (gendered reading preferences), in 23 examples  of  girls’  
preferences for stories with female protagonists (which accounted for the greatest number
of  examples  for  girls’  preferred  text  types, Section 6.2.1.1)  and  in  28  examples  of  boys’  
preferences for male protagonists (which accounted for the greatest number of examples
for  boys’  preferred  text  types, Section 6.2.2).
Nonetheless, there are  also  significant  differences  between  educators’  perceptions  
of young people’s  reading  preferences and  children’s/young  adults’  expressions  of  their
reading preferences. Such differences include the influence of childhood and parenting
experience on parents, which they perceive as determinative of their ability to judge the
reading preferences of children of the opposite sex. (14 incidences, Chapter 4, Section
4.2.7), and in educators’  disparagement  of  “boy”  (14)  and  “girl”  (10)  books  according  to  
qualities marking those texts as  traditionally  “boy”  or  “girl” (Chapter 4, Sections 4.2.8
and 4.2.9).

CHAPTER 7 GENDERED LITERACY IN THE U.S. CHILDREN’S  PUBLISHING  
7.1 Claim 4: Perceptions of the Predominance of Whites and Females
in the U.S. Children’s  Publishing
This section discusses examples from the data sampled in which bloggers and
commenters describe  the  children’s  publishing  industry  in  the  United  States  as  femaleand white (Caucasian)-dominated (35 total incidences). Compared to the three other
claims, the examples for this section represent the smallest number of incidences among
the data sampled. Specifically, the two sub-claims support the main claim that the
children’s  publishing  industry  in  the  United  States  is  perceived  as  female- and white
(Caucasian)-dominated. There are also many examples to the contrary, so in terms of the
data sampled, resistant examples are not in the minority. However, the large number of
resistant examples may be because one of the blogs (B7) from which data are sampled
focuses  on  diversity  in  children’s  literature.

7.2 Discussion of Sub-Claims and Counter Claims

17

7.2.1 Sub-claim 1: References to women versus men in publishing. Among the
data sampled, 13 references are to women, versus 5 to men, in  the  children’s  U.S.
publishing industry. Ten examples are actual mentions of women in publishing, and, in
analyzing the data, authors, illustrators, editors, literary agents, marketers, and anyone
directly involved in book production are included. Two other examples are comments
that  presume  the  children’s  publishing  industry  to  be  female-dominated, and one example
looks at gendered patterns in relation to historical debates over the winners of the
Newbery Medal, given each year by the Association for Library Service to Children
(American Library Association) to the American author of a book for children voted best
by an elected committee of librarians.
On two occasions, African-American illustrator/author of B17 comments on his
minority status – as a male among many female authors and illustrators. For example,
when attending a local  writer’s  workshop, he comments that, to his knowledge, he was
the only male author/artist in attendance, but really appreciated the help he received at the
workshop (B17, 2009). B17 blogger also refers to his literary agent and editor, both of
whom are women. On one occasion, commenting on his recent lack of writing inspiration,
he says, that in order to hold onto the female literary agent he has recently found, he
needs to produce work that will sell (B17, 2008). Two of the ten examples of women in
publishing mention women in positions of leadership. For instance, a female editor

274

describes a project she is directing for her editor-in-chief, who is on maternity leave (B19,
2009).
Two examples represent the presumption of the predominance of women among
those who produce books for young people. One is a comment by a school librarian made
on B3, a librarian-run blog aimed at boy readers, in response to the posting of an
interview with a boy reader/writer. In the course of the interview, the boy describes his
distaste for romance; in response, the female school librarian writes, “most books out
there are written by adult GIRLS, so the romance is a bit mushy” (B3, 2010). This
example also labels romance as a perceived girl-preferred genre. A frequent commenter
to B4, a mother, similarly presumes youth literature to be a female-dominated field,
commenting on a discussion of the perception that there are not enough suitable books for
young boy readers,  “I'm pretty sure that YA and kid fiction has been girl-dominated
because it's a field women have always been welcome to publish in, not being "real"
literature and all” (B4, 2010). This comment not only presumes that the field of youth
publishing is female-dominated but also that the reason behind that is that youth
publishing is not perceived to be worthy of serious consideration.
An example from B21, the blog of a prominent literary magazine pertaining to
youth literature, presents the historical debate over selection criteria for the Newbery
award, noting that the Newbery medal, the winner of which is chosen by librarians, was
initially opposed by authors of popular series fiction for boys, who complained about
librarians,  whom  they  claimed  did  not  understand  boys’  reading  preferences  (B21, 2012).
The blogger surmises that in response, the initial winners were works written by male
authors. A decade later, a shift to female winners occurred, and the Newbery winning-

275

books were all by female authors – books  that  were  considered  “girl”  books (B21, 2012).
This  discussion  of  the  shift  from  “boy  books”  to  “girl  books”  as  winners  of  the  Newbery  
medal and ensuing responses may explain,  in  part,  the  perception  of  children’s  literature  
as female-dominated.
Such attitudes are echoed in two comments made by a male author of non-fiction
in the course of an interview. At one point, discussing what he perceives as a bias against
non-fiction  among  educators,  he  states,  “I'm pretty sure that the female world in America
is the set of people who write, edit, publish, and purchase books for elementary school
kids. By purchase I mean, the moms in the bookstore, the school librarians, the public
librarians”  (Interview 3 transcript, 2013). At another point in the discussion, noting that
he has been visiting schools due to the increased interest in non-fiction brought about by
Common Core Standards, he says that most of the schools he visits have never before
invited an author of non-fiction  to  visit.  He  comments,  “previously when they've had an
author visit it was a picture book author, how she writes a story, or a novelist, and where
do you get your ideas from, etc.”  (Interview  3 transcript, 2013). Here, his own
assumption  of  children’s  literature  as  female-dominated is evident in reference to the
visiting  picture  book  author  as  “she.”  
Although there are more references to women in publishing in the data –
including 10 examples actually mentioning women in publishing, 2 examples expressing
the  assumption  that  the  children’s  publishing  industry  is  female-dominated, and 1
analyzing gendered patterns in relation to historical debates over the winners of the
Newbery Medal – 5 references to men in publishing are also evident. One refers to an
editor, two refer to literary agents, and two references are to author/illustrators. However,

276

B17, as he is one of the author/illustrators, expresses amusement over the fact that he,
along with one other male attendee, were acknowledged with special prizes at an African
American  Children’s  Book  Writers  and  Illustrators  conference  he  attended (B17, 2009).
Two other examples are from B3, a blog by public male librarians intended for an
audience of boy readers. And, three examples are from B17, the blog of an AfricanAmerican male author/illustrator.
In an interview with B7 blogger, a white female public librarian who specializes
in materials for youth, she notes,
There are a lot of women, in the librarian world as  well  as  the  publishing  world….  
Traditionally, women were allowed to work in these areas so that is where they
went….the weird thing about the publishing world is that when you do run across
a guy he tends to be the head of something, so there are a couple of male editors
that are just editors like everything else but boy they seem to move up pretty fast
in the publishing world. And to a certain extent it has to do with being
remembered. I mean there are a billion women with long brown hair, just
graduated from Brown, and now they're assistant editors, and I can't keep them
apart, I seriously can't keep them apart….So, when you can distinguish somebody
from the pack you kind of cling to that, so I think that to a certain extent is why
the guys seem to do as well as they do. (Interview 1 transcript, 2013)
B7 blogger, as a materials selector for a library system and also a published author, has
frequent contact with publishing representatives, so her commentary on the
predominance of women in publishing, but with men in the positions of power, is based
on real experience.
7.2.2 Sub-claim 2: Bloggers’  and  commenters’  perception  of  white  Caucasian  
bias  in  children’s  books. Bloggers and commenters perceive white Caucasian bias in
character representation and cover art, especially in terms of a lack of African-American
males, in children's books published in the United States (17). Seven of the seventeen
comments are from B7, the blog of a white female  public  children’s  librarian  in charge of

277

materials selection for a large U.S. public library system, who often blogs about diversity
issues  in  terms  of  children’s  literature.  The  posts  from  which  data  are collected feature
reviews of books with African-American protagonists, while at the same time
commenting that these books are rare among youth literature as a whole. For instance, in
reviewing one such novel, she notes that upon first glance she mistook the book for
something else altogether. As both apology and explanation, she says that it was because
of all the middle grade fiction published (in the U.S.) that year, the majority of which she
had looked at, it was one of the few showing a young African-American male on the
book jacket, and one of the few with an African-American protagonist at all (B7, 2012).
This statement speaks to her familiarity, as a materials selector for the library, with the
newly published works in 2012 and her concern that very few African-American males
are the focus of such works. She notes that even when they  are  the  story’s  focus,  they  
usually are not shown on the book cover. Similarly, she comments that the face of the
African-American protagonist is obscured by that of his dog (B7, 2012).
A commenter responds by thanking B7 blogger for her attention to diversity,
saying that more reviews of books featuring African-American protagonists could help
broaden the market for such books, at the same time arguing that the reason there are not
more such titles is that they are perceived to garner fewer sales (B7, 2012). This
perception may underlie the white bias in publishing.
In terms of African-American female protagonists in middle grade fiction, B7
blogger concludes that there may be more representations than of African-American
males, describing how the covers of those books featuring girls depict  the  protagonists’  
actual faces (B7, 2012). In contrast, however, B19 blogger, a female editor, describes

278

controversy surrounding the cover art, originally featuring a white girl, of a young adult
novel featuring a biracial female protagonist. Moreover, speaking as an editor and
reflecting on the practices of the company she works for, she is committed to change
regarding the issue of characters of color on book covers and at the same time suggests
that the reason companies might not show characters of color on book covers is that it
could potentially limit book sales (B19, 2009). She later describes the work of one author
published by her company, whose first and second novels featured hapa (a Hawaiian
slang term meaning a person of mixed ethnicity, usually half Asian and half white) and
Asian protagonists on the cover, respectively, and then speculates as to why the  author’s
third novel, featuring a white girl on the cover, was the most successful. Although she
surmises that the success of the third novel rests on a chain of successes started with the
first two novels, she also wonders if featuring a white character on the book jacket played
any part in its selling even better than the first two novels (B19, 2009).
B11 blogger, a mother, in an example for this code, also comments on the
controversial title mentioned by B19 that originally featured a white girl on the cover but
was later changed to feature a biracial girl, suggesting the title as a good book for
mother/daughter discussion. B11 blogger believes that, even beyond the diversity issue,
the depiction of a white character on the cover of a book about a biracial character,
undermines the perceived reliability of the story’s  main  narrator  (B11, 2009).
Six examples relating to white Caucasian bias in character representation and
cover art in children's books are from B17, the blog of an African-American
illustrator/author, who comments on his perspective as a minority among authors. In one
example, he describes how although representation is still small, it has grown

279

substantially over the past twenty years (B17, 2009). However, B17 blogger still defends
the need for opportunities, organizations, and events specifically for African-American
authors and illustrators. For example, reviewing debates over the Coretta Scott King
Awards, he says that he is wary that if the guidelines changed to include writers of other
colors as potential recipients, African-American authors would be ignored (B17, 2009).
Similarly, discussing the need for the organization, African-American  Children’s  Book  
Writers and Illustrators (AACBWI), he indicates that the youth book publishing industry,
in comparison to other industries, is particularly biased in favor of whites, noting
specifically that, from his own experience, in comparison to the other industries for
which he has produced illustrations,  children’s  book  publishing  has  proved  the  most  
difficult (B17, 2009). He also argues that African-American authors and illustrators face
unique challenges in terms of getting books published and so need the support of
organizations and conferences geared toward their specific goals. B17 blogger also
contributes to another blog that features publishing news, discussion, and debates by
various African-American authors and illustrators of books for young people. White bias
may extend to booksellers as well, as one male commenter to B17, referring to one such
conference for African-American authors, states that he had difficulty locating books
written by the authors featured at the conference (B17, 2010).
In yet another post, B17 blogger reflects on an  author’s  metaphor  of  the  
comfortable “box”  of  children’s  books  by  African-American authors geared toward
African-American readers, a box which contains historical stories or stories of
overcoming adversity. He suggests that African-American authors need both to break into

280

this “box”  which  tends  to  exclude  them  and  to  write  about  things  which  don’t  fit  into  the  
traditional  “box”  of  what  African-American authors generally write about (B17, 2007).
This section has discussed examples describing the perception of white
(Caucasian) bias in character representation and cover art in children's books published in
the United States. The following section will discuss examples of resistance identified
among the data sampled in terms of references to characters of color. Although not
directly related to the sub-claim regarding white bias, this section also deals with
examples in which book characters who challenge gender stereotypes and/or sexual
norms are mentioned.
7.2.3 Counter claim: References to portrayals of characters of color in
children’s  books. Among the data sampled, there are fourteen examples referring to
portrayals  of  characters  of  color  in  children’s  books  published in the U.S. Ten of the 14
examples are from B7, a blog maintained by a white female public librarian who is
responsible for the selection of materials for a large Northeastern U.S. library system. B7
blogger frequently focuses on diversity issues on her blog, so it is not surprising that the
majority of the examples come from her blog. Three of the examples are from B19, the
blog of a female Asian-American editor, who also frequently discusses diversity issues.
One example is from B17, the blog of a male African-American author/illustrator.
Eight of the 14 examples refer to examples of books with African-American male
protagonists, including showing them on the book covers. The examples from B19 both
reference Ezra Jack Keats’  The Snowy Day as a childhood favorite. B19 blogger, an
Asian-American female, sees the fact that The Snowy Day, featuring a black protagonist,
was her favorite as a child, as proof that, at least in terms of reading preference, gender

281

and race need not be relevant (B19, 2009). In response, a white mother comments that
The Snowy Day is one of her favorite books and also a favorite of her Chinese daughter,
adding that as a mother in a diverse family, she agrees that cultural diversity should be
celebrated (B19, 2009).
Two of the 14 examples refer to books featuring African-American female
protagonists, including a non-fiction example describing two biographies published the
same year about Alice Coachman, an African-American woman who won an Olympic
gold medal in high jump (B7, 2012). Two examples are of books featuring Latino
protagonists. One example describes an anthology of writings by Native American youth.
The examples comment on the notion that other books of the type reviewed are few in
number (B7, 2013). For example, B7 blogger highly recommends a humorous book with
a male Latino protagonist as an example among the few books published featuring Latino
boys that a child would choose without being encouraged to read it (B7, 2012).
7.2.4 Counter claim: Book characters who challenge gender stereotypes
and/or sexual norms. Among the data sampled, 17 examples are found in which book
characters who challenge gender stereotypes and/or sexual norms are mentioned. Some of
the examples reference more than one theme. Five of the 17 examples are references to
girl protagonists’  challenging  feminine  norms.  As  part  of  a  post  on  children’s  novels  
about sports, B11 blogger, a mother, includes two reviews of sports novels featuring
female protagonists. The more positive of the two reviews describes the female
protagonist’s  initial happiness at the opportunity for her softball team to train harder to
compete at a higher level, followed by her displeasure as the training becomes too intense
and some girls leave the team. B11 blogger emphasizes that softball is the true focus of

282

the novel and will appeal to fans of the sport (B11, 2006). Similarly, B7 blogger reviews
a  girls’  sports  series,  highlighting the hi-lo”  (high  interest,  low  readability)  series as
fulfilling the need for more sports fiction for girls.
Among the 17 examples, 6 refer to portrayals of boy characters who challenge
norms of masculinity. Four of those six are part of a thread on B7 discussing B7
blogger’s  suggestion  for  the  need  for  a  re-illustration of Charlotte Zolotow’s William’s  
Doll, which features a boy who wants a doll, is ridiculed by his father and older brother
for wanting one, and is eventually given one by his grandmother. B7 blogger argues the
case for re-illustration based on the book’s  outdated illustrations in conjunction with its
widespread use of the book on school reading lists. One female commenter responds that
she favors a re-illustrated version based on her perception that books featuring strong
female  protagonists  are  abundant  but  books  with  “nurturing”  male  protagonists  are  
lacking (B7, 2012). However, another commenter argues that the goal should be to
encourage authors and illustrators to produce more books like William’s  Doll that resist
gender norms, not just to push for re-illustrated versions of existing books (B7, 2012).
An example from B4 also refers to William’s  Doll,  calling  it  an  “excellent picture
book”  and  recommends  another  similar  title,  “Oliver Button is a Sissy by the awesome
Tomie de Paola about a little boy who loves to dance and gets flak from his peers about it”  
(B4, 2010). Similarly, an example from B7 blogger recommends Alex Ko: From Iowa to
Broadway, My Billy Elliot Story, a non-fiction title, featuring a boy who, despite his
father’s  disapproval,  dreams  of dancing on Broadway and eventually realizes his dream
(B7, 2012).This example, as in the work of fiction, William’s  Doll, also refers to a father
who disapproves of a son who challenges gender norms in terms of masculinity.

283

B7 blogger, in describing a book she feels is resistant in its embrace of sparkles
and other feminine symbols in the form of a male unicorn protagonist, clarifies her belief
that adults can help bring about more open-mindedness in their influence of
impressionable young children, stating: “There's enough room in the world for books that
have unicorns and sparkles and cupcakes on the cover and that a boy would read. You
just got  to  get  'em  young.  That's  true”  (Interview  1 transcript, 2013).
Five of the 17 examples refer to books in which homosexuality is a theme. In one
such example, B2 blogger, a young adult female, writes about a book that has been
challenged, stating that although homosexuality is a theme, the real meaning of the book
is the changing nature  of  relationships  and  also  saying  that  challengers’  claims  that  the
book is sexually explicit are wrong (B2, 2009). In another example, a parent comments
on enjoying reading a novel with a boy/boy romance with his/her son (B23, 2011).
Three of the 17 examples refer to books treating transgender themes. One of the
examples is a recommendation for a book featuring a trans protagonist, in which a father
writes that he approves of the positive portrayal of the character and the interesting plot,
adding that his five-year-old also enjoys the book (B21, 2012). This example illustrates a
parent’s  resistance  to the portrayal of traditional gender and sexual norms in books for
children.
7.3 Summary/Connection to Research Questions
7.3.1 Response to RQ1. What are the conceptions of gendered literacy among
literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of
texts for children (published authors, editors, and published illustrators); and,
children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities? In response to RQ1,

284

data coded according to the claim discussed in this Chapter – the  children’s  publishing  
industry in the United States as female- and white (Caucasian)-dominated – are the
fewest of all the categories (35). White bias is considered along with the gendered aspect
of perceptions of the publishing industry because some aspects of white bias are also
gendered; for example, very few African-American and Latino boys are featured in youth
literature, according to the data sampled.
7.3.2 Response to RQ2. How do the conceptions of gendered literacy identified
through the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts for children, and
children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions identified in the literature
review? To answer RQ2, the overall claim that the  children’s  publishing  industry  in  the  
United States is described as female- and white (Caucasian)-dominated explored in this
Chapter corresponds to the first aspect of the literature-review based conceptual model –
gendered literacy as performed by multiple actors, including children and young adults,
literacy educators, and those in the publishing industry. More specifically, according to
the data sampled, it is enacted through 1)13 references to women in the children’s  
publishing industry, in contrast to 5 references to men, and 2) perceptions of white
Caucasian bias in character representation and cover art, especially in terms of a lack of
African-American males, in children's books published in the United States. However, it
is also connected to the fourth aspect of the literature-based conceptual model – gendered
literacy as the remnant of a historically gendered educational system (in the U.S.) – in
terms of the field of youth librarianship, as predominantly female. This is demonstrated
by the example from B21, describing the historical debates between public youth services
librarians, who were mostly female, and male authors of children’s fiction – debates

285

which may have influenced the male/female balance in terms of winners of the Newbery
Award.
7.3.3 Response to RQ3. RQ3 asks: What similarities and differences, if any, are
represented in conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators (parents, public
librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for children (published
authors, editors, and published illustrators); and, children/young adults, as represented in
their blogging activities? In response, the perspectives of those who actually work in
youth publishing are represented among the data sampled, including a female editor,
referencing her female editor-in-chief; an African-American male author/illustrator,
referencing his minority status both as an African-American and as a male within the
publishing world, and also referring to his editor and literary agent, both of whom are
female; a female author of young adult literature who previously worked in marketing for
a major publisher; a female commenter who works for a major publisher (whose role is
unable  to  be  determined);;  a  female  author  of  children’s  literature  who references her
female editor; and a female editor referenced by a female public librarian. Posts and
comments relating to perceptions of a predominance of females in publishing are by a
female  school  librarian,  a  female  public  librarian,  and  a  male  author  of  children’s  nonfiction.
In terms of references to white bias, perspectives represented include a white
female public librarian, an Asian-American female editor, and an African-American male
author/illustrator. Seven of the 17 examples are from the blog (B7) of a white female
public librarian who, as youth materials selector for the library, is attuned to issues of
diversity in youth literature and therefore comments specifically on the lack of African-

286

American  males  featured  as  protagonists  in  children’s  literature  and/or  depicted  on  the  
covers of books for children. Six of the 17 examples are from B17 (the African-American
male  author/illustrator’s  blog), including posts by the blogger and a comment posted to
the blog discussing African-American  authors  and  illustrators  in  children’s  publishing,  
awards  for  children’s  books  written  by  African-Americans, the challenges they face as a
result, and ways in which they can work collectively and creatively to be better
represented.
B19 blogger, an Asian-American female editor, similarly comments on diversity
issues, and presents a positive but also critical stance in terms of her own work and the
publisher for whom she works, stating, in reference to a case she describes in which a
biracial character was depicted as white on the cover of a book, that her publishing house
would never do that; however, she can imagine that it might refrain from including the
face of a character of color on a book jacket. She thereby suggests that white bias might
also take the form of absence, even in the case of a publisher that prides itself on its
diversity (B19, 2009).
7.3.4 Response to RQ4. What patterns, if any, of resistance to the dominant
conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed? Among
the data described in this Chapter, resistant examples are more numerous than examples
coded according to the main claims. In terms of the data, then, the resistant examples
cannot be considered the minority. However, as previously stated, this may be because
the blogs from which data are sampled make a point of highlighting resistance. The forms
of resistance to the main claim that the  children’s  publishing  industry  in  the  United  States  
is perceived to be female- and white (Caucasian)-dominated include the following:

287

References to portrayals  of  characters  of  color  in  children’s  books  published
in the U.S. are evident. (Librarian – 10, Editor – 2, Illustrator – 1, Parent – 1)
(14)
Book characters who challenge gender stereotypes and/or sexual norms are
mentioned. (parent – 8, librarian – 6, adult of undetermined role – 2,
child/young adult – 1) (17)
Examples mentioning books featuring characters of color and those who challenge
gender stereotypes and/or sexual norms are abundant among the data sampled. However,
evidence from the data supports the perception of youth publishing as a femaledominated field, as there are very few mentions of men in the industry.

288

CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
8.1 Introduction
The evidence from the data sampled and collected for this qualitative study
supports and adds to, but also contradicts, the literature-based claims made about
gendered literacy. Gendered literacy is a reflection of the larger gender divisions in U.S.
society and evident from as early as toddlerhood both  in  terms  of  children’s  reading  
choices and choices encouraged by educators, publishers, and creators of  children’s  
reading materials. For some literacy educators, gender divisions represent a safe,
protective worldview – one  neatly  divided  into  “girl”  reading  and  “boy”  reading  – by
which to raise and educate children, and to produce marketable reading materials for
children. These gender divisions are therefore enacted through gender-segregation of
young  people’s  reading  choices  and  perceptions  of  those  reading  choices,  as  well  as  
through other gendered behaviors in relation to reading and literacy.
How are notions of gendered literacy disseminated and reproduced? Parents’  
emotional  reactions  to  their  children’s  reading  choices  play  a  role,  as  in  the  father  telling
his three-year-old son while browsing in the library that Olivia, a book featuring a female
pig  protagonist,  is  a  “girl”  book  (B7). Texts are shared physically, as in parents and
siblings taking turns reading a book, older siblings handing down a book to a younger
sibling, or parents’  recommending  books  from  their childhood. Books are also
recommended virtually, through blogs such as those linked through the KidLitosphere,
descriptions provided by online booksellers, and by comments posted by purchasers of
materials. Examples from the data sampled illustrate how institutions, including schools
and libraries, have privileged certain text types and certain forms of reading and

289

knowledge over others, especially through the disparagement of “boy”  books (including
non-fiction, comics, graphic novels, and gross humor) as less literary than other reading
materials and  considered  acceptable  reading  only  as  a  bridge  for  “reluctant  readers”  
before moving to narrative fiction, which is considered of higher quality. Comics and
graphic novels are perceived to be of lesser quality than traditional, linear narrative,
thereby elevating print over image. By disparaging non-fiction, reading for factual
knowledge is considered less important than reading for story. Crass humor is also
considered of lesser quality. In that the text types just mentioned are, among the data
sampled, both  perceived  to  be  “boy”-preferred (52) and reported to be preferred by boys
(56),  educators’  disparagement  of  those  texts  may  create  a  societal  boys’  reading  problem,  
as boys see that the texts they enjoy reading are not valued.
On the other hand, children’s  reading  choices  and  choices  encouraged  by  
educators,  publishers,  and  creators  of  children’s  reading  materials  are  also  a  means  by  
which notions of gendered literacy are disrupted. Resistance involves the refusal to label
texts  as  “boy”  or  “girl,”  adjusting expectations regarding what girls and boys may prefer
to read, and, more generally, separating the notion of whether a child is male or female
from reading preference.
Through  this  study’s  findings  describing  data  sampled  from  blogs  focusing  on  
literature  for  young  people  and  young  people’s  reading  practices  that  are  included  on  a  
U.S.-based website, a picture of gendered literacy is apparent. This picture of gendered
literacy is one in which literacy educators (including parents, librarians, and teachers)
label books for young people according to “girl”- and  “boy”-preferred, perceive boys and
girls as having differing reading preferences, perceive boys to be reluctant and less

290

advanced readers, and one in which young people express gendered reading preferences.
However, it is also a picture in which young people express resistant reading preferences
– that is, not conforming to what would be considered gender-normative preferences, and
one filled with examples of books, series, and genres that are reported to appeal to both
boys and girls, along with approximately equal numbers of examples referring to boys’  
and girls’ love of reading and/or advanced reading level.
8.2 Responding to the Research Questions Based on the Data Overall
8.2.1 Response to RQ1. RQ1: What are the conceptions of gendered literacy
among literacy educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers);
creators of texts for children (published authors, editors, and published illustrators); and,
children/young adults, as represented in their blogging activities?
The most prominent conception of gendered literacy in terms of the data sampled
is literacy educators’ labeling of books for young people according to “girl”  and  “boy”preferred (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1). This labeling is supported through young  people’s  
conceptions of gendered literacy – boys’  and  girls’  expressed preferences for text types
that educators would label as appropriate for them, which are the next two most
prominent findings. This may represent an internalization of the labels by young people.
In the following example discussed earlier, a mother describes her distaste for her
daughter’s  taste  for  pink,  glitter,  and  princesses:
I try to let her love pink glitter and purple (drowning victim) lipstick and
everything covered in Princesses and have faith that my smart, savvy little girl
will grow out of it just like I did. But I also try to expose her to anything I can that
will speed that growing out of it process up some. (B4, 2009)
In this example, the daughter gravitates toward colors and themes that are perceived to be
“girl”  preferred  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  her  mother  claims  to  dislike  them  and  discourages

291

her daughter from choosing them. Therefore, the process by which young people
internalize impressions relating to gendered literacy remains unclear. Moreover, there is
evidence that children can readily identify reading preferences that would be considered
gender-normative even when they themselves do not share the preference that would be
considered normative for their sex (Chapman, Filipenko, McTavish, & Shapiro, 2007).
Boys’  reading,  including  educators’  expectations of  boys’  reading  preferences
(Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3), along with the mention of certain book series as boy favorites,
both by educators and boy readers (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.4), stands out as important
among the data sampled. On the other hand, resistance is also prominent, in terms of 43
incidences in which children express resistant – that is, not conforming to what would be
considered gender-normative reading preferences (Chapter 6, Section 6.2.3).
In terms of creators’ of materials for children conceptions of gendered literacy, in
that there are 29 incidences in which specific books, series, and genres are reported to
appeal to both boys and girls (Chapter 6, Section 6.2.4), and that there are 17 incidences
of book characters who challenge gender stereotypes and/or sexual norms (Chapter 7,
Section 7.2.4), there is movement toward a more gender-neutral approach. However,
there are also 17 incidences in which bloggers and commenters express perceptions of
white Caucasian bias in character representation and cover art, especially in terms of a
lack of African-American males, in children's books published in the United States
(Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2).
In this dissertation study, in some cases the data were approached with
expectations, which were not met in the data sampled. For example, in the comparison
between  mothers  and  fathers  as  encouragers  of  children’s  reading (Chapter 5, Section

292

5.2.1), the underlying expectation, based on a review of the literature, was that mothers
would be primary, and while they are primary in this case (42 examples involving
mothers versus 32 involving fathers), there is not a large difference between mothers and
fathers. Similarly, in the comparison of girl and boy readers (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2), it
was expected that mentions of girls who love reading would outnumber those of boys
who love reading, and yet, the number of incidences  mentioning  boys’  love  of  reading  
and/or advanced reading level (27) are approximately equal to those mentioning girls’  (24)
among the data sampled. On the other hand, there is evidence that educators perceive that
boys  are  both  “reluctant”  and  less  advanced  readers (29 incidences) (Chapter 5, Section
5.2.3).
8.2.2 Response to RQ2. RQ2 How do the conceptions of gendered literacy
identified through the blogging activities of literacy educators, creators of texts for
children, and children/young adults compare to the theoretical conceptions identified in
the literature review?
Prominent conceptions of gendered literacy identified in the literature review include:
Gendered literacy as enacted, or performed, by multiple actors:
* Children/young adults:
a)  through  boys’  dislike of formal, school-based literacy in comparison to
girls’  more  enthusiastic adoption of formal literacy practice in terms of
reading, writing, and classroom comportment and,
b)  through  girls’  and  boys’  displaying  differing  literacy  preferences in
terms of reading and writing.

293

* Literacy educators, including parents, public librarians, school librarians, and
teachers:
a)  through  parents’  perceptions  of  their  daughters’  and  sons’  literacy  
preferences and mothers’  and  fathers’  differing  support  of children’s  
reading behaviors
b)  through  teachers’  perceptions  and  expectations  of  male and female
students’  literacy  preferences and performance
c)  through  librarians’  expectations  of  children’s    (particularly  boys’)  
literacy preferences and programmatic responses
* Creators of reading materials for children – the  children’s  publishing  industry
These conceptions are supported through evidence in the data. However, as stated earlier,
there are  also  surprises.  For  example,  although  boys’  dislike of formal, school-based
literacy was important in the literature, in the sampled data, in contrast, mentions  of  boys’  
love of reading and/or advanced reading level (27) are  slightly  more  than  those  of  girls’  
love of reading and/or advanced reading level (24). Girls’  and  boys’  differing  reading  
preferences was important in the literature; among the data sampled, there was evidence
of  girls’ (67)  and  boys’  (56)  expressions  of  reading  preferences that would be considered
aligning with gender-appropriate reading preferences. However, there was also evidence
of children’s  expressions  of  resistant  – that is, not conforming to what would be
considered gender-normative – reading preferences (43).
Similar to the reviewed literature,  literacy  educators’  perceptions  of  girls’  and  
boys’  gendered reading preferences are prominent among the data sampled. This includes
a  greater  number  of  themes  relating  to  perceptions  of  boys’  reading  preferences than to

294

perceptions  of  girls’  reading  preferences, including: educators’ alignment  of  boys’  
reading preferences with stories with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science
fiction, adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring vehicles,
and magazines (53) (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3); educators’  perceptions  that  boys  are  both  
“reluctant”  and  less  advanced  readers (29); perceptions that books and reading are
unwelcoming to boys (14) (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.4); and parents’ perception that there
are not enough "boy books" available (13) (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.5). It also includes
several themes relating to the direct labeling  of  boys’  books  – a theme which was not as
evident in the literature review, including educators (librarians, parents) and children
consistently mentioning certain  book  series,  coded  “iconic  boy  books,”  in  reference  to  
boys’  reading (43) (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.4); educators’  labeling  of  “boy”  books (31)
(Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1); and, educators’ expectations that boys prefer male
protagonists while girls are more likely than boys to read a story featuring a protagonist
of the opposite sex (22) (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.5).
Examples  relating  to  girls’  reading  preferences are also prominent. Twenty-five
examples refer to labeling of “girl” books; other examples refer to educators’ expectation
that girls prefer female protagonists and that girls are more likely than boys to read a
story featuring a protagonist of the opposite sex.
Based on the literature review, it was expected that more examples would be
found  of  mothers’  reading  with  or  otherwise  encouraging  their  children’s  reading  
(through  purchasing,  borrowing  books,  or  seeking  reading  suggestions)  than  of  fathers’.  
Although this is supported in the data sampled, with forty-two examples of mothers'
reading with their children or encouraging their  children’s  reading,  compared  with  thirty-

295

two  examples  of  fathers’  reading  with  their  children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  
reading, the difference between mothers and fathers is not great. The way in which
parents perceive that their childhood identity as either a boy or girl, or experience with
children of only one sex, determines their qualifications to judge the reading preferences
of children of the opposite sex (14 examples) was also an unanticipated and new
conception of gendered literacy identified.
Another conception of gendered literacy identified in the literature review is:
Gendered literacy as a quantifiable achievement gap
Based on the literature review, it was expected that this theme of girls achieving better
verbal test results, or achieving better grades than boys, particularly in terms of reading
and writing, would be prominent in the data sampled, but it was not. However, as
mentioned  prior,  educators’  perception  that  boys  are  both  “reluctant”  and  less  advanced  
readers (29) is an important theme among the data sampled. In this sense, the gap in
achievement between boys and girls may in part be the result of lowered expectations for
boys and a related lack of practice reading and writing for boys. However, it should be
reiterated that  among  the  data  sampled  the  number  of  examples  discussing  boys’  love  of  
reading and/or advanced reading level is on par with that of girls (27 for boys, 24 for
girls). So, a lack of literacy practice for boys is not evident in the data sampled.
The expectation was that the following theme would be important in the data
sampled:
Gendered literacy as a biological phenomenon, the result of essential, cognitive
differences between males and females

296

It is a minor theme among the data sampled, with twelve examples in which educators,
particularly parents, express the perception that gendered literacy is a biological
phenomenon, the result of essential, cognitive differences between males and females.
Within this larger category, sub-themes include: the perception that boys learn to read
later than girls; the perception that girls and boys have innate differing reading
preferences and that girls are wired to enjoy reading while boys are not; and, the
perception that boys are more active than girls and so are less inclined to enjoy schoolappropriate behaviors, including reading.
This last conception of gendered literacy was a prominent theme among the
literature reviewed for the dissertation:
Gendered literacy as the remnant of a historically gendered educational system,
including the feminization of the teaching profession in the U.S. and a legacy of
underachieving boys
However, among the data sampled, it is absent except for a couple of incidences which
could be linked to the overall theme, although they are not specifically named as such.
One comment from B4 (categorized according to Claim 2, Gendered Literacy Behaviors
and Perceptions of Gendered Literacy Behaviors, Sub-claim 4: Educators perceive that
books and reading are unwelcoming to boys – Chapter 5, Section 5.2.4) refers to the
perception  of  school  as  a  feminine  domain  and  the  “feminine”  behaviors  the  school  
environment supposedly fosters, like sitting still and behaving well. This perception of
school  as  a  “feminine”  environment  may  stem  from  the  historical predominance of
women in elementary education in the U.S.

297

Counting youth services librarians among educators of children in the U.S., a
comment from B21, categorized according to Claim 4: Perceptions of the Predominance
of Whites and Females in  Children’s  Publishing, Sub-claim 1: Thirteen references are to
women  in  the  children’s  publishing  industry in the United States, versus five to men in
the publishing industry, also speaks to this theme. The comment refers to a
predominance of women in the field of youth librarianship in connection with historical
conflicts between public youth services librarians, who were mostly female, and male
authors  of  children’s fiction, over which authors were most deserving of the Newbery
Award and who was best qualified to judge.
The following table presents conceptual model based on the empirical results of

8.2.3 Response to RQ3. RQ3 What similarities and differences, if any, are
represented in conceptions of gendered literacy among literacy educators (parents, public

298

librarians, school librarians, and teachers); creators of texts for children (published
authors, editors, and published illustrators); and, children/young adults, as represented in
their blogging activities?
In terms of incidences categorized according to the sub-claims associated with
Claim 1, Educators’  gendered perceptions of children’s reading preferences and labeling
of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books  (226 total incidences), the perspectives of librarians are
represented the most (90), with parents (88) next, followed by teachers (22),
children/young adults (16), authors/illustrators (7), and adults of undetermined roles (3).
Among the claims countering Claim 1, which include those expressing resistance against
gendered perceptions and labeling  of  children’s books, the perspectives of parents are
best represented (25), followed by adults of undetermined role (8), children (6), teachers
(4), and librarians (4). Among the data sampled, therefore, there is less resistance
expressed by employees of the formal educational system, including teachers and
librarians.
Claim 2 refers to gendered literacy behaviors and perceptions of these behaviors,
including comparison of mothers’ and fathers’ encouragement of their children’s reading;
comparison of mentions of girls’ and boys’ love of reading; specific perceptions relating
to boys as “reluctant readers” and fewer options for boys in terms of appropriate reading
materials; the perception of gendered literacy as the result of biologically-based sex
differences; and debate  over  female  authors’ ability to write a “male” voice. Among the
perspectives represented in relation to Claim 2, parents (111) are best represented, with
children/young adults also well represented (52). To a much lesser extent, the

299

perspectives of librarians (23), authors (8), teachers (7), 1 adult of undetermined role, and
1 educator of undetermined type are also represented.
Claim 3, Gendered reading preferences,  in  terms  of  boys’  and  girls’  expressions  
of differing reading preferences,  focuses  exclusively  on  children’s perspectives. However,
these examples representing children expressions of gender-normative reading
preferences (girls: 67; boys: 56) may be compared to claims about data referring to
educators’  expectations  of  children’s  reading  preferences.  These  include  Claim  1,  Subclaim 2, in which educators align  boys’  reading  preferences with the following: stories
with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science fiction, adventure, non-fiction,
sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring vehicles, and magazines (librarians – 39,
parents – 11, teachers – 3); the number of incidences – 53 – is approximately equal to that
of the perspectives of boys themselves relating to their gender-normative preferences –
56. In contrast, only eight examples illustrating educators’  perceptions  of girls’  literacy  
preferences matching the following traditional categories: realistic fiction, romance,
princess themed fiction, stories with female protagonists, coming of age stories, chick lit,
books with pink covers, were identified among the data sampled. Examples relating to
educators’  expectations  that  boys  prefer  male  protagonists,  girls  prefer  female  
protagonists, and that girls are more likely than boys to read a story featuring a
protagonist of the opposite sex (parents – 16, librarians – 4, teachers – 2) include 22
incidences, and as such, also represent a prominent theme.
On the other hand, there is significant resistance represented among the data
sampled in terms of children’s  expressions  of  resistant  – that is, not conforming to what
would be considered gender-normative – reading preferences (43 examples). To a lesser

300

degree, bloggers and commenters (including parents – 7, children and young adults – 5,
adults of undetermined role – 2, illustrator – 1) express the belief that  a  child’s  sex  should  
not influence their reading preferences (15). For this sub-claim, the number of
perspectives of adults  (10)  and  children  (5)  represented,  are  similar.  In  terms  of  educators’  
resistant  perspectives  in  relation  to  children’s  reading  preferences  – not expecting girls to
prefer  what  are  commonly  perceived  to  be  “girl”-preferred  texts,  or  boys  to  prefer  “boy”preferred  texts,  parents’  perspectives  (8)  are  similar  to  the  sub-claim just mentioned
referring to the belief that  a  child’s  sex  should  not  influence their reading preferences (in
which 7 parent perspectives were represented), with the perspectives of librarians (3), and
teachers (2) represented to a much lesser degree (13 incidences total). In terms of another
resistant theme – that of the mention of specific books, series, and genres as appealing to
both boys and girls – the perspectives of children/young adults (14) are also better
represented than those of librarians (5), parents (5), adults of undetermined roles (3), and
teachers (3). As in Claims 1 and 2 discussed prior, children and parents overall, rather
than  librarians  and  teachers,  are  leaders  in  terms  of  resistance  to  notions  of  children’s  
gender-normative reading preferences.
Examples in the data categorized according to Claim 4 are examples in which
bloggers and commenters  describe  the  children’s  publishing  industry  in  the  United  States  
as female- and white (Caucasian)-dominated. Sub-claims relate to comparisons of
mentions  of  women  versus  mentions  of  men  in  the  children’s  publishing  industry in the
U.S. and perceptions of white Caucasian bias in character representation and cover art,
especially in terms of a lack of African-American males, in children's books published in
the U.S. The perspectives represented among claim 4 sub-claims include authors (17),

301

librarians (9), editors (4), parents (2), 1 young adult, 1 adult of undetermined role, and 1
publishing representative/marketing. People directly involved in the creation and
publication of reading materials for youth are better represented here than for other
claims. Along with educators, they turn a critical eye toward publishing houses in terms
of racial bias in reading materials produced for children.
Resistance focuses on examples in which bloggers and commenters write about
characters of color and characters who challenge gender stereotypes and/or sexual norms
featured in children’s  books  published  in  the  U.S. Among these examples, librarians (16)
are best represented, followed by parents (9), editors (2), adults of undetermined role (2),
1 illustrator and 1 child. However, 13 of the 16 librarian examples are written by B7
blogger, a youth services librarian and materials specialist for a large library system, who
is particularly attuned to issues of diversity among materials for children. If data sampled
from her blog not been included in the analysis, librarians would not have been as well
represented in terms of this category.
8.2.4 Response to RQ4. RQ4 What patterns, if any, of resistance to the dominant
conceptions of gendered literacy may be found among the blog posts analyzed?
The counter claims identified in reference to the data are the following:
Claim 1, Counter claim A: Bloggers and commenters resist the labeling of books
as  “girl”- or “boy”- preferred. (parents – 10, adults of undetermined role – 6, teachers – 2,
librarian – 1, child – 1, author – 1) (21 incidences) (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2)
Claim 1, Counter claim B: Bloggers and commenters express the belief that a
child’s  sex  should  not  influence  their  reading  preferences. (parents – 7, children and

302

young adults – 5, adults of undetermined role – 2, illustrator – 1) (15 incidences)
(Chapter 4, Section 4.2.6)
Claim 1, Counter claim C: Educators do not expect girls to prefer what are
commonly  perceived  to  be  “girl”-preferred texts,  or  boys  to  prefer  “boy”-preferred texts.
(parents – 8, librarians – 3, teachers – 2) (13 incidences) (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.6)
Claim 3, Counter claim A: Children’s  expressions  of  resistant  – that is, not
conforming to what would be considered gender-normative – reading preferences are
evident. (43 incidences) (Chapter 6, Section 6.2.3)
Claim 3, Counter claim B: Specific books, series, and genres are reported to
appeal to both boys and girls. (29 incidences) (Chapter 6, Section 6.2.4)
Claim 4, Counter claim A: References to portrayals of characters of color in
children’s  books  published  in  the  U.S.  are  evident.  (14 incidences) (Chapter 7, Section
7.2.3)
Claim 4, Counter claim B: Book characters who challenge gender stereotypes
and/or sexual norms are mentioned. (17 incidences) (Chapter 7, Section 7.2.4)
Major themes among the counter claims include: resistance in terms of reading choices
and expectations of reading preferences; resistance in terms of the labeling of books for
young people; and resistance in terms of the subject matter of books for young people.
Forty-three examples are illustrative of incidences in which children indicate
resistance to  the  perceptions  of  the  adults’  perceptions  of  what they should be reading
based on whether they are male or female. Based on the data sampled, therefore, children
are a major force in terms of resistance to gendered reading. However, thirteen examples
also refer to incidences in which educators do not expect girls to prefer what are

303

commonly  perceived  to  be  “girl”-preferred  texts,  or  boys  to  prefer  “boy”-preferred texts.
Moreover, in fifteen incidences, bloggers and commenters, including parents, children
and young adults, adults of undetermined role, and a children’s  book  illustrator,  express  
the belief that  a  child’s  sex  should  not  influence  their  reading  preferences.
Twenty-one examples deal directly with resistance to the labeling of books for
young people as  “girl”- or “boy”- preferred. These examples include expressions of
resistance by parents, adults of undetermined role, teachers, a librarian, a child, and a
children’s  book  author.  
Finally, several counter claims refer to resistance in terms of the content in books
for young people. These include books that are reported to be gender-neutral, that is,
appealing to both boys and girls (29 examples), books that portray characters of color (14
examples), and books that portray characters who challenge gender stereotypes and/or
sexual norms (17 examples).
8.3 Limitations
The qualitative study described in this dissertation provides a particular view of
gendered literacy based on examples sampled from blogs included in the KidLitosphere.
Although a focus on the KidLitosphere has many advantages, in that the KidLitosphere is
a  key  site  in  which  various  aspects  of  young  people’s  reading  and  literature  are  discussed  
and it represents an unobtrusive way in which to study aspects of gendered literacy, it
also presents a major limitation of this study. Bloggers are not representative of the
general population, nor are they necessarily representative of the groups of interest.
Bloggers are self-selected commentators, who often write out of a desire to advocate for
or change their workplace (library or school, for example), their profession, or society as
a whole. Internet access and technological proficiency likely skew the class, age, and

304

other  aspects  of  the  bloggers’  demographics.  Moreover,  the  nature  of  blogging  is  such  
that things like the platform chosen, social connections, and the desire for anonymity (or
not) influence ranking and thus inclusion in this study. Blogs also represent an indirect
look at gendered literacy. For example, except for interviews with selected bloggers and
one  author  of  children’s  literature, the study does not directly query the bloggers
regarding gendered literacy. In most cases, the bloggers initiated their blogs in order to
reflect  on  and  review  children’s  and  young  adult  literature  rather  than  as  a  direct means
for them to comment on literacy as gendered.
Because the study was conducted in a naturalistic setting, and the primary
investigator served as the research instrument, the perspective is biased in terms of
conclusions made about the data. Moreover, the data sampled represents only a thin slice
of the blogs overall. Therefore, inferences made about gendered literacy based on the
data sampled are limited in scope.
8.4 Recommendations for Practice
8.4.1 Recommendations based on Claim 1. Conclusions and recommendations
for practice based on Claim 1 (Gendered reading preferences,  in  terms  of  educators’  
perceptions  of  boys’  reading  preferences and  labeling  of  “boy”  and  “girl”  books,  were  
important – 226 examples) and related sub- and counter claims are discussed in the
following sections.
Due  to  the  large  number  of  examples  that  were  coded  according  to  educators’  
labeling  of  children’s  books  as  boy- and girl-preferred (Claim1, Sub-claim 1, 72
examples) and  educators’  disparagement  of  children’s  books  using  gender  labeling  
(Claim 1, Sub-claims 6 and 7), it is recommended that educators avoid all labeling of

305

books according to boy/girl, in reading lists and in talking about books with children and
young adults. When choosing books to be included in the curriculum, teachers can
choose materials that are more gender-neutral in terms of their appeal.
As there are  a  large  number  of  examples  relating  to  educators’  perceptions  of  
boys’  reading preferences according to certain categories that are considered traditionally
male-preferred: stories with male protagonists, comics, graphic novels, science fiction,
adventure, non-fiction, sports, fantasy, gross humor, stories featuring vehicles, and
magazines (Claim 1, Sub-claim 2, 53 examples)  and  “iconic boy books,” (Claim 1, Subclaim 3, 43 examples), it is recommended that educators adjust their assumptions about
what boys will enjoy reading, especially due to the large number of examples in which
children express resistant, that is, not conforming to gender-normative reading
preferences (Claim 3, Counter claim A, 43 examples). Of those 43 examples, many refer
to  instances  of  children’s  preferences  for  protagonists  who  are of the opposite sex,
including three examples of book reviews written by boys. For this reason, Claim 1, Subclaim 4: educators’  expectations that boys prefer male protagonists and girls prefer
female protagonists, as well as their assumption that girls are more likely than boys to
read a story featuring a protagonist of the opposite sex, were evident (22), should also be
questioned.
Along with this, educators who work closely with children in terms of fostering
their literacy development may recognize that they are uniquely positioned to be change
agents in regard to encouraging both children and educators to read more broadly and to
cross gender barriers. They can do this through blogging; writing reviews of materials for
children and young adults; compiling reading lists; serving on book award committees;

306

organizing both virtual and physical displays; selecting and purchasing materials;
developing curricula and programs; and influencing those who produce materials for
young people. B7 blogger provides models of how to do this. She is materials selector for
the youth services department of a major library, blogs about youth literature, reviews
materials for youth for major publications, and is the author of an illustrated  children’s  
book. She has many acquaintances in the publishing world and attempts to wield
influence, as when she pushes for a re-illustrated version of William’s  Doll or a pink
cover for a book in the series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid. In another case, a female librarian
commenting on B7 demonstrates how educators may challenge parents’  preconceived  
notions of which materials are suitable for girls versus boys, recounting how, after
hearing  a  father  scolding  his  son  for  selecting  “girl”  books,  she went over to them and
assured the father that Olivia is a book that everyone likes (B7, 2012).
The data suggest that childhood reading is gendered. However, rather than
educators’  limiting their own reading tastes  or  assuming  that  one’s  own  sex  is  limiting  in  
terms of what one can recommend (as suggested by Claim 1, Sub- claim 5, which
discusses parents’ perception that their childhood identity as either a boy or girl, or
experience with children of only one sex, determines their qualifications to judge the
reading preferences of children of the opposite sex – 14), educators can branch out and
read things they would not normally read to equip themselves better to advise readers.
Moreover, they can encourage the forms of resistance identified in the data, including: a
refusal to label books  as  “girl”  and  “boy”  books (Claim 1, Counter claim A, 21 examples);
the belief that a  child’s  sex does not and/or should not influence their reading preferences
(Claim 1, Counter claim B, 15 examples); and a refusal to expect that children should like

307

texts that are considered normative in terms of boy and girl-preferred texts) (Claim 1,
Counter claim C, 13 examples).
8.4.2 Recommendations based on Claim 2. Conclusions and recommendations
for practice based on Claim 2 – gendered literacy behaviors (other than reading
preferences, as described separately) and perceptions of these behaviors – will be
described in this section.
Based on the following sub-claims: educators perceive that boys are both
“reluctant”  and  less  advanced readers (29); educators perceive that books and reading are
unwelcoming to boys (14); and, parents perceive that there are not enough "boy books"
available (13); working to change perceptions  of  boys’  reading is a priority. Although, for
example, the tendency based on perceptions may be to want to have exclusive boys-only
book clubs, activities, etc. the more appropriate response is to choose themes that will be
gender-neutral in terms of their appeal. Such themes could include books and series
recommended by educators as appealing to both boys and girls. Then, once there is a
broad participation base, educators can challenge children to try reading materials they
would not normally choose to read. For example, B6 blogger, a male teacher who uses
his blog primarily as a space in which to review books for children, in most cases does
not label books as gendered, but in other cases (4 total, among the data sampled) in which
he feels that boys will not even try a book because of the cover, title, or female
protagonist, he will specifically recommend that boys give a book a try. For instance,
concluding one review, he states that girls should definitely read the book and boys
should  not  be  scared  off  by  the  “princess”  aspects  and  give  it  a  try  (B6, 2010).

308

8.4.3 Recommendations based on Claim 3. In response to Claim 3 – the
prominence of gendered reading preferences,  in  terms  of  boys’  and  girls’  expressed
differing reading preferences (123 examples) and related sub-claims – girls’  reading
preferences often matched what are perceived to be traditional girl-preferred text types
(67 examples); and, boys’  reading preferences often matched what are perceived to be
traditional boy-preferred text types (56 examples), recommendations focus on educators
encouraging resistance in terms of reading preferences. This includes encouraging boys
to try reading books that  may  be  perceived  as  “girl”  books and vice versa. Parents
likewise can purchase, borrow, and read books together with their children that challenge
gender boundaries.
8.4.4 Recommendations based on Claim 4. Claim 4 – bloggers and commenters
describe  the  children’s  publishing  industry  in  the  United  States  as  female- and white dominated (35 examples), and related sub-claims – references to women (13) versus men
(5) in the children’s  book  publishing industry; and, mentions of white Caucasian bias in
character representation and cover art, especially in terms of a lack of African-American
males, in children's books published in the United States (17) lead to two
recommendations for practice. First, authors should produce more materials for young
people that challenge gender boundaries, and educators can encourage them to do so.
Secondly, publishers could publish more materials for young people that challenge
gender boundaries. Many bestsellers, like Harry Potter, have been works that have broad
appeal;;  for  example,  a  mother  comments  on  B4,  “This must be one reason (among many
others) why Harry Potter was so popular: boys  and  girls  could  relate  to  it”  (B4,  2010).
Therefore, there is no need to segment the reading audience into  “boys”  and  “girls.”  

309

Moreover, based on Claim 3, Counter claim A – children’s  expressions of resistant
literacy preferences (43 examples), and Claim 4, Counter claim B – mentions of specific
books, series, and genres that appear to appeal to both boys and girls (29 examples), a
captive audience awaits the publication of materials that are more gender-neutral in
appeal. Materials could also be marketed in a non-gendered way, as in not using the color
pink or depicting girls or boys on the cover.
The overall picture from the data sampled for this study is that of educators who
perceive literacy as a gendered phenomenon, dichotomized  as  “boy”/“girl,”  but  also  of  
many who are resistant toward these perceptions and serving as change agents in relation
to  gendered  literacy.  The  portrayal  of  children  is  even  more  inspiring,  as  boys’  love  of  
reading is evident in the data, and children review and express preferences for a broad
range of reading materials (including those that would be expected to be preferred by the
opposite sex).  A  mother  comments  on  B4,  “I see my independently reading son, my son
who loves to be read to, and my daughter who is just developing the attention span for a
story, and I want to give them all things they'll love”  (B4, 2010). Combined with the
specific recommendations for practice discussed above, the statement encapsulates the
main  outcome  of  this  study:  recognition  of  the  need  to  encourage  children’s  reading  and  
literacy in a way that focuses on gender as little as possible.
8.5 Future Directions
Future study of gendered literacy would take both a macro and micro approach.
One study would focus on confirming the aspects of gendered literacy identified in the
study on a larger scale, using a survey-based methodology. Another study could examine
whether the conceptions of gendered literacy identified in the West (and specifically in

310

the U.S., in this study) hold in other countries and cultures. For example, the National
Library Board of Singapore in 2007 began the ongoing “10,000 & More Fathers Reading!”  
program with  the  goal  “to  increase  fathers’  involvement  in  their  children’s  literacy  
development and to improve the quality of father-child  relationships” (National Library
Board Singapore, 2014). Such a program implies that parent-child reading in Singapore is
perceived to be mother- rather than father-initiated. Are there similar programs in other
places, and how do the assumptions/goals of such programs differ? The data sampled for
this U.S. – based study showed slightly more examples of mothers reading with their
children  or  encouraging  their  children’s  reading  than  fathers  but  did  not  reveal  much  in  
the way of perceptions about mothers versus fathers reading.
In terms of a micro approach to gendered literacy, further study is also needed in
order to better understand how people form perceptions of gender and reading and how
young people internalize these impressions. Such a study could include observation of the
reading practices of children and interviews with children in schools, in libraries, and in
homes.
Together these macro and micro approaches to research on gendered literacy
would help explain how and why gender and literacy are so closely connected and also
how they may be disentangled.

Summary of
Blog (based on
the posts
analyzed)

This blogger reads
children’s  books  in  his  
leisure time, both in the
evening at home and while
on vacation. He specifically
looks for books that
reluctant readers, &
especially boys, will enjoy
reading. He actively seeks
recommendations of such
books, reading book
reviews & reviewing books
himself. He is a teacher and
specifically views himself
as a teacher of reading. He
both reads aloud to his
students  &  leads  a  boys’  
book club. Although he
enjoys  reading  children’s  
books, he also finds that it
takes time. He enjoys
reading short texts that
require less time to read.
Though he enjoys
encouraging reluctant
readers to read, he also
finds that this takes time.
He also feels that finding
good  children’s  books  
requires time & money. He
believes that finding the
“perfect”  book  is  key  to  
drawing in reluctant
readers.

This blogger reads &
reviews YA books. She
finds reading YA books
pleasurable. In blogging
about books, she does
the following: predicts
whether other readers
will like the YA books
she has read & reviewed;
references other blogs,
Barnes & Noble book
descriptions, and
Goodreads; and, she
compares books. She
also plans what she will
read next and informs
an( imagined?) audience
of publishers & authors
about what types of
books she would like to
read more of.

This blogger reads & reviews
children’s  books,  in  the  context  of  
reading with her young son in the
evenings before he goes to bed. They
read together every night even if they
are tired. They read a variety of print
texts, including phonics readers,
short chapter books, & non-fiction
early readers. She also takes her son
to the library weekly and selects
books for them to check out. Her
son’s  school  homework  is  to  read  for  
15 minutes each day and record the
books he has read in a reading log.
This blogger does not think reading
should be assigned as homework
(she implies that reading together
should already be a home practice
and is judgmental of other parents
who she imagines would not read to
their child unless it is required as
homework). She notes that she has
read to her son daily since he was an
infant. At the same time, she notes
that she often finds reading with her
son (as he works to become an
independent reader) frustrating.
However, she is pleased that her son
stays focused while reading at
bedtime even though he is tired. She
notes that he enjoys reading and feels
a sense of accomplishment when he
is able to read all the words in a
book. He often memorizes words
from  a  story’s  narrative  as  they  read,  
and by the second reading can recite
words. However, she fears that
school-based reading will become
something her son resists.

her son love reading.

Specific concepts:

Specific concepts:

Prolific reading of YA
fiction

She reads with her son at bedtime
daily even when they are tired.

Prolific blogging, in
which she references
other blogs, Barnes &
Noble book descriptions,
and Goodreads, about
YA fiction. She also
informs an imagined
audience of publishers &
authors about what types
of books she would like
to read more of,
including science fiction.
However, all the books
she reviews in these
posts are girl-oriented.

It is important that he stay focused,
read phonics reader, read all the
words, read a text more than once,
develop a sense of story and memory
for plot, work up to reading longer
books, & become an independent
reader.

Specific concepts:

Converting the reluctant
reader as hard work,
requiring significant
outputs of time and money
to find good books.

Short text requiring less
time to read is desirable
(both for him and for
reluctant readers).

2 of books reviewed are
boy-oriented. 1 is more
neutral (rationale?)

She also takes him to the library on a
weekly basis. She chooses books for
him to read.

Her son enjoys reading (although she
fears he will come to dislike it).

She specifically refers to books as
more boy-oriented.

Title of Study:
Gendered Literacy and Social Media: A Study of the KidLitosphere Blogs
Principal Investigator:
Emily Seitz
School of Communication & Information
Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey
4 Huntington Street
New Brunswick, NJ 08901
You are invited to participate in a research study conducted by Emily Seitz, a doctoral student in
the Library and Information Science department of the School of Communication and
Information (SC&I) at Rutgers University. The overall goal of the study is to develop an
integrated conceptual model of gender in relation to literacy (gendered literacy). More
specifically, the study aims to articulate patterns and resistances in the ways in which literacy
educators (parents, public librarians, school librarians, and teachers), literacy learners (children
and young adults), and creators of reading materials for young people (published authors, editors,
and published illustrators), understand the connection between gender and literacy in U.S.
culture.
You, in addition to three other bloggers, are being asked to participate in this study because of
the  nature  of  your  blog  about  children’s  and/or  young  adult  literature.  Participation  in  this  study  
will involve an interview (either face-to-face, by phone, or via Skype) lasting approximately 3060 minutes. Any follow-up questions after the interview will be sent to you by email.
No risks to you are anticipated as a result of your participation in this study. Participation in this
study is at no cost to you other than your time.
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate, and you may
withdraw at any time during the study without penalty. Moreover, you may choose not to answer
any questions you find uncomfortable.
The data gathered during this study will be kept confidential. The research records will include
some identifying information, such as your name, the title of your blog, and your job title.
However, the research records will be kept confidential; access to them will be limited to the
principal investigator and they will be kept in a secure location. The research team and the
Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only parties that will be allowed to see
the data, except as may be required by law. If a report of this study is published, or the results are
presented at a professional conference, your name will not be associated with your responses, nor
will your blog be referred to by title.
