ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS’ TEACHER IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE
SCHOLARSHIP OF TEACHING AND LEARNING: A MIXED METHODS STUDY
by
Lauren Hays

ABSTRACT
This dissertation was an explanatory sequential mixed methods study that sought to
understand academic librarians’ involvement and experience in the Scholarship of
Teaching and Learning (SoTL). Specifically, the researcher studied academic librarians’
teacher identity development through SoTL. Quantitative data were collected from a
survey sent to the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
listserv. Semi-structured interviews with seven academic instruction librarians who took
part in the survey provided qualitative data that complemented and built upon the survey
results. The theoretical framework, Communities of Practice, guided and supported the
research. Results from the study indicated that academic instruction librarians are involved
in SoTL for a variety of reasons, but primarily because they believe participation in SoTL
improves their teaching. Also, the null hypothesis of if librarians engage in the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, their identities will be the same as they were before
was rejected, and the research hypothesis was accepted. Engagement in SoTL does impact
academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity. After involvement in SoTL most research
participants reported that their view of themselves as a teacher grew. Participation in SoTL
also impacted academic instruction librarians’ instructional practices. After participation in
SoTL, study participants reported an increase in their attitude toward self-improvement and
in their use of active learning strategies. These study findings have implications for
Library and Information Science (LIS) graduate schools, academic library administrations,
and professional development organizations.

Introduction
A professional identity is missing from the field of librarianship (Atkins, 2003; Davis,
Lundstrom, & Martin, 2011; Freedman, 2014; Walter, 2008). For over a century, the identity of
librarians has been ill-defined (Freedman, 2014). Often, scholars view librarians as the
caretakers of books. In the past, this view of librarians was in keeping with the responsibilities
of the job. Since Alexandria, librarians have housed, preserved, and made the written word
available (Battles, 2003; Drabinski, 2016). With the advent of the Information Age, though,
librarians’ roles have evolved. Specifically, in higher education, the role of librarians has
changed tremendously (Drabinski, 2016; Ellis, Rosenblum, Stratton, & Ames-Stratton, 2014;
Goetsch, 2008; Jaguszewski & Williams, 2013; Karasmanis & Murphy, 2014).
Today, as part of their job responsibilities, many librarians in colleges and universities
teach (Bewick & Corrall, 2010; Davies-Hoffman, Alvarez, Costello, & Emerson, 2013; Hall,
2017; Matlin & Carr, 2014). Despite librarians teaching for over 100 years, the past few decades
have led to change in the skills librarians instruct on and the type of educating librarians conduct
(Walter, 2005a; Warner & Seamans, 2004). Indeed, the teaching of information literacy skills is
a main job requirement for all academic librarians (Houtman, 2010; Julien, Gross, & Latham,
2017). The responsibility of instruction, though, is only one of the many roles librarians must
adopt. The traditional job functions of collection manager and reference work remain a
requirement for many academic librarians working today, and library schools still teach those
traditional skills (Bronstein, 2011; Freedman, 2014; Goetsch, 2008; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010).
Therefore, academic librarians struggle with their professional identity due to the many roles
they must fulfill. Librarians use the services they provide as a marker of their professional

2

identity and altering their professional persona is difficult because librarians are connected to
their traditional work responsibilities (Freedman, 2014; Hicks, 2016; Stauffer, 2014; Zai, 2014).
As a result, the adopted career characteristics of librarians does not always include the role of
teacher, despite the fact that teaching is an important requirement for many academic librarians’
jobs (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Hagman, 2015; Julien & Genuis, 2011; Wheeler & McKinney,
2015).
Librarians can grow in their teaching by becoming involved in professional
organizations, participating in communities of practice, and asking for feedback from peers
(McGuinness, 2011; Osborn, 2017). Perini (2014) and Bradley (2009) recommended that
librarians become involved in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL). SoTL is a
relatively new field of research wherein higher education faculty members study the learning that
takes place in their classrooms. Studies grounded in SoTL research provide strong evidence of
instruction and guide the improvement of teaching methods (Kern, Mettetal, Dixson, & Morgan,
2015). Opportunely, engagement in SoTL can have an impact on identity (Mårtensson, Roxå, &
Olsson, 2011; McLean, 2009; Roxå, Olsson, & Mårtensson, 2007). Similar to librarians, faculty
have discipline-specific identities, and a teacher identity is not a guarantee for those working in
higher education (Henkel, 2005; Poole, Taylor, & Thompson, 2007; Trigwell, 2013). However,
researchers have shown SoTL to be valuable in helping university professors adopt a teacher
identity. There is room in SoTL for librarians’ involvement—not only to expand their
pedagogical knowledge but also to gain a deeper understanding of their teaching role (Bennet et
al., 2016; Bradley, 2009; Mitchell & Mitchell, 2015; Perini, 2014).

3

Statement of the Problem
The purpose of this study was to explore the development of librarians’ teacher identity
through involvement in SoTL. There is a gap between the current mindset of many academic
librarians and the reality of their job expectations (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Hagman, 2015;
Julien & Genuis, 2011; Julien & Pecoskie, 2009; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). Today, many
academic librarians serve in the role of instructors but do not identify as educators (Freedman,
2014; Houtman, 2010). Teacher identity is important because researchers have connected an
instructor’s view of himself/herself to the effectiveness of the educator and subsequently to
student learning (Day, 2008; Day & Kington, 2008; Harlow & Cobb, 2014; Mansfield, Beltman,
& Price, 2014).
Many college and university faculty members do not receive formal training in teaching
methods (Bok, 2013; Leibowitz, 2015; Oleson & Hora, 2014). However, faculty members
trained in specific disciplines are not surprised by the instructional responsibilities of their jobs
(Bishop, Boyle, Carpenter, & Hermanson, 2016; Connolly & Lee, 2015; Sare, Bales, & Neville,
2012). Academic librarians, though, do not always enter the profession expecting to teach
(Davis, 2007; Hall, 2017; Houtman, 2010; Julien & Genuis, 2011; Oud, 2008). This
unanticipated duty can lead to challenges when teaching is part of librarians’ professional
responsibilities (Hall, 2017; Julien & Genuis, 2011; Slavin & Mead, 2008). Relatedly, there is
variation in enjoyment and acceptance of teaching in the library profession (Ariew, 2014; Hall,
2017; McGuinness, 2011). Nonetheless, teaching will remain a job requirement for academic
librarians and it is important to find ways for librarians to adopt a teacher identity (Brecher &
Klipfel, 2014; Davies-Hoffman et al., 2013; Julien & Genuis, 2011; Loesch, 2010; Roy &
Hensley, 2016).

4

Commonality exists between how higher education faculty members and academic
librarians learn to teach (Walter, 2005a). Writers in the college teaching literature suggest that
faculty members take advantage of professional development opportunities available on their
own campus (Lieff et al., 2012; Thomas & Goswami, 2013; Walter, 2005a). Teaching faculty
members frequently use their institution’s Center for Teaching and Learning or equivalent
division for development opportunities, and SoTL is often supported from within that department
(Austin & Sorcinelli, 2013; Bradley, 2009). Teachers grow in their self-assurance when they
know that their methods are effective (Bissonnette & Caprino, 2014; Davies-Hoffman et al.,
2013; Otto, 2014). Professors who participate in SoTL desire to see their abilities increase to
support student learning (Kahn, Goodhew, Murphy, & Walsh, 2013; Michael, 2012). Faculty
members’ interest in supporting learning is good because the goal of SoTL is to increase student
learning (McKinney, 2006).
McCormick (2003) encouraged librarians to follow the path of other teaching faculty to
improve their instruction. A commitment by librarians to engage with the pedagogical experts
on campus will keep librarians from being lone scholars (McCormick, 2003). SoTL provides an
opportunity for librarians to gain knowledge about their teaching, and through an increase in
self-knowledge, build confidence in teaching (Elton, 2009). An increased confidence will
support the growth of a professional teacher identity in librarians (Hsieh, 2010). This study
examined the development of librarians’ teacher identity through involvement in SoTL.
Background
The teaching role is not new for librarians’ (Walter, 2005a; Warner & Seamans, 2004).
However, teaching is irregularly, and often minimally, included in Library and Information
Science (LIS) curriculums (Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Goodsett & Koziura, 2016; Hall, 2017;

5

Hensley, 2015; Houtman, 2010). Studies have shown that librarians do not learn many of the
necessary instruction skills during their library school coursework (Davies-Hoffman et al., 2013;
Hensley, 2015; Houtman, 2010; Saunders, 2015; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). The teacher role
is one that librarians sometimes do not feel comfortable inhabiting because they often have
limited instruction experience and do not identify as educators (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Davis,
2007; Goodsett & Koziura, 2016; Houtman, 2010). Still, a teacher identity is critical for
effective instruction thereby indicating the need for librarians to adopt the persona of a teacher
(Day, 2008; Day & Kington, 2008).
In a study of primary and secondary teachers, Hsieh (2010) discovered that increased
confidence supports the growth of a teacher identity. Schepens, Aelterman, and Vlerick (2009)
ascertained that the key factor contributing to primary and secondary teachers’ self-efficacy was
their belief that their teacher education program prepared them well for the teaching profession.
Again, librarians do not participate in teacher education programs during their LIS coursework
(Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Goodsett & Koziura, 2016; Hensley, 2015). Researchers have stated
that due to education courses not being included as part of LIS coursework, librarians lack the
training to be fully prepared for their instruction role and the adoption of a teacher identity
(Houtman, 2010; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). The absence of graduate program support for
instruction librarians is concerning because research has shown that teacher identities and teacher
effectiveness are linked (Day, 2008; Day, Stobart et al., 2006; Hensley, 2015; Sammons et al.,
2007). The connection between how teachers view themselves and their effect on student
learning underscores the importance of this study.
Often, professional development that occurs while on the job is where librarians learn
how to be effective teachers (Bewick & Corrall, 2010; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). Engagement

6

in on the job training is common for librarians and indicates the importance many librarians
place on their teaching responsibilities once they start their career (Austin & Bhandol, 2013;
Bolan, Bellamy, Rolheiser, Szurmak, & Vine, 2015; Buck, 2014; Maggio, Durieux, & Tannery,
2015; Otto, 2014; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). SoTL, an area of research on teaching in higher
education and a faculty development tool, has been shown to be useful in impacting postsecondary faculty members’ professional identities (McLean, 2009; Mårtensson et al., 2011;
Roxå et al., 2007). From research conducted using focus groups, formal SoTL training was also
shown to impact identities (Mathany, Clow, & Aspenlieder, 2017). Simmons et al. (2013)
discovered that SoTL scholars find themselves in “liminal space” with their professional
identities (p. 10). With new experiences to navigate, SoTL scholars’ identities are not concrete
and change over time. A navigation of identities often causes uncertainty in SoTL scholars as
they undertake new roles and tasks. Despite uncertainty caused by the role of SoTL in their
professional lives, a narrative analysis of SoTL scholars’ perspectives showed SoTL created an
adaptable professional identity that allowed for growth (Simmons et al., 2013). Consequently,
SoTL’s impact on the professional identities of librarians is worth further study. With changes in
academic library job responsibilities, the adoption of a teacher identity is important (Drabinski,
2016; Hall, 2013; Maata, 2014; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015; Saunders, 2015).
Recently, teaching effectiveness in higher education settings has grown in importance
(De Courcy, 2015; Kern et al., 2015). Yet, professors do not always know that their pedagogical
practices help students learn. SoTL helps to increase teacher efficacy by having instructors ask
questions about the learning that takes place in their classrooms (O’Brien, 2008). When teachers
know their instructional methods are effective, they grow in confidence (Bissonnette & Caprino,

7

2014; Davies-Hoffman et al., 2013; Otto, 2014). Accordingly, engagement in SoTL may
influence librarians’ effectiveness and identity (Geertsema, 2016; O’Brien, 2008).
Research Questions
In mixed methods studies, the research questions are important to the methodology
(Hanson, Creswell, Plano Clark, Petska, & Creswell, 2005; Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006).
Quantitative and qualitative methods were necessary in order to provide a breadth and depth of
understanding to a topic that had been understudied. The goal of this research study was to
understand academic librarians’ involvement and experience in SoTL. Specifically, the
researcher studied academic librarians’ teacher identity development through SoTL. Heretofore,
little was known about academic librarians’ engagement and participation in SoTL (Bradley,
2009; Perini, 2014). The questions that framed this study were pertinent to the problem and
related to the literature (Marshall & Rossman, 2016; Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007;
Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006; Teddlie & Yu, 2007). Accordingly, the research questions
addressed by this study were:
1. What reasons do academic instruction librarians state for their participation in the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning?
2. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ teacher identity?
3. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ instruction?

Significance of the Study
Research findings have informed the higher education community about SoTL’s impact
on identities and teaching effectiveness (Poole et al., 2007; Simmons et al., 2013). However,
based on the review of the literature conducted by this researcher a formal study of librarians’
participation in SoTL has not been published. This study may fill gaps in the professional
literature on librarians’ involvement in SoTL and on how librarians’ participation in SoTL
affects their teacher identity (Bradley, 2009; MacMillan, 2015; Otto, 2014; Perini, 2014). The
research also contributes to an understanding of librarians’ involvement in SoTL and adds to the
knowledge base by helping readers understand how involvement in SoTL affects librarians’
teacher identity. Study results may be useful for members of the academic library community
and members of the SoTL community. The findings establish a foundational understanding of
academic instruction librarians’ participation in SoTL. As previously stated, opinion pieces have

11

been written about librarians and SoTL, but research has not been conducted (Bradley, 2009;
MacMillan, 2015; Otto, 2014; Perini, 2014).
The academic library community may benefit from an increase in understanding
instruction librarians’ views of their professional identity and how a specific professional
development model, SoTL, affects that identity. This outcome potentially fills multiple gaps in
the field, including the need for greater understanding of academic librarians’ professional
identity as a teacher, the need to understand how professional development affects academic
instruction librarians, and an identified gap in the literature on librarians’ participation in SoTL
(Freedman, 2014; Houtman, 2010; Walter, 2005b; Walter, 2008). Previous researchers
recommended engaging in further study to understand how often, and under what circumstances,
librarians seek out assistance from other librarians and the broader higher education community
in order to improve their teaching (Houtman 2010; Walter, 2005b).
In addition to the library community, the SoTL community may benefit from this
research because the study will potentially aid in understanding the value of SoTL as a
professional development tool and supports the understanding of how involvement in SoTL
affects professional identities (Meyers, 2007). A deeper grasp of SoTL’s effect on professional
identities is a valuable outcome for the broad higher education community and more specifically
for faculty developers (Johnson & Goodson, 2015; Meyers, 2007; Roxå et al., 2007; Simmons et
al., 2013). Further, the SoTL community gains from learning about librarians’ participation in
SoTL. This information is important for understanding potential support for SoTL projects
(McVeigh, 2011). Despite Trigwell’s (2013) finding that SoTL was useful for improving student
learning when higher education faculty participated in it, numerous gaps still exist in the

12

literature on how SoTL influences professional development (Johnson & Goodson, 2015;
Mitchell & Mitchell, 2015).
Lastly, the education community may benefit from the results of this study due to the
connection between teacher identity and teaching effectiveness. When instructors possess a
teacher identity, their teaching methods are often more effective (Day, 2008; Day, Stobart et al.,
2006; Sammons et al., 2007). Therefore, the results of Research Question 3 were potentially
valuable in understanding the connection between engagement in SoTL and instruction. The
definition of teacher identity is not conclusive, and this study may help clarify the makeup of
librarians’ teacher identities (Beijaard et al., 2004; Beauchamp & Thomas, 2009; Hsieh, 2010).
While researchers have studied the impact of mentors and the impact of early career settings on
teacher identity there are gaps in research on other influences of teacher identity (Beauchamp &
Thomas, 2009; Izadinia, 2015).
This dissertation is also significant because it builds on a theory used extensively in
higher education and the library community—the Communities of Practice theoretical
framework (Wenger, 1998), which strengthened this research study. Communities of practice
have framed previous research on teacher identity (Correa, Martinez-Arbelaiz, & Gutierrez,
2014). Nonetheless, research gaps still exist around the theory of Communities of Practice
(Nistor, Daxecker, Stancui, Diekamp, 2015; Wenger, 1998), and Nistor et al. (2015)
recommended a mixed methods study for further research on communities of practice. Although
additional study is needed to understand the conversations around communities of practice in
higher education (Ryan, 2015), this study possibly filled research methods gaps because it
utilized communities of practice to determine if engagement in SoTL influences librarians’
teacher identity (Wenger, 1998).

13
In summary, this dissertation aids in understanding SoTL’s impact on the professional
teacher identity of librarians. Through knowledge of the impact of SoTL on teacher identity
development, these findings help librarians make decisions about professional development and
become better connected to the higher education community. In conclusion, the findings of this
study add to the body of literature on librarians’ participation in SoTL and on librarians’
professional identities.
Theoretical Framework
In Lave and Wenger’s (1991) Social Learning Theory, communities of practice are the
primary characteristic. In this theory, people learn, create meaning, and form identities through
their involvement with others in the community (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). Thus,
groups of people participating in a system affect how individuals in the group see themselves
(Wenger, 1998). Given that identity was a primary focus of this study, communities of practice
framed the formation of this study’s research methods and the understanding of the results.
Wenger’s theory has supported research and the actions of many in the library, higher education,
and SoTL communities (Clark, Partridge, & Peterson, 2017; Green, Ruutz, Houghton, Hibbins,
2017; Hagman, 2015; Handley, Sturdy, Fincham, & Clark, 2006; Jawitz, 2009; Nistor et al.,
2014; Pharo, Davison, McGregor, Warr, & Brown, 2013; Ryan, 2015). Due to extensive use of
communities of practice in related publications, the theoretical framework fit the current study.
Overview of Research Methods
A person’s identity is individual, yet it is affected by their involvement in communities
(Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, & Caine, 2001; Wenger, 1998). Therefore, due to the complex
nature of identity, the researcher sought to understand what influenced identity and why
identities were influenced. To answer the study’s questions, the researcher conducted an

14

explanatory sequential mixed methods study. Mixed methods studies include quantitative and
qualitative data, thus allowing for a variety of analysis (Creswell, 2014). The researcher
determined a mixed methods study was the most suitable design for the proposed study because
the mixing of methods allowed for a thorough answering of the research questions (Venkatesh,
Brown, & Sullivan, 2016). Additionally, the use of a mixed methods approach acknowledged
the benefit of both quantitative and qualitative discoveries to have a well-rounded view of the
results (Leech & Onwugbuzie, 2009; Sale, Lohfeld, & Brazil, 2002). By integrating quantitative
and qualitative research methods, the researcher improved the value of the research (Bryman,
2006; Ivankova, Creswell, & Stick, 2006). Consequently, conducting a mixed methods study was
appropriate for understanding the breadth and depth of the research results (Denzin, 2012;
Johnson et al., 2007).
Decisions regarding the study method and design were conducted sequentially in order
for results to guide other research design components (Hanson et al., 2005). The primary
rationale for a mixed methods approach was complementarity (Bryman, 2006; Greene et al.,
1989). In other words, the results from the qualitative data collection complemented, clarified,
and expanded on the quantitative data. Complementarity also allows for similarities or overlays
in the data analysis. Therefore, the qualitative results complemented the numerical data and
added depth to the study (Greene et al., 1989; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003).
The second rationale for a mixed methods approach was development (Greene et al., 1989).
A development rationale for a mixed methods study means that the findings from the quantitative
data aided the researcher in the development of the qualitative data collection tools (Greene et al.,
1989; Ivankova et al., 2006). Survey participants were asked if they have participated in SoTL.

15

If they answered in the affirmative, then the rest of the survey was revealed. Research Questions
1, 2, and 3 were answered with both quantitative and qualitative data.
The theoretical framework directed the development of the survey and interview questions.
The researcher adapted survey questions from the University of Wisconsin’s Teaching and
Learning Impact Survey (Meyers, 2007). For Research Question 1, the survey data helped the
researcher determine which librarians were involved in SoTL. Then the data collected from the
semi-structured interviews answered the question. To analyze the ordinal data from the Likert
scales on the survey to answer Research Questions 2 and 3, the researcher conducted a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test (Field, 2013). The statistical test allowed the researcher to test the mean
difference between two observations—before involvement in SoTL and after involvement in
SoTL (Laerd Statistics, 2015b). Moreover, the null hypothesis was that if librarians engage in
the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, their teacher identities will be the same as they were
before.
In the quantitative data gathering portion of the study, the researcher collected data from
a volunteer convenience sample using a survey sent to the Information Literacy listserv of the
Association of College and Research Libraries (Teddlie & Yu, 2007). At the time of the study,
the listserv had 6,163 subscribers (M. Heuer, personal communication, 2017). Subscribers to the
Information Literacy listserv are typically academic librarians whose job responsibilities include
teaching information literacy, or they are librarians who want to engage in the conversation around
this topic (American Library Association, 2016). To gather the qualitative data, the researcher
conducted semi-structured interviews with seven librarians (n=7) who represented the population
that took the survey. Also, the interviewees participated in the survey and indicated that they
were willing to be interviewed. Initial interview questions were adapted from Walter’s (2008)

16
study on librarians’ teacher identity. After reviewing survey results, the researcher modified
Walter’s interview questions from findings from the collected quantitative data (Fetters, Curry,
& Creswell, 2013). The qualitative data were coded for themes (Marshall & Rossman, 2016).

Chapter II
Review of Literature
Introduction
A review of the literature found that teaching is now a requirement for academic
librarians (Hall, 2013; Maata, 2014; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015; Saunders, 2015). However,
the adoption of a teacher identity by librarians in higher education was not a smooth road. A
variety of role expectations led to nebulous characteristics for librarians, and now librarians must
adopt the role of a teacher (Freedman, 2014; Gray, 2013). In order to fully engage with their
role, the development of a teacher identity is important for librarians to adopt (Bullough, 1997;
Hagman, 2015). Nevertheless, there are barriers to librarians adopting the identity of teacher.
Formal instructional education is rarely embedded into LIS curriculum. Due to this limitation, in
the past and currently, librarians learn many of the required teaching skills on the job; the
professional development necessary to adopt a teacher identity is sparse (Bewick & Corrall,
2010; Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Davis, 2007; Goodsett & Koziura, 2016; Hall, 2013; Matlin &
Carr, 2014; Walter, 2006, 2008; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010).
The literature indicates that librarians are interested in their teaching (Bewick & Corrall,
2010; McGuinness, 2011; Sproles, Detmering, & Johnson, 2013; Walter, 2008), but there are
challenges in creating a common culture for academic instruction librarians that allows librarians
to adopt a teacher identity. Academic librarians have stated that multiple demands and an
overlap in job responsibilities contributed to the lack of a common culture (Bronstein, 2011;
Freedman, 2014; Goetsch, 2008; Seymour, 2012; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). Librarians have
also reported feelings of isolation in their roles (Orbell-Smith, 2012; Seymour, 2012). The
factors contributing to a lack of clear identity has led to professional struggles when teaching is a

18

significant aspect of a librarian’s job (Freedman, 2014; Zai, 2014). Teacher identity is important
because a teacher’s identity is linked to the quality of his or her instruction (Day & Kington,
2008; Sammons et al., 2007). With academic librarians expanding their teaching responsibilities,
the quality of their instruction is critical (Davies-Hoffman et al., 2013; Houtman, 2010).
Bradley (2009) encouraged librarians to engage in the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning, an area of discipline-specific research wherein instructors study their teaching and
share their findings. Researchers have shown that participation with SoTL results in the growth
of a teacher identity among university professors (Mårtensson et al., 2011). Much of SoTL work
occurs in communities; humans form identities through shared experiences with a community
(Michael, 2012; Mighty, 2015; Potter & Kustra, 2011; Wenger, 1998). When instructors take
part in SoTL, they often engage with a community of peers (Barnard et al., 2011; Kahn et al.,
2013; Michael, 2012), and despite being an international movement, SoTL has many
characteristics of a community of practice. Members of higher education involved in SoTL have
the same goal of improving teaching to improve student learning. Moreover, Lave and Wenger
(1991) found individuals’ identities are connected to their ability to contribute to the community.
SoTL participants regularly share their findings as well as support and analyze each other’s
research (Fanghanel et al., 2016; Shulman, 1999). Understanding the work of others in an
individual’s community leads to individuals identifying more closely with the group (Lave &
Wenger, 1991).
Identities are composed of many factors (Kelchtermans, 1993). For example, teachers’
personal values and experiences affected their identity as a teacher (Day & Kington, 2008;
Jephcote & Salisbury, 2009). In addition, identities are formed through internal and external
factors (Hicks, 2014; Kelchtermans, 1993; Walter, 2008; Wenger, 1998). Librarians’ identity

19

formation aligns with these statements. Academic librarians have many factors that contribute to
their professional identity, and research has shown that circumstances affect librarians’ identities
(Austin & Bhandol; 2013; Hagman, 2015). However, despite librarians struggling with their
professional teaching identities, there is minimal literature on this topic (Davis et al., 2011;
Freedman, 2014; Walter, 2008).
Similarly, the literature on librarians’ engagement with SoTL is also sparse. Despite the
need for many librarians to teach, few librarians have sought to engage in the broad academic
discussions on the best practices of teaching (Bradley, 2009; Perini, 2014). As stated earlier,
participation in SoTL can have an impact on professional identities (Mårtensson et al., 2011;
McLean, 2009; Roxå et al., 2007). Synthesizing the literature is necessary for understanding the
background and current setting of this study. The following literature review provides the
context and justification for this research on how participation in SoTL affects librarians’ teacher
identity. Included in the review of the literature are sections that combine information on
librarians, SoTL, and teacher identity. The sections in the literature review are an overview of
the theoretical framework, the history of teaching by librarians, the instructional proficiencies
and responsibilities of librarians, the professional identity of librarians as teachers, the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and librarians and the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning. The researcher supported each section with the Communities of Practice theoretical
framework.
Theoretical Framework
In this study, the researcher explored the concept of a teacher identity in librarians. This
study is rooted in the work of Wenger (1998). Wenger wrote of a social theory of learning and
specifically called social learning interactions communities of practice. Through engagement in

20

social learning settings, members create meaning, engage in practice, build community, and form
identities. Communities of practice are the social structure that allows much of this social
learning to occur. Continued involvement in a community leads to persons identifying with the
community (Lave & Wenger, 1991).
Engagement in communities of practice is complex. Individuals interact with many
people throughout their day, but only a certain number of those interactions take part within a
community of practice. Figure 1 illustrates how individuals interact and engage with
communities of practice (Wenger & Wenger-Traynor, n.d.).

Wenger and B. Wenger-Traynor, n.d. (http://wenger-trayner.com/project/levels-of-

participation/). Reprinted with permission (Appendix A).
For this study, the focus was on identity development through SoTL, which is framed as
a community of practice. Additionally, the researcher considered the other attributes of a social
learning setting and applied the theory where appropriate. However, the focus of the study is on

21

identity development. Wenger (1998) described the component of identity in social learning as
“a way of talking about how learning changes who we are and creates personal histories of
becoming in the context of our communities” (p. 5).
To understand the conceptual framework of the Communities of Practice social learning
theory, one must start with four premises:
1) We are social beings. Far from being trivially true, this fact is a central aspect of
learning.
2) Knowledge is a matter of competence with respect to valued enterprises—such as
singing in tune, discovering scientific facts, fixing machines, writing poetry, being
convivial, growing up as a boy or a girl, and so forth.
3) Knowing is a matter of participating in the pursuit of such enterprises, that is, of active
engagement in the world.
4) Meaning—our ability to experience the world and our engagement with it as
meaningful—is ultimately what learning is to produce. (Wenger, 1998, p. 4)
These stated assumptions underlie the work of this study.
Researchers have suggested that communities of practice were useful models for higher
education to utilize to encourage collaboration, interdisciplinary teaching, and complex problem
solving (Kissel et al., 2016; Pharo et al., 2013). At Loyola Marymount University, researchers
found that communities of practice help build community involvement to support SoTL (August
& Dewar, 2010). In addition, librarians have used communities of practice to foster identity
development (Belzowski, Ladwig, & Miller, 2013). Communities of practice were able to affect
identity through both formal and informal settings (Correa et al., 2014).

22

Despite the use of communities of practice for identity development, not all communities
have consistent identities. Multiple identities can exist within one community of practice. The
occurrence of more than one identity in a community can cause tension to arise among the
participants. Character choices also create options for career paths, and those too can lead to
tension. In effect, a single community of practice does not guarantee a cohesive identity (Jawitz,
2009). Nonetheless, when members of the same social group work together in similar pursuits,
common identities form (Wenger, 1998). Still, both individual and group identities exist in
communities and that leads to the need for individual and collective negotiation as individuals
determine how they view themselves (Wenger, 1998). Some have written that the primary way
identities are developed is through discourse. Discourse allows for negotiation of those
conflicting identity components (Correa et al., 2014). Wenger (1998) wrote that engaging in a
practice with a group was the primary conduit to identity development. Thus, in terms of
identity in communities of practice, identity is


negotiated experience



community membership



learning trajectory



nexus of multimembership



a relation between the local and the global (Wenger, 1998, p. 149).

Of particular relevance to this study is when identity is formed through community membership
a person’s view of themselves creates a sense of ability and proficiency in the shared practice
(Wenger, 1998).

23

History of Teaching by Librarians
For many years, a need for library instruction within higher education did not exist
(Hopkins, 1982; Salony, 1995). Academic programs were extremely specialized, and scholars
knew the literature in their fields. As institutions of higher learning opened their doors to more
students and offered more general education courses, the need to instruct on library usage
became a necessity (Hopkins, 1982; Salony, 1995). Additionally, the changes in curriculum,
student demographics, and technology expanded the role of librarian to one wherein a librarian is
also a teacher (O’Connor, 2009; Walter, 2008).
Originally, library instruction equated to bibliographic instruction. Academic librarians
were often faculty members with part-time appointments in the library. Due to this fact, the
focus of librarians in higher education contexts was on teaching the academic uses of library
collections (Hopkins, 1982). Academic librarians taught classification schemes and
bibliographic organization (Hopkins, 1982). Included in bibliographic instruction were the
teaching of research skills and instruction on how information was organized (Shill, 1987).
Bibliographic instruction was a precursor to the information literacy instruction librarians
provide today (Julien & Pecoskie, 2009).
Information literacy was a term first used by Paul Zurkowski in 1974 when he was
president of the Information Industry Association (McGuinness, 2011; Zurkowski, 1974). The
Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL, 2015) defined information literacy as “the
set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the
understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating
new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning” (para. 7). The

24

responsibility of teaching information literacy now falls within the purview of librarians
(Albrecht & Baron, 2002; Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Rader, 2002; Walter, 2008; Zai, 2014).
In 1977, ACRL established the Bibliographic Instruction Section (Dudley, 1981). Today,
the ACRL Bibliographic Instruction Section has been renamed the ACRL Instruction Section. In
recent times, academic librarians began to teach information literacy, and librarians pushed for
its addition to college curriculums (Davis, 2007). Of course, librarians are not the sole teachers
of information literacy; like writing, it crosses all disciplines (Elmborg, 2003). Nonetheless,
librarians were, and are still currently, often the primary supporters of information literacy on
campus and are optimistic about its future (Saunders, 2009). Additionally, librarians believed
that they should engage with teaching faculty and work to embed information literacy more fully
into the curriculum. Unfortunately, despite the overall positive outlook for the future of
information literacy, there are barriers to its growth including faculty autonomy and the time
required to teach skills (Saunders, 2009; Saunders, 2018).
As stated, the role of librarians has changed, and now a focus on teaching and learning is
important to the job (Julien & Genuis, 2011; Vassilakaki & Moniarou-Papaconstantinou, 2014).
With transformations in the traditional roles held by librarians, such as collection management
and circulation, teaching has become an area where librarians can demonstrate their value
(Creaser & Spezi, 2014). Teaching skills have been important for librarians to possess for many
years (Avery & Ketchner, 1996). Results of Avery and Ketchner’s (1996) study indicated that in
1993 and 1994, 75% of employers of the reviewed librarian jobs preferred candidates to have
instruction skills. However, the listed job requirements did not always include teaching skills.
Nonetheless, over 50% of the hiring managers stated that instruction skills were an important
consideration in making hiring decisions. Since Avery and Ketchner’s study, teaching skills

25

have increased in importance for librarians (Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Davis, 2007; Shank &
Bell, 2011). In fact, teaching has become the most significant part of many librarians’ jobs (Hall,
2013; Rose, 2003). Emphatically, employers have wanted librarians with teaching skills (Hall,
2013).
Recently, Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, and Brunetti (2016) determined that threshold
concepts were a useful approach to understanding information literacy. Through four rounds of
interviews, the researchers identified six threshold concepts for information literacy. Originally,
the researchers started with 50 possible thresholds. Then the researchers narrowed their findings
to the final six thresholds. The six threshold concepts are authority, format, information
commodities, information structures, research process, and scholarly discourse (Townsend et al.,
2016). Previously, researchers had identified seven threshold concepts—namely,
“metadata = findability, good searches use database structure, format is a process, authority is
constructed and contextual, ‘primary source’ is an exact and conditional category, information as
a commodity, and research solves problems” (Hofer, Townsend, & Brunetti, 2012, p. 402). The
discovery of these many threshold concepts for the field of information literacy framed librarians
as subject matter experts in a discipline (Hofer et al., 2012; Townsend et al., 2016). This
position for librarians differed from earlier classifications where the academic community
viewed librarians as academic support or technical experts. Indeed, some have said librarians
should strive to teach critical skills needed for students to become information literate (Hagman,
2015; Townsend, Brunetti, & Hoffer, 2011; Townsend et al., 2016). Despite the view that
librarians are experts in information literacy, the identification of threshold concepts for
information literacy and the subsequent publication of the ACRL Framework for Information
Literacy in Higher Education led to strong discourse. Many librarians did not agree with the

26

ACRL Framework or agree with threshold concepts. The conversations that occurred around the
framework and threshold concepts pointed to questions of professional identity in librarians. In
fact, the strong opinions held by many librarians had a direct effect on their professional
identities (Drabinski, 2016).
Because information literacy is now seen as an important skill, a requirement for many
librarians today is to teach for-credit and/or one-shot information literacy courses (Davis et al.,
2011; Hall, 2013; Hurley & Potter, 2017; Zai, 2014). One-shot classes occur when a librarian
teaches one session of a course. During the one-shot class, the librarian often introduces students
to library resources that will support a particular project (Davis, 2007; Zai, 2014). Both forcredit classes and one-shot information literacy courses are times where librarians engage in a
formal teaching setting.
In 2007, ACRL released Standards for Proficiencies for Instruction Librarians and
Coordinators: A Practical Guide. This guide was a list of competencies librarians with
instruction responsibilities should possess. The Standards for Proficiencies for Instruction
Librarians and Coordinators: A Practical Guide included 12 categories of skills. The categories
highlighted the range of abilities needed by librarians who teach. The importance placed on the
teaching role in this guide indicated the importance of developing librarians’ instruction skills
(Buck, 2014; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). This update prompted Westbrock and Fabian (2010)
to recreate a study conducted by Shonrock and Mulder (1993) to determine where librarians
obtained the teaching skills required of them. In the literature review, Westbrock and Fabian
highlighted the lack of studies on the training of librarians as teachers. Study results indicated
that despite library school being the preferred place to learn many of the necessary skills,
librarians learned 37 of the proficiencies included in the ACRL list at work and not in library

27

school. Many librarians reported a desire to learn expected proficiencies through continuing
education opportunities.
In 2017, an ACRL task force identified seven roles that academic instruction librarians
must fulfill. The seven roles are: “advocate, coordinator, instructional designer, lifelong learner,
leader, teacher, and teaching partner” (Standards and Proficiencies for Instruction Librarians and
Coordinators Revision Task Force, 2017, para. 11). As changes have come to higher education,
librarians’ instruction responsibilities have continued to increase (Hopkins, 1982; Julien &
Genuis, 2011; O’Connor, 2009; Salony, 1995; Walter, 2008). Librarians have not always been
teachers (Hopkins, 1982; Salony, 1995), but the increase in teaching responsibilities has led to a
need for librarians to be teachers (Hall, 2013; Hurley & Potter, 2017; Rose, 2003).
The Instructional Proficiencies and Responsibilities of Librarians
Instruction is a skill all librarians need; therefore, it is vital to ensure that the instruction
is effective if librarians want students to learn (Davis et al., 2011; Hall, 2013; Julien & Genuis,
2011). Many books and articles are available to help librarians plan lessons and develop
exercises for information literacy courses (Bravender, McClure, & Schaub, 2015; Burkhardt,
MacDonald, & Rathemacher, 2010). In addition, there are many resources available to help
librarians gain skills in teaching and managing a class (Blackburn & Hays, 2014; Buck, 2014;
Matlin & Carr, 2014; Polger & Sheidlower, 2017). Further, librarians have experience with
assessment of student learning as well as with self-reflection on their teaching (Corrall, 2017;
Greer, Hess, & Kraemer, 2015; Maggio et al., 2015). However, when librarians have written
about their teaching, the majority of their works have been descriptive articles (Sproles et al.,
2013), which do not examine the effectiveness of teaching methods. In recent years, there has
been a greater emphasis placed on teacher effectiveness in higher education. Lists of

28

instructional requirements or lesson examples do not indicate the ultimate success of instruction
given by librarians (De Courcy, 2015; Kern et al., 2015; Walter, 2005b). Descriptive articles,
while useful, are not sufficient because researchers have linked teacher effectiveness to teacher
identity (Day, 2008; Day, Stobart, Sammons et al., 2006; Sammons et al., 2007).
In addition to librarians teaching one-shot or for-credit courses, they collaborate with
faculty on teaching projects (O’Clair, 2012; Shank & Bell, 2011). Librarians engaged in
curriculum design and evaluation as well as participated in co-teaching assignments with faculty
(Julien & Genuis, 2011; Maggio et al., 2015; Shank & Bell, 2011). Thus, librarians needed to
understand the teaching and learning process even if they are not engaged in formal instruction
(Shank & Bell, 2011). Unfortunately, though, librarians did not necessarily have the skills
required to act as instructional designers for information literacy in the curriculum (Saunders,
2009). Therefore, for librarians to fully engage with faculty in these new roles, the development
of a teacher identity might be useful (Hensley, 2015; Walter, 2008).
The instructional settings where librarians teach can affect their professional identity
(Davis et al., 2011; Hagman, 2015). Many librarians engaged, and still engage, in teaching oneshot instruction sessions and credit-bearing information literacy courses (Davis, 2007; Hoseth,
2009). Researchers found that the instructional setting was important to professional identity. If
librarians taught a for-credit information literacy course, they were more likely to identify as a
teacher. The teaching model affected the development of librarians’ teacher identity (Davis et
al., 2011). However, the instructional setting of a one-shot session or a credit-bearing course can
often be determined by a librarian’s professional status, meaning librarians do not always have
control over their instructional settings. For example, if librarians hold faculty status, then
teaching a for-credit course is not outside professional responsibilities, but the professional status

29

of librarians is inconsistent. Librarians can hold the position of faculty, staff, professional staff,
or administrative faculty (Freedman, 2014; Walters, 2016).
Information literacy is a subject librarians will continue to teach (Saunders, 2009;
Townsend et al., 2016). Therefore, because teaching is a role in which librarians will likely
remain, the professional identity of teacher is important for librarians to embody (Avery &
Ketchner, 1996; Houtman, 2010; Loesch, 2010; Rose, 2003). Academic librarians spend a
considerable amount of their time teaching (Bewick & Corrall, 2010; Matlin & Carr, 2014;
Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). Even librarians who were somewhat averse to their teaching role
admitted the importance of teaching for their current job (Bewick & Corrall, 2010).
In two case studies, Austin and Bhandol (2013) found that despite teaching being an
important role for librarians, it was surrounded by uncertainty. A majority of librarians enjoyed
teaching, but most felt anxiety before teaching a class (Davis, 2007; Houtman, 2010; Julien &
Genuis, 2011). Feelings of nervousness did not change based on career length. Librarians who
have been working many years still felt anxiety at similar rates to new professional librarians
(Davis, 2007). The perception of the role of a librarian by faculty members had an effect on the
anxiety felt by librarians (Creaser & Spezi, 2014; Davis, 2007). Julien and Pecoskie (2009)
conducted a qualitative study of Canadian librarians to determine how they experienced their
role as a teacher. Through a phenomenological approach, the researchers discovered that the
relationship between the librarians and teaching faculty was one of the most important aspects of
a librarians’ teaching role. There was a power differential between librarians and teaching
faculty, with faculty holding the power. Some teaching faculty did not see librarians as
possessing the same status. Consequently, finding ways to overcome the challenges posed by

30
librarians’ lack of power in higher education was important for effective teaching (Hagman,
2015; Julien & Pecoskie, 2009).
Not all faculty, though, are confused about librarians’ roles. Some faculty did understand
and value librarians’ contributions to teaching (Doskatsch, 2003; Manuel, Beck, & Molloy,
2005). Manuel et al. (2005) interviewed faculty members to understand why they used library
instruction and what they valued about it. Many faculty members stated that they used library
instruction because students did not have the necessary research skills to be successful. Faculty
members also used library instruction to help students rely on sources other than exclusively
Internet resources. The third reason faculty stated for using library instruction was to help
students evaluate sources. The majority of faculty members saw librarians as the expert in these
areas, and the faculty listed librarians’ expertise as the reason they invited librarians to teach.
Nonetheless, while librarian and faculty collaborations were fruitful, at times, confusion was
shown to exist about librarians’ roles and that diminished productivity (Fliss, 2005; Library
Journal Research & Gale Cengage Learning, 2015; Manuel et al., 2005; Otto, 2014).
Moreover, confusion regarding librarians’ roles led to anxiety in librarians (Davis, 2007).
The main areas that caused anxiety for librarians are “isolation (due to faculty confusion or lack
of understanding of the librarians’ teaching role), coverage, performance (public speaking), and
lack of training” (Davis, 2007, p. 92). Four of the recognized causes of teacher anxiety aligned
with causes of anxiety felt by academic librarians (Davis, 2007). Showalter (2003) identified
seven causes of teacher anxiety in higher education: “lack of pedagogical training, isolation,
stage fright, the conflict between teaching and publication, coverage, grading, and student or
peer evaluation” (p. 3). The acknowledged causes of teacher anxiety in librarians demonstrated a
need for librarians to have access to more training, support, and professional development

31

opportunities (Davis, 2007; Hensley, 2015; Hoseth, 2009). In a three-year qualitative study on
school librarians, researchers found professional development to be a key moment during the
first 3 years of employment, and there was a connection between identified key moments and
identity development (Branch-Mueller & de Groot, 2016). In higher education, professional
development has increasingly focused on student learning (Fanghanel & Trowler, 2008).
Involvement in professional development helped librarians support their teacher identity
(Hoseth, 2009).
Librarians often realized their need for further development of teaching and instruction
skills (Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Davies-Hoffman, 2013; Matlin & Carr, 2014), and there are
many ways to promote professional development leading to instructional improvement among
librarians (Buck, 2014). For example, administrators can provide opportunities for librarians to
communicate with each other; they can host workshops, conduct assessment, engage in peer
review, and conduct on the job training (Walter, 2006; Zanin-Yost & Crow, 2012). One specific
example of a professional development opportunity for teaching librarians was at Loyola
University New Orleans’ Monroe Library. The instruction coordinator developed a community
of practice to help librarians develop as teachers. An important part of the community of
practice was open discussions about topics of interest and needs. The group also supported each
other by one-on-one mentoring, sharing relevant literature, and engaging in active learning
activities. Additionally, members of the group shared their experiences with librarians at other
institutions. Results of the community of practice indicated that it was a beneficial model and
librarians at Monroe Library developed in their role as teachers (Willey, 2014). This community
of practice is an example of the professional development that other studies have indicated are
needed. For librarians to adopt a teacher identity, administrators and professional developers

32

will need to consider the institutional culture and the change process. The culture of an
institution can determine what is accepted and what members of an institution do not accept
(Kezar & Eckel, 2002; Roxå, Olsson, & Mårtensson, 2008). When instructional changes do
occur for librarians, Gilchrist (2007) wrote that is important for faculty to collaborate with the
librarians in focusing on teaching and learning.
In summary, not all librarians have been comfortable in the role of a teacher, nor do they
desire to become teachers (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Davis, 2007). However, teaching will
remain a job expectation for many librarians (Davis et al., 2011; Hall, 2013; Julien & Genuis,
2011; Vassilakaki & Moniarou-Papaconstantinou, 2014). Consequently, it is important that
librarians develop and expand their professional identity to include that of teacher in order to
facilitate student learning.
Professional Identity of Librarians as Teachers
A professional identity is not the same as the role a person fills (Day & Kington, 2008),
but due to interplay between a person’s role and his or her perceived identity, identity often
influences roles (Burke & Reitzes, 1981). The professional status of librarians has been debated
over time. These debates led to specific perceptions about the roles of librarians. As the roles
and responsibilities of the job have changed, professional identities have changed too. This
development led to resistance by many in the library profession to changes because they saw
those changes as an attack on their professional identity (Stauffer, 2014). However, professional
identities are not static; individuals can be open to change and transformation as new
responsibilities and roles are placed on them (Clegg, 2008; Coldron & Smith, 1999; Volkmann &
Anderson, 1998). In fact, even new technologies have been shown to change occupational
identities (Nelson & Irwin, 2012).

33

Throughout their career, primary and secondary educators continually negotiate their
professional identities as teaching contexts change (Hsieh, 2015). The experience of primary
and secondary educators is comparable to the adapting academic librarians’ must do as their jobs
change (Ellis et al., 2014; Goetsch, 2008). Lupton (2002) recommended academic librarians
begin to see themselves as educators comparable to the teacher identity of primary and secondary
school teachers. Primary and secondary teachers, similar to librarians, have multiple roles they
must fulfill and often struggle to maintain a strong professional identity (Day, Kington, Stobart,
& Sammons, 2006). Primary and secondary “teacher librarians see themselves as teachers first,
librarians second” (Lupton, 2002, p. 76). Additionally, there are parallels between how teachers
and librarians learn new skills. Both teachers and librarians need mentors and a strong support
system in their roles (Sare et al., 2012; Seymour, 2012). The relationships that occur through
mentorship can influence identity (Izadinia, 2015; Volkmann & Anderson, 1998; Wenger, 1998).
Research has shown that pre-service teachers with a strong mentor relationship gained
confidence in their teacher identity. Although mentors helped teachers grow in their teacher
identities, it is important to be aware that negative mentor relationships caused a decrease in the
confidence of pre-service teachers’ identities (Izadinia, 2015).
Recently, professional identity has been a topic of discussion in the teacher education
literature (Chong, Ling, & Chung, 2011; Correa et al., 2014; Hsieh, 2010; Izadinia, 2013;
Lamote & Engels, 2010). Horn, Nolen, Ward, and Campbell (2008) found teacher education
programs were important for teacher identity development. It is important to understand the
growth and creation of a professional identity in teachers through professional development,
because as previously stated, professional identities influence teachers’ effectiveness (Day, 2008;
Day, Stobart et al., 2006; Sammons et al., 2007). Elementary and secondary student teachers’

34

methods evolved as they engaged in their own teaching during their coursework. The evolution
of their teaching methods affected their sense of themselves (Horn et al., 2008). As found in a
case study of eight English teachers with 3-5 years of experience that were part of a collaborative
inquiry group, there were complexities to creating and sustaining a teacher identity because new
teachers created their professional identity from multiple sources (Hsieh, 2010).
Moreover, the local context matters in identity formation. Local events affect how a
person viewed himself or herself (Hsieh, 2010; van Lankveld, Schoonenboom, Volman, Croiset,
& Beishuizen, 2017). Likewise, the words a person used to describe him- or herself were
important for the adoption a specific identity (Hicks, 2014). Identities evolve over time and
consist of multiple parts. Included in a professional identity are “self-image, self-esteem, jobmotivation, task perception, and future perspective” (Kelchtermans, 1993, p. 444).
While an agreed-upon definition of a teacher identity does not exist, the idea of a teacher
identity is well documented in the literature; many researchers pointed to its significance for
teachers (Beauchamp & Thomas, 2009; Beijaard et al., 2004; Izadinia, 2013; Olsen, 2008; Roy
& Hensley, 2016; Walter, 2008). A teacher identity is more specific than a broad professional
identity; it is open to change and has many factors contributing to its creation (Beauchamp &
Thomas, 2009; Beijaard et al., 2004; Harlow & Cobb, 2014; Izadinia, 2013; Olsen 2008). A
teacher identity is composed of many of the same parts, though, as a broad identity, and it has
been shown to influence teachers’ effectiveness and job commitment (Day, Kington et al., 2006;
Day, Stobart et al., 2006; Day & Kington, 2008). The emphasis on primary, secondary, and
post-secondary educators’ teacher identity draws attention to the need to pay attention to
librarians’ teacher identity (van Lankveld et al., 2017; Walter, 2005b). Paying attention to the
identity of librarians as teachers is important because librarians’ identities as teachers affect their

35

job performance as well as their motivation to continue improving when teaching is an important
part of their jobs.
The literature confirmed multiple components of a professional identity. Perceived roles
impacted how librarians view their identity as teachers. Librarians and library users constructed
librarians’ professional identities (Davis, 2007; Hicks, 2014; Polger & Okamato, 2010).
Researchers have also written about how faculty and student perceptions of librarians affect a
librarian’s identity (Feldman & Sciammarella, 2000; Polger & Okamoto, 2010). Moreover, the
professional identity of librarians adapted to the changing work environment (Gray, 2013;
Miller, 2015; Sare & Bales, 2014). The library profession is one where change is a prime theme
(Sare & Bales, 2014). As previously stated, today librarians must fulfill many roles (Corrall,
2010; Freedman, 2014; Saunders, 2012; Vassilakaki & Moniarou-Papaconstantinou, 2014;
Walter, 2008).
To gain an understanding of the professional identity of academic librarians, Freedman
(2014) sent a survey to academic librarians and library administrators in the New England area to
determine their professional status, how they self-define their role, role expectations, and the
relationship between identity and role. The study results indicated similar findings to those
found by Walter (2008). Academic librarians struggled with their professional identity due to
the many roles they were required to fulfill. The most common role expectation was an
information professional and the second most expected role was an educator. The new roles of
an information professional and an educator were often in combination with more traditional
librarian roles such as reference and collection development (Freedman, 2014). Frequently,
these unrealized expectations led to a reexamination of professional identities (Flores, 2006).
Often, the expectations librarians had of the profession when leaving library school did not align

36

with their experiences (Houtman, 2010). Many librarians started their careers with unrealized
expectations in the areas of flexibility, workload, diversity of work, and the campus community’s
feelings about the library (Oud, 2008).
The multiple professional roles are important to be cognizant of because it can lead to
indistinct professional roles. Moreover, fulfillment of different roles led to stress in many
librarians (Vassilakaki & Moniarou-Papaconstantinou, 2014). Librarians have still been engaged
in many of their traditional core functions, but they have had many additional responsibilities
added to their jobs (Bronstein, 2011; Saunders, 2012). These different roles indicated a need for
administrative support to aid librarians in adopting new identities. In fact, multiple expectations
for some librarians led to more than one identity forming. The existence of multiple identities in
one individual led to stress (Colbeck, 2008).
Furthermore, there was a relationship between institutional structure and the professional
identity of librarians (Freedman, 2014; Jephcote & Salisbury, 2009; Sare et al., 2012).
Librarians often spent the beginning stage of their employment understanding expectations in
order to meet those expectations (Sare et al., 2012). If employers asked librarians to fulfill
multiple roles, then indistinct identities formed, thus leading to strain in professional identity
(Colbeck, 2008). A specific workplace context mattered greatly to how librarians view
themselves. This is also true for academics broadly. Workplace culture and context affected
academic identities (Roxå et al., 2008).
With all the components affecting a teacher’s identity, the creation of one has been
shown to be challenging. There is a complex relationship between identity and pedagogical
knowledge. When librarians do not have strong pedagogical knowledge, it posed a potential
problem for librarians in adopting the role of a teacher (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Julien &

37

Pecoskie, 2009; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). Many librarians eventually learned about
pedagogy, but that was not always their first area of training (Bewick & Corrall, 2010).
Traditional librarian roles, such as the reference interview, have been shown to have minimal
impact in a class setting. Nevertheless, the reference interview was, and is, still an important part
of librarians’ jobs (Polger & Okamoto, 2010; Powers, 2010; Saunders, 2012). Today, librarians
use different tools in their reference work, but the core work of reference remains the same
(Bronstein, 2011; Saunders, 2012). Additionally, many librarians wanted to engage in
instruction at the reference desk, but were often unable to do so (Powers, 2010). Therefore, when
librarians tried to continue with the typical models of teaching they employed in a reference
interview, they were not successful teaching in a class setting. This, coupled with the fact that
many academic librarians did not receive the necessary training to teach, created barriers for the
development of a professional teacher identity (Davies-Hoffman et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2011;
Walter, 2008). The multiple voices, job requirements, and lack of preparation for their teaching
responsibilities can create a challenging environment for librarians trying to create a strong
professional teacher identity.
In the 1990s, a shift occurred from librarians who teach to librarians as teachers
(Doskatsch, 2003). Nevertheless, not all librarians viewed themselves primarily as teachers, and
they were hesitant to take on that identity (Austin & Bhandol, 2013). Walter (2008) conducted
an exploratory qualitative study to investigate the professional identity of teacher in academic
librarians. Walter interviewed six librarians during the spring of 2004. The participant group
was composed of five females and one male librarian, all from the same doctoral/researchextensive institution. From the semi-structured interviews, Walter identified five themes that
affected librarians’ professional identity as that of a teacher. The identified themes are:

38

1. The centrality of teaching.
2. The importance of collegial and administrative support.
3. The stress of multiple demands.
4. The problems with professional education.
5. The stereotypes and misperceptions (of librarians) (Walter, 2008, pp. 61–63).
The conclusions of Walter’s (2008) study were not definitive due to the exploratory nature of the
investigation, and further research was recommended to determine how librarians develop a
teacher identity. However, the findings were important to understanding the complex issues
surrounding the development of a teacher identity among academic librarians.
Researchers have identified four ways that librarians regard their identity. The categories
are teacher-librarian, librarian who teaches, learning support, and trainer (Wheeler &
McKinney, 2015). Librarians who fell into the teacher-librarian category viewed themselves as
teachers. They also knew that they taught. Librarians in the librarian who teaches category did
not see themselves as teachers in spite of the fact that they taught. Librarians in the learning
support category did view themselves as teachers, but they did not see their work as teaching.
Last, librarians who viewed themselves as trainers did not think they taught and did not consider
themselves teachers (Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). Therefore, many of these librarians needed
support to make the shift from trainer, or solely a librarian, to a librarian with a teacher identity
(Lupton, 2002). The various ways librarians viewed themselves and the many actions they
performed as part of their jobs signified their identity was not set (Freedman, 2014; Miller, 2015;
Sare & Bales, 2014). Librarians are “always becoming librarians” (Sare & Bales, 2014, p. 580).
Due to constant growth and change in how librarians viewed themselves, researchers
recommended increased support for librarians to develop their teacher identity (Austin &

39

Bhandol, 2013; Flores, 2006; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). Similar to librarians, the identities
of primary and secondary teachers adapted due to changes in their teaching situations. To
reiterate, researchers recommended further study on the identity development of these instructors
because identity and effectiveness are linked (Hsieh, 2015). Future studies can be framed using
the theoretical framework of Communities of Practice, because these communities provide a
setting for librarians to cultivate a strong professional identity (Belzowski et al., 2013; Wenger,
1998). Hicks (2016) found that the importance of community was crucial to librarians’
identities. The discrepancy in librarians’ views of their teaching status meant that they rarely
participated in outreach for teaching and learning (Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). As previously
stated, identity has been shown to have an impact on teaching effectiveness (Day, 2008; Day,
Stobart et al., 2006). Additionally, a teacher’s perceived competence also influenced his or her
identity (Sammons et al., 2007; van Lankveld et al., 2017). Faculty in post-secondary
classrooms indicated that they desired community around the topic of identity. As roles and
responsibilities changed, faculty found identity to be an important aspect of this shift (Terosky &
Heasley, 2015). Terosky and Heasley (2005) noted that an example in higher education of
faculty shifting from face-to-face instruction to online teaching had similarities to changes in
librarians’ roles from reference work to classroom instruction. One study that examined higher
education faculty member’s teacher identity found that faculty who transitioned into a faculty
role from a professional career struggled with their new identity as an educator more than faculty
who became a professor immediately upon completion of graduate school (van Lankveld et al.,
2017). Post-secondary faculty members’ experience with online teaching and transitioning from
a professional career track underscored the importance of considering identity when roles and
job responsibilities change (Terosky & Heasley, 2015; van Lankveld et al., 2017).

40

Freedman (2014) identified a gap in the literature and recommended further studies be
conducted that are focused on professional development opportunities and career development.
This recommendation echoed an earlier one by Walter (2008) for further study in the specific
way that professional development affects teacher identity. The literature revealed room for
research that studies the effects of professional development opportunities for librarians as a way
to develop their teacher identity.
The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning
During his time as president of the Carnegie Foundation, Ernest Boyer (1990) introduced
the scholarship of teaching in Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate. The
scholarship of teaching was one of the four areas of scholarship Boyer proposed for faculty
participation. During Lee Shulman’s tenure at the helm of the Carnegie Foundation, he founded
the Carnegie Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning and expanded the
scholarship of teaching to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Bradley, 2009; Georgia
Southern University, 2013). Shulman (2006) defined SoTL as:
The scholarship of teaching and learning invites faculty…to view teaching as serious,
intellectual work, ask good questions about their students’ learning, seek evidence in their
classrooms that can be used to improve practice, and make this work public so that others
can critique it, build on it, and contribute to the wider teaching commons. (p. ix)
Shulman’s definition, however, is not the sole definition, and some confusion has surrounded the
meaning of SoTL (Miller-Young & Yeo, 2015). A second definition of SoTL is “the systematic,
literature-based study of processes and outcomes involved in teaching and learning intended for
peer-reviewed publication and dissemination” (Secret, Leisey, Lanning, Polich, & Schaub, 2011,

41

p. 2). Despite multiple definitions, SoTL can be framed as a coherent field (Miller-Young &
Yeo, 2015).
As these different definitions of SoTL indicate, there are still questions surrounding
SoTL as a discipline of study. Numerous scholars have given varied definitions, which has led
to questions about how academics should practice SoTL (Felten, 2013; Hutchings, 2000; Kreber,
2002a). Although confusion regarding SoTL exists, a strong international community and local
cohorts have grown in the past 25 years (Kern et al., 2015). Geertsema (2016) recommended
that SoTL be viewed as professional development instead of as solely a research discipline. This
view corresponded with connections made between SoTL and faculty learning communities;
SoTL and faculty learning communities have been shown to be closely connected (Beach, 2015;
Richlin & Cox, 2004). Researchers have argued that SoTL offers a valuable approach to faculty
development by creating spaces for faculty in local contexts to discuss, share, and learn in their
resident communities (Cambridge, 2001; Fanghanel, 2013; Geertsema, 2016). Through new
kinds of faculty development, faculty learning communities have proven useful in advancing
SoTL on college and university campuses (Hubball & Albon, 2007; Michael, 2012). In fact,
SoTL has already influenced faculty development offerings at institutions of higher education
(Beach, 2015; Saylor & Harper, 2003).
For those who participate in SoTL, they typically have framed SoTL research around a
problem they notice or experience (Bass, 1999). Hutchings (2000) proposed a taxonomy of four
types of questions that encompass SoTL research. These questions are “What works?, What is?,
What’s possible?, and Theory-building questions” (Raffoul, n.d., para. 9). These questions and
the ensuing research conducted to answer the questions has led to differences between excellent
teaching and SoTL (Kern et al., 2015).

42
O’Brien (2008) emphasized the differences between excellent teaching and SoTL in four
specific attributes. SoTL is “an overarching concern for students and their learning” (p. 1),
“deliberate design for how teaching and learning may proceed on the basis of these initial
concerns” (p. 2), “systematic implementation, analysis and evaluation of the design” (p. 2) and
“contribution to the SoTL knowledge and practice” (p. 2) while excellent teaching is instruction
provided by a good teacher (O’Brien, 2008). Together the attributes create a field of scholarship
focused on the study of teaching and learning. Higher education practitioners have debated the
differences between scholarly teaching and SoTL (Gingsberg & Bernstein, 2012; Potter &
Kustra, 2011; Secret et al., 2011). Understanding the distinctions between excellent teaching and
SoTL is necessary for full engagement in the field (Kern et al., 2015).
The SoTL Compass has helped SoTL scholars focus their inquiries (O’Brien, 2008). The
Compass includes four questions: “What do my students need to learn and why is it worth
learning? Who are my students and how will they learn effectively? What can I do to support my
students to learn effectively? How do I know if my teaching and my students’ learning have been
effective?” (O’Brien, 2008, p. 4). To address these questions, researchers of professional
development programs and initiatives have recommended a multi-factor development program
(Williams, Nixon, Hennessy, Mahon, & Adams, 2016). Researchers also suggested professional
development facilitators listen to their attendees and adjust curriculum to meet needs because
external factors and teachers’ perceptions of their teaching affect their involvement in
professional development (Barlow, Frick, Barker, & Phelps, 2014). Therefore, participants in
SoTL research can engage with multiple questions about teaching and learning.
Previously, many educational professional development programs failed; yet, they were,
and are still, central for the growth of teachers (Bissonnette & Caprino, 2014; Lieberman, 2000).

43

In traditional professional development, educators have not been active in their development
(Bissonnette & Caprino, 2014). Some campuses have now started to use SoTL for professional
development (Fanghanel et al., 2016; Roxå et al., 2008). In contrast to other professional
development programs, SoTL encourages teachers to be engaged scholars in their professional
teaching growth. Additionally, SoTL urges faculty to share the experiences of teaching and the
lessons learned from the study of teaching (Fanghanel, 2013; Kreber, 2002b; O’Brien, 2008;
Roxå et al., 2008; Shulman, 2006). As Brookfield (1995) wrote, “silence surrounds us as
teachers” (p. 247). Often, there are few opportunities to discuss, share, and critically evaluate
teaching with a direct focus on student learning. The need to engage in thoughtful conversations
about teaching in the higher education environment supports the emphasis Boyer (1990) placed
on teaching as a scholarly activity. It is important that professors view themselves as part of a
community, especially since much of the work done in the classroom is done in seclusion
(Shulman, 1993).
Similar to librarians, not all academic identities fit a specific mold (Bennet et al., 2016).
An increasing number of faculty members in higher education engage in SoTL (Bennet et al.,
2016; Kern et al., 2015; Miller-Young & Yeo, 2015). Through an analysis of personal
narratives, Bennet et al. (2016) identified three identities study participants possessed: “the
teacher, the discipline scholar, and the educational researcher” (p. 221). The researchers were
not surprised that teaching was their participants’ most prominent identity. Study participants,
who were academics that worked in an Australian university in the academic support center, had
a workload focused on teaching, and SoTL was an important part of each of their positions.
Nonetheless, the three identities caused anxiety and confusion; consequently, the researchers

44
balanced and reconciled participants’ identities through negotiation and involvement in a peer
community (Bennet et al., 2016).
Academics have shown to need a community to develop and maintain strong identities
(Henkel, 2005). Engagement in SoTL can create community (August & Dewar, 2010). For
example, writing group participants found community to be so beneficial that Marquis, Healey,
and Vine (2014) hypothesized that being part of a community engaged in SoTL might contribute
to the creation of an SoTL identity. Academics involved in writing groups valued diverse
perspectives because it opened more learning opportunities. Participants also valued learning
through experience (Marquis et al., 2014). The experience of academics participating in writing
groups demonstrated the benefit of engaging in professional development for identity
development. Communities of practice have been ideally created to promote the growth of SoTL
(Poole et al., 2007; Roxå et al., 2007). Indeed, communities of practice support SoTL
internationally (Clark et al., 2017). Relatedly, as stated previously, librarians experience
isolation in their teaching and they are often “lone scholars” (McCormick, 2003, p. 214) in their
work (McCormick, 2003; Orbell-Smith, 2012; Seymour, 2012). Librarians have combatted
feelings of isolation through interactions with peers such as in a community of practice
(Sinkinson, 2010). The participants in Houtman’s (2010) study desired increased support and
more opportunities to discuss their teaching. Community allowed for the shared engagement and
support librarians seek (Belzowski et al., 2013; Henkel, 2005). The SoTL community is a place
where librarians can develop their instructional skills through engagement with others seeking to
become better teachers (Perini, 2014).
SoTL is also useful for professional development (Mitchell & Mitchell, 2015). One
specific example of this is at Miami University, where faculty learning communities supported

45

the development of SoTL on their campus. Participants in the faculty learning communities
conducted research and published and presented on their findings (Richlin & Cox, 2004). When
connecting to communities of practice, SoTL proved to be successful for professional
development and identity formation when collaboration occurred (Cambridge, 2001; Kahn et al.,
2013; Saylor & Harper, 2003). In another example, Mitchell and Mitchell (2015) found that
SoTL methods were also useful for identity formation when SoTL was practiced in one teacher’s
class. In both scenarios, SoTL impacted professional identities.
As previously mentioned, SoTL has been shown to grow through faculty learning
communities (Dees, Niesz, Tu, & Devine, 2009; Hubball & Albon, 2007; Richlin & Cox, 2004).
Even if faculty were at different stages in their use of and participation in SoTL, faculty found
the learning communities beneficial (Hubball & Albon, 2007). At Kent State University, faculty
who engaged in a learning community spent a year discussing and learning about an aspect of
teaching. Faculty participants attended meetings; worked with mentors, peers, and students; and
had to present at two conferences that focused on college teaching. Faculty determined that the
best part of the learning community was the community; it was not the SoTL projects. The
participants in Kent State’s faculty learning communities assisted each other in placing focus on
student learning (Dees et al., 2009). Furthermore, faculty who participated in the Wisconsin
Teaching Fellows & Scholars Program saw the program as beneficial for teaching and learning.
The participants remarked that they had new appreciation for the learning process; it renewed
them as teachers, and they now saw their job as helping students learn (Voelker & Martin, 2013).
The community created through faculty learning communities assisted in identity formation and
influenced faculty members’ ideas about teaching effectiveness (Voelker & Martin, 2013;
Wenger, 1998).

46

Through communities of practice, identities are formed (Wenger, 1998). However,
despite communities of practice affecting identity development, the process of creating a
professional teaching identity was shown to be complex (Correa et al., 2014). Researchers
identified SoTL as helpful for many graduate students in growing their teaching and their
professional careers. Moreover, graduate students also found SoTL useful in their development
as an academic (Schram & Allendoerfer, 2012). Similar to librarians, teaching faculty have
many demands on their time, including research, teaching, and advising. Due to these demands,
faculty must also negotiate their professional identities (Bennett et al., 2016). Study findings
pointed to SoTL being beneficial for librarians to grow in their teaching and careers and in their
development as academics (Bennett et al., 2016; Correa et al., 2014; Schram & Allendoerfer,
2012; Voelker & Martin, 2013; Wenger, 1998).
Local contexts are also important for SoTL growth. The local context was shown to
influence how SoTL was developed and supported (Williams, 2004). In addition to local
context, the curricular context is of particular importance in SoTL work (Fanghanel, 2013).
Research conducted on SoTL focused on the curricular context and sought ways to increase
learning by students in their own setting (Gale, 2008). Scholars cannot ignore the importance of
content, and it should not be divorced from pedagogy (Shulman, 2013). Information literacy is
the content of librarians, and the pedagogy they use should be driven by research in this
pedagogical content area. Whether in a for-credit course or a one-shot session, librarians are
teachers of information literacy (Albrecht & Baron, 2002; Rader, 2002; Saunders, 2018; Walter,
2008). The ACRL Framework (2015) highlights the usefulness of the framework for librarians’
involvement in SoTL, thus underscoring librarians’ expertise in information literacy.

47

SoTL provides a framework for engaged teaching, reflection, and scholarship. Once the
framework is established, educators link their SoTL work with professional development (Elton,
2009; Fanghanel, 2013). Participation in professional development often resulted from concerns
faculty had about their abilities or questions they had about their work. Similarly, SoTL
inquiries often start with a problem (Bass, 1999). As the literature makes clear, librarians have
not always been confident in their teaching abilities; faculty members’ perceptions and students’
perceptions of librarians’ role as a teacher influenced librarians’ professional identities (Austin &
Bhandol, 2013; Manuel et al., 2005; Polger & Okamoto, 2010; Sammons et al., 2007; Slavin &
Mead, 2008; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). Engagement in a SoTL network affected higher
education faculty members’ professional identities (Kahn et al., 2013). At times, SoTL might
affect academics’ identities negatively because of campus culture, norms, and expectations
(Roxå et al., 2008). Nonetheless, both formal and informal networks have proven useful in
helping teachers and librarians build their teaching skills (Kahn et al., 2013; Sare et al., 2012).
SoTL has been shown to be useful for improving student learning when instructors build their
instruction on theory, make their teaching public, participate in peer review, and engage in
inquiry regarding their teaching methods (Trigwell, 2013). Peer work has also been shown to be
effective in developing SoTL (Barnard et al., 2011). Further, communities of practice create
space for faculty and librarians to collaborate (Belzowski et al., 2013). Communities of practice
also provide librarians with the opportunity for participation and inclusion in a group that they
might not feel they are naturally a part of, thus impacting librarians’ identities (Wenger, 1998).
Academics who engaged as a community in a SoTL program discussed the effects of the
work at the “individual, department-level, institutional-level, and discipline-level impact”
(Miller-Young, Yeo, Manarin, Carey, & Zimmer, 2016, p. 59). New faculty members at Mount

48
Royal University spoke about the SoTL program’s impact in individual terms. Faculty with a
lengthier tenure at the university spoke about the program’s impact on the department,
institution, and discipline levels (Miller-Young et al., 2016). This finding was telling regarding
“the macro/meso/micro model of institutional culture” (Miller-Young et al., 2016, p. 60). For
SoTL to continue its growth on college campuses, culture changes might need to occur. At
Eastern Michigan University, Ginsberg and Bernstein (2012) sought to ingrain SoTL on their
campus. In order to promote SoTL, they created a cohort that promoted self-awareness for
individual cohort participants and self-awareness of the university. When cohort members
understood their personal history and the history of the university, making a cultural shift was
easier. SoTL seminars, supportive leadership, a change agency, and a facilitator were also
integral parts of creating a SoTL culture at Eastern Michigan University (Ginsberg & Bernstein,
2012). Other universities have found mentor/mentee relationships, community, and institutional
support vital for the growth of an SoTL culture (Marquis et al., 2014; Michael, 2012). Creating
and maintaining a SoTL culture are challenges facing those involved in the field. Nonetheless,
the differences in language used to describe SoTL’s impact and the many people involved in
growth efforts point to the numerous areas for growth in librarians (Ginsberg & Bernstein, 2012;
Miller-Young et al., 2016).
In review, through professional development, communities, and collaboration SoTL can
help promote teacher identity (Cambridge, 2001; Kahn et al., 2013; Saylor & Harper, 2003).
Some faculty who participated in SoTL programs engaged in more collaboration, while other
faculty studied teaching on their own (Voelker & Martin, 2013). Nonetheless, all who participate
in SoTL are engaged in the international movement that includes studying and sharing teaching
and learning. This community helps shape identities and helps academics make sense of their

49

place in higher education when their identities do not fit comfortably within a disciplinary field
(Bennet et al., 2016; Wenger, 1998).
Librarians and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning
Librarian involvement in a teaching program led to improvement of librarians’
instruction skills (Buck, 2014; Sinkinson, 2010). When skills are improved, confidence levels
increased and anxieties decreased (Hoseth, 2009). Librarians’ engagement with teaching and
pedagogy is important, thus underscoring the applicability of participation in SoTL (Bewick &
Corrall, 2010). SoTL is the active researching method in the area of teaching and learning
encouraged by Wheeler and McKinney (2015). Campus teaching centers house the experts in
teaching and pedagogy and are good places to start exploring SoTL (McKinney, 2006; McVeigh,
2011). In the past, there have been partnerships between instruction librarians using the
resources available to them in their respective university’s centers for teaching. Partnerships
included librarians teaching workshops, librarian and faculty co-teaching ventures, and web
development (Jacobsen, 2001; Marcum, 2012). Librarians’ engagement with SoTL is important
because research has shown a relationship between a professors’ effectiveness in helping
students learn and their involvement in SoTL (Kern et al., 2015; Trigwell, 2013). As previously
stated, a link has been shown between teaching effectiveness and professional identity (Day,
2008; Day, Stobart et al., 2006; Sammons et al., 2007). Thus, this finding linked SoTL and
identity. Indeed, faculty who participated in the Wisconsin Teaching Fellows & Scholars
Program who saw improvement in their teaching became more involved in SoTL (Voelker &
Martin, 2013). The figure below shows the impact of the Wisconsin Teaching Fellows &
Scholars Program and includes specific SoTL activities.

50

A teacher’s effectiveness is associated with his or her resilience (Day & Kington, 2008). When
some faculty see their teaching as effective, they seek more learning opportunities in SoTL
(Voelker & Martin, 2013). Involvement in communities of practice assisted in building
resiliency, thereby leading to increased effectiveness and a stronger identity (Le Cornu, 2009).
Despite the demonstrated importance of librarians engaging with centers for teaching,
librarians have not rated their collaborative experience with faculty development centers high.
Instead, some librarians indicated that they felt in competition with faculty development centers
(Johnson & Goodson, 2015). However, benefits were also shown to exist in collaboration
between faculty development centers and libraries (Johnson & Goodson, 2015; Walter, 2006).
Still, there is minimal literature about librarian involvement with campus centers for teaching,
and more studies should be conducted (Hoseth, 2009; Johnson & Goodson, 2015).
Librarian involvement in campus teaching and learning activities promoted a teacher
identity in librarians. Involvement with campus teaching centers also helped librarians improve

51

their instruction (Hoseth, 2009). One challenge that librarians participating with centers for
teaching face, which Hoseth (2009) acknowledged, is the nontraditional teaching librarians often
conduct. As stated earlier, the majority of instruction given by librarians was, and is, a one-shot
session where they work with a class for one session (Davis, 2007; Zai, 2014). Therefore, many
librarians do not have the same teaching responsibilities as traditional faculty members.
However, centers for teaching must accommodate the needs of multiple types of faculty—
adjunct, non-tenure, tenure-track, and online instructors. Indeed, flexible communities of
practice have been proven to work with another type of nontraditional faculty—adjuncts (Webb,
Wong, & Hubball, 2013). Consequently, overcoming the challenge of librarians’ instructional
settings can occur when teaching centers focus workshops and training on the type of teaching
librarians conduct.
Teaching faculty are encouraged, at times pressured, to improve their teaching (De
Courcy, 2015). Researchers have found that forced improvement of teaching can negatively
affect faculty members’ perceptions of the quality of their teaching and student learning (Cheng,
2010). Conversely, some faculty found benefit in teaching reviews (Cheng, 2010). Nonetheless,
in both scenarios, improvement in teaching and the study of that improvement was the starting
place for many teaching faculty members’ engagements with SoTL (O’Brien, 2008).
Despite SoTL being a field ripe for librarian involvement, little was known about
librarians’ current engagement with the field (Bradley, 2009; Perini, 2014). Librarians have an
expertise and a level of comfort working outside of their discipline, but researchers have not yet
studied librarians’ participation in SoTL (Jaguszewski & Williams, 2013). Nonetheless,
Jaguszewski and Williams (2013) acknowledged that librarians possessed a greater role in
supporting teaching and learning on college campuses. Despite minimal literature on librarians’

52

involvement in SoTL, librarians’ roles in supporting teaching and learning and their engagement
in teaching indicate that librarians’ did engage at some level with SoTL (Hagman, 2015;
Houtman, 2010; Jaguszewski & Williams, 2013; Loesch, 2010; McVeigh, 2011).
Warner and Seamans (2004) wrote an article on librarians’ involvement with SoTL. The
article was a description of a collaboration between Notre Dame’s library staff and teaching
center staff. The collaboration was SoTL work. The Center for Teaching and Learning
developed a workshop to help librarians improve their teaching skills. The collaboration was
beneficial for both the librarians and the staff of the Center for Teaching and Learning. The
Center for Teaching and Learning staff were not familiar with the work of librarians, and this
collaboration provided an opportunity for the center staff to learn about librarians’ roles. A
separate project through the Center for Teaching and Learning at Notre Dame involved a
librarian and a professor applying for a research grant from the Carnegie Foundation. The grant
supported the study of instructional methods—an example of early librarian involvement in
SoTL (Warner & Seamans, 2004). This early type of collaboration was an example of what set
the stage for the increase in librarians supporting the teaching and learning that occurs on college
campuses today (Dewey, 2005; Jaguszewski & Williams, 2013; Otto, 2014).
The Association of College and Research Libraries offered many opportunities for
librarians to grow in their SoTL knowledge and practice (Otto, 2014). Explicitly within the
teaching skills category of the Standards for Proficiencies for Instruction Librarians and
Coordinators: A Practical Guide (ACRL, 2007) were two skills that align with SoTL. The skills
were “reflects on practices in order to improve teaching skills and acquires new knowledge of
teaching methods and learning theories” (Teaching skills, para. 7) and “shares teaching skills and
knowledge with other instructional staff” (Teaching skills, para. 8). These needed abilities are

53

SoTL practices and a place for librarians to begin their professional development through SoTL.
It should be emphasized, though, that the Standard for Proficiencies for Instruction Librarians
and Coordinators is not an evaluative tool; instead, it was a guide for understanding what is
required of successful instruction librarians (ACRL, 2007; Otto, 2014).
ACRL’s focus on instruction highlighted the importance of teaching skills for librarians,
yet the organization’s efforts have not been sufficient (Hensley, 2015; Otto, 2014; Westbrock &
Fabian, 2010). Regardless of library school being the favored place to learn instruction skills, a
majority of librarians learned teaching skills on the job (Maggio et al., 2015; Sare et al., 2012;
Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). Many librarians did not feel they were adequately prepared for the
required responsibilities of the job during graduate school (Larrivee, 2014). Often, librarians did
not learn teaching strategies, pedagogy, and curriculum development before their first time
teaching as a professional librarian. As mentioned earlier, librarians acquired 37 of the
proficiencies included in the Proficiencies for Instruction Librarians from the ACRL list on the
job and not in library school (Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). As a result, librarians reported that
they wanted to learn proficiencies through continuing education opportunities (Westbrock &
Fabian, 2010). Therefore, the need for librarians to participate in professional development
activities centered on teaching was important. The results indicated that support structures
needed to be in place for librarians to continue acquiring instruction skills while on the job
(Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). Teaching instruction skills during LIS education and
implementing institutional support once librarians are employed would be very useful in helping
librarians gain the necessary teaching skills (Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Hensley, 2015; Houtman,
2010). However, it remains the responsibility of librarians to learn those necessary skills
(Houtman, 2010; Walter, 2006). Librarians have found collaborative professional development

54

to be a useful tool for increasing their own instruction abilities (Buck, 2014), and many librarians
want to engage in professional development once they start their career as a librarian (Maggio et
al., 2015).
Early teacher identities have been shown to be fragile, and challenges experienced during
teaching can lead to a reshaping of professional identity (Beltman, Glass, Dinham, Chalk, &
Nguyen, 2015; Flores, 2006; Lamote & Engles, 2010). Participation in a group provides support
for identity development (Wenger, 1998). For group participants, it was important for academic
librarians to understand the values and requirements of SoTL communities (Holland et al., 2011).
Individuals who are active in their participation in a community developed common identities
(Handley et al., 2006). Moreover, campus teaching centers can be instrumental in introducing
librarians to the SoTL community (Otto, 2014). Importantly, collaboration and partnerships are
key themes in research literature on librarians. In addition, the literature reveals that librarians
want to work within a community (Sproles et al., 2013). Ultimately, when librarians participate
in SoTL, they engage with a community of practitioners who teach and are interested in
developing their abilities for effective teaching and thereby affecting their identities.
Conclusion
Communities of practice support teaching and learning (Ryan, 2015). Jawitz and Perez
(2015) discovered that higher education faculty engage in professional development in order to
be part of a community. Participating in development opportunities and feeling connected to
other teachers can lead to a stronger teacher identity (van Lankveld et al., 2017). Thus, this
researcher framed this study around the theory of Communities of Practice. Wenger (1998)
identified communities of practice as being an important aspect of how identities in the
workplace are created and negotiated. Communities of practice provide the conceptual

55

framework for understanding the involvement of librarians in SoTL. The conceptual framework
also structures the study to help the researcher understand how participation in SoTL affects
librarians’ teacher identity.
Generally, librarians have not easily adopted a teacher identity (Freedman, 2014;
Houtman, 2010; Walter, 2008). A review of the literature identified a gap in the understanding
of how professional development forms academic librarians’ teacher identities. Professional
development is important for librarians because practicing librarians must often fill the gaps left
in their LIS education (Goodsett & Koziura, 2016). One specific gap in LIS education is in
teaching and pedagogical knowledge (Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Hall, 2017; Hensley, 2015). LIS
students recognize their need for information literacy instruction skills because they realize that
college students view librarians as instructors of information literacy and use. However, LIS
students do not feel comfortable in their expected role of teaching information literacy (Inskip,
2015). Unlike academic librarians, primary and secondary educators developed their teacher
identity during teacher education programs (Beauchamp & Thomas, 2009). Because many
librarians did not develop their teacher identity during their LIS programs, their teacher identity
must be developed on the job (Westrock & Fabian, 2010; Walter, 2008). Julien and Genuis
(2011) discovered that librarians who felt prepared for instruction responsibilities identified
teaching as important to their professional identity. The growth of a teacher identity is important
for librarians because researchers have related identity to teaching effectiveness (Sammons et al.,
2007). Moreover, having the opportunity to engage in practice teaching in a formal educational
setting affected identities (Horn et al., 2008).
SoTL is a form of scholarship suitable for librarians to apply in order to grow in their
teaching practice and more fully adopt the identity of a teacher. Mårtensson et al. (2011)

56

cautioned, though that the professional identity of teacher grows organically through SoTL
involvement. Professional identity should not be the focus of engagement with SoTL. Instead,
librarians should engage in the study of teaching, the study of student learning, and the
subsequent sharing of their study for its own rewards. A growth of a teacher identity will
develop naturally. Nonetheless, engagement in SoTL can affect professional identities (Roxå et
al., 2008).
Multiple gaps exist in the literature regarding librarians as teachers, librarians’ teacher
identity, librarians’ growth in their teacher identity through professional development, and
librarians’ involvement in SoTL (Perini, 2014; Walter, 2008). At the time of this study,
researchers had not conducted a study on librarians’ involvement with SoTL. More specifically,
researchers have not conducted an in-depth study of the growth of a professional teacher identity
through SoTL. In the literature review, the researcher identified a gap in the understanding of
how involvement in SoTL influences a teacher identity. As Perini (2014) stated, SoTL is a field
of scholarship where librarians have much to contribute and much to learn. Increased
engagement with a field focused on the study of student learning provides librarians with an
opportunity to increase their confidence and self-efficacy in teaching (Wheeler & McKinney,
2015).
The literature review supports this study to understand the role of SoTL in the growth of
librarians’ professional teacher identity. SoTL is a faculty development tool that many
institutions of higher education use (Beach, 2015; Geertsema, 2016; Saylor & Harper, 2003). If
librarians become more involved in professional development at their institutions, they would
likely encounter or engage in SoTL. This researcher identified a gap in the literature of studies
conducted on the growth of a teacher identity in librarians through professional development. In

57

summary, the researcher of this study seeks to understand if involvement in SoTL affects a
librarians’ professional identity by supporting and growing a teacher identity. The answers to
the research questions will add to the body of literature on librarianship, professional identity,
and SoTL.

Chapter III
Design and Methodology
Introduction
Previous studies have shown that librarians do not always identify as a teacher despite
instruction being an important part of their professional roles (Julien & Genuis, 2011; Matlin &
Carr, 2014; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). While teaching is essential for many librarians’ jobs
they often learn instruction skills in employee professional development training instead of
during their formal schooling (Bewick & Corrall, 2010; Houtman, 2010; Westbrock & Fabian,
2010). Researchers have recommended further investigation on how professional development
affects librarians’ teacher identity (Freedman, 2014; Walter, 2008). The researcher of this study
endeavored to fill that gap. The initial idea for the study resulted from a question the researcher
asked about engagement in SoTL: do members of the SoTL community create a teacher identity
as a result of studying teaching and learning? From this foundational question, the theoretical
framework, Communities of Practice, guided the researcher’s study design (Wenger, 1998).
Wenger (1998) concluded that meaning, learning, and identity could be found in communities
that work together toward a shared purpose. The researcher framed this study around the idea
that SoTL is a community of practitioners working toward the shared goal of improving teaching
to improve student learning.
Researchers have used qualitative methods in previous studies to explore the professional
identity of librarians (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Bronstein, 2011; Hicks, 2014; Sare & Bales,
2014; Walter, 2008; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). This study builds on the qualitative data
collection methods of previous studies and extends the research with the addition of quantitative
methods. The following chapter describes the design and methodology used to answer the

59

research questions. Within the chapter is information on study participants, data collection and
analysis, role of the researcher, and limitations. A description of the methods used to ensure
reliability and validity of the study is also included. Chapter III lays the groundwork for
understanding the study results and discussion found in Chapters IV and V.
Research Questions
The following research questions were used to guide this inquiry:
1. What reasons do academic instruction librarians state for their participation in the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning?
2. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ teacher identity?
3. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ instruction?
Research Design
During the development of the study, questions were developed that could be answered
with both qualitative and quantitative data (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). The questions led the
researcher to design an explanatory sequential mixed methods study. While mixed methods
research is recognized as one of the three research paradigms many opinions exist as to its rigor
and suitability (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, & Turner, 2007;
Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2012). In study designs that combine qualitative and quantitate data
ensuring credibility can be challenging because of the various ways validity and reliability are
addressed in the different methodologies (Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016). The researcher
recognized the complexity of mixed methods research and worked to ensure a strong study
(Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).

60

Despite the difficulties in developing a credible study, a multi-method approach allowed
the researcher to select the best methods of both quantitative and qualitative data collection.
Combining methods also helped to fully answer the three research questions, and it allowed the
researcher to focus on the strengths of quantitative and qualitative methods thereby minimizing
the weaknesses of each (Ivankova et al., 2006; Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006; Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2012). Lastly, mixing quantitative and qualitative data created a more complete
picture than if the researcher had only used one research method (Plano Clark & Ivankova,
2016).
Before beginning data collection, the researcher determined the primary purpose of the
research design to be complementarity. Complementarity allows for overlaps in the analysis of
the collected data (Caracelli & Greene, 1993; Greene et al., 1989; Ivankova & Plano Clark,
2016). More specifically, a complementary approach to mixed methods evaluation is when
“qualitative and quantitative methods are used to measure overlapping, but distinct facets of the
phenomenon under investigation” (Caracelli & Greene, 1993, p. 196). The methods allowed for
an understanding of the state of librarians’ involvement in SoTL, how librarians defined their
professional identity, and how their professional identities were influenced by their involvement
in SoTL. The sequence of the methods allowed for both breadth and depth of understanding.
Broad knowledge was achieved through quantitative results, and depth was achieved through
qualitative results (Denzin, 2012; Ivankova & Plano Clark, 2016; Johnson et al., 2007).
An explanatory sequential mixed methods study is designed to let the quantitative data
influence the direction of the qualitative portion of the study (Creswell, 2014, 2015). The
quantitative data are typically given priority in explanatory sequential mixed methods research
designs because quantitative data collection occurs first and it is often the majority of the data

61

gathered (Ivankova et al., 2006). Therefore, the researcher gave priority to the quantitative data
for the establishment of a foundation of knowledge about librarians’ engagement in SoTL
(Ivankova et al., 2006; Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016).
The researcher started with the hypothesis that engaging in SoTL would help librarians
grow their teacher identity. Therefore, the null hypothesis was that if librarians engage in the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, their identities would be the same as they were before.
By first collecting quantitative data from responses the researcher sought a broad understanding
of the reasons academic librarians choose to participate in SoTL, how they defined their
academic identity, and how their engagement in SoTL affected their teacher identity.
A secondary purpose for conducting a mixed methods approach was development
(Greene et al., 1989). After the survey results were analyzed, the quantitative data findings
helped provide parameters for the interview questions. The results from the survey guided the
creation of the next form of data collection because the researcher adapted an interview protocol
based on the quantitative results (Greene et al., 1989; Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016). This
integration of research methods allowed the researcher to conduct semi-structured interviews
designed to elicit a deeper understanding of the survey responses (Greene et al., 1989; Hanson et
al., 2005). The semi-structured interviews helped the researcher understand the complex
interplay between involvement in SoTL, the professional identity, and the instructional practices
of academic librarians (Galletta, 2013; Wengraf, 2001). The qualitative portion of this study
helped the researcher gain insight into academic librarians’ professional identities and into how
their identity developed through participation in SoTL.
Through the sequencing of the data collection methods, the researcher explained the
quantitative survey results with qualitative semi-structured interviews. In a sense, the sequential

62

nature of the study acted as a funnel, moving the researcher from broad understanding to more
specific knowledge (Fetters et al., 2013; Hanson et al., 2005; Ivankova et al., 2006). The
selected methods meant that the researcher engaged in both inductive and deductive inquiry, thus
completing the cycle of research (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2012). The explanatory sequential
mixed methods research design allowed the three research questions to be answered with greater
depth of understanding (Denzin, 2012; Johnson et al., 2007).
Participants
Study participants were academic instruction librarians employed at post-secondary
institutions in the United States. In 2015, there were 26,606 academic librarians working in the
United States (American Library Association, 2015). Approximately 23%, or 6,119, of all
academic librarians’ primary responsibilities include instruction (M. J. Petrowski, personal
communication, October 5, 2016). Instruction librarians are expected to teach information
literacy, work with students, understand curriculum, and possess other necessary skills (ACRL,
2007). A volunteer convenience sampling of librarians (n=95) on the Association of College and
Research Libraries (ACRL) listserv was used for the quantitative portion of the study (Teddlie &
Yu, 2007). Only academic instruction librarians who have participated in SoTL were included in
the results. Survey participants were asked if their main responsibilities include instruction and
if they have participated in SoTL. If they answered in the affirmative to both questions, then the
remainder of the survey was revealed. Participants who responded that their main responsibility
is not instruction and/or have not participated in SoTL were not shown the full survey and were
excluded. Permission to conduct a survey on the Information Literacy listserv was provided by
the site owner and associate director of ACRL (Appendix C). At the time the researcher sent the

63

survey, there were 6,163 subscribers to the ACRL Information Literacy listserv (M. Heuer, personal
communication, 2017).
A purposeful sample of seven librarians (n=7) involved with SoTL, gathered from
purposeful sampling, was used for the qualitative portion of the study. Purposeful sampling
occurs when participants are selected to represent a population (Teddlie & Yu, 2007). The
sampling strategy was used in order to ensure productive data gathering during the semistructured interviews (Palinkas et al., 2015). Table 1 displays the demographics of the interview
participants. Participants indicated their willingness to be interviewed by checking a box in the
survey and providing their contact information.

A short timeline between the survey and interviews helped mitigate the potential loss of
participants (Curry & Nunez-Smith, 2015). To integrate the methods, the researcher connected
the survey participants with interview participants by ensuring the interview participants
represented the survey population (Fetters et al., 2013).
Before conducting research, the researcher took the Protecting Human Research
Participants course from the National Institute of Health (Appendix D). Next, approval to
conduct the study was received from Northwest Nazarene University’s Institutional Review
Board (Appendix E). Survey participants gave consent when they clicked on the internet survey.
Each interviewee signed an informed consent (Appendix F). The researcher informed each
interview participant of how the data were to be used and how the data were to be kept
confidential. Due to the mixed methodology, interview participants knew that they would be
asked questions about their survey responses. Their survey responses were not anonymous but
were confidential (Hesse-Biber, 2010).
All possible risks to the participants were minimized. Risks included feelings of
uncomfortableness, unease, and/or embarrassment due to the disclosure of personal feelings and
experiences. To decrease the risks, the researcher made sure of confidentiality and allowed
participants to withdraw from the study at any time. Confidentiality was maintained through
coding and assigning each participant a unique identifying number (Librarian 1, Librarian 2,
Librarian 3, etc.). By decreasing risks and thoroughly explaining the purpose of the study, the
researcher developed trust with the participants. Moreover, the researcher kept appointments,
was respectful, and was reliable. To demonstrate respect to interviewees, the researcher
recognized each participant as a person with rights who could withdraw at any time. Respect
was also shown to participants by remembering that it was important to ensure confidentiality.

65

The researcher also sought to do no harm to the participants (Marshall & Rossman, 2016).
Power structures were recognized as occurring in librarian/faculty relationships, and the
researcher reminded interviewees of confidentiality (Hagman, 2015; Julien & Pecoskie, 2009).
All attempts were made to ensure each participant in the study was made to feel that they were
safe, that they were comfortable, and that their voice was being heard.
Data Collection
Communities of practice are “a way of talking about how learning changes who we are
and creates personal histories of becoming in the context of our communities” (Wenger, 1998, p.
5). This definition, along with Wenger’s (1998) understanding of identity, denoted where the
researcher started constructing the data collection methods. Understanding how identity is
formed through learning in groups helped the researcher ask questions of participants that were
most pertinent to the study. Moreover, the theoretical framework kept the survey and interview
questions focused because the researcher used Wenger’s description of identity to guide question
development.
In addition to the theoretical framework, the survey questions were adapted from the
University of Wisconsin’s Teaching and Learning Impact Survey (Meyers, 2007). The Teaching
and Learning Impact Survey helped researchers understand the impact of SoTL at the University
of Wisconsin (Meyers, 2007). Permission to adapt survey questions was obtained from Meyers’
colleague, Dr. Ciccone, since Dr. Meyers is deceased (Appendix G). The researcher added
questions specific for librarians to The Teaching and Learning Impact Survey. The survey
included a retrospective pre-post design as this helped the researcher establish a base in which to
measure the impact of SoTL.

66

The survey was created using the survey creation software Qualtrics (Appendix H).
Ordinal data were collected from 54 Likert-scale and five multiple-choice questions on the
survey. The researcher sent the survey via e-mail to the ACRL Information Literacy listserv
(Appendix I). The survey remained open for 4 weeks. Two reminder e-mails were sent to the
ACRL Information Literacy listserv during the 4 weeks the survey was available to participants
(Appendix J).
Due to the sequential nature of this study, the researcher conducted the seven semistructured interviews after the analysis of collected survey data. This study’s interview questions
were informed by the results of the survey (Fetters et al., 2013), adapted from Walter’s (2008)
study on librarians’ teacher identity, and fundamentally influenced by Wenger’s (1998)
description of identity and communities of practice (Appendix K). Walter gave permission to
adapt the interview questions for the researcher’s current study (Appendix L). Interviews are a
beneficial qualitative data collection tool (Brenner, 2006; Creswell, 2013; Doody & Noonan,
2013; Marshall & Rossman, 2016) that allow for a vast amount of data to be collected in a
relatively short amount of time. Interviews also allow for clarification of data (Brenner, 2006;
Marshall & Rossman, 2016).
Before the start of the interviews, the participants gave verbal assent to take part in the
study. The participants had previously signed an informed consent (Appendix F). The
researcher used a protocol, but because the interviews were semi-structured, probes were used to
elicit more detail and clarify question responses (Brenner, 2006; Marshall & Rossman, 2016).
All interviews were conducted via the telephone. The researcher recorded the interviews using
the app Voice Recorder on an iPad Air. Interviews lasted no more than 60 minutes. The
researcher saved the recordings on a password protected file on an external hard drive. After the

67

interviews, the researcher transcribed the recordings. The researcher chose to transcribe the
interviews and did not hire a transcriptionist. Transcribing the interviews was important to the
researcher in order to become more familiar with the data (Brenner, 2006). The researcher will
keep the data for 3 years post study in compliance with the Federalwide Assurance Code. After
3 years, the data collected in this study will be destroyed (45 CRF 46.117).
Analytical Methods
The researcher analyzed the data through the theoretical lens of Communities of Practice
(Wenger, 1998). For Research Question 1, the researcher collected descriptive statistics to
identify which librarians in the population had participated in SoTL. For Research Questions 2
and 3, the researcher used the software program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) to run a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to examine the quantitative data collected from the
surveys data gathered in Qualtrics (Field, 2013). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a nonparametric test used for ordinal data that tests the mean difference between two observations
(Laerd Statistics, 2015b). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used “to determine whether there is a
mean difference between paired or matched observations” (Laerd Statistics, 2015b, para 1).
While a Wilcoxon signed-rank test looks at the mean differences, even though ordinal data in the
form of Likert-scale questions was collected, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test is still appropriate
since it is specifically used for non-parametric ordinal data. As a result, the researcher selected
this statistical test to understand agreements among librarians regarding the impact of their
engagement in SoTL and their teacher identity. The researcher aggregated the survey data and
compared the data about librarians’ teaching responsibilities, their engagement with SoTL
literature, their professional interests, their teaching ability and effectiveness, their level of
involvement in SoTL research, their discussions about SoTL, and their teaching design.

68

Statistical results found the chance of a teacher identity forming in librarians through their
engagement in SoTL (Field, 2013). Findings allowed the researcher to accept or reject the null
hypothesis by testing against a p-value. A p-value of less than .05 was considered significant for
this two-tailed test (Field, 2013). Table 2 aligns the research questions with the quantitative data
collection methods and variables.

For the qualitative data, the researcher used the software program NVivo to analyze the
interviews and to identify themes. Using NVivo the researcher conducted open coding of the
interview transcripts to reveal themes and the main ideas in the qualitative data (Marshall &
Rossman, 2016). The codes emerged from the data until the data was exhausted.

69

The researcher used a contiguous approach to reporting the data (Fetters et al., 2013).
The quantitative results are shown in a table; a table allows for easy viewing of the data. The
qualitative results are represented in a narrative discussion. While the narrative primarily
focused on the qualitative data analysis, the researcher integrated findings from the survey to
demonstrate the mixing of the methods (Fetters et al., 2013; Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016).
Describing study results in a narrative format allowed the researcher to frame the discussion
within the theoretical framework.
Validity and Reliability
In explanatory sequential mixed methods studies, the researcher needs to determine the
validity of the survey data and consider the validity of the data collected through the semi-structured
interviews (Creswell, 2014). Onwuegbuzie and Johnson (2006) noted the complexity of validity
in mixed methods studies. An expert in both SoTL and academic librarianship initially reviewed
the survey and provided recommendations on wording, the relevance of survey questions, and
the reliability of the survey questions to answer the research questions. The initial validation
process took place over an hour long virtual discussion and then via e-mail.
After the first expert examined the survey nine academic instruction librarians reviewed
the survey for content validity. The content validity index was 93%. This S-CVI did not include
two questions: What is your gender? and What is your employment status? Those questions
were included in order to correlate data; however, they were not directly relevant to the purpose
of the study. The content experts had a universal agreement of 59.6%.
The content experts also listed the research question with which they believed each
survey question aligned. Once this data were collected, to ensure the relevancy of the survey
questions to the research questions, the researcher asked the nine content experts to identify their

70

level of agreement or disagreement with the alignment of each of the survey questions to the
selected research question. Based on input from the content experts each survey question was
strongly aligned to a research question.
The researcher used face validity to determine if the survey questions measured what
they intended to measure (Nevo, 1985). Tourangeau (2004) discussed the difficulty of validating
attitudinal survey questions. Therefore, the researcher also conducted face validity with three
content experts and adjusted survey questions based on confusion indicated by participants
(Tourangeau, 2004).
After content and face validity, the survey was sent to a pilot group of 12 academic
librarians. The researcher ran Cronbach’s alpha to determine the reliability of the survey.
Cronbach’s alpha measured the internal consistency of the Likert scale questions on the survey
(Field, 2013). Specifically, the test determined the reliability of the survey questions related to
SoTL’s impact on instruction and teacher identity. Based on the alpha scores from the pilot the
researcher moved forward with data collection. The full survey had a Cronbach's alpha of .939.
Research Question 2 had an alpha score of .906, and Research Question 3 had an alpha score of
.881.
Recognizing the importance and complexity of validity, the researcher used weakness
minimization to focus on the strengths of each type of data collection (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson,
2006). The researcher determined the validity of the instrument by weighing all possible options
from the quantitative data collected (Creswell, 2014). The developmental research rationale also
increased the validity of the study. The quantitative results informed the qualitative methods, thus
increasing the credibility of the study (Greene et al., 1989; Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016). In

71

addition to weighing all possible options, the researcher used content validity and confirmed the
findings measured the “content [the questions] were intended to measure” (Creswell, 2014, p. 160).
The researcher also scored the surveys consistently (Creswell, 2014).
For Research Question 1, the researcher collected descriptive statistics to identify which
librarians in the population had participated in SoTL. The researcher ran Cronbach’s alpha to test
the reliability of the survey questions once all survey data were collected. The full survey had a
high level of internal consistency, as determined by a Cronbach's alpha of .934. Scale statistics
were also run on the survey questions aligned with research questions two and three. Research
Question 2 had Cronbach’s alpha score of .899 and Research Question 3 had a Cronbach’s alpha
score of .872. Reliable survey results influenced the semi-structured interviews.
To ensure the credibility of interviews, the researcher piloted the interview questions with
two academic instruction librarians to make sure the questions would lead to relevant data
(Brenner, 2006). Based on results from the pilot, the interview questions were modified, and the
final protocol was written (Appendix K). Throughout the qualitative data collection phase, the
researcher kept an audit trail in the form of a research log. The research log aided in the
credibility of the findings (Bell, 2014; Creswell & Miller, 2000; Marshall & Rossman, 2016).
To validate the findings of the interviews, the researcher used member checking (Creswell,
2014, 2015; Marshall & Rossman, 2016). Participants reviewed initial research conclusions from
the interviews. Due to the possibility of increased discomfort to the participants, the researcher did
not ask the participants to review interview transcripts (Mero-Jaffe, 2011). Instead, initial study
results were shared with the study participants via e-mail (Appendix M). Participants were asked to
review initial results from their interview and confirm that their voices were accurately represented

72

(Marshall & Rossman, 2016). To determine the reliability of the semi-structured interviews, the
researcher checked transcripts for errors (Creswell, 2014).
Limitations
Limitations exist in every study (Creswell, 2015; Marshall & Rossman, 2016). In this
study, weaknesses include the retrospective pre-post survey design. Generally, the retrospective
pre-post survey design is susceptible to limitations of recall and self-reporting (Klatt & TaylorPowell, 2005a; Klatt & Taylor-Powell, 2005b). Participants might have been unable to recall
their identity and instructional beliefs prior to involvement in SoTL, they might have a “social
desirability bias,” and/or an “effort justification bias” (Colosi & Dunifon, 2006, p. 3). Social
desirability bias is when participants want to report development in an area in order to meet
expectations. Effort justification bias is when participants indicate improvement in an area to
validate time they spent involved in an activity (Colosi & Dunifon, 2006). Given these
limitations of the retrospective pre-post survey design the researcher asked clarifying questions
in the interviews to help explain some of the data collected.
Another limitation involves the size of the study’s sample population (Creswell, 2015).
A volunteer convenience sample was used to collect quantitative data via a survey. As a result of
the use of volunteer convenience sampling for the quantitative portion of the study, the results
may not be representative of all librarians (Creswell, 2015; Teddlie & Yu, 2007). The researcher
asked librarians who took the survey if instruction was a primary role. Only librarians with
instruction as a main job responsibility were included in the study results. Therefore, other
librarians could engage in SoTL, and that engagement could influence their identity. The
population for this study was specific. Another study limitation involves the external timeline
set by the researcher’s university; the survey was open from August 14- August 31, 2017.

73

Because the survey was open during the month of August, some potential participants might
have missed taking part in the study or chose not to participate due to time constraints relating to
the start of the academic year. A non-response bias is also present in this study (Berg, 2005).
Less than two percent of the academic instruction librarians took the survey. It is unknown how
many academic instruction librarians have participated in SoTL and that number of academic
instruction librarians who participate in SoTL was not identified in this study.
Possible researcher bias existed. The researcher is an academic instruction librarian who
possesses a professional interest in SoTL. During the interviews, the researcher was the
instrument and thus potentially brought bias to the process (Marshall & Rossman, 2016).
Nevertheless, the researcher purposefully minimized bias through the use of quantitative survey
results. Bracketing was used to separate the researcher’s personal feelings and experiences from
those of the study participants (Marshall, 2016). During the qualitative data collection and
analysis, the researcher kept notes to bracket her bias. The notes were analyzed for bias prior to
final data analysis (Fischer, 2009). Bracketing allowed the researcher to acknowledge personal
experiences but set aside them aside in order to let the voices of the participants lead the results
(Fischer, 2009; Glasser, 1992).
An additional study limitation is that the researcher assumed all participants were honest
on both the survey and in the interviews. Last, the qualitative study is subject to personal and
multiple interpretations. The researcher used member checking to ensure the credibility of the
data; nevertheless, it is possible that another researcher would interpret the transcripts differently
(Marshall & Rossman, 2016). Further research is recommended to address the limitations of this
study.

74

Role of the Researcher
As an academic instruction librarian, the researcher recognized a personal agenda for
taking up the topic of librarian identity development through SoTL. The researcher brought to the
study the bias that SoTL was useful for teacher identity development for all those working in
higher education—including librarians. However, the literature did not support the belief that
SoTL was useful in helping librarians develop a professional identity. The literature only
supported that SoTL and identity development in higher education faculty are linked (McLean,
2009). For the researcher, the motivation for this study was personal. In order to minimize bias,
the researcher answered the interview questions and made note of any relationship and/or prior
knowledge with the interviewees. These notes were kept at the ready during qualitative analysis.
Conclusion
Librarians’ participation in SoTL is understudied (Bradley, 2009; MacMillan, 2015; Otto,
2014; Perini, 2014). The explanatory sequential mixed methodology of this study allowed for a
thorough answering of the research questions (Creswell, 214; Denzin, 2012; Johnson et al., 2007;
Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). Starting with the collection of quantitative data aided the
researcher in understanding the breadth of librarian involvement in SoTL; next, the qualitative
data provided depth of knowledge (Denzin, 2012; Johnson et al., 2007). In summary, the study
was influenced by Wenger’s (1998) description of identity and communities of practice. Survey
questions were adapted from the University of Wisconsin’s Teaching and Learning Impact
Survey (Meyers, 2007). Interview questions were adapted and modified from Walter’s (2008)
study on librarians’ teacher identity. The primary rationale for the mixed methods approach was
complementarity. In other words, the qualitative data complemented and explained the
quantitative data (Greene et al., 1989; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). Overall, priority was given

75

to the quantitative data (Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016), but the researcher integrated the
quantitative and qualitative methods through the explanatory sequential nature of the study
(Bryman, 2006; Hanson et al., 2005; Ivankova et al., 2006).

Chapter IV
Results
Introduction
As librarians continue to be required to perform teaching instruction as part of their job
duties, it is important for academic librarians to identify themselves as teachers because such
self-identity corresponds to teaching effectiveness (Day & Kington, 2008; Houtman, 2010;
Mansfield et al., 2014; Walter, 2005). Previous researchers have connected participation in the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) to instructors possessing a teacher identity
(Bennet et al., 2016; Cambridge, 2001; Kahn et al., 2013; Mitchell & Mitchell, 2015; Saylor &
Harper, 2003). SoTL is an international program designed to improve learning in higher
education (Pope-Ruark, 2012; Shulman, 2006). However, research on academic instruction
librarians’ participation in SoTL is limited (Bradley, 2009; MacMillan, 2015; Otto, 2014; Perini,
2014). The results of this study helped fill that gap.
A review of the literature showed that academic librarians’ jobs include teaching
responsibilities (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Hagman, 2015; Julien & Genuis, 2011; Wheeler &
McKinney, 2015). While graduate Library and Information Science (LIS) programs are the
favored place to develop teaching skills, most librarians learn how to teach on the job (Maggio et
al., 2015; Sare et al., 2012; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). For the reason that most librarians learn
to teach after they are employed, the researcher sought to understand how academic instruction
librarians develop the identity as a teacher—specifically by examining their involvement in
SoTL. SoTL is an area of research into teaching and learning in higher education (Shulman,
2006). Kahn et al. (2013) found that involvement in a SoTL network affects higher education
professors’ identities. Based on the literature review findings, the research questions for this

77
investigation were designed to gain an understanding of academic instruction librarians’
participation in SoTL. Specifically, the researcher wrote the research questions to help develop
an understanding of how academic librarians were involved in SoTL and how SoTL affects
identity and instruction. Importantly, other researchers have recommended further such studies
on how professional development affects librarians’ teacher identity (Freedman, 2014; Walter,
2008). In addition, SoTL is often considered a tool for professional development and is situated
as such in this study (Geertsema, 2016; Meyers, 2007).
In this study, the researcher was guided by the theoretical framework, Communities of
Practice (Wenger, 1998). This theory was introduced by Lave and Wenger (1991) in Situated
Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation. In Situated Learning theory, the authors
designated the main situated learning groups communities of practice. Within these
Communities of Practice, participants engage in meaning-making, learning, and identity
formation (Wenger, 1998). Wenger (1998) described the component of identity in social
learning as “a way of talking about how learning changes who we are and creates personal
histories of becoming in the context of our communities” (p. 5). Many other researchers have
found Communities of Practice useful for understanding higher education practices and
membership (August & Dewar, 2010; Belzowski et al., 2013; Kissel et al., 2016; Pharo et al.,
2013). Thus, this study is underpinned by the idea that SoTL is a community of practitioners—a
community of practice—working toward the shared goal of improving teaching to improve
student learning (Barnard et al., 2011; Kahn et al., 2013; Michael, 2012; Shulman, 2006;
Wenger, 1998).
An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was utilized for this research study.
Quantitative data were collected from a survey sent to the Association of College and Research

78
Librarians’ Information Literacy Listserv. The researcher then gathered qualitative data from
semi-structured interviews of survey participants who agreed to be interviewed. The qualitative
data helped explain the quantitative data (Fetters et al., 2013; Hanson et al., 2005; Ivankova et
al., 2006). The research questions for this study were the following:
1. What reasons do academic instruction librarians state for their participation in the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning?
2. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ teacher identity?
3. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ instruction?
Chapter IV includes the results of the quantitative survey data and qualitative semistructured interview data gathered to answer the research questions. The chapter is organized by
the research questions. Results from the quantitative and qualitative data are combined under the
headings for each research question to provide a full understanding of the findings. The
researcher analyzed the collected data through the Communities of Practice theoretical
framework (Wenger, 1998). The results are presented through that lens.
Data Collection Instruments
Survey Instrument
The survey included two primary sections (Appendix H). The first section included
demographic questions and questions about participants’ engagement in SoTL. On the second
section of the survey, participants were asked to reflect on their time before they became
involved in SoTL and after their involvement in SoTL. For each question, participants ranked
their response on a 5-point Likert scale:

79


1 = Strongly disagree.



2 = Somewhat disagree.



3 = Neutral.



4 = Somewhat agree.



5 = Strongly agree.

Interview Protocol
The interview protocol was adapted from Walter’s (2005) doctoral study on academic
librarians’ teacher identity. Once survey results were received, the researcher modified the
protocol to explain the quantitative data. During a review of the survey results, the researcher
noticed the mean score for the use of technology before SoTL was 3.44 and after SoTL was 4.19.
With the exception of the survey item, I believe there are many ways to teach and learn the same
thing, the effect size for the question on the use of technology was the lowest at .612. Thus, the
researcher added a question to the protocol that dealt specifically with participants’ use of
technology. For the statement I identify positively with members of the higher education
teaching profession, the mean score before involvement in SoTL was 3.80 and after SoTL was
also 4.43. Therefore, the researcher added questions to the interview protocol about participants’
interactions with librarians and others in the higher education community. The researcher also
added a question about the use of assessment because the z-score of 6.852 was high. The
researcher also added questions to the interview protocol about how participation in SoTL
impacted the instruction of interviewees because those questions were needed to answer
Research Question 3.

Participant Profile
Survey Participants
A 59-item Likert scale and multiple-choice survey was sent to the Information Literacy
Listserv of the American Library Association. The survey included a retrospective pre-post
design. This study design is useful in collecting self-reported data before and after an event or
intervention (Klatt & Taylor-Powell, 2005a). Klatt and Taylor-Powell (2005b) found that the
retrospective pre-post design “has been shown to reduce response-shift bias providing more
accurate assessments of actual effect, is convenient to implement, [and] provides comparison
data in the absence of ‘pre’ data” (p. 1). The retrospective pre-post design aided the researcher
in establishing a base from which to measure the influence of SoTL. During the time of data
collection, there were 6,163 subscribers to the listserv (M. Heuer, personal communication, 2017).
Participants were asked if they had participated in SoTL based on the following definition that
was crafted in conjunction with the first content expert:
The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning is something many librarians engage in but it
is not always called the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. For this survey,
participation in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning includes the following
activities, whether they are directly related to information literacy or deal with teaching
and learning more generally. Scholars have defined the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning as researching the teaching and learning that occurs in higher education in order
to improve student learning (Shulman, 2006). SoTL studies are often conducted on
participants taught by the researcher. For this survey, participation in the Scholarship of
Teaching and Learning included the following:


Reading teaching and learning literature

81


Attending teaching and learning conferences



Using the teaching and learning literature in your teaching



Conducting teaching and learning research



Presenting and/or publishing teaching and learning research



Implementing the techniques and methods supported by your own teaching and
learning research in the classroom.

If a participant responded that they had not participated in SoTL based on the definition used in
this research, continuation on the survey ended. Seven participants marked “No” for their
response. Participants were also asked if their primary job responsibilities included instruction.
If they answered no, the survey closed. Three participants indicated their primary job duties did
not include instruction. Therefore, no additional data were collected from these 10 participants.
The available population is unknown because it is indefinite how many academic
instruction librarians have participated in SoTL. As stated in Chapter III, from this research, it
can be concluded that at least 1% of academic instruction librarians have some level of
involvement in SoTL. Ninety-five participants of the population finished complete or partial
surveys. However, the n differed by survey response since some participants dropped out or did
not answer certain questions. Appendix N summarizes the participant population for each survey
question.
Survey participants represented a broad range of the academic instruction librarian
population. Table 3 summarizes the survey participant demographics for gender and
employment status for both complete and incomplete survey results. Of the 95 participants, 63,
or 66.32%, had faculty status. Twenty, or 31.75%, of the librarians with faculty status were
tenured, and 43, or 68.25%, were non-tenured. Of the non-tenured faculty, 12, or 27.91%, were

82

eligible for tenure within the next 3 years. Table 3 also summarizes the institution type where
the survey participants were currently employed. Specifically, 13.68% worked at community
colleges, 30.52% worked at research universities, 11.58% worked at regional universities,
21.05% worked at private liberal arts universities, and 14.74% worked at private liberal arts
colleges. Only 2.11% worked at for-profit institutions. Last, 6.32% marked “other” as their
place of employment.
Survey participants had various career lengths. Specifically, 37.89% of the survey
participant population had worked 0-5 years. Participants who had worked 6-10 years made up
21.05% of the population, and participants who had worked 11-15 years made up 12.63% of the
population. However, 11.58% of the participants had worked 16-20 years, 9.47% had worked
21-25 years, 5.25% had worked 26-30 years, and 1.05% had worked 31-35 years and 36+ years.

Interview Participants
Of the 95 librarians who completed the survey, 40 agreed to be interviewed. These
librarians represented a range of experience. After reviewing the demographic data and the
survey results, the researcher selected seven academic instruction librarians to interview.
Interview participants were selected to represent a range of demographics and represent the
overall survey population. Polkinghorne (2005) emphasized that samples are selected in

84

qualitative research to represent a population. A representative sample allows the researcher to
understand the extent of the experience being studied.
The survey population was 83.15% female and 13.68% male. Therefore, the researcher
selected six females (85.71%) and one male (14.29%) for the interview. As shown in Table 3,
66.32% of the survey population had faculty status, 25.26% were categorized by their institution
as staff, and 8.42% of the survey population marked other for their employment status.
Therefore, the researcher selected five librarians, or 71.43%, with faculty status and two
librarians, or 28.57%, who had staff employment status.
The tenure status of the librarians with faculty status was also important. Of the surveyed
population with faculty status, 21.05% were tenured, 45.26% were not tenured, and 12.63% were
eligible for tenure in the next 3 years. Therefore, the researcher selected two librarians who were
tenured, which was 28.57% of the interview population. The researcher also selected one
librarian who would apply for tenure in the next 3 years, which was 14.29% of the interview
population, and two librarians who were faculty but not tenured and not eligible in the next 3
years, which was 28.57% of the interview population.
The researcher also took the type of institution the interview participants worked at into
consideration and closely aligned such with the survey population. Seven different types of
institutions were represented in the survey population; consequently, the researcher balanced the
type of institution represented with the other demographic data. One academic instruction
librarian, or 14.29%, who worked at a research university participated in an interview. One
librarian, or 14.29%, of the interview population, worked at a community college. The
researcher selected two librarians who worked at regional universities for interviews, which was
28.57% of the interview population. The researcher also selected two librarians who worked at

85

private liberal arts universities, which was also 28.57% of the population; this aligned closely
with the surveyed population. Last, the survey population included 14 librarians, or 14.74%,
who worked at private liberal arts colleges, so one interview participant, or 14.29%, worked at a
private liberal arts college.
Table 4 details the demographics of the interview participants, including gender,
employment status, tenure status, institutional status, and length of experience. The length of
experience each participant had in the field of librarianship was also important. Most survey
participants, 37.89% of the population, had worked in the field 0-5 years. Consequently, the
researcher selected three librarians, or 42.86%, for interviews who had 0-5 years of experience.
Librarians with 6-10 years of experience accounted for 21.05% of the survey population. Of the
interview participants, librarians with 6-10 years of experience accounted for 28.57% of the
population. Librarians with 11-15 years of experience made up 12.63% of the survey
population. Therefore, the researcher selected one librarian, or 14.29%, for the interview portion
of the study. Finally, one librarian (14.29%) with 16-20 years of experience was chosen for an
interview because 11.58% of the survey population had 16-20 years of experience. The survey
population included librarians who had been in the field for 21-25 years, 26-30 years, 31-35
years, and 36+ years. However, each of those categories accounted for less than 10% of the
survey population and were therefore not included in the interview population.

Once the interviewees were selected, the researcher e-mailed each participant at the
address provided. After receiving confirmation of their willingness to participate, the researcher
sent the participants the interview protocol (Appendix K) along with the informed consent
(Appendix F). This form was signed and returned prior to participating in an interview. The
researcher conducted the interviews via telephone.
Survey Validity and Reliability
In mixed methods studies, maintaining credibility can be challenging because of the
different ways validity and reliability are addressed in the two methodologies (Plano Clark &
Ivankova, 2016). The researcher recognized the potential issues with ensuring the credibility of

87

the research in the mixed methods design (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006; Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2009). In this study, the researcher needed to determine the validity of the quantitative
survey data as well as consider the validity of the qualitative data collected through the semistructured interviews (Creswell, 2014). To ensure a strong research study, the researcher
confirmed the validity of the survey in three different ways.
Expert panel. First, an expert in both SoTL and academic librarianship reviewed the
survey. This person has been called the most active librarian in SoTL (Chick, 2016). She holds
a Master of Library Science and is a retired instruction librarian. In addition to her work as a
librarian, she has given numerous presentations on SoTL, published her own SoTL research, and
sits on the Publication Advisory Council for the International Society for the Scholarship of
Teaching and Learning’s journal Teaching and Learning Inquiry. After a thorough review of the
survey, the expert gave recommendations on wording, the relevance of survey questions, and the
reliability of the survey questions to answer the research questions. This validation process
occurred during a 60-minute virtual discussion and then via e-mail. She suggested including
additional ways a librarian could be involved in SoTL. Before her review of the survey, the
definition of SoTL included the following:


Reading teaching and learning literature.



Conducting teaching and learning research.



Presenting teaching and learning research.



Publishing the results of teaching and learning research.



Attending teaching and learning conferences.



Implementing the techniques and methods supported by the teaching and learning
literature in the classroom.

88

After her review the definition was as follows:


Reading teaching and learning literature.



Using the teaching and learning literature in your teaching.



Conducting teaching and learning research.



Presenting and/or publishing teaching and learning research in either information literacy
or general teaching and learning literature and/or conferences.



Attending teaching and learning conferences, which includes both information literacy
and more general teaching and learning in higher education conferences



Implementing the techniques and methods supported by the teaching and learning
literature in the classroom.
The first content expert also recommended including the following phrase, “The

Scholarship of Teaching and Learning is something many librarians engage in, but it is not
always called the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning.” Furthermore, she encouraged the
researcher to define the term my students.
Content validity index. After the expert validation, nine academic instruction librarians
reviewed the survey for content validity. Content validity determines if the content of the
questions measures what it is intended to measure (Creswell, 2014). The scale content validity
index (S-CVI) was 93%. The S-CVI signifies the content validity of the survey. Polit and Beck
(2006) recommend a S-CVI of at least .90 or 90%. This S-CVI did not include two questions:
“What is your gender?” and “What is your employment status?” Those questions had been
originally included in the survey to correlate data; however, the questions were not directly
relevant to the purpose of the study. The content experts had a universal agreement (S-CVI/UA)
of 59.6%. The S-CVI/UA is the percent of questions deemed relevant to the study. Most of the

89

disagreement among the experts was over the demographic questions, which led to a lower
universal agreement. Appendix O includes the content validity index.
A panel of nine experts in the field of library science reviewed the survey items to
determine which research question aligned to each survey question. Additionally, the researcher
asked the nine content experts to identify their level of agreement or disagreement with the
alignment of each of the survey questions to a selected research question. Based on input from
the content experts, the researcher aligned each survey question to a research question. The
panelists were comprised of seven librarians and two faculty members. Of the seven librarians,
three were library directors, and four were librarians with active SoTL experience. The two
faculty members had both conducted SoTL research. The composition of the panel was selected
to gain a range of expertise in librarianship and SoTL. Table 5 depicts the demographics of the
expert panel.

The third method the researcher used to check the validity of the survey was face validity.
This method was utilized to determine if survey questions measured what each were intended to
measure (Nevo, 1985). Table 6 depicts the demographic data of each content expert. The
content experts for face validity were a mix of librarians and faculty members with experience in
faculty development. Three content experts were asked to review each survey question and make
notes on anything they found confusing or unclear. The researcher then combined the notes from
the content experts and looked for patterns. Finally, the researcher adjusted survey questions
based on confusion indicated by the content experts (Tourangeau, 2004). From the face validity
process, the researcher adjusted wording and addressed concerns about redundancy.

Cronbach’s Alpha of pilot survey. Testing the internal consistency reliability of study
results is necessary for high quality research (Henson, 2001). The internal consistency reliability
tells a researcher how reliable the instrument is by calculating the extent of each item’s
assessment of “the same construct” (Trochim, 2006, Internal Consistency Reliability, para. 1). In
other words, internal consistency reliability determines if the survey questions measure the same
thing. Researchers use Cronbach’s alpha to measure the internal consistency of Likert-scale
questions (Field, 2013; Laerd Statistics, 2005a). An alpha score of .7 is considered acceptable
(DeVellis, 2003; Kline, 2005). A high alpha score indicates a high internal consistency (Field,
2013; Laerd Statistics, 2005a). The researcher conducted a pilot of the survey with 12 academic
instruction librarians. The full survey had a high level of internal consistency indicated by a
Cronbach's alpha of .934. Scale statistics were also run on the survey questions aligned with
Research Questions 2 and 3. Research Question 2 had a Cronbach’s alpha score of .899.
Research Question 3 had a Cronbach’s alpha score of .872. These results were all above .7, and
therefore were considered acceptable (DeVellis, 2003; Kline, 2005). The alpha scores indicated

92
the survey questions were measuring the same construct. Cronbach’s alpha was not used for
Research Question 1, because descriptive statistics were used to identify which librarians in the
population had participated in SoTL.
Cronbach’s Alpha of final survey. After survey results were gathered, the researcher
ran Cronbach’s alpha on the completed survey to determine the internal consistency of the final
data (Field, 2013; Laerd Statistics, 2005a). The alpha score for all the ordinal questions in the
pre-post survey section was .941. This alpha score showed a high internal consistency among
survey participants. Results for each sub-section of questions showed a strong internal
consistency. The alpha score for questions aligned with Research Question 2 was .991, and the
alpha score for questions aligned with Research Question 3 was .881. These results were all
within the acceptable range because they were above .7 (DeVellis, 2003; Kline, 2005). The high
alpha scores indicate the questions on the survey were measuring the same concept. Due to
these results, the researcher did not eliminate any questions.
Interview Pilot
Conducting a pilot of the interview protocol is important to ensure the questions elicit
responses relevant to the research questions (Brenner, 2006). Piloting the research also lets the
research test the recording equipment and work out any potential difficulties (Creswell, 2014;
Marshall & Rossman, 2016). The researcher piloted the interview protocol with two academic
librarians who participated in validating the survey. On the pilot survey, both pilot interview
participants indicated their willingness to participate in an interview. The pilot interviews
confirmed the questions on the protocol were eliciting the responses the researcher needed to
answer the research questions. The researcher made one change after the pilot. The change

93

made was to include the definition of SoTL on the interview protocol. Demographics of the two
academic librarians who participated in the pilot are in Table 7.

Results for Research Question 1: Reasons Academic Librarians Participate in SoTL
The review of the literature showed that librarians participated in SoTL, but their reasons
for involvement were unknown (Bradley, 2009; MacMillan, 2015; Perini, 2014). Instead,
authors offered opinions about librarians and SoTL, but research had not been conducted
(Bradley, 2009; MacMillan, 2015; Otto, 2014; Perini, 2014). Given this discovery, this study’s
author wrote Research Question 1 to better understand academic instruction librarians’ reasons
for participating in SoTL. Data gathered for this question helped form a foundational
understanding of the reasons librarians choose to participate in SoTL. Specifically, Research
Question 1 asked: What reasons do academic instruction librarians state for their participation in
the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning? The researcher used both the quantitative survey
results and the qualitative interviews to answer this research question.
Quantitative Results
To better understand the reasons why academic instruction librarians participated in
SoTL, the researcher first needed to know who participated in SoTL. To gather this
information, the researcher sent a survey to the Information Literacy listserv hosted by the

94

Association of College and Research Libraries. Ninety-five participants of the population
indicated they participated in SoTL, and of those 95 individuals, 40 of them agreed to be
interviewed.
Qualitative Results
Follow-up interviews with seven participants from the survey participant pool aided the
researcher in explaining the quantitative results (Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016). For the
qualitative data, the researcher transcribed the interviews and used NVivo to identify themes that
emerged from the data. Once themes were identified, they were collapsed into codes. Then, to
confirm the identified codes accurately represented the interview participants’ thoughts and
feelings, the researcher e-mailed the survey participants to conduct member checking (Marshall
& Rossman, 2016).
The qualitative data explained in detail the reasons the study participants gave for their
involvement in SoTL (Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016). Further, the researcher determined that
overall, regardless of the reasons given for deciding to participate, academic instruction
librarians’ decisions to participate in SoTL are reinforced and strengthened after their
involvement in SoTL. In other words, their initial desire to participate, is, upon participation,
enhanced, and they desire increased participation. Librarian 3’s involvement in SoTL reinforced
her desire to improve and keep engaging in SoTL. Specifically, she said, “I think what kept me
interested, so much of it resonated with so much of my own experience as a learner initially, and
I was like, ‘Wow, this really makes sense! I need to keep learning more.’”
All seven participants spoke about their reasons for choosing to participate in SoTL.
Table 8 displays the codes and the number of times the interviewees mentioned the code during
the interviews. Librarian 1 stated,

95

I think the reason why [I am involved in SoTL] is because there is that perception we
talked about, that librarians aren’t teachers, and I think there is also a gap that needs to be
filled with some really good pedagogy training and because I want to improve.
Librarian 3 reiterated the idea of wanting to improve:
I just felt like there were so many ways in my experience as a learner that I thought,
“Wow, that instructor wasn’t particularly effective; I didn’t care about that class at all.
So that sort of made me really curious because if I am going to be doing this as a career,
how do I not have my students feel that way about me as an instructor? So, what things
can I learn as a future instructor to help me have a more compelling and engaging
classroom experience for students who are in that room or in that space, wherever that
space might be?

The primary reason interview participants stated for their involvement in SoTL was to
improve their own teaching. The interviewees focused on SoTL’s impact on their own teaching
over their students’ learning. All seven participants specifically mentioned their teaching as a
reason they participated in SoTL, while only two expressed an intent to focus on student

96

learning. In fact, when asked about the reason Librarian 1 participated in SoTL, she responded,
“Because I want to improve.” Librarian 2 stated,
I think I’ve always had that idea and mentality of being very self-reflective, but I think
the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning just resonates with that natural tendency I have
of trying to be reflective and learn from my experiences and try to improve in every way
personally and professionally.
Librarian 3 did connect her own improvement to student learning and later said, “Ultimately, for
me, right, it is student learning.” Librarian 3 continued her explanation for involvement in SoTL
by saying, “Because it actually makes the experience much more meaningful for the students.”
As with Librarian 3, Librarian 4 said her reason for participation in SoTL was because “it has a
demonstrable impact on student learning.”
Four participants mentioned professional interest, and two participants described SoTL as
central to their mission as librarians as the reason for their involvement in SoTL. Librarian 3
said, “I just find all of it [SoTL] particularly interesting and relevant to the work that I do.”
Other study participants echoed the centrality of SoTL to their work because they work at a
teaching-focused library. While there is some variation in the reasons academic instruction
librarians choose to participate in SoTL, there is much commonality too. The results
demonstrated academic instruction librarians want to be better teachers.
Results for Research Question 2: Impact of SoTL on Teacher Identity
Research Question 2 was “What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning on academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity?” Both the quantitative survey
results and the qualitative interviews were used to answer this research question. This question
was central to the research. Many academic librarians identify as a teacher, but many do not

97

(Julien & Genuis, 2011; Matlin & Carr, 2014; Vassilakaki & Moniarou-Papaconstantinou, 2014;
Walter, 2008). However, a teacher identity is important because it has been linked to teaching
effectiveness (Day, 2008; Day & Kington, 2008). This researcher frames SoTL as an
international community of practice, and communities of practice and SoTL have been shown to
influence higher education professors’ identities (Bennett et al., 2016; Correa et al., 2014;
Schram & Allendoerfer, 2012; Voelker & Martin, 2013). Therefore, the researcher sought to
understand SoTL’s impact on academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity.
Quantitative Results
The quantitative results were analyzed using SPSS. The researcher used a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test to analyze the difference between the participants’ scores before and after
participation in SoTL. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric alternative to the
dependent t-test (Field, 2013; Tanner, 2012). Researchers use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to
study the same population at two different times—before and after an event has occurred (Field,
2013; Tanner, 2012). When analyzing the results from the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, the
researcher reviewed the z-scores, mean ranking, statistical significance, and effect size (Field,
2013).
Effect size is used to determine the difference between two groups. Specifically, the
effect size is a number that demonstrates the size of the difference between the two groups
(Salkind, 2017). The larger the effect size, the greater the difference between groups. When the
effect size is small, there is greater similarity between the groups (Field, 2013; Salkind, 2017).
The effect size was calculated to understand the difference between SoTL’s impact on academic
instruction librarians. To determine the size of the effect, the following was used:

98


A small effect is from 0 to .3.



A moderate effect is from .3 to .5.



A large effect is above .5 (Field, 2013).

Z-scores are determined from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and display how many standard
deviations a score is from the mean (Salkind, 2017). Statistical significance, as displayed by a pvalue, tells the researcher the reliability of the finding (Field, 2013).
The quantitative results indicated that participation in SoTL does impact academic
instruction librarians’ teacher identity. Table 9 displays the mean ranking before and after
participation in SoTL. Table 9 also shows the statistical significance, the z-score, and the effect
size. To obtain these survey results, the researcher used SPSS to combine the responses of all
items related to Research Question 2. Then, using the combined data, the researcher ran
descriptive statistics to obtain the mean scores and ran a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to discover
the p-value, z-score, and effect size.

When the survey items that aligned with Research Question 2 were combined (see Table
9), the results showed that before involvement in SoTL, participants (n = 95) reported a mean
ranking of 3.42, which falls between neutral and agree. After engagement in SoTL, participants

99

also indicated a mean ranking of 4.24 which is between agree and strongly agree. The researcher
also reviewed the median scores for the survey items that aligned with Research Question 2,
because the data came from a Likert-scale. Participants reported a median ranking of 4, which
means they agreed with the survey statements. Additionally, after engagement in SoTL,
participants indicated a median ranking of 4. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which looks at the
relationship between two related samples, was used to analyze the difference between the
participants’ scores before and after participation in SoTL (Field, 2013). A positive z-score
indicates participants responded with a higher mean ranking after participating in SoTL (Salkind,
2017). In other words, the z-score tells the researcher there is positive growth in the participants’
agreement of the statements on the survey after participation in SoTL. The results for this
research question showed z = 6.378, which displays a positive increase in reporting. Thus, the
positive growth demonstrates that SoTL positively impacts librarians’ teacher identities.
As previously stated, the effect size demonstrates relative difference between groups.
The larger the effect size, the greater the differences between the groups (Salkind, 2017).
Therefore, there was a large effect (r = .654) on the reasons participants stated for their
participation in SoTL. From the p-value (p = .000) the researcher can conclude there is a
statistically significant difference in the responses for how the study participants felt before
involvement in SoTL and after involvement in SoTL. This statistical finding indicates that
engagement in SoTL impacted the teacher identity of academic instruction librarians. Owing to
these findings, the null hypothesis of if librarians engage in the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning, their identities will be the same as they were before was rejected, and the research
hypothesis was accepted. Participation in SoTL impacted academic instruction librarians’
teacher identity. In fact, engagement in SoTL significantly impacted academic instruction

100
librarians’ teacher identity (r = .654). After their participation in SoTL, librarians saw to a
greater degree themselves as a teacher than they did prior to their involvement in SoTL (z =
6.378).
For each pair of items, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test determined there was a significant
increase in participants’ teacher identity after involvement in SoTL (p < .001). This p-value for
each survey item demonstrates the extent to which engagement in SoTL impacted academic
instruction librarians’ teacher identity. While the impact of SoTL is wide-ranging, there was
always positive growth, as evidenced from the positive z-scores. For all question areas on the
survey, academic instruction librarians reported significant change; thus, involvement in SoTL
had a positive impact on academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity. Involvement in SoTL
changes how librarians see themselves. Table 10 shows a detailed view of each item that aligned
with Research Question 2.

From the individual survey items aligned with Research Question 2, results indicated a
large positive effect for all survey statements. The larger the effect size, the greater the
differences between the groups (Salkind, 2017). The positive large effect indicates that the
difference between librarians’ identities before participation in SoTL and after participation in
SoTL was substantial. The item where participants reported the largest effect was for I have a
clear vision for how to become a more effective educator (r = .685). In other words, through
participation in SoTL, study participants had the greatest change in understanding how to grow
as an educator.
Qualitative Results
For Research Question 2, the qualitative data allowed the researcher to better understand
the information gathered in the survey (Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016). In this study, results
from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a large positive effect on academic instruction
librarians’ teacher identity. This finding mostly aligned with the qualitative results. While most
interview participants indicated they had a teacher identity, two participants did not. Table 11
displays the codes and the number of times the interviewees mentioned the code during the
interviews.

Results showed that when participants’ felt empowered in their teaching, they identified as a
teacher. Librarian 4 stated that “it is empowering,” when others at her institution see her as a
leader in teaching and learning. When outside forces impact a librarians’ teaching agency,
results from the qualitative interviews suggested they are less likely to see themselves as a
teacher. Librarian 1 and Librarian 6 did not see themselves as teachers. Despite saying that
teaching, “is a large part of my job,” Librarian 1 also said, “Librarians aren’t seen as teachers at
all.” Regarding the participation in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, Librarian 1
continued by saying, “It has given me tools, but I don’t think it has changed my opinion of
myself.” Librarian 4 saw herself as a teacher but realized others in higher education might not.
When asked about her involvement in SoTL she said, it [SoTL] aids in “having others see us as
teachers. … I don’t even know how many other faculty do sometimes.”
Again, participation in SoTL is linked to librarians holding a teacher identity, but only if
the librarians feel empowered. Librarian 2 said, “The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning has
made me see my role as a teacher as more important. I think it has added validity to that role.
That this is a valuable role in the university.” Librarian 3 shared, “I think [it] has been the real
value as far as my identity and then feeling then like I had more ownership more personal
ownership of that identity.” Librarian 3 also shared, “So, I think it [SoTL] helps my identity, and
that when we meet each other—meaning me and the faculty person, right—we meet as cocollaborators. So that definitely helped with my identity. I don’t sort of feel like the person who
has been tagged as the substitute teacher.”
The interview participants all indicated they wanted to improve in their jobs and
specifically in teaching. Involvement in SoTL helped them improve, thus strengthening their
teacher identity and teacher effectiveness. Those participants who were more involved in SoTL

104

than others saw SoTL as affecting their identity to the point of adopting a leader identity.
Librarian 4 stated,
I never identified as a leader, you know, but this is my thing, so now I kind of have my
standing in the department because I am the person who does a lot of reading. I am kind
of the go-to person, so it has kind of created a niche there—a leadership role within the
department.
Overall, SoTL helped interviewees see their professional self more clearly. Librarian 2
said, “It [SoTL] just sort of validated how I see myself and how I see this work that I am doing
as important, and it has helped to have some external evidence.” She continued,
It [SoTL] has helped me see myself as an educator more fully. It has helped me to just
understand the multi-faceted role or what being an educator is—a multi-faceted role …
experience or role.
Librarian 3 supported Librarian 2’s observations. She noted, “I would say it [SoTL] has been
integral to my understanding of myself as a teacher.”
Results for Research Question 3: Impact of SoTL on Instruction
Research Question 3 was “What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning on academic instruction librarians’ instruction?” As with Research Question 2, both
the quantitative survey results and the qualitative interviews were used to answer this research
question. Teaching is an important duty for many librarians (Hall, 2013; Hall, 2017). However,
the literature indicated that librarians do not learn instructional skills during library school
(Hensley, 2015). Instead, they learn them on the job (Bewick & Corrall, 2010; Westbrock &
Fabian, 2010). Since SoTL is a professional development tool often used to improve teaching at

105

the higher education level, this researcher wanted to understand the impact of SoTL on academic
librarians’ instruction (Booth & Woollacott, 2017).
Quantitative Results
As with the previous research question, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test—which looks at the
relationship between two related samples—was used to analyze the difference between the
participants’ scores before and after participation in SoTL (Field, 2013). Table 12 displays the
mean ranking before and after participation in SoTL for academic librarians’ instructional
activities. Table 12 also displays the statistical significance (p < .000), the z-score, and the effect
size. To obtain these survey results, the researcher used SPSS to combine the responses of all
items related to Research Question 3. Then, using the combined data, the researcher ran
descriptive statistics to obtain the mean scores and ran a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to discover
the p-value, z-score, and effect size. From the p-value (p = .000), the researcher determined that
SoTL has a statistically significant impact on academic instruction librarians’ instruction. After
participating in SoTL, librarians change their instructional practices.

Given that the data came from a Likert-scale the researcher reviewed the median scores
in addition to the mean scores which were the primary data used. Before involvement in SoTL,

106

participants (n = 93) reported a mean ranking of 3.37 and a median ranking of 3.5. A mean
ranking of 3.37 means that the study participants’ range of opinions fell between neutral and in
agreement with the survey statements. After involvement in SoTL, participants reported a mean
ranking of 4.36 and a median ranking on 4.5, indicating that participants’ range of opinions fell
between agreement and strong agreement with the survey statements. The initial 3.37 mean
ranking was the lowest for the two research questions that used a Wilcoxon signed-rank. This
finding indicated that prior to participation in SoTL, academic instruction librarians did not
engage in many of the best instructional practices. Importantly, their use of instructional best
practices increased after participation in SoTL.
The effect size also demonstrated the relative difference between groups. From the data
collected for Research Question 3, there was a large effect (r = .740) from involvement in SoTL
on the instructional practices of academic instruction librarians. In other words, participation in
SoTL had a large impact on the instructional practices of academic instruction librarians (Fields,
2013).
Additionally, the positive z-score from the Wilcoxon signed-rank indicated participants
responded with a higher mean ranking after participating in SoTL (Salkind, 2017). The results
for this research question displayed a positive increase in reporting (z = 7.140). Thus, the zscore showed a significant positive growth in the participants’ agreement of the statements on the
survey after participation in SoTL. Owing to this growth, the researcher determined that SoTL
has a positive impact on the use of a variety of instructional practices.
Engagement in SoTL significantly impacted all instructional practices surveyed (p <
.001). After participating in SoTL, study participants changed their instructional practices to
reflect best practices. Table 13 displays a detailed view of each question that was aligned with

107

Research Question 3. For all survey items that aligned with Research Question 3, participants
responded with a positive large effect, as shown in the z-scores and d effect sizes. The item
where participants reported the largest effect was I read research on teaching and learning (r =
.765).

Qualitative Results
The previous two research questions focused on why librarians participate in SoTL and
the impact of SoTL on identity. Research Question 3 examined SoTL’s impact on academic
instruction librarians’ instruction. Table 14 summarizes the codes and the number of times those
codes were mentioned in during the interviews. For this research question, the researcher used
both latent and manifest coding to identify themes (Boyatzis, 1998; Saldana, 2016).

The themes of active learning strategies and an attitude of self-assessment were derived from
latent coding (Saldana, 2016). These themes both showed up multiple times. Five librarians
referred to active learning strategies, and six out of seven participants mentioned an attitude of
self-improvement. For active learning strategies, Librarian 1 stated, “So, a lot of times what we
have them do is group work. There is a lot of group work involved, even if it just a pair,” and
Librarian 7 said, “I’m trying to talk as little as possible. I’m done lecturing; it doesn’t help the
students.” Librarian 5 went so far as to say that he was willing to “walk in and listen and cocreate a class.”
For the attitude of self-improvement, Librarian 3 said, “The Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning has really helped me make more informed and intentional decisions in the classroom

109
and as a teacher.” Librarian 5 stated, “I think the biggest thing is I am constantly reflecting and
open to reflection.” Librarian 2 said,
I think it’s [SoTL has] just given me an attitude of constantly trying to improve and
assess and see what I can do differently and inform my practices from the research that is
out there saying these are the best practices, or this is what you need to consider, or have
you thought about issues of social justice in the classroom and equity of information.
Each interview participant stated they read teaching and learning literature, thus confirming the
high z-score found in the survey results. Reading teaching and learning literature was one way
participants sought to improve. Librarian 3 stated, “Doing more reading about how students
learn. … Once I did more of that reading, then it was like, ‘Oh! This is what this theory looks
like in the classroom.’”
The researcher determined the themes of assessment and technology from manifest
coding because questions about those topics were added to the interview protocol after the
survey and they were therefore, directly evident in the data (Boyatzis, 1998; Weisburg, Krosnick,
& Bowen, 1996). Specifically, the researcher desired to learn more about those topics after the
survey indicated there was something that needed further review. Therefore, all seven
participants mentioned both assessment and technology in their responses. Overall, though,
while participants saw benefit to assessment, they were not conducting it the way they wanted.
Some wanted to do more with it and did not feel that SoTL had impacted their assessment. For
example, Librarian 2 said her use of assessment data “is pretty limited honestly.” She continued,
“But I think … the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning—even if I haven’t done it—has helped
me think about assessment in libraries in a different way or assessment of my teaching in a
different way.”

110

All interviewees shared that they are hesitant to use a lot of technology. Instead, they use
technology when it makes sense for learning. Librarian 2 said, “I think I have just become more
intentional about technology and a little more skeptical, I think.” Similarly, Librarian 3 said, “I
think I am much more mindful about the role of technology in the classroom.” Librarian 7
summed up the common response by saying,
I’d say my use of technology has not changed because my attitude has been and always
will be that technology should never be central. What needs to be central is, “What is
your learning objective, what do you want the students to be able to do?” If technology
will serve a purpose, fine, but that is the last thing you think about.
Overall, instructional practices changed through engagement in the Scholarship of
Teaching and Learning. The findings for Research Question 3 reinforced the rejection of the null
hypothesis, which was if librarians engage in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, their
identities would be the same as they were before. After engaging in SoTL, librarians conduct
their teaching differently.
Conclusion
Chapter IV presented the quantitative and qualitative results on academic instruction
librarians’ participation in SoTL and on how SoTL impacted identity and instructional practices.
The explanatory sequential mixed methods design allowed the researcher to present broad
numeric findings and more specific qualitative findings. The qualitative data helped explain the
quantitative data. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Cohen’s d effect size revealed that
involvement in SoTL had a significant impact on both the identity of academic instruction
librarians and their instruction. Results from the semi-structured interviews showed a more
complex picture of both SoTL’s impact on teacher identity and on instructional practices.

111
Overall, SoTL positively impacted study participants’ development of a teacher identity, but at
times the local community in which interview participants worked overrode that impact, causing
some interviewees to not see themselves as teachers. Additionally, interview findings showed
that participation in SoTL influenced the pedagogy used by librarians, but instead of influencing
specific instructional practices, involvement in SoTL had a greater impact on the participants’
attitude toward pedagogical self-improvement.
Further explanation of the results is found in Chapter V, which expands on the data
presented in Chapter IV. In Chapter V, the researcher discusses what the findings mean.
Implications for professional practice and recommendations for future research are also included.
Other Quantitative Findings
The researcher gathered data on seven survey items unrelated to the three research
questions. The findings proved interesting, and the results are reported below (see Table 15 and
Table 16). For each pair of items, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine if there
was a significant impact from participating in SoTL (p < .05) (Fields, 2013). From the change in
the responses to individual survey items, a clearer picture of how participation in SoTL impacts
participants comes into view.
Teaching and Learning Findings. Engagement in SoTL had the greatest effect on
participants’ interest in teaching and learning issues and questions (r = .642). Table 15 shows
that the participant responses to two items presented a large effect size while the responses to the
other four demonstrated moderate effects. These findings indicated there was at least a moderatesized difference between librarians before they participated in SoTL and the same group of
librarians after they participated in SoTL. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed the p-value for
each set of items remained in the statistically significant range at p = .000 (Fields, 2013). This p-

112

value (p = .000) indicated a statistically significant difference in the responses that measured the
study participants’ interests and desires before involvement in SoTL and after involvement in
SoTL.
Survey responses for the items indicating academic instruction librarians’ desire to
become more effective educators and to improve student learning had a mean score above 4.5
before and after participation in SoTL. This finding indicated that even before engagement in
SoTL, many participants strongly agreed with the statements I desire to become a more effective
educator and I desire to improve my students’ learning. The reasons librarians choose to initially
engage in SoTL is tied to this finding. A detailed view of responses is shown in Table 15.

4.5 was for the survey item I enjoy research. Instead, as shown in Table 16, the mean for that

moderate effect on the study population’s enjoyment of research. Despite a moderate effect, the
z-score was positive, which indicated a positive growth in the participants’ enjoyment with
research after participation in SoTL. Also, the probability statistic remained in the statistically
significant range p = .001 (Fields, 2013). This p-value (p = .001) indicated a statistically
significant difference in the responses that measured the study participants’ interest in research
before involvement in SoTL and after involvement in SoTL.

Chapter V
Discussion

Introduction
For the past 100 years, academic librarians have struggled to determine a clear
professional identity (Freedman, 2014). With the dawning of the Information Age, the roles and
responsibilities of librarians have changed (Drabinski, 2016; Ellis et al., 2014; Goetsch, 2008;
Jaguszewski & Williams, 2013; Karasmanis & Murphy, 2014). Currently, teaching is an
important part of librarians’ jobs (Hall, 2017; Matlin & Carr, 2014). However, despite the
significance of teaching responsibilities, many librarians are ill-prepared and surprised by the
role (Austin & Bhandol, 2013; Hagman, 2015; Julien & Genuis, 2011; Julien & Pecoskie, 2009;
Wheeler & McKinney, 2015). Given the lack of preparation in pedagogy and instructional
practices, many academic librarians do not identify as teachers (Freedman, 2014; Houtman,
2010).
The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) is an international movement to
review teaching and learning and make the findings public in order to improve student learning
(Pope-Ruark, 2012; Shulman, 2006). Engagement in SoTL has been shown to have an impact on
professional identity (Mårtensson, Roxå, & Olsson, 2011; McLean, 2009; Roxå et al., 2007).
Participation in SoTL is an opportunity for librarians to study their teaching, and through an
increased understanding of their teaching, build confidence in their role as a teacher (Elton,
2009). The reason that developing a teacher identity is important for librarians is because the
possession of a teacher identity has been shown to relate to the effectiveness of instruction. In
other words, the more an instructor identifies as a teacher, the more effective their teaching (Day,
2008; Day & Kington, 2008; Houtman, 2010; Mansfield et al., 2014; Walter, 2005).

115

Understanding how SoTL impacts academic instruction librarians is useful for the
communities of higher education, academic librarianship, SoTL, and educational development.
Academic instruction librarians, similar to higher education faculty, often do not receive training
in pedagogy and instruction (Bok, 2013; Davies-Hoffman et al., 2013; Hensley, 2015; Houtman,
2010; Leibowitz, 2015; Oleson & Hora, 2014; Saunders, 2015; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010).
Instead, academicians—both librarians and faculty—frequently learn how to teach on the job
(Bewick & Corrall, 2010; Murphy & Jensen, 2016; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). While SoTL is
practiced by some graduate students, it is more often an area of study academics engage with
once they are working in the higher education field (Auten & Twigg, 2015; Ellis, Crumrine, &
Scudder, 2010; Fanghanel et al., 2016). Despite research on higher education’s faculty
involvement in SoTL, prior to this study only opinion pieces had been written on academic
instruction librarians’ participation in SoTL (August & Dewar, 2010; Bradley, 2009; MacMillan,
2015; Miller-Young et al., 2016; Otto, 2014; Perini, 2014).
In this study, the researcher sought to understand academic instruction librarians’
involvement in SoTL and the impact of that involvement on identity and instruction. The
research questions for this study were:
1. What reasons do academic instruction librarians state for their participation in the
Scholarship of Teaching and Learning?
2. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ teacher identity?
3. What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning on academic instruction
librarians’ instruction?

116

As previously stated, a teacher identity is not held by all academic instruction librarians despite
teaching being part of their job responsibilities (Hall, 2017; Wheeler & McKinney, 2015).
However, teacher identity is important because research has linked it to the effectiveness of the
instructor (Day, 2008; Day, Stobart, Sammons et al., 2006; Sammons et al., 2007). One of the
purposes of SoTL it to determine the effectiveness of instructional techniques (O’Brien, 2008).
In addition, authors have linked SoTL and identity (Bennett et al., 2016; Geertsema, 2016). The
researcher sought to understand SoTL’s impact on academic instruction librarians’ teacher
identities, as well as SoTL’s impact on instruction, because of the connection between SoTL and
professional identity and because the purpose of SoTL is to determine the efficacy of specific
pedagogical practices. Therefore, the researcher studied how involvement in SoTL impacted
academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity and instruction.
In this chapter, the researcher discusses the results presented in Chapter IV. The
discussion of the results is framed by the perspective of the communities of practice theoretical
framework (Wenger, 1998). The chapter also includes implications of the research findings for
professional practice and recommendations for future research.
Summary of the Results
The number of academic instruction librarians who participate in SoTL is unknown.
From this research, it can be concluded that at least 1% of the 6,119 academic instruction
librarians have some level of involvement in SoTL (M. J. Petrowski, personal communication,
October 5, 2016). The researcher did conclude that of those academic instruction librarians who
participated in the study, involvement in SoTL positively impacted both their identity and their
instruction. Research findings also indicated that the primary reason academic instruction

117

librarians choose to participate in SoTL is because they want to improve their teaching. Study
participants saw teaching as central to their professional mission.
As a result of participation in community shaping identity (Wenger, 1998), academic
instruction librarians see engagement in SoTL as involvement in a community that values
teaching and learning (Wenger, 1998). When the interview participants were asked about their
interactions with others who also participate in SoTL, they described the interactions as
beneficial, encouraging, and supportive. One participant said, “It has been mostly very
community-based sharing of ideas,” while another said, “It has been really rewarding because it
has allowed me to engage in that kind of conversation beyond just the librarian circles.”
Nonetheless, despite discussion of community and interactions with peers on the topic of
teaching and learning, most interview participants focused on projects they had completed.
Projects included leading a faculty learning community, committee work, and faculty
development events they attended. Participants could easily describe specific examples of
engagement with colleagues on teaching and learning, including hallway conversations. What
study participants rarely did was connect activities or conversations with how those projects or
events specifically affected them. Nevertheless, quantitative results from the survey showed an
impact from SoTL. Librarians recognized their role in teaching and learning but still did not feel
completely part of the broad teaching and learning field, nor did they always see themselves as
teachers. In other words, librarians did not always see themselves as full members in the SoTL
community. Wenger, (1998) in the Communities of Practice theory, wrote that identity is
negotiated in community. If the academic librarians involved in this study did not see
themselves as fully part of the SoTL community, then their reticence to adopt a teacher identity
is supported by the theoretical framework.

118

While study results demonstrated that SoTL had a positive strong effect on academic
instruction librarians’ identity and instruction, the reasons for the impact appeared to be
connected to how they viewed themselves prior to SoTL involvement. Participants who already
viewed themselves as teachers were more likely to be affected. Participants who did not see
themselves as a teacher prior to involvement in SoTL primarily focused on tangible projects
rather than personal effect. Given this, the researcher believes the implications of these results
are particularly important to Library and Information Science (LIS) graduate schools, academic
library administrations, and professional development organizations. These organizations and
professional bodies need to support academic instruction librarians as teachers for the full
positive effect of involvement in SoTL to occur.
Methodology
The researcher conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study to answer the
research questions. Prior to this study, research had not been conducted on academic instruction
librarians’ involvement in SoTL. An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach allowed
the author to gather baseline information about academic instruction librarians’ involvement in
SoTL. The quantitative data were then explained by qualitative interviews.
Of the academic instruction librarians working in the United States, approximately 23%,
or 6,119, of them had primary responsibilities that included instruction (M. J. Petrowski,
personal communication, October 5, 2016). Study participants for the quantitative portion of the
study were from a volunteer convenience sampling of librarians (n=95) on the Association of
College and Research Libraries Information Literacy (ACRL) listserv (Teddlie & Yu, 2007). At
the time of the research, there were 6,163 subscribers to the ACRL Information Literacy listserv (M.
Heuer, personal communication, 2017). The number of subscribers to the ACRL Information

119

Literacy listserv corresponded closely to the number of academic instruction librarians whose
primary job responsibilities included instruction.
Survey participants indicated their willingness to participate in a follow-up interview by
checking a box on the survey and providing their contact information. For the qualitative portion
of the study, the researcher used a purposeful sample of seven librarians (n = 7) who participated
in the survey (Teddlie & Yu, 2007).
The researcher used a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to analyze the responses on the pre-and
post- reflective items on the survey (Field, 2013; Tanner, 2012). Mean scores, statistical
significance (p-value), effect size represented by Cohen’s d, and z-scores were reported (Field,
2013; Salkind, 2017; Tanner, 2012). For this study, a p-value of less than .05 was considered
significant (Field, 2013). The interviews were coded for themes (Marshall & Rossman, 2016).
Summary of Results and Discussion for Research Question 1
Research Question 1 was “What reasons do academic librarians state for their
participation in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning?” As studies have shown, engaging in
SoTL is a way for academic instruction librarians to become more effective educators and to
improve their students’ learning (Boyer, 1990; Hutchings, 2010; Shulman, 2006). The survey
results identified academic instruction librarians who were involved in SoTL. From the
participant pool, numerous interviewees said they participated in SoTL because teaching was a
professional interest and because they saw teaching as central to their mission as librarians.
Academic instruction librarians participated in SoTL for a variety of reasons. The
primary reason as determined by the qualitative data, was that the participants felt participation
in SoTL improved their own teaching. This reason aligned with one of the purposes of SoTL—
study teaching to improve student learning (Shulman, 2006). However, the majority of

120

participants did not state that the reason they wanted to improve their teaching was to improve
student learning. Instead, many participants stopped at the importance of improving their own
teaching. Viewed through the lens of Communities of Practice, this finding is not necessarily
surprising (Wenger, 1998). Individuals engaged in a community of practice adopt customs of the
group (Wenger, 1998). In the SoTL community, members publicly share their teaching practices
and research on teaching and student learning (Shulman, 1998). However, since each class is
comprised of unique individuals, and the participant pools are often small, SoTL study results
may vary. Owing to small sample sizes and unique student populations, many SoTL studies are
not generalizable (Miller-Young & Yeo, 2015). When the results of publicly shared teaching
strategies and the subsequent outcomes of those pedagogical practices are not generalizable,
placing the focus on the improvement of teaching instead of on the improvement of student
learning may help participants more quickly feel part of the community. Therefore, the focus of
study participants on the improvement of teaching over student learning may be a product of the
SoTL field. Additional SoTL studies are needed to determine how teaching practices impact a
different group of students.
Furthermore, all teachers have more control over their own teaching than control over
student learning. Their goal for teaching is to help students learn, but ultimately, they cannot
control student learning. Therefore, it is likely easier to focus on one’s own teaching than it is to
focus on student learning. The focus of the study participants on their interests and their
teaching led this researcher to hypothesize that those involved in SoTL might choose to
participate for themselves and only indirectly for potential outcomes for their students.
While four out of the seven interview participants had conducted SoTL studies, other
participants spoke strongly about barriers to conducting research. Instead, participation in SoTL

121

has more of an impact on attitudes and behaviors with a lower barrier to entry, such as the
enjoyment of teaching, the desire to improve teaching and student learning, and the enjoyment of
understanding student learning, rather than on research.
Summary of Results and Discussion for Research Question 2
Research Question 2 was “What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning on academic librarians’ teacher identity?” From the survey results, the null hypothesis
of if librarians engage in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning their identities will be the
same as they were before was rejected, and the research hypothesis was accepted. Participation
in SoTL had an impact on academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity. Results from the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrated the significant impact of SoTL on the participants’
teacher identity. After involvement in SoTL, survey participants agreed more strongly with
survey items that were aligned with Research Question 2.
The quantitative findings were confirmed and explained by the qualitative data. From the
interviews, the researcher heard participants speak about the importance of gaining knowledge
and expertise in teaching and learning because they did not always have a grounding in
educational techniques prior to becoming an academic librarian. Even librarians with a
background in pedagogy found involvement in SoTL beneficial in helping them see themselves
as a teacher in the higher education context.
Multiple interview participants spoke of their involvement with the Centers for Teaching
and Learning or equivalent department. Engaging in the community created by the centers
affected the identities of the librarians who participated in this study. Study participants’
involvement with teaching centers helped expand their instruction skills and made them feel part
of the broad teaching and learning community at their institutions. As Wenger (1998) wrote,

122
“developing a practice requires the formation of a community whose members engage with one
another and thus acknowledge each other as participants” (p. 149). For librarians to feel
completely part of the higher education teaching and learning profession, they also need to feel
part of a local community that views them as teachers.
Being an outsider, or at a minimum, feeling on the outside, negatively impacts librarians’
teacher identity. Thus, despite SoTL impacting teacher identities, not all participants saw
themselves as teachers. In fact, two interviewees specifically said they did not see themselves as
teachers. This finding supported previous research studies that found that librarians who serve in
the role of instructor do not necessarily view themselves as an educator (Freedman, 2014;
Houtman, 2010). In this study, participants indicated their view of themselves as an educator
was influenced by the situation in which they conducted their teaching. One participant felt that
because they did not teach full semester courses, they were not a teacher. She often questioned if
she was wanted at teaching center events because of her role as a librarian. A second participant
believed that they were a professor and not a teacher. Librarian 6 described a teacher as
someone who thinks about pedagogy and teaches children. The explanations for why these two
interviewees did not see themselves as teachers is understood through the communities of
practice theoretical framework. Wenger (1998) wrote that it was “a mistaken dichotomy to
wonder whether the unit of analysis of identity should be the community or the person” (p. 146).
Communities in which librarians find themselves affect their views of themselves, and
community and individual identity are intertwined. It is difficult to tell where the individual
identity ends and the community identity begins (Wenger, 1998), and since Librarian 1 and
Librarian 6 did not believe they had colleagues who consistently viewed them as teachers, their
own perceptions of themselves as teachers were compromised.

123

Not everyone defines the term teacher the same. Polger and Okamoto (2010) found that
students viewed librarians differently and had different definitions of teacher—some definitions
were narrow while others were broad. In this study, academic instruction librarians who did not
see themselves as teachers were also influenced by the definitional box they created around the
word teacher. For Librarian 1, a teacher was someone who taught a for-credit course. For
Librarian 6, a teacher was someone who thought about pedagogy over content. Even though
both interviewees spent time reading teaching and learning literature, attending conferences and
workshops about teaching, and stated they were involved in SoTL, they did not see themselves
as teachers because the teaching they conducted did not fit their pre-conceived ideas of a
teacher. This result might be surprising, but when considering the results through the lens of the
theoretical framework, it is not. Identity parallels practice (Wenger, 1998). When the practices
of librarians do not fit the community’s common definition of a teacher then their identity is
impacted. Similarly, identity is both local and global (Wenger, 1998). The global definition of
teacher clearly influenced Librarian 6, while Librarian 1 was heavily influenced by the local
understanding of teacher. However, identities are not one-dimensional, and as seen in the other
five librarians, a teacher identity is complex and a lived experience (Wenger, 1998). All
librarians had identities that spanned multiple communities of practice.
It is important to note that possessing a faculty contract is not enough evidence for
librarians to consider themselves teachers. Librarian 1 and Librarian 6 were both considered
faculty at their respective institutions but did not view themselves as teachers. On the other
hand, Librarian 3 and Librarian 7 held the position of academic staff at their institutions, but
they did consider themselves teachers. This finding indicates that how others in the community
view librarians or how an individual views the global definition of teacher has a greater impact

124

on teacher identity than does the institution’s categorization of librarians. Furthermore, the lack
of clarity concerning the role of a librarian is underscored by this finding (Freedman, 2014).
The methods academic librarians use for instruction on information literacy varies.
Various methods include a one-shot instruction session, for-credit courses, embedded
information literacy, and interactions at the reference desk (Davis, 2007; Davis et al., 2011; Roy
& Hensley, 2016; Zai, 2014). Librarian 1 mentioned that she did not see herself as a teacher
because she was not with the students for a full semester. Instead, she only saw them once or
twice. This finding corresponds to the results found by Davis et al. (2011): When librarians
taught for-credit courses that follow the schedule of other classes taught at the institution, they
were more likely to see themselves as a teacher.
These results point to the reality of how one’s situation affects one’s view of him or
herself. Wenger (1998) wrote that identity is influenced by community membership. The results
from this study support that hypothesis of the communities of practice theoretical framework
because even though all participants had teaching responsibilities, not all of them felt part of a
community of higher education teachers (Wenger, 1998). Instead, they saw themselves as part
of a different community or on the periphery of real teachers. In other words, participants who
did not see themselves as teachers had not moved to full participation in the SoTL community
and thus were not full members (Lave & Wenger, 1991).
Summary of Results and Discussion for Research Question 3
Research Question 3 was “What is the impact of the Scholarship of Teaching and
Learning on academic instruction librarians’ instruction?” Of the three research questions,
survey results indicated that SoTL had the largest positive effect on instruction. Additionally, for
each individual survey question that aligned with Research Question 3, the effect size was large.

125

Participation in SoTL had a positive impact on instruction. This finding aligns with previous
descriptions and research on SoTL (Cambridge, 2001; Fanghanel, 2013; Fanghanel et al., 2016;
Geertsema, 2016; Roxå et al., 2008). The mean ranking of 3.37 (between neutral and agree)
before participation in SoTL was not a surprise, since many academic instruction librarians learn
instruction skills on the job and not during graduate school (Bewick & Corrall, 2010; Hensley,
2015; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). After participation in SoTL, the mean ranking on the survey
was 4.36.
Interview data supported the survey findings since many participants spoke about how
they had changed instructional methods as they learned more about teaching. However, despite
changes to teaching—primarily in regard to the use of active learning strategies—interview
participants spoke more about a change in their attitude. This attitudinal change was coded by
the researcher as an attitude of self-improvement. Librarian 2 specifically stated, “I think it’s
[involvement in SoTL] just given me an attitude of constantly trying to improve.” Librarian 5
spoke about the importance of reflection for his professional growth and how SoTL supported
reflection. In summary, as indicated by interview participants, involvement in SoTL can lead to
alterations in the attitude of academic instruction librarians toward continuing to develop their
teaching strategies.
Booth and Woollacott (2017) wrote that SoTL is a professional development tool often
used to improve teaching at the post-secondary level. Based on this view of SoTL, the
researcher expected interview participants to speak about specific pedagogical changes. The
researcher did not expect the qualitative study findings to emphasize attitudinal changes over
adjustments to instructional practices. It could be assumed that academic instruction librarians
might be involved in SoTL because they were already interested in improving, which was

126

supported by the results for Research Question 1. Nevertheless, even if librarians participated in
SoTL because they wanted to improve their teaching, qualitative findings showed that their
attitude toward instructional self-improvement still improved from involvement in SoTL.
Engagement in a community of practice gives people power to work through “an identity of
competence” (Wenger, 1998, p. 175). The researcher concluded that from participation in SoTL
academic instruction, librarians grew in their teacher identity, which in turn affected their
attitude toward learning about instructional strategies and pedagogy. Consequently, belonging to
a community of teachers impacted librarians’ attitude toward their current teaching and their
willingness to continue to learn.
Quantitative results demonstrated that technology use was not as affected by SoTL as
other areas of pedagogical methods. This finding was confirmed from the interview results.
When asked about technology, interview participants spoke about the importance of student
learning and how they felt technology often got in the way of the focus of the class. However,
interviewees were all willing to use technology in class when they felt that it aligned with their
learning outcomes. While SoTL did not change the interview participants’ opinions of
technology, it did reinforce for them the importance of alignment with activities and class
objectives.
The findings for Research Question 3 further supported the rejection of the null
hypothesis that aligned with Research Question 2: if librarians engage in the Scholarship of
Teaching and Learning, their identities would be the same as they were before. An attitude of
self-improvement in pedagogical practices signifies a growth in teacher identity. Day and
Kington (2008) found that a teacher’s effectiveness and his or her identity as a teacher are linked.
Furthermore, a teacher’s effectiveness is related to his or her resilience (Day, 2008; Day &

127

Kington, 2008; Day, Stobart et al., 2006; Sammons et al., 2007). Findings from this study
illustrate that as librarians participate in SoTL, their attitudes toward instructional growth
change, thus underscoring their identity as teachers. Librarian 2 specifically stated that because
of involvement in SoTL, she has “an attitude of constant improvement and constant openness to
improve and to change and to be an educator so my students can learn more effectively.”
Furthermore, she said that participating in SoTL helped her realize that she is “not the only one
[who] still struggles with instructional issues.” Librarian 2 sees herself as part of the teaching
and learning community and knows she is not alone. Being part of the higher education
community impacts her identity and supports her continued goals for improvement (Wenger,
1998).
Conclusion
SoTL is the study of teaching and learning and then making the results “public so that
others can critique it, build on it, and contribute to the wider teaching commons” (Shulman,
2006, p. ix). Academic instruction librarians choose to participate in SoTL for a variety of
reasons. As shown in the study results, academic instruction librarians who were part of this
study want to improve, they care about their students’ learning, and they feel teaching is central
to their job. Librarians engaged in SoTL choose to participate in a community of practice where
the focus is the topic of teaching and learning (Wenger, 1998). As Wenger (1998) wrote,
“Communities of practice are about content—about learning as a living experience of negotiating
meaning—not about form” (p. 229). Academic instruction librarians who participate in SoTL
are participating in a professional community with other academics who are also interested in
teaching and learning. Participants learn together and negotiate their teacher identities as a group
(Wenger, 1998).

128

Indeed, study results indicated that SoTL communities impact academic instruction
librarians who choose to participate in them. Engagement in SoTL positively influences how
academic instruction librarians professionally identify, and participation in SoTL also impacts
their instruction. However, when librarians do not feel that they fully belong to the community,
they do not necessarily adopt the same identity as others in the group—they may not see
themselves as teachers. A sense of belonging to the community is necessary for a sustained
teacher identity.
Feelings of belonging to the teaching and learning community do not have as great of an
impact on instruction as they do on an academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity. Results
from this study showed that involvement in SoTL had the largest impact on academic instruction
librarians’ instruction. For example, participation in SoTL had a large positive impact on
academic instruction librarians’ pedagogical practices—primarily in their attitude toward selfimprovement. When academic librarians engaged in SoTL, they were more likely to feel
comfortable admitting there is room for improvement and then would seek out ways to strive for
growth. Additionally, as indicated in the qualitative research findings, academic librarians who
participate in SoTL incorporated more active learning strategies into their teaching.
Overall, participation in SoTL impacted academic instruction librarians’ teacher identity
and instructional practices. Through the practices of reading literature, attending conferences,
using learned teaching strategies, conducting and sharing research, and implementing research
discoveries, librarians involved in SoTL were changed. Connection to the SoTL community—
whether that community was local to their institution of higher education or global, as
distinguished by the international teaching and learning community—significantly impacted
academic instruction librarians in this study (Shulman, 2006; Trigwell, 2013). Moreover, when

129

academic instruction librarians felt they were full members of the SoTL community, the impact
to their teacher identity and instruction was even greater.
Recommendations for Further Research
Teaching information literacy is an important part of academic librarians’ jobs (Julien &
Genuis, 2011; Vassilakaki & Moniarou-Papaconstantinou, 2014). The teaching methods
employed by librarians to instruct on information literacy varies (Davis, 2007; Davis et al., 2011;
Roy & Hensley, 2016; Zai, 2014). While this study confirmed previous results, that academic
librarians who teach credit-bearing courses are more likely to see themselves as teachers, the
researcher recommends additional research be conducted on this aspect of the study (Davis et al.,
2011). There is room in the literature for an examination of why the type of teaching method
affects teacher identity. There is also room in the literature for additional analysis with a larger
sample. A larger sample will help the librarian community understand how various information
literacy instruction methods impact teacher identity.
The researcher recommends further research using a larger sample size. The survey in
this study captured a little over 1% of academic instruction librarians. Specifically, additional
research should be conducted to determine how many academic instruction librarians participate
in SoTL because it is still unclear how many academic librarians participate in SoTL.
Additionally, further research is needed to understand participation in SoTL among librarians at
different types of post-secondary institutions with different years of experience and different
employment statuses.
Moreover, the researcher recommends additional research on the different types of
involvement in SoTL. For this study, the researcher included the following as involvement in
SoTL:

130


Reading teaching and learning literature.



Attending teaching and learning conferences.



Using the teaching and learning literature in your teaching.



Conducting teaching and learning research.



Presenting and/or publishing teaching and learning research.



Implementing the techniques and methods supported by your own teaching and learning
research in the classroom.

The majority of participants read the literature, attended conferences, and used the literature in
their teaching. However, many of them did not conduct their own research. A few study
participants gave some insight into why they did not conduct their own research. Librarian 1
indicated that her personal life kept her from having time to dedicate to research studies.
Librarian 7 worked part-time for many years and only recently accepted full-time work. When
she was working part-time, she indicated she did not have time or support within the institutional
structure to conduct research. Understanding why librarians choose or do not choose to research
their teaching might shed light on needed areas for additional education during library school or
for professional development once librarians are working either part-time or full-time.
Another recommendation for future research is to delve more deeply into the reasons
academic instruction librarians state for their involvement in SoTL as well as involvement in
other types of professional development. Results from this study pointed to the possibility that
some participants might say they participate in SoTL to improve their own teaching instead of
being involved in SoTL to improve student learning, because they see teaching as the end versus
learning as the end. For some, the goal of professional development might be to professionally
grow themselves. For others, the reason to participate in professional development could be

131

because they see learning as the end goal of teaching. How a person sees the ultimate purpose,
or end goal, of the teaching and learning process might have an impact on the reason he or she
participates in SoTL.
As shown in previous studies, teacher identity is linked to teacher effectiveness (Day &
Kington, 2008; Sammons et al., 2007). Further research should be conducted on the growth of
academic instruction librarians’ teacher identities and on how the development of a teacher
identity does or does not impact the quality of instruction. Additional research can be extended
to include how the development of a teacher identity in academic librarians influences student
learning.
The communities of practice theoretical framework includes the premise that humans are
social creatures, and socializing is a central part of learning. Additionally, learning impacts
identity (Wenger, 1998). While connecting how humans are social beings with learning and
identity, Wenger (1998) wrote about how participation in a community of practice affects
identity. Research findings supported that element of the theoretical framework. Given that, the
researcher also recommends additional studies be conducted on how local communities affect
academic librarians. Roxå et al. (2008) found that workplace culture and context shapes the
identities of academicians, and research findings from the interviews indicated that faculty and
staff at the research participants’ institutions had a greater influence on how participants saw
themselves than their institution classification. Study participants who held staff positions saw
themselves as teachers, while other interview participants who were classified as faculty did not
view themselves as teachers. Interview responses pointed to the influence of the local
community on identity, which interview participants identified as including faculty members
whose primary responsibility was teaching. As Julien and Pecoskie (2009) found, teaching

132

faculty hold power over librarians. Therefore, the researcher recommends additional research to
further investigate how power differentials impact the local teaching and learning community
and how the power dynamic in the local community affects academic librarians’ teacher identity.
As previous research has shown, local events impact how a person views himself or herself
(Hsieh, 2010).
Identities are complex and consist of multiple parts, including “self-image, self-esteem,
job-motivation, task perception, and future perspective” (Kelchtermans, 1993, p. 444). Findings
from this research were that participants who identified as teachers also possessed the identity of
librarian. This dual self-image may cause professional stress (Colbeck, 2008; Vassilakaki &
Moniarou-Papaconstantinou, 2014). Again, further research on how local communities,
including library administration, can help academic instruction librarians adopt the identity of a
teacher while maintaining a congruent view of themselves will be beneficial for those working in
higher education. Librarians are not the only group within higher education who struggle with
their identities. Educational developers also struggle with possessing multiple identities (Bennet
et al., 2016). Additional research on how to help academicians reconcile various and possibly
conflicting identities may be useful for aiding those employed in the higher education field to
find professional balance and a better understanding of how they fit within the broad postsecondary community.
In addition to local communities of practice affecting identity, global communities impact
it as well (Wenger, 1998). Specifically, “an identity is neither narrowly local to activities nor
abstractly global. Like practice, it is an interplay of both” (Wenger,1998, p. 163). Given that
identities are comprised of local and global activities, the researcher recommends further
research focusing on academic instruction librarians’ global participation in communities of

133

practice. For example, this researcher suggests studying how continued learning impacts
academic instruction librarians’ identity as a member in the broad teaching and learning
community. A second recommendation for future study focuses on researching the global
identities of academic instruction librarians. This researcher recommends additional research on
generational views of teacher identity in librarianship. As depicted in early literature, the
primary role of librarians was to house, preserve, and make the written word available
(Drabinski, 2016), yet as information has changed, the role of librarians has also changed (Ellis
et al., 2014; Goetsch, 2008; Jaguszewski & Williams, 2013; Karasmanis & Murphy, 2014).
Specifically, the past few decades have led to change in the teaching responsibilities of librarians
(Walter, 2005a; Warner & Seamans, 2004). Since much of this change has been relatively
recent, the researcher recommends studying the growth of teacher identities in veteran librarians.
To understand generational differences, the researcher also recommends studying new academic
instruction librarians’ teacher identities. Moreover, this researcher recommends surveying
higher education faculty in various disciplines to see how many consider themselves teachers.
Since many academic librarians learn instruction skills on the job, this researcher also
recommends additional research on professional development opportunities for librarians
(Brecher & Klipfel, 2014; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). SoTL is one type of professional
development, but there are other types of academic development in which librarians can, and do,
elect to participate (Buck, 2014; Fanghanel, 2013; Francis & Wingrove, 2017; Geertsema, 2016;
Mitchell & Mitchell, 2015). Participants in both the quantitative and qualitative portions of this
study indicated that they engaged in a range of professional development opportunities.
Therefore, delving more deeply into what types of professional development librarians

134

participate in and studying how those opportunities impact their teaching and instruction will
help the library community and academic developers in their efforts to support educators.
Communities of practice are widely used in higher education and particularly in the
academic library field (August & Dewar, 2010; Belzowski et al., 2013; Richlin & Cox, 2004).
Overall, the researcher recommends broad research on how librarians’ professional communities
impact their involvement in SoTL. All interviewees indicated the community of professionals—
other librarians and higher education faculty—affected them. How they were affected, though,
varied. Mapping the communities of practice in which librarians find themselves would likely
allow for greater understanding of how librarians are situated within the library profession, the
higher education profession, and the SoTL community.
In addition to further research on librarians’ teacher identity, this researcher recommends
further study on how librarians’ instructional practices are impacted by their involvement in
various communities of practice and professional development. In this study, the findings
indicated SoTL primarily impacted librarians’ attitudes toward self-improvement and their use of
active learning strategies. Interview participants rarely spoke about specific pedagogical changes
they made due to their involvement in SoTL. It would be useful for the academic library
community and the academic development community to have a better understanding of how
different types of professional development influence instruction librarians’ pedagogies.
Likewise, it would be useful to know if any professional development changes the pedagogical
practices of academic librarians, and if so, why instructional practices change after participation
in some professional development but not in SoTL.
Discovering that involvement in SoTL affected academic instruction librarians’ attitudes
toward instructional improvement more so than impacting specific pedagogical practices was

135

surprising to the researcher. Given this anomaly, the researcher recommends additional research
on SoTL’s impact on attitudes. It would be interesting to know if the SoTL community, through
the studying the teaching and learning, allows instructors to feel more comfortable
acknowledging room for improvement. Further research is also needed on how changes in
teachers’ attitudes toward professional growth impacts their instruction. Moreover, the
researcher recommends future studies on how participation in SoTL impacts academic
instruction librarians’ engagement in self-reflection. Conducting and acting on assessment
results is already an important part of many librarians’ jobs (Greer et al., 2015; Oakleaf, 2011).
The use of assessment data often requires a reflective component (Kissel et al., 2016; Oakleaf,
2011). Understanding the interplay between self-reflection, assessment, and the development of
an attitude of self-improvement might help educational developers, the SoTL community, and
the academic library community create professional development programs that support
academic librarians’ professional advancement.
Study results from this research indicated the mean score of 3.44 before participation in
SoTL and the mean score of 4.19 after participation in SoTL for the survey topic I use new
technologies to engage my students. This finding was unique because it had a smaller effect size
(r=.612) than some of the other survey items. The qualitative data clarified and explained the
quantitative findings which led to a slightly different understanding of the conclusion. All seven
interview participants indicated they were hesitant to use technology because they often felt it
did not add to the lesson. Instead, they often saw it as a distraction from the core topics being
taught. Due to these findings, this researcher has two recommendations for future studies. First,
the academic library community and LIS graduate programs would benefit from supplementary
research on why librarians use technology in their lessons prior to participation in SoTL.

136

Understanding why librarians use technology may help foster similar strategies for the support of
other instructional practices. Specifically, it would be interesting, and possibly useful, to know
why academic librarians choose to use technology in their teaching when they are not wellversed in the teaching and learning literature. Second, the academic library community, the
SoTL community, and the educational technology community may benefit from additional
research on why academic instruction librarians feel technology is a hindrance in the classroom.
Understanding why academic librarians are hesitant to use technology may point to professional
development needs, or it may show that librarians are cognizant of their students as learners.
Implications for Professional Practice
Results from this study found that most participants participated in SoTL by reading the
literature, attending conferences, and using the literature in their teaching. Few of the
participants conducted their own research. While study participants primarily indicated that the
reason they did not conduct primary research was due to a lack of time, still, given this finding,
LIS graduate programs and professional development organizations may want to spend
additional time instructing on research methods, and specifically SoTL research methods. In a
recent study, Kennedy and Brancolini (2018) found that only 17% of participants believed their
LIS master’s degree program prepared them to conduct research. If academic instruction
librarians develop an increased comfort level with research, they might be more willing to
conduct SoTL research studies. Despite numerous definitions of SoTL, commonality among
research set-up exists (Bass, 1999; Felten, 2013; Hutchings, 2000; Kreber, 2002a; O’Brien,
2008; Shulman, 2006). There is a need for additional support of academic librarians who want to
conduct SoTL research.

137

Another implication for professional practice is that Centers for Teaching and Learning,
or the equivalent department, should more strongly support academic librarians’ engagement in
SoTL initiatives. Many participants spoke about how beneficial their university’s teaching and
learning center was to their professional development. Specifically, staff in the teaching and
learning center could host workshops to discuss how to create and conduct a research project on
information literacy. Since the instruction conducted by librarians often differs from faculty who
teach semester-long courses, the teaching and learning center may also want to consider hosting
a workshop exclusively for librarians if the university has a staff of many academic instruction
librarians (Davis, 2007; Zai, 2014).
Participation in SoTL has a positive effect on academic instruction librarians’ teacher
identity. Involvement in SoTL also positively impacts academic instruction librarians’
instruction. Reading the teaching and learning literature and then using the strategies discussed
in the articles is enough to change both instructional practices and how librarians view
themselves. Therefore, librarians should be introduced to the teaching and learning literature in
their schooling early in their career. In fact, academic librarians should be taught about the broad
teaching and learning community in higher education. Since instruction is still not a core part of
many LIS graduate programs, administrators and faculty in those programs should, at a
minimum, introduce LIS graduate students to how academic librarians fit into the higher
education community (Brecher & Klipfel, 2014).
Owing to their job functions, many academic librarians already have some experience
with self-reflection (Corrall, 2017). Separately, Trigwell (2013) wrote that engagement in SoTL
helps instructors build their teaching practices on theory. Self-reflection coupled with theory and
practice leads to praxis (Jacobs, 2008). In many ways, involvement in SoTL leads to deeper

138

praxis. As librarians learn about instructional theories and practices, they are more likely to
reflect on their teaching and act on those reflections. Librarian 5 specifically stated, “I look at
what I do as a praxis, which to me means it is a cycle of practice, research, practice, research,
practice, research.” Librarian 6 also discussed the importance of praxis in her professional work.
Growing as a teacher is a process, and the praxis that SoTL involvement encourages was found
to be beneficial for participants in this study. Therefore, organizers of future professional
development initiatives should consider incorporating instruction on praxis and demonstrating
how SoTL supports it. Similarly, individuals responsible for professional development should
incorporate instruction on the importance of being reflective practitioners. Oakleaf (2011) found
that librarians who participated in assessment automatically were involved in reflective practice.
Oakleaf (2011) further noted that reflective practice was important for librarians to grow
professionally. These findings were further supported by this study’s findings on the connection
of reflection and an attitude of self-improvement.
Additionally, library organizations, library schools, and library administrations should
look for ways to make the teaching and learning of librarians more visible. Participants in this
study found the support and encouragement of other colleagues to be beneficial to their own
practice. However, there were still recognized gaps. Some participants indicated they were not
seen as teachers nor did they see themselves as a teacher. Moreover, the view others had of their
role affected the view they had of themselves. For example, Librarian 1 felt the need to confirm
librarians were wanted at teaching and learning events hosted by the university despite having
faculty status. She was willing to advocate for herself, but greater support from the larger higher
education teaching community might influence how other faculty view her as well as how they

139

view other librarians. This implication for practice is underpinned by Wenger’s (1998)
Communities of Practice theory, which noted that participation in a community impacts identity.
In 2008, Walter found that LIS curriculum was not meeting the needs of librarians with
teaching responsibilities. While some participants in this research study did indicate they took
courses on instruction during library school that they found helpful, other participants still felt
there was a gap between their graduate-level work and the requirements of their job. Librarian 1,
who has been in the field 0-5 years, stated that she took an instruction class during her master’s
program, but she did not recall discussing pedagogy. Librarian 4, who has also been in the field
0-5 years, had a similar experience. She started library school with a teacher identity because of
previous graduate work, but she said, “I feel strongly that I should have had classes in graduate
school, in library school, on teaching. I feel like that was really missing in my graduate ...
training.” On the other hand, Librarian 3, who has 0-5 years of professional working experience,
spoke about a teaching practicum she had the opportunity to participate in during graduate
school. Due to the practicum, she indicated she felt prepared for teaching responsibilities upon
graduation. An additional caveat is that Librarian 2 started library school with the intention of
working in a K-12 setting and was exposed to a lot of coursework on pedagogy and instruction.
Librarians do have experience with assessment, and survey results showed an increase in
librarians’ use of assessment to guide instruction after participation in SoTL (Oakleaf, 2009).
However, this study’s findings also indicated that librarians wanted to assess student learning,
but they often did not. Interview participants recognized the benefits of assessment, but often
felt that they did not have the necessary skillset. In fact, Librarian 1 stated, “I have been
struggling with that [assessment] for a while.” When asked what has changed the most in their
teaching through participation in SoTL, Librarian 2 said, “I think what has happened is my fear

140
of assessment has been diminished a little bit. That doesn’t mean I am actually comfortable
assessing student learning all the time.” Given this finding, it would behoove both LIS graduate
programs and professional development organizations to spend time teaching assessment
strategies and then teaching what to do with assessment data. Librarians clearly want, and need,
additional instruction on assessment. LIS programs and professional organizations are uniquely
situated to meet this need.
LIS graduate programs have made progress in aligning their curriculum with the needs of
the field, but additional work needs to be done (Hensley, 2015). As teaching continues to grow
as part of librarians’ jobs, LIS professors should add curriculum on pedagogy and provide more
opportunities for their students to practice teaching (Hall, 2017; Hensley, 2015). Practicum
programs such as the one described by Librarian 3 are a good model of how other LIS graduate
programs can incorporate teaching and learning into their curriculum to help students prepare for
future job responsibilities.
Walter (2008) also found in his research that teaching was central to how librarians
viewed their mission. This finding was reconfirmed in this research study. The importance of
LIS graduate programs emphasizing instruction is further highlighted because practicing
academic librarians view teaching as central to their mission. Many interview participants spoke
about how important their teaching was to their professional role, with Librarian 2 going so far
as to say, “my identity as an educator is really central to my work.” Additionally, academic
library employers want librarians with instruction skills (Hall, 2013; Hensley, 2015). LIS
graduate program administrators and faculty need to stay in tune with the requirements for
librarians working in the field.

141

Given that academic instruction librarians view teaching as central to their mission, in the
future they should work to extend their SoTL practices and place additional focus on student
learning. More interview participants identified their reason for involvement in SoTL as being to
improve their own teaching rather than to improve student learning. Indeed, while participation
in SoTL provides an opportunity for librarians to gain knowledge about their teaching and
improving teaching is necessary and important, the primary end goal of SoTL is increased
student learning (Elton, 2009; McKinney, 2006). As Shulman (2006) noted:
The scholarship of teaching and learning invites faculty…to view teaching as serious,
intellectual work, ask good questions about their students’ learning, seek evidence in their
classrooms that can be used to improve practice, and make this work public so that others
can critique it, build on it, and contribute to the wider teaching commons. (p. ix)
Therefore, future SoTL practice among academic instruction librarians should include
advancement on the focus of student learning.
Another implication for future practice includes fostering a vision wherein academic
librarians recognize each other as members of the teaching and learning community. In many
instances, this is already happening, but for the broader teaching and learning community to also
view librarians as participants in the community, academic librarians need to fully embrace the
role themselves. Identity is negotiated, and librarians must first negotiate this identity within
themselves (Wenger, 1998). In other words, the academic librarian community must first define
themselves as teachers. Then, academic librarians will have the support of their most closely
aligned professional community as they adopt the identity of teacher. Professional organizations
such as the Association of College and Research Libraries and the Association of Research
Libraries can specifically refer to librarians as teachers. How people refer to themselves and how

142

they participate in a community with others will affect how they make abstract concepts such as
identity concrete (Wenger, 1998).
Due to academic librarians teaching information literacy using a variety of methods and
contexts, future focus by LIS graduate schools and professional development organizations
should be given to specific pedagogical practices that work in different class settings (Davis,
2007; Davis et al., 2011; Roy & Hensley, 2016; Zai, 2014). Additionally, discussion on teaching
information literacy in a one-shot instruction session, credit-bearing courses, or at the reference
desk will help future and current academic librarians understand their role within the higher
education teaching and learning community.
Furthermore, LIS graduate programs and professional development organizations should
consider openly discussing the importance of a teacher identity for effective instruction (Day &
Kington, 2008; Sammons et al., 2007). Supporting librarians in fostering their teacher identity
will likely have a positive impact on the academic librarianship community. Teaching will
continue to be a job responsibility for academic librarians (Gammons, Carroll, & Inge, 2017;
Hall, 2017); therefore, helping them feel comfortable in that role will be beneficial.
Overall, the results of this study point to the importance of librarians being open-minded
to assuming a teacher identity. Librarians need to participate in the broad higher education
profession. This involvement should be encouraged in library school, by library organizations,
and by library administrations. When librarians choose to participate in the international higher
education teaching and learning community, they will have additional opportunities to engage in
practices that lead to identity formation and the development of professional purpose (Wenger,
1998).
