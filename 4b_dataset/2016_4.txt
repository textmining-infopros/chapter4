ABSTRACT
Samuel J. Brannon: Books about Music in Renaissance
Print Culture: Authors, Printers, and Readers
(Under the direction of Anne MacNeil)
This study examines the ways that printing technology affected the relationship between
Renaissance authors of books about music and their readers. I argue that the proliferation of
books by past and then-present authors and emerging expectations of textual and logical
coherence led to the coalescence and formalization of music theory as a field of inquiry. By
comparing multiple copies of single books about music, I show how readers employed a wide
range of strategies to understand the often confusing subject of music. Similarly, I show how
their authors and printers responded in turn, making their books more readable and user-friendly
while attempting to profit from the enterprise. In exploring the complex negotiations among
authors of books about music, their printers, and their readers, I seek to demonstrate how printing
technology enabled authors and readers to engage with one another in unprecedented and
meaningful ways.
I aim to bring studies of Renaissance music into greater dialogue with the history of the
book. Renaissance books about music combine text, sound, and image in ways that resonate with
contemporary developments in literary, philosophical, and scientific books. I show that
Renaissance writers about music grappled early on with issues that also plagued (and continue to
vex) authors in all fields: engaging unknown and distant readers, writing clearly about difficult
subjects, and publishing timely and commercially viable texts. Surviving copies of books by
music theorists contain unusually significant evidence of intense interactions between their

iii

producers and consumers. Textual and paratextual features introduced by authors, technical
innovations by printers, and heavy annotations by readers all demonstrate each party reaching
out across the page to the others. I argue that these attempts to diagnose and to solve the unique
challenges of writing and reading about music constitute a critical chapter in the history of the
book and in the history of music.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

It is a pleasure to recognize those individuals and institutions that have supported this project. I
have received constant support from various organizations within the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill—the Graduate School, the Department of Music, and the Program in
Medieval and Early Modern Studies allowed me to conduct research across the globe, provided
time and space to think, and contributed generous research and financial assistance at several
critical junctures. A Charles Montgomery Gray Fellowship from the Newberry Library allowed
me to complete a large portion of research on their significant collection of Renaissance books
about music. An Alvin H. Johnson AMS 50 Dissertation Fellowship from the American
Musicological Society afforded me the opportunity to complete this project unencumbered by
other distractions.
Projects on rare books require, well, rare books. Many librarians and archivists helped to
expedite my research by providing generous access to the materials I needed. A list of such
individuals easily could fill many pages. I wish to thank in particular the following individuals
who went out of their way to help me while I conducted research at their institutions: Emily
Ferrigno (Irving S. Gilmore Music Library, Yale University), Paul Gehl (Newberry Library),
Veronika Giglberger (Bayerische Stattsbibliothek), Sabine Kurth (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek),
Suzanne Lovejoy (Irving S. Gilmore Music Library, Yale University), Tiziana Morsanuto
(Biblioteca del Conservatorio “Santa Cecilia”), Rosario Todero (Biblioteca Casanatense), and
Alfredo Vitolo (Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica). Chiara Pancino graciously

v

facilitated access to materials at the Biblioteca del Conservatorio “Benedetto Marcello” while the
library was under renovation. Elisabetta Caldelli (Biblioteca Vallicelliana) and Samantha
Gilchrist (Special Collections, University of Glasgow Library) provided detailed bibliographical
assistance through correspondence. Susan Clermont (Music Division, Library of Congress),
David Peter Coppen (Sibley Music Library, Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester),
and Carla Zecher (Newberry Library) helped to shepherd me through the enormous collections at
their respective libraries. Here at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Emily Kader
and Kathleen Monahan, both of the Special Collections Library, provided generous access to the
University’s rare books and directed my attention to some interesting uncataloged finds. Diane
Steinhaus and Carrie Monette, both of the Music Library, provided reference assistance,
answered innumerable queries, and made helpful suggestions at several stages.
A number of scholars and friends provided invaluable advice. I was the fortunate
recipient of kind critiques on early drafts of chapters from several graduate-student colleagues,
particularly Molly Barnes, Megan Eagan, Matthew Franke, and Oren Vinogradov. I am
especially grateful to Thomas Christensen, Jane Daphne Hatter, Susan Forscher Weiss, Adam
Whittaker, and Richard Wistreich for sharing new and unpublished research with me. Cristle
Collins Judd generously shared her ongoing research into the life and works of Zarlino and read
the entire manuscript, providing many comments that helped sharpen or clarify my arguments.
The members of my dissertation committee have provided unfailingly sound advice at numerous
junctures. Tim Carter provided incisive, detailed comments and helped to improve many of the
translations. John Nádas provided a number of useful suggestions about the relationship between
prints and manuscripts. Mark Evan Bonds helped to focus my arguments and narrow the scope of
the project. Phil Vandermeer lent a kind ear and pointed me toward valuable secondary literature.

My dissertation advisor, Anne MacNeil, has gone above and beyond in seeing this project from
its initial inception in a seminar paper through to completion. I am thankful for her instinctive
ability to sense when I needed space to work, for prodding me gently along the process, and for
several final pushes as this project drew to completion.
Finally, I wish to thank my wife, Heather Brannon. The dubious honor of being an
academic spouse carries with it many other duties: therapist, travel agent, editor, chef, and
realist-in-chief. She watched as this project ballooned beyond its initial scope and waited
patiently throughout the gestation process as it thinned down to something manageable. I am
eager to repay the many hours she has loaned me to read, to think, and to write.

NOTE ON REFERENCES AND TRANSCRIPTIONS

In the interest of space, all references are given in shortened form; full citations may be found in
the bibliography. Page references to books printed before 1800 follow the pagination or foliation
employed by the books themselves. Signatures (e.g., “sig. A1v”) refer to the specific pages of
gatherings in books with absent or inconsistent pagination or foliation. Following bibliographical
convention, signatures with duplicate letters are reduced simply to a number and single letter
(e.g., “Aa” becomes “2A” and “bbb” becomes “3b”). The Greek letter pi (π) is assigned to a
preliminary gathering that is unsigned or signed non-alphabetically; the Greek letter chi (χ) is
assigned to an unsigned gathering that interrupts or follows a sequence of gatherings signed
alphabetically. Multiple gatherings in these locations follow the convention for signatures with
duplicate letters: e.g., sig. 2π1v is the verso of the first leaf of the second preliminary gathering;
sig. 3χ4r is the recto of the fourth leaf of the third interpolated gathering. Page or folio numbers
given in brackets are implied; for example, p. [102] refers to the unnumbered page that appears
overleaf the page numbered 101.
Where practical, I give English translations of documents in foreign languages in the
main text, with transcriptions in their original languages given in the footnotes. Where the
content of the text is the locus of interest, the transcriptions are edited to standardize letterforms
and spell out all abbreviations (e.g., “ii” for “ij,” “udire” for “vdire,” and “saranno” for “ſarāno”);
I preserve original letter case, punctuation, and diacritical marks. Where the presentation of the
text is the locus of interest (e.g., in title pages or marginalia), I provide diplomatic transcriptions
that reproduce the salient aspects of the original texts as closely as possible (original letterforms,
scribal abbreviations, cancellations or interlineal additions, italic vs. roman typeface, letter case,

xx

punctuation, diacritical marks). In both kinds of transcriptions, the vertical bar ( | ) indicates the
location of a line break; a double vertical bar ( || ) indicates a line break with additional
intervening whitespace. Square brackets indicate the addition of material not found in the
original text (clarifications of meaning, descriptions of typographical features such as ornaments,
borders, rules, illustrations, etc.) Where no source of a translation is identified, the translation is
my own.
Musical transcriptions are given in modern clefs with an incipit that indicates original
cleffing, signature, and mensuration sign. All accidentals specified in the original notation are
given on the staff and are edited to conform to modern practice (i.e., when there is a flat in the
signature, a diesis applied to a B is rendered as B♮). Editorial accidentals, whether for the sake of
musica ficta or clarity, are given above the staff. Ligatures are indicated using closed horizontal
brackets (

) above the staff; coloration is indicated using opened horizontal brackets (

)

above the staff. Abbreviated repetitions of text are expanded in angle brackets (< >); editorial
additions or corrections to the text are given in square brackets ([ ]). Critical notes, where
appropriate, are given in the captions of individual transcriptions.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

In 1474, the Venetian scribe Filippo de Strata issued a memorandum to the Doge of Venice,
Nicolò Marcello. Johannes Gutenberg’s “ars scribendi artificialiter” had arrived there in 1469
from Germany and Rome, touching off an economic boom in the book trade. Only five years
later, Filippo offered a bleak assessment of the situation:
Indeed, writing, which brings in gold for us, should be respected and held to be
nobler than all goods, unless she has suffered degradation in the brothel of the
printing presses. She is a maiden with a pen, a harlot in print…This is what the
printing presses do: they corrupt susceptible hearts. Yet the (let us say) silly asses
do not see this, and brutes rejoice in the fraudulent title of teachers, exalting
themselves with a song like this (be so good as to listen): “O good citizens,
rejoice: your city is well stuffed with books. For a small sum men turn themselves
into doctors in three years. Let thanks be rendered to the printers!” Any
uncultured person without Latin bawls these things. I propose a very different
song: “Never has the city had so small a number of books as at this time, or even
of people wanting books.” The printing presses are giving us a city without cash
and without a heart. If you are the kind of person who expects light to come to
you out of darkness, then it will come to you from printed books.1
Of course, an ulterior motive lurked behind Filippo’s misguided attempt to persuade Venetian
authorities to ban printed books and their makers from the city: the corrupting influence of the
medium aside, printed books were bad news for scribes unwilling to embrace technological

change. Filippo’s letter unwittingly bears witness to the irrevocable impact of printing
technology on communication, knowledge, and learning during the Renaissance.
In this dissertation, I assess the relationship between Renaissance books about music and
the dissemination of printing technology. By “books about music,” I mean printed books that
explore substantially the topic of music in any kind of discursive or literary framework (treatise,
dialogue, letters, primer, method, poetry, etc.). This definition includes both entire works
devoted to the subject of music and extended discussions of music in books ostensibly about
other subjects. This definition does not encompass brief discussions of, or passing references to,
music in longer works, although I do consider these from time to time in this dissertation. For
example, I do not consider either Francesco Spinacino’s Intabulatura de lauto libro primo
(RISM 15075) or John Day’s The Whole Booke of Psalmes (1562) to be books about music
simply because they include short primers on playing the lute or on singing the psalms. Instead, I
view both of these as “books of music,” by which I mean printed books consisting entirely or
mostly of musical texts, whether destined for performance, study, or some other use. Although I
consider books about music and books of music to be separate classes of music books, during the
Renaissance there existed a mutually dependent relationship between them; this is an important
theme I pursue in this dissertation.
I argue that Renaissance books about music as material artifacts provide extensive
evidence of intense interactions among their producers, distributors, and consumers. This thesis
challenges a number of assumptions common in music scholarship: (1) that books in general, and
books about music in particular, are neutral vehicles for containing ideas, and that the medium is
distinct from the messages they transmit; (2) that printing technology ossified patterns of textual
transmission by virtue of disseminating at once many identical copies of a text; and (3) that the

2

nature of authorship and the process of writing was divorced from concerns about the
dissemination and reception of the works that resulted. Books about music have yet to play a
significant role in the literature on music and print culture during the Renaissance. I show,
however, that books about music provide far greater evidence of use and reader engagement than
books of music and thus are important sources for studying the history of all kinds of music
books during the Renaissance. The primary category of evidence that I consider is the
bibliographical analysis of the material condition of surviving copies of Renaissance books about
music. Over the course of three years, I conducted an international survey of Renaissance books
about music at a number of major repositories. By comparing multiple copies of single books
about music, I show how readers employed a wide range of strategies to understand the often
confusing subject of music. Similarly, I show how authors and printers responded in turn,
making their books more readable and user-friendly while attempting to profit from the
enterprise. In exploring the complex negotiations among writers about music, their printers, and
their readers, I seek to demonstrate how printing technology enabled authors and readers to
engage with one another in unprecedented and meaningful ways.
These attempts to diagnose and to solve the unique challenges of writing and reading
about music constitute a critical and little-examined chapter in the history of the book. This
dissertation contributes to a growing body of literature that integrates early-modern music and
print culture into a rich and more general historical context. My research complements previous
scholarship through close attention to the material condition of surviving exemplars, which
testify to developments in the reading practices of professional musicians and lay audiences
during the sixteenth century. Similarly, this dissertation contributes to discussions of the
relationships between books about music and books of music, showing how both functioned

3

within the wider marketplace of print. Renaissance books about music combine text, sound, and
image in ways that resonate with contemporary developments in literary, philosophical, and
scientific books. I show that Renaissance writers about music grappled early on with issues that
also plagued (and continue to vex) authors in all fields: engaging unknown and distant readers,
writing clearly about difficult subjects, and publishing timely and commercially viable texts. The
introduction of textual and paratextual features by authors, technical innovations by printers, and
heavy annotations by readers all demonstrate each party reaching out across the page to the
others.
I propose that these interactions occurred by means of a communications circuit, a
concept first theorized by Robert Darnton and refined by scholars such as Thomas R. Adams and
Nicholas Barker, Roger Chartier, and Adriaan van der Weel.2 The communication circuit is “a
general model for analyzing the way books come into being and spread though society” (67).
The path of the circuit follows the possession of textual artifacts, from authors, editors,
publishers, printers, shippers, booksellers, binders, and finally to readers. At the center, shaping
the entire process, are three overarching and overlapping factors: the intellectual, economic, and
political frameworks in which books existed (68). The most important feature of this model is its
circularity, the necessity of individuals to assume multiple roles as producers, distributors, and
consumers of texts. Darnton argues that awareness of this cyclic process prompted specific
reactions from individuals, changes to their behavior, which are the proper subject of the history
of printed books:

“Interaction between Text and Reader.”

It [the communications circuit] transmits messages, transforming them en route,
as they pass from thought to writing to printed characters and back to thought
again. Book history concerns each phase of this process and the process as a
whole, in all its variations over space and time and in all its relations with other
systems, economic, social, political, and cultural, in the surrounding
environment…But the parts do not take on their full significance unless they are
related to the whole, and some holistic view of the book as a means of
communication seems necessary if book history is to avoid being fragmented into
esoteric specialization, cut off from each other by arcane techniques and mutual
misunderstanding. (67)
At the core of this dissertation are analyses of three central figures in the communication circuit
surrounding Renaissance books about music: the author, the printer, and the reader. My goal is to
capture something of the dynamism inherent in these roles—that is, I hope not only to show what
it meant to be an author, printer, or reader of books about music during the Renaissance, but also
to show how authors acted as publishers and readers; how printers acted as authors and readers;
and how readers acted as authors and publishers. In this chapter, I provide an introduction to
Renaissance books about music themselves, surveying their geographical and chronological
dissemination, their general content, and their historical development. I then turn to a review of
the literature on Renaissance writings about music and print culture. Finally, I provide a
summary of each chapter and trace the lines of argument that connect these chapters.

Books about music and incipient print culture
At the time of Filippo de Strata’s letter, music was making only its first tentative steps into the
world of commercial printing. Before the emergence of Ottaviano Petrucci’s press at Venice
around 1500, musical notation and discussions of music appeared in a small number of printed
books. Mary Kay Duggan has identified 270 music incunabula, which represent less than one

5

percent of the estimated total of 28,000 incunabular editions.3 The direct reach of these books to
the public was negligible, because the majority (213 editions) were books of liturgical music
destined not for lay readers or musicians, but for the libraries of cathedrals, parishes,
monasteries, convents, and courts—and possibly a few collectors.
The remaining fifty-seven music incunabula were books about music. These and their
early sixteenth-century counterparts were the first music books to reach a wider public.4 Scholars
have yet to consider that printed books about music shaped public perceptions of music and
conditioned the marketplace for printed music, even before it was available to most readers. Prior
to the dissemination of printing technology, the subject of musical practice (as distinguished
from the study of music as a member of the quadrivium) was studied by few non-musicians;
rather, serious discourse about musical practice circulated within the limited sphere of its
practitioners and their patrons.5 With the dissemination of printing technology arrived the
possibility of writing about music for a literate public—for novices and experts, for students and
teachers, for amateurs and professionals, and most importantly for readers distant and unknown.
Over a fifty-year period, roughly from 1480 to 1530, writers about music learned to embrace this
new opportunity.6 The best such books of this period—Franchinus Gaffurius’s Practica musicae
(1496) and Pietro Aaron’s Toscanello in musica (1523), for example—became the first classics
of music literature, consistently reprinted and widely read throughout the sixteenth century. It

should also be emphasized that, until the birth of modern musical scholarship during the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, knowledge of ancient and medieval music theory was
filtered significantly through the lenses of Renaissance books about music, which were the first
to consider significantly the history of musical theory and practice.7
The barriers to enjoying these books were the same as for any other: basic literacy, at first
in Latin and later in the vernacular; and access to books themselves, whether owned or
borrowed. Admittedly, for many these were not insignificant challenges.8 Depending on the book
in question, another barrier was musical literacy, the ability to read and understand musical
notation. During the course of the Renaissance, the number of standalone books designed to
teach the fundamentals of musical literacy grew rapidly. Twenty-five books devoted entirely to
this subject appeared before 1500, representing almost half of the incunabular books about
music; over half of this subset are first editions and reprints of five foundational works on
reading and singing both plainchant and mensural music.9 This period also witnessed the
publication of the first printed dictionary of musical terminology, Johannes Tinctoris’s
Terminorum musicae diffinitorium (c. 1495).10 The overall purpose of such books was to
promote musical literacy and basic knowledge of the subject. Tinctoris expresses this desire in
the dedication of the Terminorum to Beatrice of Naples (1457–1508):

von Reutlingen, Flores musice (3 editions, 1488–1492; no sixteenth-century reprints); Michael Keinspeck, Lilium

Wherefore, being a student of the most liberal art, and the noblest among the
mathematical arts, namely divine music, and believing it very useful to define its
terms both in principle and in detail, by which the things concerning it being
understood, those who practice it may the more readily grasp its nature and its
particulars, I have published the present little book, which is called with reason a
dictionary of music.11
Promoting musical literacy and knowledge of the subject had the benefit of removing what must
have been a major obstacle to approaching more technically-oriented books about music. Indeed,
books about music worked alongside short primers such as Spinacino’s on playing the lute
(reprinted in all of Petrucci’s books of lute intabulations) in order to make books of music
accessible to new readers.
The corpus of Renaissance books about music—unlike many other contemporary fields
of book production, including books of music—affords a comprehensive overview. Such an
overview is possible only now through the completion of a number of significant bibliographical
projects such as RISM, various national bibliographies such as EDIT16 and VD16, and online
union catalogs such the ISTC and USTC. During the period from 1474 to 1609, 979 editions of
516 different books about music were printed in 112 cities.12 The size of this corpus is large
enough to permit meaningful statistical analysis of its geographical and chronological

My method for deriving these figures is given in the prefatory note to appendix two. This period is circumscribed
by the availability of reliable data and by changes in theoretical discussions: 1474 witnessed the publication of the
first book about music; after 1609, books about music turned to new subject matters, such as monody and harmonic
theory, and became more diffuse geographically. Judd, Reading Renaissance Music Theory, 17 gives slightly
different figures for the period 1500–1600, based on Davidsson, Bibliographie der musiktheoretischen Drucke: 611
editions of 326 books about music in 75 cities.

distribution, which is discussed here and summarized in appendix two. The books themselves
also are consistent enough in topic and approach to characterize their historical development,
which is discussed later in this section.
Table 1.1 analyzes patterns of production by decade during this period.13 One clearly sees
the general growth of production from the 1470s through the 1550s, with an increase in the
number editions for nearly every decade; after 1550 growth levels off, with a more-or-less
consistent level of production through the end of the period. There are two exceptions to these
general trends, the 1520s and the 1560s, which witnessed temporary cessations of production of
books about music in Augsburg, Basel, Leipzig, Milan, Paris, Rome, Strasbourg, and
Wittenberg. This was a reflection of trends in the wider book trade that resulted from prolonged
religious and political conflict.14 The most dramatic illustration of the effects of conflict on the

book trade was the Sack of Rome in 1527. The Sack devastated the city’s robust printing
industry, leading to a depression in the city’s book trade in general, and the trade in music books
in particular, that lasted for nearly twenty years.15 Incidentally, both the 1520s and the 1560s
witnessed increased production in Nuremberg and Venice, the twin centers of the trade in books
about music during the Renaissance.
Table 1.2 analyzes patterns of production by city during this period. Most cities with
active presses produced books about music only sporadically. Ninety-two cities produced fewer
than eleven books about music each and only a third of the books produced in these cities were
first editions. That the total output of these cities accounts for only a quarter of the total
production points up the importance of the most active cities. Three-quarters of all Renaissance
books about music were printed in only twenty cities, the most productive of which were
important trade hubs and centers of intellectual activity: Venice, Nuremberg, Wittenberg, Paris,
Leipzig, Basel, and Augsburg.
At least with respect to books about music, the emphasis on Venice in scholarship on
music printing is justified. Books about music printed at Venice handily outnumber their
counterparts printed in other European cities. Venice was also the first market to maintain an
uninterrupted output, producing at least one edition during every five-year interval starting in
1480. The production in Venice’s closest competitor, Nuremberg, is consistent starting only in
1530. Every other major center of production saw intermittent bursts of activity, typically related
to a single printer or publisher (e.g., the firm of Georg Rhau accounts for 59 of Wittenberg’s 66
editions). This pattern emerges even more clearly when one considers the production of first

editions—the seventy-four first editions printed at Venice rival the total production of most
cities. These first editions are dispersed evenly among the catalogs of thirty-six different
Venetian printers. The Venetian market for books about music was also the most diverse,
attracting many different kinds of readers by publishing books on a wide range of musical topics.
Other major markets adhered rigidly to the publication of books with niche audiences. For
example, most of the books about music printed at Nuremberg and Wittenberg were designed for
schoolboys; those printed at Paris were designed for university students; and those printed at
Basel were designed for scholars. In contrast, books about music printed at Venice were

11

designed for these audiences and others, including professional musicians, amateur musicians,
and interested non-musicians.
The importance of any given center of production does not consist solely in its total
number of editions. The number and proportion of first editions—including works that were both
newly-composed and new-to-the-press—helped to define the character of local markets for
books about music. For example, Nuremberg was preoccupied with the publication of reprints,
releasing only thirty first editions (out of 114 editions total, about a quarter), all of them destined
for schoolboys. Paris produced half as many total editions as Nuremberg, but a greater number of
first editions (33 of 59 editions). Most centers with a middling level of production (between 11
and 20 total editions) released mostly new works. Upon closer examination, one sees that
printers in these markets catered to local authors in way that printers in larger markets did not—
for example, despite their small outputs, Bologna, Milan, and Rome present detailed pictures of
highly localized approaches to printing and publishing books about music.
What did Renaissance books about music discuss? Such books comprise an astounding
array of topics, some old, some new. As various scholars have noted, this topical variety makes it
difficult, if not impossible, to trace the history of Renaissance music theory in chronological
terms.16 Rather, it proves expedient to trace various theoretical strands, noting their development
and representative works. Broadly speaking, Renaissance writers about music maintained the
ancient bifurcation of musical knowledge into musica speculativa and musica practica. The
former treated of the philosophical foundations of music as a member of the quadrivium,
exploring the theory of number comparison mythically derived by Pythagoras and systematized

16

Dahlhaus, “Was heisst ‘Geschichte der Musiktheorie’?” famously noted that music theory resists its own history.
Christensen, The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory, 2 argues credibly that the Renaissance music theory
cannot be “an intelligible and meaningful historical subject” traced chronologically.

by Boethius. The latter concerned the application of these precepts to musical sound,
encompassing a great variety of topics ranging from the division of the monochord to musical
composition. During the mid-sixteenth century two noteworthy topics arose outside this broad
intellectual framework: instruction in musical performance and musical aesthetics.
The first printed books about music concerned musica speculativa, which underwent a
dramatic transformation during this period. Although the inherited medieval tradition of
Boethian number theory derived from Pythagoras remained a central topic, writers gradually
reexamined it in response to broader intellectual shifts. Late fifteenth-century and early
sixteenth-century texts, such as Franchinus Gaffurius’s Theoricum opus musice discipline (1480)
and Sebald Heyden’s De arte canendi (1537), largely viewed musica speculativa as the familiar
study of canonics (abstract mathematical ratios and proportions) and harmonics (their
manifestation in musical intervals). These theorists viewed musica speculativa as essential
components of philosophical study and as preliminaries to practical music-making. More
practically-oriented writers signaled the waning importance of ancient and medieval views on
music by mentioning them only briefly, or by dispensing with them altogether. Late-sixteenthcentury writers, especially those with a more scientific or mathematical orientation, began to
reinvigorate Boethian number theory; Johannes Kepler’s Mysterium cosmographicum (1596), in
particular, redirected popular attention to the concept of musica universalis. Responding to
developments in mathematics and astronomy, such writers argued for both physical and
metaphysical connections between canonics and harmonics, between number and sound.17 In
short, the development of musica speculativa paralleled the transformation of the other quadrivia
(geometry, astronomy, and arithmetic) into early-modern science and mathematics.

17

Grant, “Numbers and Series” provides a survey of this general trend.

13

It has often been noted that the sixteenth century witnessed the first flowering of writings
about musica practica.18 An important argument of this dissertation is the centrality of printing
technology to this process, which required general increases in rates of musical literacy and in
public interest in the subject. During this period, the number and complexity of practical topics
within the study of music greatly increased. In spite of the heterogeneous and imprecise pictures
they paint of musical practice, these books enabled Renaissance readers to understand how music
was made. In addition to inculcating the rudiments of notation and singing, Renaissance books
about music considered a wide range of topics, focusing especially on counterpoint, mode, and
mensuration.
Counterpoint—the study of crafting polyphony—is the most frequently-encountered
subject in Renaissance books about music. Among the 516 first editions published during this
period, over a third discuss counterpoint substantively. The basic necessity of understanding
counterpoint accounts for its prevalence as a subject of study; counterpoint allowed musicians to
understand how composers assembled polyphonic textures and helped them to improvise new
parts to preexisting music. Renaissance counterpoint treatises witness a basic tension between
theorists of notated counterpoint (e.g., Aaron, Vicentino, and Zarlino) and improvised
counterpoint (e.g., Lusitano, Santa Maria, and Montanos). No shortage of scholarly confusion
has arisen from casual slippages between the two in discussions of counterpoint, especially in
earlier writers like Gaffurius and Tinctoris.19 A number of texts, Giovanni Maria Lanfranco’s
Scintille di musica (1533) being a prominent example, suggest a messier and more intimate

Jeppesen, “Eine musiktheoretische Korrespondenz,” 3 argues that the sixteenth century saw the first “craze for
music theory” (“der sozusagen musiktheoretischen Wut”).

Compositional Process.”

relationship between improvised counterpoint and composition that scholars have begun to
explore in the past decade.20
The subject of mode formed another fundamental part of a musician’s training. In
essence, mode partitioned musical space into discrete segments of pitches with their own
distinctive characteristics. Most Renaissance writers about mode (e.g., Gaffurius, Lanfranco,
Morley) continued to embrace the medieval eight-fold system, with pairs of authentic and plagal
modes on four finals (D, E, F, and G). Heinrich Glarean’s Dodecachordon (1547) introduced a
twelve-mode system, with pairs of modes on six finals (D, E, F, G, A, and C). Gioseffo Zarlino’s
Le istitutioni harmoniche (1558) disseminated Glarean’s system more widely, aided in the
process by the works of his followers, Francisco de Salinas’s De musica libri septem (1577),
Oratio Tigrini’s Il compendio della musica (1588) and Lodovico Zacconi’s Prattica di musica
(1592). The pattern of modal expansion was extended further in the fourteen-mode system of
Illuminato Aiguino da Brescia’s Il tesoro (1581), which added six irregular modes to the
traditional eight. Even within individual camps about the number of mode, partisans disagreed
over a number of related issues. Glarean and Zarlino mostly agree on the affects accorded to the
modes, but disagree on their constitution, whether by species of octaves or by conjunctions of
species of fourths and fifths.21 The classification of the diatessaron into diatonic, enharmonic,
and chromatic genera sparked lively discussion throughout the sixteenth century, most vividly in
the debate between Nicola Vicentino and Vicente Lusitano; this debate is recounted in appendix
one and is examined intensively in chapters two through four. Indeed, the entire pitch system,
from the largest level of the gamut to the smallest level of the comma, received unprecedented

attention during this period. A great deal of discussion appeared in the pages of printed books, in
which readers recorded their responses, which in turn occasioned the writing of new books.
Mensuration uniquely bridged musica speculativa and musica practica, as it involved
both the study of proportions and musical notation. Nearly every sixteenth-century practical text
included at least a few chapters on mensural systems (time, mood, and prolation) and gave a few
musical examples. Sebald Heyden’s De arte canendi (1537) is viewed often as the culmination
of Renaissance mensural systems, particularly in the emphasis accorded to the tactus;
nonetheless, recent scholarship has problematized its relationship to the general development of
mensural theories.22 The picture that emerges from a survey of mensuration texts during the
Renaissance is one of striking variety; while most authors agree on the perfect and imperfect
divisions of time, and the major and minor division of prolation, the precise interpretations and
performances of actual mensural music vary.23 This overall diversity points toward the study of
mensuration as an activity that brought together the differing interests of theorists and
performers: composition and performance, numbers and proportions, and notation and
interpretation. General interest in mensuration should be viewed as a response to the puzzles of
polyphonic music that many readers faced for the first time; whether in books of or about music,
performing mensural music relied on an ability to parse and regulate time, sometimes in highly
unusual ways. The most practically-minded theorists, especially Vicentino and Tigrini, focused
on the needs of such readers, dismissing mensural subtleties as vestigial features of outmoded
systems.

23

Miller, “Sebald Heyden’s De arte canendi,” 84n: “A study of the all too numerous theoretical writings of the time
[on mensuration] reveals clearly that they are magnificently contradictory.”

16

The Renaissance also witnessed the first outpouring of books of vocal and instrumental
instruction. Martin Agricola’s Musica instrumentalis deudsch (1529) was an early book on
instrumental technique and was read by many sixteenth-century students at German Latin
schools. Many of the most revealing primary sources on counterpoint, mode, and mensuration
are properly performance manuals: Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego’s Opera intitulata Fontegara
(1535), Tomás de Santa María’s Libro llamado arte de tañer fantasia (1565), Vincenzo Galilei’s
Fronimo (1568), William Bathe’s A Briefe Introduction to the Skill of Song (c. 1596), Adriano
Banchieri’s Conclusioni nel suono dell’organo (1609), and Francisco de Montanos’s Arte de
canto llano (1594). Conversely, many texts ostensibly about other topics, such as Vicentino’s
L’antica musica (1555) and Lanfranco’s Scintille di musica (1533), yield significant insight into
performance practice and organology. One particular subset of works on performance explored
the subject of text underlay, a perennial concern for modern editors. Most printed books that
considered the subject do so in isolated chapters (e.g., Zarlino’s Istitutioni and Lanfranco’s
Scintille); a few manuscript sources explore the subject more extensively, Gaspar Stoquerus’s De
musica verbali libri duo (c. 1570) being the most notable.24 All of these texts point up the
precarious nature during this period between the various component subject matters of musica
practica.
One final topic, prompted by the conjunction of speculative and practical matters,
deserves brief mention—music criticism and aesthetics. During the Renaissance, for the first
time, readers encountered classifications of composers and compositions into consistent

categories (good/bad or ancient/modern).25 One also encounters extended discussion of
individual compositions, describing their musical features and aesthetic qualities with technical
language (e.g., throughout Glarean’s Dodecachordon). Although to my knowledge there are no
single primary sources related exclusively to the criticism or aesthetics of music during the
Renaissance, increasingly they became important preoccupations for theorists.26 Printing
technology aided in this process: as the technical vocabulary for describing music and as the
volume of theoretical discourse increased, writers began to prioritize their allegiances to
theoretical lineages over traditional systems of thought, which contributed to the breakdown of
the distinction between speculative and practical theories of music. During the second half of the
sixteenth century, a third category of music emerged called musica poetica, which saw aesthetics
as a means of reconciling speculative and practical thought. Such texts as Gallus Dressler’s
Praecepta musicae poetica (manuscript dated 1563), Sethus Calvisius’s Melopoiia (1592), and
Joachim Burmeister’s Musica poetica (1606) drew comparisons between musical composition
and oratory, suggesting ways of composing, performing, and analyzing music with reference to
codified sets of rhetorical figures. Another significant observation is that—although the separate
publication of speculative and practical texts persisted during the Renaissance—one finds for the
first time speculative and practical topics treated in the same volume: for example, Gioseffo
Zarlino’s Le istitutioni harmoniche (1558), Francisco de Salinas’s De musica libri septem
(1577), and Pietro Cerone’s El melopeo y maestro (1613). As Bartolomeo Ramis de Pareia put it
in Musica practica (1482): “Here we do not undertake only to teach philosophers or

mathematicians; anyone, provided he has learned the rudiments of grammar, will understand our
books. Here mouse and elephant can swim together, Daedalus and Icarus can fly together.”27
Ramis’s gambit speaks to a concern common among Renaissance writers about music, an
explicit desire to establish a wide audience for their books. I argue in this dissertation that writers
leveraged printing technology to achieve this end of public discourse about music. In the
chapters that follow, I will show that the reasons for this were manifold. Printed books were
economically advantageous: notwithstanding the drawbacks signaled early on by Filippo de
Strata, they were cheaper to manufacture and potentially more directly profitable for authors than
manuscripts; and they spread more widely and more rapidly along trade and shipping routes than
one-off manuscripts delivered by authors and scriptoria. Printed books also were commodities
that conferred authority and prestige on their writers and publishers, which helped writers to
achieve a variety of career goals: securing jobs and patronage, improving their professional
standings, and staking out longer-lasting legacies. This also was true about luxury manuscripts,
but to a lesser degree, as printed books about music were more firmly rooted in the matrix of
commerce. In order to acquire audiences, makers of books about music needed to balance
intellectual, literary, and professional priorities against the economic imperative to sell books. I
propose here that the ultimate success of any given book about music was characterized by a
satisfactory balancing of these competing factors. That is, such books about music fulfilled at
once the various needs of their authors, printers, and readers. But there was no reliable formula
for success. Sometimes it resulted merely from a fortuitous confluence of individuals and
personalities; other times, it resulted from trial-and-error or calculated strategy. Such books also

accomplished many different aims, whether in the form of runaway sales or the pure
achievement of seeing a book into print, or something else in between. In sum, I suggest that a
book’s success stemmed from its ideal positioning within the communications circuit. The net
effect of the communications circuit was that the proliferation of books by past and then-present
writers, combined with emerging reader expectations of textual and logical coherence, led to the
coalescence and formalization of music theory as a field of inquiry.

Materializing theory, theorizing materiality
With this project, I aim to bring studies of the theory and practice of Renaissance music into
greater dialogue with the history of the book. My emphasis here is on dialogue between these
areas of study, which have developed in relative isolation from each other. The likely reason for
this is the nature of musical notation, a forbidding non-alphabetic text; put simply, books of
music require specialist knowledge to read and understand in ways that books on other subjects
do not.28 I propose that Renaissance books about music offer fertile points of connection between
musicology and the history of the book. This exchange goes both ways: on the one hand, books
about music provide a book-historical perspective on musical culture; on the other hand, books
about music allow musicological perspectives to assume greater prominence in the history of the
book. Conceiving of books about music as artifacts of a material culture is the key to this
exchange. It is precisely the uniquely hybrid qualities of books about music—their juxtaposition
of text, image, and music; their constant shifting between different modes of sensory
engagement; and their broad range of didactic functions—that suggest new ways of thinking

text; Pettegree is one of the few historians of the Renaissance book to take notice of music printing.

about materiality with regard to both musicology and book history. In this section, I survey the
relevant literature in these two fields, indicating how my research contributes to them, and
pointing to ways that books about music can harmonize them.
The impact of printing on Renaissance musical culture is one of the pioneer fields of
musicology.29 Extensive reference works such as RISM and the catalogs of individual printers
represent the culmination of extended bibliographical research on musical sources.30 Enabled by
the synoptic views in such enumerative bibliographies, musicologists in recent decades have
considered the intersections of music and the concept of print culture.31 Similarly, interest in the
history of the book and analytical bibliography has resulted in studies that consider printed books
of music as material objects.32
Writings about music occupy a precarious position within this literature. As early as
1932, books about music were considered in a separate class from books of music: “The question
of music in the fifteenth-century book has a double aspect. There are books about music, and
book which contain musical compositions.”33 One finds echoes of this view as late as 1995:
“[The emphasis of this book] deliberately excludes from consideration both theoretical works
and liturgical books, two large categories of material which often include printed musical

notation…These two kinds of books are in general quite separate from music itself.”34 Indeed,
this was a sixteenth-century distinction; in his Libraria (1550), Antonfrancesco Doni lists over
one hundred books of music, sorted by author, number of voices, and genre. Almost as an
afterthought, Doni tacks on at the end a handful of “libri diversi composti”—that is, books about
music.35 This distinction, however useful, excludes from consideration a significant quantity of
evidence concerning the impact of music printing on Renaissance culture. There are dozens of
copies of the most historically-significant books about music, which are inversely proportional to
the few surviving copies of important books of music. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the
audience for books about music was broad and that their readers viewed them as books truly to
be used, reading and rereading them, and most importantly writing in them.
A number of scholars have worked to establish a cultural context for Renaissance music
theory, sketching out the world in which writers about music worked. These studies are less
concerned with presenting definitive, all-encompassing interpretations of texts than with
providing multiple avenues for considering writers about music and their works. These contexts
can take many forms. For example, the treatises of Glarean and Zarlino have elicited very
different interpretations that emphasize alternately the influence of humanism, religion, literary
traditions, and sociopolitical institutions.36 Russell E. Murray’s article on Nicolò Burzio’s
biography uses newly-recovered details about his travels to situate Burzio’s Musices opusculum

(1487) within various local traditions.37 Similarly, Colleen Reardon’s monograph on Agostino
Agazzari explores how the demands of his positon as maestro di cappella at the Siena Cathedral
shaped his theories in the early seventeenth century.38 Several scholars have noted that the
category of “music theorist” was fluid, often overlapping with other categories such as
“composer,” “linguist,” “historian,” “mathematician,” and “scientist.”39 Thomas Christensen
suggests that this occupational confusion is a reflection of the discursive fuzziness of theorizing
about music, which he views “as a social act in which elements of performance and memory
elude the fixation of textual codification.”40 Jessie Ann Owens has argued similarly that the
terms “theory,” “theorist,” and “treatise”—terms prevalent in musical scholarship—need
significant refining so as not to paper over important distinctions in books about music: “Instead
of catch-alls like ‘theorist’ or ‘theory,’ we need to find words that are specific to the particular
activity and reflect the character of the audience and social function of the text(s) under
consideration.”41
This dissertation answers several calls for the study of the impact of printing technology
on Renaissance music theory. Owens notes that, although Renaissance music theory matured as a
subject in the pages of printed books, the specific context of print culture has not yet played a
considerable role in the history of Renaissance music theory.42 Building on Owens’ arguments,

C. Matthew Balensuela has called for the study of “the way in which the technology of printing
changed the content of music theory texts.”43 Christensen similarly highlights a need for greater
methodological reflection on the materiality of music-theoretical discourse: “Printed books can
make, order, and constrain knowledge. The book is not always an innocent transmitter of facts;
rather, print sometimes can determine and delimit what is appropriate knowledge that can be
contained within its discursive borders—constraints that have varied over time or genre of
publication.”44 I also aim to consolidate the diverse perspectives of a handful of studies that
address this and related subjects. These include, for example, studies of the iconographical
significance of title pages and historiated initials.45 Tim Carter has noted the close association of
certain music theorists with music printers.46 Bonnie J. Blackburn has explored the subject of
publishing in the voluminous correspondence of the music theorist Giovanni Spataro.47
Similarly, a recent essay Bernhard Kölbl paints a detailed picture of Glarean’s involvement in
the printing and publishing of his Dodecachordon by comparing stop-press corrections with

Fenlon and Inga Mai Groote considers broadly the role of books and print culture in the life and
works of Heinrich Glarean.49
The most substantial study on the subject to date is Cristle Collins Judd’s Reading
Renaissance Music Theory: Hearing with the Eyes (2000), which explores the ways that music
printing “betokened an irreversible change in the interplay of music theory, practice, printed
repertories, and communities of readers.”50 Judd’s wide-ranging book examines the textual and
repertorial sources for the musical examples in a number of seminal theoretical treatises,
showing how music printing afforded theorists unprecedented access to entire repertories of
music. Although not couched in such terms, Judd’s book provides an excellent illustration of the
effects of Darnton’s communication circuit within Renaissance music theory. That is, her book
focuses on the changes in authorship that resulted from writers about music becoming self-aware
as consumers and readers of printed music. Judd’s research suggests many avenues for further
study of the nature of Renaissance books about music. This dissertation complements Judd’s
work by addressing two of these. First, I emphasize the importance of non-authorial readership in
shaping the development of Renaissance music discourse. What was the social function of books
about music after they left the printer’s shop? How did writers about music adapt to the prospect
of writing for new and unknown audiences? Second, I locate Renaissance books about music
within a material culture wherein form and content are inextricably linked in the production of
meaning. Inspired by Judd’s early advocacy of a materialist approach within musicology, I
propose a conceptual shift away from considering texts as transmitters of ideas and toward
examining books as material objects. In what ways did authors and printers communicate

meaning nonverbally through the physical and bibliographical forms of their books? How did
readers interact with these forms?
Readership and materiality have emerged as important areas of research within
musicology. In response to the flourishing of marginalia studies in other areas of Renaissance
history, a number of music scholars have considered readership and annotations in Renaissance
music books.51 Studies of booklists and libraries have drawn attention to collectors of historical
importance, but rarely consider how the contents of these libraries witness the specific reading
habits of their owners.52 A recent monograph by David Greer surveys a broad corpus of early
English printed music, outlining the kinds of marks left behind by particular groups of readers.53
An article by Richard Wistreich calls attention to the rigors of musical reading practice by
exploring how musicians interacted with notation (in print and manuscript) in the act of
performance.54 The recent spate of scholarship on Heinrich Glarean includes several pathbreaking studies on the subject of marginalia in books about music. The most notable of these is
the essay coauthored by Inga Mai Groote, Bernhard Kölbl, and Susan Forscher Weiss, which
provides evidence for Glarean’s lecture notes in the form of annotations in his students’
textbooks.55 Furthermore, Weiss has outlined a broad approach to understanding marginalia in

Renaissance music textbooks.56 The primary limitation of this research is its intensive restriction
to sources annotated heavily by well-known, or at least identifiable, figures. I build on this
research by considering a wider range of sources, including those annotated in varying degrees
and by lesser-known and even anonymous figures. I thus show how developments in printing
technology shaped the ways that books about music were read, sketching out a basic background
for Renaissance notions of musical readership and literacy that has not been attempted
previously. This study will complement recent work by Adam Whittaker on the intersection of
reading history and musical exemplarity and in medieval music theory.57
Music scholars also have focused attention on the role that books of music played in
Renaissance material culture. A 2012 issue of the journal Renaissance Studies was devoted to the
subject of musical materials and cultural spaces. In his introduction to the issue, Richard
Wistreich argues for the importance of attending to the material features of music books:
For all their highly specialized attributes, then, it should now be clear that music
books are nevertheless deeply embroiled in the full complexity of book culture,
and thus subject to the entire range of materialities that constitute the “new
bibliographical” dimension and its discourses. Music books are in many ways just
like other kinds of books, and not just in their outward form: like any other
written or printed texts, they are material products of, and participants in,
particular geographical, social, political and intellectual structures; and as such,
they are thus potent sources for the investigation of many kinds of “cultural
spaces.”58
For Wistreich, the material features of music books have the potential to inform scholarly
conceptions of the material features of all books. Kirsten Gibson’s article in the same issue
provides a case in point, showing how the copious front and back matter in John Dowland’s First

Booke of Songes or Ayres shaped its readers’ understandings of the music by placing the book in
specific sociocultural contexts.59 I seek to extend this area of inquiry to books about music;
because they consisted mostly of prose, such authorial constraints on readers are far more
pervasive in books about music than in books of music.
In two recent books, Kate van Orden aims to consolidate much of this recent scholarship
on the intersections of Renaissance music, material culture, and the history of the book. In
Music, Authorship, and the Book in the First Century of Print (2014), van Orden traces how
notions of musical authorship developed alongside the advent and maturation of music printing.
She examines in particular “the factors that conjoined to separate ‘composers’ from other
musicians and turn them into the ‘authors’ that are so central to our histories [of Renaissance
music].”60 Particularly of note is her attempt to revise author-centric historical narratives within
musical scholarship, suggesting instead books as a profitable site for investigating historical
change. Van Orden takes up this challenge in Materialities: Books, Readers, and the Chanson in
Sixteenth-Century Europe (2015), which traces the production and reception of printed sixteenthcentury chansonniers along the communications circuit, considering how such books were
designed to accommodate the needs of their owners, which included professional musicians,
amateur singers and instrumentalists, and interested non-musicians.61 Van Orden emphasizes the
material alterity of Renaissance books of music, which stood apart from other kinds of books in
their distribution of polyphonic musical texts into separate spaces on the page and even into
different volumes. I follow van Orden’s embrace of readership, investigating how the pages of

van Orden, Materialities, 34 does mention the communications circuit explicitly, although it is not a central

books about music preserve interactions among their authors, printers, and readers. I propose that
the material qualities of books about music merged the material qualities of books of music and
of other books, allowing us to draw more meaningful connections between all kinds of books
during the Renaissance.
This body of musicological literature is premised on the work of book historians and
bibliographers who have examined the impact of printing technology on discourse during the
Renaissance. Lucien Febvre’s and Henri-Jean Martin’s L’apparition du livre (1958, translated as
The Coming of the Book, 1976) introduced the argument that printing technology dramatically
shaped the nature of the written word, and that the medium of print restructured the nature of
thought and writing. Marshal McLuhan argued further that printing technology effected
fundamental changes on language itself (e.g., “typography tended to alter language from a means
of perception and exploration to a portable commodity”).62 Walter Ong provided more nuanced
arguments that writing restructures consciousness and that the advent of printing technology led
to a dominance of literate culture.63 Elizabeth L. Eisenstein’s The Printing Press as an Agent of
Change: Communications and Cultural Transformations in Early-Modern Europe (1979)
encapsulated this previous scholarship, demonstrating the role that printing technology played in
various social, intellectual, and political changes such as the humanist classical revival, earlymodern science, and the Reformation. Although scholars have accepted the general premise that
printing technology changed something in writers and readers, exactly what was transformed and

the nature of this transformation have been serious points of contention.64 Even basic
nomenclature—“book,” “literacy,” and “print,” for example—remains problematic.65 Despite
their clear heuristic value, binary oppositions also have presented challenges, especially orality
versus literacy and print versus manuscript.66 Indeed, a few scholars have suggested that the
advent of printing technology has been overemphasized to the detriment of, for example,
medieval scriptoria or the acceptance of the codex (as opposed to the scroll) during the fourth
century.67
Integrating McLuhan’s and Ong’s lines of reasoning with bibliographical study, Paul F.
Grendler has argued for a close relationship between the material form a book and its content.68
Subsequent scholarship has shown that these relationships resist neat categorization. For
example, Joseph A. Dane has suggested that the meaning behind correlations of form and content
has been overstated, demonstrating both that small-format editions (octavo and duodecimo) were
not necessarily cheaper to produce, and that gothic and italic typefaces were not more
economical to set than roman equivalents.69 In any case, the notion that the form of a book
shaped or constrained the actions and thoughts of those who interacted with it remains an

important and underexplored principle.70 As Roger Chartier puts it, “any comprehension of a text
is necessarily dependent on a knowledge of the material forms it has taken.”71
This study considers for the first time Renaissance books about music from the
bibliographical perspective of book history. I show that books about music manifest important
developments in the material forms of Renaissance books writ large. Many such developments in
books about music—for example, the forms of title pages, the presentation of illustrative
material and its integration with prose, and textual constraints on reading—closely follow, and
even anticipate, similar developments in books on other subjects. In other words, books about
music pioneered solutions to problems in shaping the material forms of Renaissance books. This
inverts a familiar trope in musicological scholarship, which proposes that music was a latecomer
to the press. Instead, I show that books about music were among the earliest significant
illustrated books on technical subjects, and even pushed the boundaries of what could be
illustrated. Furthermore, as hybrids between books that contained either music or prose, books
about music provide meaningful connections between the two, which allows the subject of music
to assume a greater role in the history of the book. Finally, surviving copies of books about
music witness the struggles between authors, printers, and readers, which provide an unusually
vivid case-study for the ways that learning and communication took place through printed books
during the Renaissance.

Chapter overviews
This dissertation considers how different members of the communications circuit shaped and
were shaped by a core repertory of texts by seven authors: Ghiselin Danckerts, Franchinus
Gaffurius, Heinrich Glarean, Vicente Lusitano, Oratio Tigrini, Nicola Vicentino, and Gioseffo
Zarlino. Chapters two through four examine in turn each member of the communications circuit.
Each of these chapters is divided roughly in half. The first half surveys generally how these
groups of individuals shaped the material, bibliographical forms of books about music. The
second half considers specific books about music in detail, placing them in more localized social
contexts—the author’s desk, the printer’s shop, and the reader’s study.
Chapter two considers books about music from the perspective of their authors. I begin
with a summary of the textual and material evolution of Renaissance books about music,
considering their characteristic features. I then explore the role of print in the famous debate
between Lusitano and Vicentino. I show how the works of Lusitano, Vicentino, and Danckerts (a
judge in the debate) served each party in different ways and how the reception of their works was
conditioned by the material forms they assumed. Finally, I consider the transformation of
Gioseffo Zarlino’s Le istitutioni harmoniche through three editions, showing how it only
gradually adapted to reader expectations about the shape of printed books. By showing how
publication strategies built on complex, multilayered balances of risk and reward, this chapter
offers a complementary perspective to recent scholarship on the publishing habits of Renaissance
musicians of various kinds.72

Chapter three considers books about music from the perspective of their printers, broadly
conceived. The chapter focuses on the ways that printers brought together authors and readers
through design, typography, and marketing. I begin by proposing three archetypal designs for the
layouts of books about music, showing how these signaled information to prospective buyers and
readers about a book’s intended audience, literary genre, and social or regional context. I then
explore the struggles to print scores in books about music before 1580, examining the various
technical solutions employed to accomplish this feat of typography; this section complements a
recent essay by Christine Jeanneret that examines technologies for printing scores after 1580.73
Finally, I discuss the subject of marketing, outlining the specific techniques that printers used to
steer potential buyers to their music books. I provide both macroscopic analyses of entire
markets at Rome and Venice and a microscopic analysis of a single Venetian printer, Francesco
de’ Franceschi Senese (Zarlino’s printer of choice). I argue that books about music, by virtue of
their hybridity between music and prose, helped to differentiate their printers’ brands and niche
audiences. The unifying theme of this chapter is the conveyance of meaning nonverbally on the
printed page.
Chapter four considers books about music from the perspective of their readers. The
chapter begins with two sections that outline broad patterns in the ownership and use of books
about music. These sections present evidence to answer longstanding questions about
Renaissance books about music. Who typically owned them? How did readers use them? On the
basis of this evidence of how readers used their books about music, I provide a new assessment
of musical literacy during the Renaissance, focusing on the ways that readers derived meaning
from musical examples. I propose four broad functions for musical examples, diverse ways of

construing meaning from the perspective of aesthetic reader response. These functions call for a
rethinking of what it meant to read musical notation during the Renaissance.
Chapter five ties together the various strands considered in the previous chapters by
showing how individuals along the communications circuit blended their roles as authors,
printers, and readers as they participated in early-modern print culture. I also consider the
broader ramifications of a book-historical approach to future scholarship on Renaissance music
and print culture. Three appendices provide supplementary information. Appendix one
establishes a contextual foundation for the central authors whose works are considered
throughout the dissertation. This appendix outlines their lives and participation in book culture,
highlighting new discoveries about their interwoven careers; it will also be a useful reference for
readers unfamiliar with their biographies. Appendices two and three provide overarching surveys
of the corpus of Renaissance printed books about music. Appendix two analyzes the
chronological and geographical dissemination of writing about music in print, showing how
many books were published during any given five-year period and in which cities. Appendix
three presents information about early owners, readers, and references to a total of 224
Renaissance books about music, drawing from provenance records in library catalogs, scholarly
accounts of individual libraries, and my own survey of exemplars in several major repositories.
Both appendices provide crucial evidence for statistical and bibliographical analyses given in
each chapter.

CHAPTER TWO: AUTHORS

“Little book, you will go without me—and I grudge it not—to the city, whither alas your master
is not allowed to go!”1 Ovid begins his Tristia, a collection of autobiographical letters written in
exile, with an exhortation to his own book. The poet instructs his book in vivid language about
its intended path toward Rome and desired imperial audience. He begins by comparing the
aspects of the book of exile and the book of good omen:
Go, but go unadorned, as becomes the book of an exile; in your misfortune wear
the garb that befits these days of mine. You shall have no cover dyed with the
juice of purple berries—no fit color is that for mourning; your title shall not be
tinged with vermillion nor your pages with oil of cedar; and you shall wear no
white bosses upon your dark edges. Books of good omen should be decked with
such things as these; ’tis my fate that you should bear in mind. Let no brittle
pumice polish your two edges; I would have you appear with locks all rough and
disordered. Be not ashamed of blots; he who sees them will feel that they were
caused by my tears.2
Renaissance printed books are much like Ovid’s book of exile, sent into the world to face new,
uncertain, and unforeseen circumstances. Unlike Ovid, however, their authors aimed to fashion
books of good omen, works well suited in form and content to the customs of their readers.
Books about music followed this trend, sometimes explicitly so. Franchinus Gaffurius begins his

and banish grave cares of the mind. But if you are rejected you will suffer a
shameful fate and I will say: never reenter our portals.4

This chapter explores the perspectives of authors of Renaissance books about music, considering
how they adapted to the medium of print in varying ways. I begin with an overview of the
material and textual transformation that books about music underwent with the advent of printing
technology. I pay particular attention to distinctive textual and paratextual apparatuses, including
title pages, colophons, visual decoration, indices, textual segmentation, and marginal
annotations. In viewing these apparatuses as sites of social exchange between authors, printers,
and readers, I echo the thinking of Roger Chartier:
Understanding the reasons and the effects of such physical devices (for the printed
book) as format, page layout, the way in which the text is broken up, the
conventions governing its typographical presentation, and so forth, necessarily
refers back to the control that the authors but sometimes the publishers exercised
over the forms charged with expressing intention, orienting reception, and
constraining interpretation.5

I argue that these framing and organizational devices demonstrate how engineering books of
good omen significantly changed how books about music were conceived as printed objects, and
furthermore how music was conceived as a field of inquiry. An exploration of the writings that
emerged in the wake of the debate between Nicola Vicentino and Vicente Lusitano shows how
these transformations were deployed in practice by three different actors with very different endresults. An assessment of Gioseffo Zarlino’s Le istitutioni harmoniche through three different
editions shows its author developed, transformed, and improved a single work by perfecting its
manner of presentation.

The evolution of music theory books as printed objects
It is widely asserted that music was a latecomer to the field of printing.6 In chapter one, I
examined the early development of books about music, which began to appear alongside books
of liturgical music three decades before Ottaviano Petrucci’s first books appeared in 1501.7 In
other words, books about music adapted to the medium of print much more quickly than books
of music; that is, in a way that scholars have yet consider, books about music set the agenda for
how books of music operated in the marketplace. Printed books about music, long considered to
behave categorically differently than printed books of music, assumed a significant role in
shaping how musicians worked in and for the medium of print. In this section, I survey the
transformation of music theory books as printed objects, examining the features that distinguish

6

For a recent rehearsal of this argument, see van Orden, Music, Authorship, and the Book, 19–22. Iain Fenlon,
“Music, Print, and Society,” 281–83 refines this line of argument to refer to the realization of a broader market
potential for printed music, not its technical introduction or maturation.

them from their manuscript counterparts.8 This will lay the groundwork for an examination of
individual deployments of printing technology by several musicians.

Framing devices: Title pages, colophons, and visual decoration
The most significant development in books about music was the maturation of the title page,
which followed broader trends in the development of title pages in general.9 The earliest such
books began simply with a short description of the book’s contents. Nicolò Burzio’s treatise on
music (1487) begins with a lengthy heading that describes its author, subject, and reason for
composition:
Nicolai Burtij parmenſis: muſices profeſſoris: ac | iuris pontificij ſtudioſiſſimi:
muſices opuſculuʒ inci | pit: cum defenſione Guidonis aretini: aduerſus que | dam
hyſpanum veritatis prevaricatorem.10
By Nicolò Burzio of Parma, professor of music and most learned pontifical jurist,
a short work about music [Musices opusculum], which begins with a defense of
Guido of Arezzo against a certain, truly apostate Spaniard.
Two features of this book’s title are especially noteworthy: its position within the first gathering
and its particular wording. The first gathering of the book begins with a blank leaf, with the text
starting on the second leaf (i.e., third page) of the first gathering. Margaret M. Smith has shown
that, before around 1500, most books began with a blank leaf that served two functions.11
Practically speaking, the first leaf was the most fragile because it was typically the most handled;
leaving it blank meant that its loss would not incur damage to the book. The blank leaf was also a

The framing of this section, especially in terms of the devices mentioned, is indebted to Richardson, Printing,
Writers and Readers, 122–35.

conceit to collectors who preferred to decorate their printed books with more fanciful title pages,
as if they were manuscripts. Indeed, the printer of Burzio’s Musices opusculum, like many other
Italian printers of the late incunabular period, left other blank spaces for the book to be decorated
by hand.12
This is technically not a true title but an incipit; that is, an explanation of how the text
begins. The title often attributed to the book, Musices opusculum, is not a title at all, but simply a
descriptive phrase from the incipit (“a short work about music”). At this stage, Burzio, like many
other authors, apparently did not discern a need to provide a title or some sort of handle for
referring to the book itself.13 Elizabeth L. Eisenstein has argued that this tendency reflects an
interiority on the part of manuscript authors, concerned more with producing texts than with their
use and reception; for Eisenstein, an important feature of nascent print culture is the attempt to
find convenient and efficacious ways to refer an author’s works.14
Colophons, unlike title pages, were a venerated tradition of manuscript books carried
over by the printers of incunabula and cinquecentine.15 The colophon was a brief description of
the facts of publication, such as the place of publication, the printer and any publishers (i.e.,
financers or underwriters), and date of publication. Colophons also sometimes preserve

12

This is how Franchinus Gaffurius tended to decorate his books. Ramis, Musica practica (1482) begins with a
blank leaf and contains spaces for initial capitals. (Incidentally, Ramis is the Spaniard to whom Burzio responds in
his treatise.) Gaffurius added to his copy (I-Bc, shelfmark A.80) a descriptive title on the blank leaf (“BARTOLOM.
RAMI de PAREIA hisp. | DE MUSICA | TRACTATUS.” sig. a1r) and decorative initial capitals and rubrication in
red and blue ink. A highly decorative capital letter H (sig. a3r) uses several shades of red, blue, purple, white, and
green ink.

13
Meconi, “Petrucci’s Mass Prints,” make a similar point about music printing with regard to the practice of naming
of compositions and books of music.
14

Eisenstein, Printing Press, 52 and 168. Chartier, The Order of Books, 55 argues further that reproductive
technologies (whether manuscript or print) compromised the “direct and authentic relation between the author and
the reader.”

information about the author’s biography or the identity of any other craftsmen who contributed
to the making of a volume. Burzio’s Musices opusculum contains a colophon representative of
early printed music theory books:
Impēſis Bn̄ dicti librarij bonon̄ . ac ſuma induſtria | Ugonis de rugerijs: qui
propatiſſimus huius artis | exactor imp̄ ſſus Bonōie. An̄ o dn̄ i .m.cccc.lxxxvij. | die
vltima aprilis.16
Printed at Bologna with the highest industry by Ugo Ruggerio, a most skilled
master of this art, at the expense of the Bolognese bookseller Benedetto, in the
year of our Lord 1487 on the last day of April.
This example identifies the printer, underwriter, place and date of publication, and provides the
briefest of biographical sketches for these figures.
Johannes Tinctoris’ Terminorum musiace diffinitorium (c. 1495) reflects a later stage in
the development of these framing devices. The title page of the Terminorum typifies the basic
form of title pages found in many Renaissance books about music. The book begins on the first
leaf of the first gathering with a proper title page, a self-contained page that contains a real title,
that is, a heading that refers to the book itself:
TERMINORVM | MVSICÆ | DIFFINITORIVM ::17
A Dictionary of Musical Terms
In this case, the title page has become an integral component of the book as a physical object.
Tinctoris’ Diffinitorium is unusual in its lack of a colophon, which has raised questions about the

16

Burzio, Musices opusculum (1487), sig. I4r. The identity of the underwriter, one Bolognese bookman named
Benedetto, remains uncertain. Duggan, Italian Music Incunabula, 203 suggests Benedetto Faelli, a bookseller
(libraio) who fits the profile. Burzio, Bononia illustrata (1494) was printed by Francesco Benedetto, another
possible candidate for the underwriter. Ibid., sig. E6r defends the accuracy of Benedetto’s editions: “Si quid tamen
in eo mendae et erroris isertum fuerit: non impressoris negligentia: sed potius famulorum incuria pretermissum
putes.” “Should anything faulty or erroneous have been inserted in it, you must think it was overlooked, not by any
neglect of the printer, but rather by the carelessness of his workmen.” Translation from Pollard, Essay on
Colophons, 74.

circumstances surrounding its printing and publication.18 This basic form of the title page would
come to be embellished in the following decades with various additions. The most common of
these additions to the title page are the facts of publication formerly reserved for the colophon,
namely the identity of the printer or publisher and the place and date of publication. Through the
beginning of the seventeenth century, the facts of publication are given with equal frequency on
the title page or in the back of the volume in the colophon, sometimes in both places.
Another common addition to the title page was a description of the volume’s contents. In
some cases, these are simple, prosaic descriptions of a work’s subject matter. In other cases,
these are lengthy, imaginative listings of a work’s appealing attributes. These two possibilities
represent the extremes of a spectrum of possibilities borne of commercial necessity. Just as titles
emerged with the need to have a handy way to refer concretely to a work, descriptions of
contents allowed a book’s potential buyer to see at a glance what was in the book without having
to leaf through or read it. An example of a simple description of subject matter comes from the
full title of Oratio Tigrini’s treatise:
IL | COMPENDIO | DELLA MVSICA | NEL QVALE BREVEMENTE SI
TRATTA | Dell’Arte del Contrapunto, | DIVISO IN QVATRO LIBRI. | DEL R. M.

The compendium of music, in which the art of counterpoint is discussed briefly,
divided into four books, by the reverend Messer Oratio Tigrini, canon of Arezzo,
newly composed and published with privilege at Venice, 1588 by Ricciardo
Amadino.

This example provides the prospective buyer with information about the author, his
qualifications, and the book’s basic subject and organization. A contrasting example of a more
fanciful description of contents comes from the second edition of Gioseffo Zarlino’s treatise:
ISTITVTIONI | HARMONICHE | DEL REV. MESSERE | GIOSEFFO

The Istitutioni harmoniche, by the reverend Messer Gioseffo Zarlino from
Chioggia, maestro di cappella of the Most Serene Republic of Venice, newly
improved in many places and expanded with many beautiful secrets about
practical matters. In which, beside subjects pertaining to music, are discussed
many passages by poets, historians, and philosophers, as one may see clearly by
reading it. With two tables, one that contains the principal subjects, and the other
the more noteworthy things to be found in the work. In Venice, by Francesco de’
Franceschi Senese, 1573.
Here the lengthy title acts in a capacity beyond a simple description of the book—it functions as
advertising copy, directing attention those features of the book other than its text and principal
subject. Later in this chapter, I will show that Zarlino’s Istitutioni underwent a number of further
paratextual changes, of which the title page was one small part. In this respect, the exigencies of
commerce played an important role in the material and textual evolution of printed books about
music during the Renaissance.
Visual decorations on the title page played a similar role in conveying the scope and
importance of a book’s contents. An early and enduring kind of decoration in Renaissance music

theory books was the portrait or representation of the author.21 The earliest example is
Franchinus Gaffurius’s Theoricum musice opus discipline (1480), which contains on its title page
a woodcut portrait of the author seated at the organ (figure A1.1); the illustration visually
represents the subject of music by superimposing the Guidonian gamut on the pipes of the organ.
This in fact was among the earliest title-page woodcuts in printed books of any kind; Gaffurius
was at the forefront of book-illustration in tying the portrait to the book’s subject matter.22 In
appendix one, I examine Gaffurius’s portraits in other editions of his works, showing that they
stood as representations of his authority. Many other Renaissance music theory books followed
Gaffurius’s lead by including portraits of their authors. Pietro Aaron’s Toscanello in musica
contains a woodcut portrait of the author teaching a roomful of students (figure 2.1), which is
modeled after the portrait of Gaffurius in his Angelicum (1508; cf. figure A1.3).23 Aaron is seated
on a platform wearing academic regalia, his right hand propped under his chin and his left hand
grasping a book atop his knee. There is no doubt as to his identity; he is seated below a banderole
inscribed with his name. Behind the author is a bookshelf with four large tomes visible; the
remaining volumes are covered by a curtain—all of these symbols of the exclusivity of the
teacher’s knowledge. Directly in front of Aaron is a bench with a viola da braccio, lute, small
recorder, and two small, closed volumes (one oblong, one upright). The architectural and floral
borders lend the scene an air of classical nobility, reinforced by the seemingly aloof, impassive

21

Fenlon, “Music, Print, and Society,” 296 attributes the increase in woodcut portraits of composers and musicians
to their popularity in theory treatises. Eisenstein, Printing Press, 232–35 traces the development of author portraits
in Renaissance books in general.

22

Richardson, Printing, Writers and Readers, 132–35 identifies sporadic examples as early as 1467, noting that
woodcut illustrations did not become common until after 1490. Hind, History of Woodcut, 405 and 516–18
contextualizes Gaffurius’s books within the vanguard of Neapolitan and Milanese book illustration.
23

The portrait of Aaron is discussed in Vendrix, “La dialectique de l’image et du text,” 108–110.

Vitali, 1529), sig. a4v.

expression on Aaron’s face. The heads of eleven students are apparent, but only four faces are
visible. Of these, only one looks at his teacher. Similar examples of books with author portraits
include Stefano Vanneo’s Recanetum de musica aurea (1533) Aaron’s Lucidario in musica
(1545), Adrian Petit Coclio’s Compendium musices (1552), and Vicentino’s L’antica musica
(1555).
The title page of Heinrich Glarean’s Dodecachordon (1547) compactly abstracts its
intellectual content (figure 2.2). Below the identification of the work’s author and Greek title is a
representation of the modal system that the book expounds. The left-hand column records the
names of the plagal modes, the right-hand column the authentic modes. In small type are the
alternate names of the modes given by Apuleius, Martianus Capella, Porphyry of Tyre, Angelo
Poliziano, and Claudius Ptolemy. Seven modes are given in each column, corresponding to the
seven possible species of diapason; asterisks by the hyperphrygian and hyperaeolian modes
indicate their rejection from Glarean’s system. The title page of the Dodecachordon thus
encapsulates the basic thesis of the book, much as lengthy prose descriptions came to stand for
an advertisement of a book’s contents and arguments. The clarity with which Glarean visually
distilled his theories stands as a reminder of his status as an outlier among Renaissance authors
of books about music—as Laurenz Lütteken notes, he “was neither a musician nor a music
theorist, but a humanist” with a uniquely scholarly interest in music.24
Other forms of visual decoration on title pages functioned similarly to forecast their
books’ contents. Especially well known is the mythological representation of the cosmos on the
title page of the first edition of Franchinus Gaffurius’s Practica musicae (1496), analyzed

24

extensively by James Haar and Claude V. Palisca.25 The edition of the same work published at
Venice in 1512 contains a large woodcut illustration of a monastic choir singing chant before an
enormous book placed on a lectern. It remains unclear whether the figure standing at the base of
the lectern or the diminutive seated figure holding a small book is meant to be Gaffurius; both
figures bear a passing resemblance to other portraits of Gaffurius. Similar scenes of musicmaking, but of a domestic variety, are found on the title pages of Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontega’s
Opera intitulata Fontegara (1535) and Regola rubertina (1542), which depict a group of two
singers and three recorder players gathered around oblong music books placed on a table
(Fontegara) and two men playing viole da gamba and two men singing from a single oblong
music book held by one of the men (Regola). Ganassi’s model seems to be the humorous scenes
of Andrea Antico’s Canzoni novi (RISM 1510) and Frottole intabulate da sonare organi (RISM
15173).26
Title pages, colophons, and visual decorations established the essence of a book’s identity
as a printed object. Printing technology allowed writers of books about music to see their works
from an external perspective, one detached from the embodied experience of their own
handwriting or the familiar appearance the working manuscript or fair copy. These framing
devices afforded authors and printers an opportunity to imbue their works with distinctive visual
and bibliographical profiles.

Organizational devices: Indices, textual segmentation, and marginal annotation
Changes to the framing of books about music were accompanied by changes in their
organization. The introduction of indices, textual segmentation, and marginal annotations
profoundly shaped the organization of books and the ideas contained in them.27 At first glance,
these might seem surface features, mere adornments to the textual main attraction. But their
introduction, standardization, and internalization demonstrate an important change in authors’
mindsets. I will show later in this chapter that, as these devices became common among printed
books, authors of books about music began to craft new works around them.
Indices, like title-page descriptions, allowed prospective buyers to know what was in a
book without having to read it. One type of index, the table of contents, was a traditional part of
many manuscripts. Because the table of contents was a simple, sequential listing of a book’s
material, it was easy to produce. The earliest printed treatises begin with tables of contents. The
first gathering of a book typically was the last printed, and a list of contents with page references
was possible only after the body of the text had been printed. This was convenient for printers,
too, who typically needed several pages of material to fill out a first gathering that would
otherwise only contain the first page. Gaffurius’s Theorica, a lengthy folio volume, provides an
instructive example. The structure of the first gathering, which is unsigned, is as follows:28

27

Eisenstein, Printing Press, 71–159 gives a general account of this idea.

28

In this and the following gathering diagrams, each horizontal line represents a leaf. The contents of the recto and
verso are listed, respectively, above and below this line. Conjugate leaves are connected with vertical lines. In other
words, the diagram represents what the gathering might look like from the bottom edge of the book.

48

Title page, portrait of Gaffurius
Errata
Table of contents

Dedication

Poem “ad lectorem”
In this case, only the errata relies on details from the rest of the book, as the table of contents
does not provide page references, but merely listing each book and its chapter headings. The
gathering consists entirely of material designed to frame and to organize the book as a whole,
which properly begins with the second gathering (signed as a). From the author’s perspective,
only the title page and dedication were strictly necessary; the additional material seems designed
to fill out the gathering. All of these features, however, provided valuable services for the
potential reader, giving an accurate idea of the book’s scope and contents after being drawn in by
the large woodcut illustration on the title page. At least in principle, preliminary gatherings such
as this one also could have functioned as advertising brochures for their books.29 This would
have been convenient for the bookseller, who needed only to place this gathering of two sheets
on the shelves, while leaving the remaining thirty-two sheets in the storeroom or warehouse.
Although tables of contents continued to have a place of honor in writings about music, a
new type of index emerged as an important tool for authors and readers of longer works—the
alphabetical subject index. The subject index has a different modus operandi than the table of
contents, placing at the top level of organizational hierarchy the subject itself rather than its
sequence within the book. Such an index is more difficult to make, for several reasons. An
alphabetical index requires the compiler to proceed exactingly through the volume, recording

29

McKerrow, Introduction to Bibliography, 88–95; and Corns, “The Early Modern Search Engine.”

49

both subject and page references. Then the compiler must alphabetize these. Early instances of
subject indices and alphabetical tables of contents are notably imprecise, which yield insight into
the techniques that compilers used to make such indices. For example, the compiler of the
alphabetical table of contents in Petrucci’s Harmonice musices odhecaton A probably partitioned
some scratch paper into sections for each letter of the alphabet, then proceeded through the
printed sheets or cast-off copy (manuscript prepared for typesetting) and recorded titles of
compositions in the order that they occurred. As a result, the alphabetization is only approximate;
for example, the first alphabetical index begins as follows: “Ave maria. folio iiii | Amours
amours xii | Adieu mes amours xvii | Amours amours amours xxvi.”30 One finds all the
compositions beginning with the letter A, or any other letter, in the order that they appear in the
book. The same holds true for many other similar indices in writings about music, most notably
the subject index of Zarlino’s Istitutioni harmoniche (1573), which I will examine later in this
chapter.
An alphabetical subject index analyzes the book in question. The mindset of its compiler
is very different than that of its author, concerned more with segmentation and organization than
with continuity and cohesion. I suggest here that as authors of books about music increasingly
came to use indices as readers, and perhaps even to create ones for their own works, they began
to produce texts that naturally lent themselves to this kind of indexing. The resultant effect is one
of bursts of topical clarity rather than of winding disquisition. Indices of all kinds thus functioned
as finding aids for authors and readers.31 Moreover, subject indices provided an opportunity for

30

Harmonice musices odhecaton A (RISM 1501), sig. A2v. The book has two alphabetical indices, one for
compositions in four voices and one for compositions in three voices.

authors and printers to showcase different, unexpected aspects of their books. The subject index
of Zarlino’s Istitutioni harmoniche (1573), for example, explicitly highlights the “more
noteworthy things” found in the volume, lending a more attractive character to the study of
music. For example, Zarlino’s index contains the following entries: “The sea, not without music,
page 9” and “Medicine, not too different from music, page 8.”32 In the creation of indices,
authors and printers mirrored contemporary reading practices and anticipated the use of their
creations; owners of manuscripts and unindexed printed books had long compiled their own
indices and bound or tucked them in the fronts and backs of volumes.33 Supplying these
apparatuses preprinted made the book more approachable and usable, and thus more appealing to
buyers.
The uniformity imposed by typography could be a bane as well as a boon. Entire pages of
undigested prose appear as an intimidating, impenetrable blanket of text. Renaissance music
theorists were fortunate to inherit a tradition of writing that encouraged, and even required, the
use of examples. Such examples broke up the visual monotony of the page and offered readers
welcome vantage points for scanning and reading the text. At the same time, music was a
difficult subject to write about clearly, and many opted for prolixity in the face of the
imprecision necessary when writing about such a numinous, evanescent phenomenon. I propose
that, as Renaissance authors of books about music, like their contemporaries in other subject

areas, rethought the local and global organization of their works, they began to segment their
texts into smaller units and to mark these visually by various means.34
Most authors of lengthier treatises employed multiple levels of hierarchical organization.
Entire works are divided into books or parts, parts into chapters, and chapters sometimes into
paragraphs; even within the sometimes tortuous Latinate syntax that dominated every written
European language, sentences emerged over time as cognizable units of composition and
organization. Consider, for example, Burzio’s Musices opusculum (1487) and Tigrini’s
Compendio (1588). Both are quarto-sized publications pitched as textbook-style introductions to
musical practice. Obviously, being separated by a century’s time, their approaches to musical
practice and manners of presentation are very different. But as transmitters of texts, they are
crafted in much the same way. The two books have roughly equivalent lengths, 134 and 146
pages of text respectively.35 Burzio’s treatise contains 63 sections of text.36 Tigrini’s treatise has
112 sections of text.37 This reflects an increase of 78 percent in the number of sections per book,
and a decrease of 64 percent in the number of pages per section (from 2.13 pages to 1.30 pages).
It should be mentioned that Tigrini’s treatise contains extensive illustrative material on 101
pages, whereas Burzio’s treatise contains illustrative material on only nine pages; adjusting the

figures accordingly would dramatize the statistical difference in their segmentation and
organization. Burzio’s and Tigrini’s books provide representative examples of a general increase
in the importance of textual segmentation for books about music during the course of the
Renaissance. Moreover, these two books also furnish an especially vivid illustration of the
changes in discursive approaches and technological and illustrative possibilities that had opened
up over the course of a century.
Sections of text often are marked visually. The simplest method is the addition of
whitespace between sections, whether in the form of indentation at the start of a section or
additional leading before and after sections. Chapters and other major sections are often marked
by initials capitals, whether simple drop caps or more ornate historiated, floral, or otherwise
decorative capitals. In addition to breaking up the page, such initial capitals allowed printers to
brand the book, as initial capitals often formed part of a house style.38 Although chapters had
been numbered since their introduction in classical antiquity, the Renaissance witnessed the
invention of chapter titles, brief headings that described their content or argument.39 These
provided a further opportunity for authors and printers to set off sections so as to make each page
visually apprehensible to readers. I suggest that, as authors became accustomed to writing in
chapters and titling them, these sections became more coherent and focused in content.
Furthermore, authors began to contemplate the sequence of sections and their combination into
parts or books, occasionally even writing rationales for the organizations of their books.

Printed marginal annotations were another tool that broke up the page visually. These are
short phrases that appear in the outer margins beside certain passages. As the precursor to the
modern footnote, they fall into at least three important categories outlined by Anthony Grafton.40
The first kind is the keyword, a word or short phrase meant to summarize the section next to
which it is placed. These are most common in Renaissance books about music printed before
around 1540. After 1540, increased use of tables of contents and increased segmentation seem to
have rendered marginal keywords obsolete. Marginal keywords mimicked the practices of
contemporary readers, who added marginal keywords in manuscript to help them track the
progression of ideas, especially midsection (see chapter four). I interpret the use of printed
keywords as an early concession to readers, another organizational device that helped them wend
their way through texts with minimal puzzlement and exertion.
Citations and references to authorities are Grafton’s second category of printed
marginalia. These were an early addition to printed writings about music, appearing prominently
in Gaffurius’s Practica (1496) to label all of the authorities and composers discussed in text. In
this instance, the marginal citations highlight the cosmopolitan scope of the author’s learnedness,
ranging from ancient Greek authors like Aristotle (still knowingly tagged as “Philosophus”) and
Boethius, to medieval writers like Guido of Arezzo and Franco of Cologne, and more recent
theorists like Johannes Tinctoris and Prosdocimus de Beldemandis. Gaffurius managed even to
namedrop such venerated composers as Josquin des Prez, Guillaume Dufay, John Dunstable,
Heinrich Isaac, Jacob Obrecht, and Johannes Ockeghem, among several others. During the
sixteenth century, such citations became increasingly exact, listing not merely the author, but
also the name of the work discussed with section or page references. The most extensive

54

citations emphasize the perspectives of multiple sources on a single topic, highlighting the
diffusion of knowledge that printing technology enabled. Tigrini’s Compendio is perhaps the
best example of this, containing on most pages precise citations to the works of Gaffurius,
Vicentino, and Zarlino. Whatever Tigrini’s motivations for his copious annotations, they bear
witness to the availability to a single reader of a wide range of musical thinking through the
medium of printed books.
Commentaries are Grafton’s final category of printed marginalia. These provide more
discursive observations about the text, quoting from sources cited, clarifying potentially obscure
points, or providing more idiomatic or literal translations of passages in different languages.
Marginal commentaries are relatively rare in Renaissance writings about music, perhaps because
the act of commentary was already so deeply enmeshed in the conventions of writing about
music. Thomas Morley’s A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597) presents
one of the few instances of this practice in a Renaissance music theory treatise. The margins of
most pages are lightly peppered with printed marginalia, many of them extraordinarily detailed.
The majority are keywords and citations, for example: “A general rule for midle notes in
Ligatures,” “Exception,” “Finall notes in Legatures,” and “Prickt notes in Ligature” (all p. 11);
and “Franchinus op. mus. it. trac. 3. cap. 2,” “Lossius. lib. 2. cap 4,” and “Peter Aron
Tuscanello” (all p. 13).41 Occasional marginal commentaries provide points of clarification and
further explanation: “Proportion of the more inaequalitie doth in Musicke alwaies signifie
diminution” (p. 27) and “The parts must be close, so that no other may be put in betwixt them”
(p. 146). Morley reserved longer commentaries for a separate section at the back of the book,

41

Morley’s exact references are to Gaffurius, Theorica (1492), book 3, chapter 2 (sig. D4v–D5r); Lucas Lossius,
Erotemata musicae (1563), book 2, chapter 4 (sig. G8v–I1r); and Aaron, Toscanello in musica (1523), probably
book 1, chapter 6 (sig. B2v).

which he labels as “ANNOTATIONS necessary for the understanding of the Booke.” In the
introduction to this nineteen-page section, he lays out the rationale for its inclusion:
When I had ended my booke, and showne it (to be perused) to some of better skill
in letters then my selfe, I was by them requested, to give some contentment to the
learned, both by setting down a reason why I had disagreed from the opinion of
others, as also to explaine something, which in the booke it selfe might seeme
obscure. I have therefore thought it best to set downe in Annotations, such thinges
as in the text could not so commodiouslie be handled, for interrupting of the
continuall course of the matter, that both the young beginner shoulde not be
overladed with those things, which at the firste woulde be to hard for him to
conceive: and also that they who were more skilful, might have a reason for my
proceedings. I would therefore counsel the young scholler in Musicke, not to
intangle himselfe in the reading of these notes, til he have perfectly learned the
booke it selfe, or at least the first part thereof: for without the knowledge of the
booke, by reading of them, hee shal runne into such confusion, as hee shall not
know where to begin or where to leave. But thou (learned Reader) if thou find any
thing which shal not be to thy liking, in friendship advertise me that I may either
mend it, or scrape it out. And so I ende, protesting that Errare possum haereticus
esse nolo.42
Here Morley acknowledges directly how his annotations, both in the margins and in this selfcontained section, function for the benefit of advanced readers.43 At the same time, Morley’s
rationale makes explicit many of the imperatives of printed texts that authors of books about
music only gradually learned to negotiate: ease of understanding, linear and coherent
construction, and accessibility to a range of audiences.
Morley’s “Annotations” show how such paratextual features shaped the ways that readers
approached books, both in bookshops and in their studies, and how those who made them
conceived of them as printed objects. I interpret Morley’s rationale for these features as evidence
of one author anticipating the needs of his readers by shaping the text to conform to their

Morley, Introduction (1597), sig. χ1r. The Latin phrase at the end, an adage of St. Augustine, means, “I may fall
into error, but I will not plunge into heresy.”

42

43

The confinement of these annotations to three self-contained and non-alphabetically-signed gatherings after the
body of the book suggests that Morley may have shown printed main text to those “better skilled in letters” and
crafted the annotations as a preemptive response to any possible public negative reactions.

56

expectations. The accoutrements of the printed page were not mere changes to the surface of a
text, but integral parts of it. Like Ovid in exile, many authors faced, some for the first time, the
prospect of writing for an uncertain audience and escaping the immersive, isolated world of the
author’s working manuscript. I argue that acclimatizing to this mindset effected an important
shift in the ways that authors wrote about music. In the following sections, I trace this shift
through several case studies, showing how and why individual authors practically adapted their
works to the medium of print. In the following chapter, I will consider the complementary
perspective, how the medium of print adapted to books about music.

Taming the printed beast: Lusitano, Vicentino, and Danckerts
In appendix one, I outline the substance and trajectory of the acrimonious debate between
Vicente Lusitano and Nicola Vicentino, held at Rome in May and June 1551. In this section, I
explore in a more focused way the role of print in engineering the controversy and how three of
its participants—Lusitano, Vicentino, and Ghiselin Danckerts—exploited its aftermath. In short,
I will argue that Lusitano provoked the debate through the choreographed publication of his own
music; that both Lusitano and Vicentino capitalized on their newfound notoriety by publishing
music treatises to varying degrees of success; and that Danckerts, a newcomer to publishing,
struggled find a satisfactory overarching concept for his unpublished manuscript.

Lusitano’s “Regina coeli” (1551) and Introduttione (1553)
Most of Lusitano’s known compositions are preserved in a single collection of motets published
in 1551 at Rome by Valerio and Luigi Dorico (RISM L3091). The print, titled Liber primus
epigramatum, contains twenty-two Latin motets for five, six, and eight voices. An unusual
feature of the print is a motu proprio signed by Pope Julius III, appended to the tenor and sexta

57

pars partbooks, constituting in effect a copyright privilege. Privileges were standard legal
documents for protecting the contents of printed books during the sixteenth century.44 The motu
proprio specifically protects Lusitano’s ten-year license to print, sell, and distribute his collection
of motets, even prohibiting the Dorico firm from printing, selling, or distributing further copies
without Lusitano’s express permission.45 Several factors make this privilege unusual. First, the
scope of a privilege was circumscribed by the jurisdiction of the civic authority that granted it. In
crafting the legal document, the pope could specify its validity in any lands under his authority as
pope or as the civic leader of the Papal States. The language in the motu proprio is specific on
this point; this document was to be valid throughout the Catholic world, “for each and every
faithful Christian, equally in Italy and beyond.”46 Second, the stipulated punishment for violating
the privilege was comparatively strong. A typical punishment was a small fine and the
confiscation of all offending copies.47 In contrast, the punishment for violating Lusitano’s
privilege was the confiscation of illegal copies, a fine of two hundred ducats per each illegal
copy (one half payable to papal authorities, the other half to the composer), and

G4r (also in sexta partbook, sig. C4v).

47

Agee, “The Venetian Privilege,” 17 notes a typical fine in Venice of one or two ducats for each illegally-printed
copy. Due to the high cost of paper and labor, the customary seizure of a printer’s stock of even a single work was a
more effective deterrent against intellectual theft than a fine.

58

excommunication for any parties involved.48 Another contemporary book about music protected
by a papal privilege provides a useful point of contrast. The privilege for Diego Ortiz’s Trattado
de glosas sobra clausulas (1553 = RISM O136) likewise protected the composer for ten years,
but was valid only in the Italian Papal States and specified as punishment only the confiscation
of illegal copies.49 By its very presence and unusual nature, the motu proprio marks Lusitano’s
Liber primus epigramatum as a publication of special significance to the composer.
Barbosa has suggested credibly that the print my have constituted an attempt to gain
employment for Lusitano in the Papal Chapel.50 This seems likely, given the print’s dedication to
Lusitano’s patron, Dom Dinis de Lencastre (d. 1598), a lesser member of the Portuguese royalty,
Commander of the Military Order of Christ (a Portuguese branch of the Knights Templar), and
Portuguese ambassador to Julius III.51 The dedication also emphasizes Dinis’s role in enabling
Lusitano’s advancement as a professional musician.52 The motu proprio also mentions Fabius
Acorombonus, a Roman cleric that served throughout the mid-sixteenth century as an
intermediary between the papacy and King João III of Portugal; it seems likely that

48

“Inhibentes omnibus et singulus Christifidelibus tam in Italia quam extra Italiam existentibus, praesertim
bibliopolis, et aliis impressoribus sub excommunicationis latae sententiae, in terris vero sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae
mediate vel immediate subiectis ducatorum ducentorum auri Camerae Apostolicae pro una, et dicto Vincentio pro
altera mediatem applicandorum.” Lusitano, Liber primus epigramata, tenor partbook, sig. G4r. It remains unclear
the extent to which such a punishment could be carried out. It seems likely that the threat of confiscation and the
fine held force only in the Papal States, whereas the threat of excommunication held force outside the Papal States.
49

Stevenson, “Vicente Lusitano,” 74 incorrectly states that violators of Ortiz’s privilege would be fined. I have
examined two copies of Ortiz’s print (E-Mn, shelfmark R/14653 and I-Bc, shelfmark B.130); in neither does the
privilege specify a fine.
50

Barbosa, Vicentius Lusitanus, 336. Lowinsky, postscript to Vicentino, L’antica musica (1959), n.p. suggests that
Lusitano was a member of the Papal Chapel in 1551; there is no evidence in the Vatican archives to support this
assertion.

51

Dinis is identified as the “speaker for the Most Serene King of Portugal to Our Holy Lord, Pope Julius III”
(“Apud Sanctum Dominum Nostrum Iulium papam III pro serenissimo Portugalliae Rege Oratoris”). Lusitano, Liber
primus epigramatum, all partbooks, sig. A1v.

52

Ibid., with regard to Dinis: “I cannot deny that I could have done nothing without him” (“sine qua me nihil posse
haud inficior”). For Dinis’s patronage, see Mastrocola, “Vicente Lusitano”; and Stevenson, “Vicente Lusitano,” 73.

59

Acorombonus filed the petition for a privilege on Lusitano’s behalf. 53 In any case, Lusitano’s
print suggests a close connection to papal circles, which may account for the broad latitude
granted in his privilege.
Several commentators have observed in the Liber primus epigramatum the presence of
unusual notated accidentals—most notably A♭, G♯, and D♭—supposing these to reflect
Lusitano’s “Iberian heritage.”54 Stevenson cites in particular a rare first-inversion A♭-major
simultaneity from the “Regina coeli” (no. 12 in the collection).55 The remainder of Lusitano’s
entire motet collection is full of similar harmonic curiosities. In the interest of space, I cite here
only one of many examples: an extremely early and rare instance of a sounded augmented sixth
in the second part of “Hic est Michael” (no. 3; figure 2.3). Whether these chromatic moments
reflect Iberian mysticism, some other quality altogether, or even notational carelessness, they
significantly unify this collection of Lusitano’s motets.
Stevenson was the first to suggest that Lusitano’s five-voiced “Regina coeli” was the
composition that sparked the debate with Nicola Vicentino.56 His only justification for this
attribution is the notated A♭-major simultaneity. I concur with Stevenson that the motet was the
likely cause of the debate, but I propose that Vicentino and Lusitano argued over something

Vicente” repeats Stevenson’s pronouncement about the “Regina coeli.”

other than a relatively routine turn to the flat side.57 Another peculiar feature of the motet, and
one also characteristic of many other motets in the same volume, is a striking type of cadence
formation. Throughout the motet, Lusitano clearly prepares a chromatic inflection in one voice
as a phrase approaches a cadence, while presenting in another voice the same note, clearly
uninflected. One example will suffice as a demonstration of this procedure (figure 2.4). On the
one hand, most musicians reading the supranus voice initially would inflect the asterisked note
as B♮ (instead of B♭) in order to effect a cadence on C. The stepwise D–C motion in the
supranus secundus voice further prepares this inflection in the supranus, creating the classic
sixth–octave cadence with suspension—this exact kind of cadence occurs at the end of the

57

See, for example, Josquin des Prez’s “Absalon fili mi,” which features a notated A♭ in the first phrase. Strictly
speaking, notated accidentals were irrelevant to the debate; Lusitano and Vicentino agree in their subsequent
writings that any tetrachordal genus can begin on any pitch.

previous phrase.58 On the other hand, the B in the altus is performed unambiguously as B♭, the
default within the notational system. The notated E♭ in the tenor confirms this interpretation; to
raise the B in the altus would create an illegal augmented fifth with the tenor (E♭–B♮).
This creates a potential dilemma for the performing ensemble, depending on their
competence and inclinations. In all likelihood, a first run-through will result in a B♮ in the
supranus and a B♭ in the altus, creating a cross-relation. Three scenarios are possible thereafter.
First, upon discovering the jarring glitch, the performers elect not to raise the B in the supranus,
creating a modal C-dorian effect. Second, the performers notice the augmented octave and elect
for whatever reasons to keep the piquant chromaticism. Third, the performers blithely pass over

62

the cross-relation and give it no further thought.59 Lusitano’s intended effect is beside the point;
Renaissance musical notation is sufficiently underdetermined that either the uninflected and
inflected forms are acceptable interpretations. Stanley Boorman and James Haar have gone as far
as to suggest that composers intended such ambiguities and were satisfied with either result.60
I believe that this type of cadence formation raises issues that match more closely the
subject and spirit of the debate. The potential cross-relations in Lusitano’s cadences are an ideal
opportunity for a misunderstanding. (I adopt the conditional tense in following sentences, as
there is no documentation of what happened at the performance of the “Regina caeli.”) Lusitano
could have argued that leaving the supranus B uninflected (i.e., flatted) creates a perfect
illustration of the diatonic genus because all the voices are in the diatonic genus. Vicentino,
however, could have argued that inflecting (i.e., raising) the B creates a perfect illustration of
music in the mixed genera because the pitches of each part derive collectively from the diatonic
and chromatic genera. Vicentino also could have argued credibly that the ambiguity in the
notation creates the possibility that one cannot say definitively in which genus the composition is
written. Speaking precisely about music is difficult enough; underdetermined notational and
performance practices make it well nigh impossible. Although there is strong evidence to support
the claim that Lusitano’s “Regina coeli” is the piece that touched off this legendary event, even if
it was not the piece in question, it nonetheless provides compelling evidence that illuminates the
Lusitano–Vicentino debate.

59

These very scenarios are treated at length in Boorman, “False Relations and the Cadence.” Ibid., 221 suggests the
third scenario as the most likely, that professional ensembles simply did not have the rehearsal time to smooth over
potential cross-relations and that composers gradually “expected theoretically forbidden false relations to occur in
performance and…they composed in such a way that these harmonically rich sonorities would be included in
performance.”

63

Its inclusion in Lusitano’s only known complete publication raises intriguing questions
about the print as a whole.61 I suggest here that Lusitano published the volume with the intention
of picking a fight with Vicentino. There is no evidence of Lusitano’s whereabouts between 1543
(Lusitano’s last documented appearance in Portugal) and the debate in 1551.62 Even if he did not
witness the failed performances of Vicentino’s avant-garde compositions at Rome in 1549,
Lusitano would have heard about them from Roman confidantes by 1551.63 Evidence also
suggests that Vicentino’s reputation for bravado and a quick temper preceded him.64 A welltimed performance of the motet and a gentle prodding would have been all that Lusitano needed
to provoke Vicentino. Vicentino’s account of the debate (albeit an undoubtedly biased one)
records Lusitano’s attempts to antagonize, culminating in a lengthy rebuke by Cardinal Ippolito
II d’Este.
The dating of Lusitano’s Liber primus epigramatum is therefore an important concern.
Following a manuscript defacement in the sole surviving copy at D-Mbs (shelfmark 4º Mus. pr.
94), RISM incorrectly lists the year of publication as 1555. Closer inspection confirms that the
year is in fact 1551. (A diagonal stroke is added in dark brown ink to the last numeral of “M. D.
LI.” to make “M. D. LV.”) Barbosa was unable to establish through archival research at the
Vatican the exact date of the motu proprio, or even whether the publication was published before
or after the debate in June 1551.65 In any case, two interpretations are possible: Lusitano

provoked the debate as an attempt either to generate excitement or to stimulate sales for his
collection of motets, either forthcoming or hot off the presses. The significance is the same in
either case—on the basis of this evidence, I argue that Lusitano engineered a plan to increase his
reputation through publication.
Lusitano appears anxious to control his public image in print, because, I believe, he had
bigger plans afoot. Shortly after the debate came to an end, Vicentino decided to publish the
formal declaration of the results. Vicentino palpably describes Lusitano’s nervous attempts to
prevent its publication:
[I do not] want to overtax myself by enumerating how many times, after His Most
Illustriousness had read the sentence, the said Don Vicente requested it back from
His Most Illustrious Lordship. Since the said sentence was in favor of the
aforesaid [Don Vicente], I begged His Most Illustrious Lordship to do me the
favor of permitting me to print and publish it to the world to his honor and glory,
as well as to that of the two judges. I shall refrain from describing how insistent
Don Vicente was to have the sentence back from the Most Illustrious Cardinal
when he heard that I planned to publish it, and how many days he importuned the
rector, Monsignor de Trotti, to whom the Most Illustrious Cardinal had entrusted
the sentence.66
The declaration included lengthy and unflattering depositions written by both parties during the
debate (described in appendix one). At this point, Lusitano was contemplating publishing a
book-length exposition on his views, based on the manuscript (now at F-Pn) that Lusitano
drafted before the debate.67 Lusitano’s victory in the debate established his credibility on musical

matters. By publishing the declaration, Vicentino would have both undermined Lusitano’s
authority and possibly foreclosed the publication of his book.
Lusitano’s Introduttione facilissima et novissima appeared shortly thereafter at Rome in
1553. In the short span of twenty-four leaves, the book breezily describes how to read staff
notation and perform and improvise polyphonic music. On the subject of the ancient Greek
genera—ostensibly the main draw for readers—Lusitano offers a mere four hundred words of
explanation and tosses off a perfunctory musical example (mangled in production). Furthermore,
as Vicentino later noted in his own treatise, Lusitano changes sides in the debate, showing that
music could be composed in the enharmonic and chromatic genera. Lusitano ends the entire
treatise by advising readers to “defer judgment to the ears of good musicians.”68 (Whether this is
a subtle dig at Vicentino or a noncommittal ending depends on one’s magnanimity about
Lusitano’s prose style.) Antonio Blado, the treatise’s printer, enjoyed decades of prosperity as
the official printer for the papacy. Blado’s publications thus carried with them tacit papal
imprimatur, which conferred legitimacy on Lusitano’s pamphlet in spite of its brevity. The
colophon at the end of the tract announces proudly in outlandishly large type Blado’s position as
“Impressore Apostolico” (figure 2.5).
My narrative about Lusitano’s two prints emphasizes his negotiation of the risks and
rewards of the publishing world. I have argued that a performance from his collection of motets
sparked a debate that created promotional buzz for the collection. Lusitano quickly leveraged his
newfound notoriety by publishing a treatise that appeared to settle the score with Vicentino. I
will leave aside speculation on the extent to which this entire strategy was conceived in advance,

noting only that Lusitano could not mastermind at least one aspect of his scheme. His motet
volume appears to imply an unfulfilled ambition—a Liber secundus never appeared.69

Vicentino’s L’antica musica (1555)
As the instigator of the debate, Lusitano had a clear advantage over his opponent. Nicola
Vicentino’s defensive posture set the tone of his responses to the debate. As I will show below,
he was also less adept than Lusitano at deploying printing technology in his favor. Immediately

69

Stevenson, “Vicente Lusitano,” 76 speculates that Lusitano “paid the penalty for his [harmonic] daring when no
publisher chose to anthologize his motets.” It should be noted, however, that many other composers published only a
first book of music.

after the debate in 1551, he retired to Ferrara with his patron, Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este.70 He
spent the next few years there, with bouts in Rome and Siena while Ippolito unsuccessfully
helped defend the Republic of Siena against the designs of Spain and Florence.71 Over the course
of this period, Vicentino worked on a response to Lusitano, laying out in full his theoretical
positions on the ancient Greek genera. Although his treatise was probably well underway before
1553, the publication of Lusitano’s treatise—with its seemingly tacked-on description of the
genera and polemical volte-face—put him further on the defensive and prodded him to see the
work through publication.
After nearly four years of silence, Vicentino’s response emerged on 22 May 1555,
printed at Rome by Antonio Barrè. L’antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica is a
significantly more complex work than Lusitano’s Introduttione. Vicentino’s views of the genera
inform each of the tome’s 304 pages, an expansive volume that touches on every area of
compositional and performance practice. L’antica musica is dedicated to and frequently
addresses his longtime patron Ippolito, but advertises for the wider world the “invention of a new
instrument that accommodates all perfect music and many musical secrets,” a culmination of the
extended development of his ideas on advanced music. 72 This difference in discursive approach
between Lusitano’s and Vicentino’s book is signaled furthered by their respective
bibliographical formats (upright quarto and folio), which imbued them with very different
profiles as material objects.

Incidentally, the fall of the Republic of Siena and its incorporation into the Republic of Florence set the stage for
Tigrini’s patron, Federico Barbolani, an Aretine noble in the service of the Medici who became governor of Siena
(see appendix one).

Despite Vicentino’s protestations that the work had been underway long beforehand,
L’antica music ridotta alla modern prattica should be understood as a response to the debate. In
his narrative account of the debate, Vicentino makes explicit his reasons for publishing the book:
I have written these few words lest the aforesaid Don Vicente Lusitano reprove
me for my tardiness in printing the said sentence, which I had promised him to do
some time ago. This delay was caused by the concerns and reasons given above.
Even though four years have elapsed since that sentence was issued, this delay is
not inappropriate because the sentence now comes out together with this, my
work. Hence, it will be better understood than it would have been earlier without
my work. As a consequence, everyone can properly adjudicate our disagreements
and consider whether the sentence was pronounced justly and whether the judges
understood our disagreement.73
Vicentino’s own position is implicit in the statement itself; he felt wronged by the judges of the
debate and set out to correct and to expose their misunderstandings. Throughout the book,
Vicentino argues for the limitations of language, both in terms of Vicentino’s own rhetorical skill
and the broader utility of words to explain music as an empirical phenomenon. This forms a
significant theme in Vicentino’s rationales scattered throughout the book:
As for language, we have as many rules as there are writers. Reading now one,
now another for my amusement, I find that the language we use today is just like
Proteus, who purposely changed himself into diverse shapes. Consequently, by
clinging in subservience to first this writer and then to that writer, I almost
became a new Vertumnus myself.74 I have taken some care in this matter after
diligently reading over my work many times. Yet I do not doubt that detractors
and calumniators of good works who aim at nothing but malice will contradict me
on this issue, being unable (so I believe) to lay any other blame on me. And so to
obviate all this, I declare at the outset that I did not feel obliged to write in the

73

Vicentino, Ancient Music (1996), 304. “Hò detto queste poche parole, acciò che il sopradetto Don Vincentio
Lusitano, non mi riprendi s’io son stato tardo à far stampare detta sententia, gia à lui promessa. La cagione è stata
per la inquiete, & per le ragioni sopradette; avvenga che sia corso il quarto anno doppo essa sententia. nondimeno
questa tardanza non è stata fuore di proposito. perche detta sententia venendo fuore insieme con questa mia opera,
sarà più intesa dal Mondo, che non saria stata prima senza essa opera, & acciò che ognuno possi giudicare bene, le
nostre differenze, & considerare se la sententia fù data giustamente, et sè le nostre differenze furono intese dalli
Giudici.” Vicentino, L’antica musica (1555), fol. 95v.

style of Boccaccio and that I scarcely had time to worry over every insignificant
little word because of the great scope of my work.75
Moreover, your skill will be improved by my instrument, called the archicembalo,
since practical examples are more convincing than notated examples accompanied
by words.76
In such statements, one sees Vicentino’s reaction to the profusion of books about music in
general, and the appearance of Lusitano’s in particular. His comment about the scope of his book
reads as a critique of the pithiness of Lusitano’s Introduttione, which is notably difficult to
understand. His doubts about using prose to explain musical practice likewise suggest a disdain
for the limited scope of musical examples in many Renaissance music treatises. In appendix one,
I suggest that Vicentino’s loss in the debate stemmed partly from the inaptness of his theories for
oral explication. I interpret his concerns about the language of L’antica musica as a response to
this possibility and to his experiences being misunderstood as a communicator.
Vicentino’s conception of his distinctive style of composing shifted throughout his career
from publication to publication (listed in table A1.4). In his 1546 madrigal print, Vicentino
indicates that his madrigals were composed “in the new theoretical and practical manner
discovered by his most celebrated teacher.”77 Vicentino portrays this style as the brilliant

discovery of Adrian Willaert; the compositions are presented as his first attempts at composing
in this new style, although Henry W. Kaufmann has noted its predominantly diatonic
conception.78 In L’antica musica, Vicentino instead portrays this style of composition as a
humanistic recovery of ancient Greek ways, noting in particular how modern musical practice
had lost its ancient power. In his 1561 untitled broadside, known as the Descrizione
dell’arciorgano, Vicentino makes no mention of how this system of composing and performing
began, except to say that arciorgano would inspire the unnamed inventor of this system to
compose “with greater harmony and more consonances.”79 Finally, in his 1572 madrigal print,
Vicentino styles himself grandly as “the practical and theoretical arch-musician and inventor of
new harmonies.”80 Over the course of twenty-six years Vicentino thus asserted four different
views of the origins of his musical style, attributing it to his teacher, to the ancient Greeks, to an
unnamed source, and finally to himself. His unfocused narrative about the genera likely
contributed to his troubled reputation as a professional musician among the Italian musical
intelligentsia.81
Between 1555 and the publication of the 1571 madrigal print, L’antica musica was the
only source available to the wider public for Vicentino’s newest, most representative
compositions. Seven extended musical examples, billed as demonstrations of the genera and how
to mix them, lie at the center of the book:

Timothy R. McKinney has interpreted these examples as Vicentino’s response to Lusitano’s
theories.82 Throughout L’antica musica, Vicentino asserts the idea that the diatonic genus is
particularly harsh, unsuited for modern compositions, which directly countered Lusitano’s claim
that most contemporary music was in the diatonic genus. McKinney argues that Vicentino
crafted the diatonic examples (in the list above, no. 1 and the first part of no. 6) so as to increase
their harshness. Also noteworthy is Vicentino’s omission of a texted exemplar of the diatonic
genus; the only complete example has no text, subtly reinforcing his point about its unsuitability
for composers.
In Vicentino’s L’antica musica, one may see the unfolding of his theoretical agenda,
providing a full exposition of his theories of the genera and their application to modern
composition. The book also presented new examples of his avant-garde style of composition
accompanied by a rigorous defense of their aesthetic value and instructions in how to compose in

72

this way for oneself. Vicentino’s L’antica musica allowed him to clarify his position and defend
against Lusitano’s attacks. The book also afforded Vicentino an opportunity to antagonize
Lusitano and Danckerts privately. In one chapter, Vicentino glosses Lusitano’s section on
improvised counterpoint, the principal theoretical innovation in Lusitano’s Introduttione,
dismissing the technique out of hand: “Such a practice is neither good nor useful for the choir,
and in the chamber it is worthless.”83 Each contrapuntal technique is appraised in turn, each one
receiving such damnation as “crude to hear” (“fà brutto sentire”), “not modern” (“non è
moderno”), and “utter clumsiness” (“tanta mal gratia”). The kindest assessment Vicentino has to
offer is “not so bad” (“è manco male”). Danckerts, too, receives subtle condemnation. When
discussing puzzle canons, Vicentino mentions several unsuitable kinds:
[A composer] should not make a canon in the shape of a tower, a mountain, a
river, a chessboard, or other objects, for these compositions create a loud noise in
many voices, with little harmonic sweetness. To tell the truth, a listener is more
likely to be induced to vexation than to delight by these disproportioned fancies,
which are devoid of pleasant harmony and contrary to the goal of the imitation of
the nature of the words.84
Danckerts himself wrote a puzzle canon in the shape of a canon on the text “Ave maris stella,”
which Vicentino here ridicules. As Maria Rika Maniates observes, Vicentino must have taken no
little pleasure in privately needling Danckerts in this way.85
One final aspect of the publication history of L’antica musica deserves mention. Several
copies of the treatise survive with a publication date of 1557. Although listed in RISM as a

second edition and identified by Maniates as a reprint, in actuality these copies are a separate
issue of the first edition.86 To create this issue, the book’s printer, Antonio Barrè, merely
stamped in two numerals “II” next to the “MDLV” to alter the date of publication on the title
page and colophon.87 Maureen Buja notes that the added numerals are in fact in smaller type.88
Both the 1555 and 1557 imprints bear on the colophons the indication “a instantia di Don Nicola
Vicentino,” which typically indicates that the individual named bore some element of
responsibility for the edition. In chapter three, I argue that the edition was underwritten not by
Vicentino but by Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este. After all, his reputation was as much at stake as
Vicentino’s in warding off Lusitano’s attacks. The 1557 issue of L’antica musica represents
Vicentino’s attempts to freshen the book’s appeal by making it appear newer. This stands in stark
contrast to Lusitano’s Introduttione, which went through three editions in less than a decade.

Danckerts’s manuscripts
Ghiselin Danckerts witnessed the aftermath of the debate from a level of remove. He was neither
personally involved with the litigants of the debate nor did his administrative duties in the Papal
Chapel permit sustained engagement with either party. Perhaps his compulsive scribal instinct to
record events accurately led him initially to involve himself in the debate’s aftermath. The
sentence against Vicentino written by Danckerts and Bartolome de Escobedo (the other judge in
the debate) emerged as a particular concern for both Lusitano and Vicentino. At least according

86
Maniates, introduction to Vicentino, L’antica musica (1996), xxiii. In bibliographical terms, an “issue” generally
is an alteration made to an edition (the body of printed sheets corresponding to a single run of the press) after it had
first gone on sale.

to Vicentino, Lusitano wished to suppress its publication, which might have dampened
enthusiasm for his publication; Vicentino wished to publish it in order to let members of the
public decide for themselves the justness of the debate’s outcome. In L’antica musica, Vicentino
indicates that Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este, who presided over the proceedings, finally entrusted
the document itself to one Monsignor de Trotti, probably Brandalisio de’ Trotti, the steward of
the cardinal’s household.89 In this section, I analyze the complex revisions of Danckerts’s
manuscripts, showing how they provide an extraordinary detailed window into the mind of an
author preparing a work for publication.
As an author of the sentence, Danckerts had a vested interest in protecting its survival and
integrity. He had reason to suspect foul play on the part of both Lusitano, who might have it
stolen or destroyed to mask his change in position, and Vicentino, who might have published a
bastardized version. Danckerts’s probably began compiling his manuscripts in 1551 as a means
to preserve the sentence in its true and correct form.90 Danckerts then began to expand the
manuscript to include copies of Lusitano’s and Vicentino’s depositions, which later appeared in
Vicentino’s L’antica musica (fol. 95v–96r). Danckerts closely studied Vicentino’s account and
noted some minor, but disturbing divergences from the original copies. The most damning of
these is Vicentino’s alleged addition of the phrase “non è Diatonica semplice” in Vicentino’s
version of his own deposition:
Vicentino:

Io hò provato, à M. Vincentio Lusitanio, che la Musica, che noi cantiamo
hoggi di, & che communamente ognuno canta, non è Diatonica semplice,
& lui dice che è Diatonica…91

89

I have proved to Messer Vicente Lusitano that the music that we sing
nowadays and that everyone sings ordinarily is not simply diatonic, and

Danckerts:

oggi di et che communemente ognuno canta; lui dice che è Diatonica…92
I have proved to Messer Vicente Lusitano that the music that we sing
nowadays and that everyone sings ordinarily, which he says is diatonic…

Danckerts maintained that the slight addition distorted the tenor of the debate, the subject of
which was not the “simple diatonic genus,” but the “diatonic genus.” He devoted an entire
chapter to critiquing Vicentino’s version of his deposition, showing how Vicentino deceitfully
introduced further minor alterations and additions to reinforce his point.93 Danckerts took pains
to indicate that his versions of documents were made from the most authoritative sources
available. In the first draft of the manuscript, Vicentino’s deposition is headed as follows:
Copia della ^Cedola et originale Informatione
inform ᵱ sua proua
proua.94

[illegible], manda don Nicòla Vicentino, ^& sua

Copy of the ^warrant and original deposition

[illegible] sent by Don Nicola Vicentino ^and his

evidence.
Here we see Danckerts’s attempts to find the best way to position the document and convey the
importance of his rendering of it. At this stage in the first draft, his primary motivations remain
preservation and accuracy.
In short order, however, Danckerts decided to expand the document beyond simple
transcriptions. Perhaps as he digested the scope of Vicentino’s treatise and its ramifications for

92

I-Rv, Ms. R56, fol. 354r. The versions of this document in Danckerts’s other two drafts (fol. 389v and 574r) are
substantially the same, differing only in details of orthography.

himself personally, he felt he needed to offer his own defense. Danckerts aspired to have his
records of the proceedings printed and published for the greater benefit. The first draft of his
manuscript includes a lengthy letter to the readers, labeled “L’Autore alli Lettori,” in which he
sets out his reasons for publishing his work:
The thought occurred to me to have this printed [stampare] in Italian for the
reasons mentioned below, in order to show to everyone who wishes to see how
his telling and publication of the said proceedings have lacked pure truth in many
ways, some of which I will discuss here.95
Danckerts worked diligently on the manuscript over several years, preparing two drafts in his
own hand and having a third professionally copied by another scribe, with corrections in
Danckerts’s hand. Ultimately, however, there is no surviving record of the manuscript being
printed, nor is there reason to believe that it might have been.
The main value of Danckerts’s treatise for this study is its development as a material
object from draft to draft. A full textual or codicological study of the manuscript drafts is beyond
the scope of this chapter.96 I will focus instead on the most significant changes that Danckerts
introduced as the manuscripts developed to show how he prepared the book for publication. In
the extended analysis below, I will argue that each draft witnesses his gradual, and only partial
assimilation to the unwritten rules of the printed book that were discussed above. Just as the
intellectual and theoretical content matured with each subsequent writing, its organization and
presentation gradually assumed the mantle of a printed book.

95

“Mi à penso farlo stampare in lingua italiana per le cagioni che si diranno disotto, per mostrare ad ogniuno che lo
uoglia uedere, come che esso nel narrare et publicare il detto progresso, ha mancato alla pura uerità in molti modi,
deli quali ne dirò qui alcuni.” I-Rv, Ms. R56, fol. 349r.
96

The most extensive textual study of the manuscripts is Campagnolo, “Il Trattato,” which attempts to provide a
critical edition of the manuscripts. No complete codicological study of the manuscripts has been published.

77

Three drafts of Danckerts’s treatise survive a I-Rv, Ms. R56 (for the structure and
contents of these drafts, see table A1.1). The first draft (fol. 348r–381v) was clearly the copy
Danckerts used initially to compose the manuscript, as it is the most heavily revised, often to the
point of illegibility. The draft’s four gatherings correlate to the work’s front matter and three
parts. Composing the manuscript in this manner gave it an extensible conception—sections could
be added, removed, or reordered without difficulty. This also required planning so as not to
waste paper. Danckerts evidently overestimated the length of part two, as its gathering ends with
two leaves canceled on both sides via diagonal slash followed by two blank pages. This
represents a second stage of second thought: the canceled pages include a leaf (fol. 371) that was
interpolated into the gathering (i.e., added after its initial formation), only for its contents to be
excised later on. The leaf contains a chapter, headed “Opinion regarding the chromatic and
enharmonic coloration of songs with some other advice” (“Opinione sopra il colorare le cantilena
Chromatico et enharmonico con alcuno altri avisi”).97 The structure of this gathering is as
follows:98

97

The chapter appears in the same place at the end of part two in the second draft (fol. 404r–404v) and the third
draft (fol. 589v–590r); both versions of the chapter are heavily edited by Danckerts.

This draft records Danckerts’s struggle to find a satisfactory concept for the work. The first draft
hinges on Vicentino’s L’antica musica, responding to it at every turn. He even seems to cede
Vicentino the final word, intending to place a quotation from Vicentino’s book after the end of
his book:
The end of the aforesaid treatise. Here follows the chapter on the aforesaid
musical debate printed in the aforesaid book about music by the said Don Nicola
on folio 95 with the changes and additions to the words that are not in the
originals, as was mentioned above.99
In the next two drafts, Danckerts revisited the concept of the work, gradually escaping the
limiting impulse to respond exclusively to Vicentino, instead coming to think of the work more
as a fully-fledged treatment of the genera.
The most vivid illustration of Dankcerts’s struggles with the work are his attempts to find
a satisfactory title. Danckerts seems to be aware of the need to have a convenient handle for his
work. The first draft begins with a title page with a fanciful description of the work:

99

musical things worthy of understanding, and moreover there are several different
compositions [concenti, literally “harmonies”] twenty compositions [cantilene,
literally “songs”] only in the diatonic genus by the same author, in order to clarify
for everyone that the said music that is commonly sung is not mixed of the three
genera (as a certain person suggests), but is only in the diatonic genus, as
everyone may judge, as the present volume intends to show.
The holes in the paper seem to result from Danckerts’s revisions and strikethroughs. The second
draft, after a half title page, begins with a much simpler full title:
GHISILINO DANCKERTS | MVSICO ET CANTORE DELLA CAPELLA DEL
PAPA | SOPRA VNA | DIFFERENTIA MVSICALE | SENTENTIATA | NELLA

Ghiselin Danckerts, musician and singer in the Papal Chapel, regarding a musical
debate judged in the said Chapel. In which debate the venerable Don Nicola
Vicentino was obligated to prove that no composer of music knows the genus of
the music that he himself composed. With a very easy declaration regarding the
three genera of music, diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic. With some examples
in four voices of each of these genera, one separated from the other, and also
mixed of all three genera together, and many other things worth knowing.
Moreover there are sixteen songs for more voices in various styles composed by
the same author, Ghiselin, only in the diatonic genus.
Even up through the completion of the third draft, a fair copy, he seems not to have settled on a
title. At the very bottom of the last page of the third draft, Danckerts tries out two different titles,
one underneath the ending of the main text, the other crammed in the margin to the left. The
marginal version appears to be the definitive version—it is headed, “È titolo dell’operetta”—but
the handwriting is so small that many of the words have faded into the paper to the point of
illegibility. Also unclear is where the first working title ends and the second marginal working
title begins, because the first contains marginal corrections that encroach on the second’s space.
Danckerts’s discomfort with the title seems to stem from its beginning with the preposition
“sopra” rather than a noun. The interior of each draft refers to the work by several different
nouns, alternately “trattato,” “libro,” or “operetta.” This was a significant concern, because these
terms, if attached formally to a title, might alter how readers approached Danckerts’s text.
Another element over which Danckerts vacillated are the “songs” or “compositions”
referred to in the title. The first draft mentions at first “twenty compositions,” which is amended
to “several songs.” The second draft specifies a smaller number, “sixteen songs.” The second
working title in the fair copy refers either to twelve or thirteen compositions (the faded ink is

difficult to read). Arnaldo Morelli has argued that this is a reference to another manuscript,
I-Rsc, G. Mss. 968 (olim Chiesa nuova, no. 12).102 The manuscript contains eighteen
compositions written in Danckerts’s hand, including fifteen motets, a magnificat, and a mass
cycle complete with propers and choral responsories. In this respect, Danckerts continued to ape
Vicentino, who included several compositions in L’antica musica. But Danckerts’s desire to
include a greater number of compositions, and compositions of greater length, is a significant
point of departure. Danckerts never published a single-author collection of his music, unlike both
Lusitano and Vicentino, and only four of his compositions were scattered among printed
anthologies.103 Appending the collection of his own music to his treatise seems to have been a
compensatory move for this perceived shortcoming. Had Danckerts’s proposed hybrid treatise–
anthology been published, it would have been a first in Roman music publishing and marked a
significant achievement that might have helped advance his career in the papal choir and in
clerical spheres; equally, such an unusual publication might have hurt his career by exposing him
to criticism as both a composer and music theorist. During the sixteenth century, only
Antonfrancesco Doni’s Dialogo della musica (1544), Heinrich Glarean’s Dodecachordon
(1547), and Thomas Morley’s Introduction (1597) employ a similar hybrid concept, although
only Glarean’s firmly ties the anthologized compositions to concrete theoretical innovations and
only Morley’s contains exclusively self-authored compositions. None of the works in
Danckerts’s manuscript collection of compositions appeared among his sporadic publications of
the 1550s and 1560s; it seems that Danckerts was saving these compositions for publication in
his treatise.

The most thoroughgoing changes occurred in the paratextual matter. In the first draft, the
front matter consists of a full title page, a three-page letter to the readers, and a three-page
proem, all appearing before part one. The proem concludes with a brief, one-sentence synopsis
of each of the work’s three parts. In the second draft, the front matter consists of a half title page,
a full title page, and the proem. Danckerts omits the letter to the readers, distributing its material
throughout the proem and the main text. After the proem are two blank pages headed
“TAVOLA” (fol. 386v–387r), after which begins part one. The only substantial textual revision
to the proem appears in the synopses of each part. The synopses are the identical to those in the
first draft, but the following phrase is added after each synopsis, then crossed out: “and its
chapters are listed in the table above” (“& capitoli in la tavola sopra ciò ordinati,” fol. 386r). At
some point in composing the second draft, Danckerts intended to include a table of contents—
one of the organizational devices prevalent among printed books—but changed his mind, leaving
the pages reserved for the table blank and canceling the relevant phrases in the proem. The third
draft, the fair copy, finds a middle ground by reconceiving of the proem. In this draft, there is no
front matter at all; the proem becomes chapter one of part one. In place of the tavola and the
short synopses of each part, Danckerts gives at the end of the proem a paragraph-length summary
for each part, mentioning the specific contents of each chapter. It should also be mentioned that
the third draft contains two drafts of the proem, one in Danckerts’s hand with additions and
alterations (fol. 566r–568v), and a copy of this into another hand incorporating these changes
(fol. 570r–573r). The result is to make the proem an introduction to the work in the modern
sense, drawing the listener in with a tale of calumny and intrigue, identifying the author’s pretext
for writing, and describing the scope and contents of the entire work. The same elements had
been present in the earlier drafts, but needed tweaking to balance their respective lengths and

function. The omission of a tavola in each draft is curious, especially in light of the pages
reserved for it in the second draft. One cannot know whether he elected to omit the table
altogether or to defer the task to the printer at a later point. In either case, the changing shape of
the front matter demonstrates Danckerts’s awareness of its importance and attests to the gradual
formation of his conception of the work as a printed object.
Even in the first draft, Danckerts promised to include musical examples of the three
genera, along with additional examples of “musical things worth knowing.” Arnaldo Morelli
argues credibly that these latter examples developed in the manuscript of his compositions at IRsc in parallel with his drafts of the treatise.104 This illustrative material is confined mostly to
part two of the work; each draft contains a different reading of part two that shows an evolving
idea of what this material conveys.105 Table 2.1 summarizes the evolution of the illustrative
material in various drafts and versions of part two. The first draft of the treatise does not contain
any polyphonic examples of the genera, only three illustrative examples in part two: an
illustration of the gamut common in many contemporary treatises (fol. 362r), a schematic

diagram comparing the interval contents of each genus of tetrachord (fol. 363r), and the gamut
divided into each respective kind of tetrachord (fol. 369r).
The second draft of the manuscript has two versions of part two. The first version (fol.
395r–404v) contains a schematic diagram of the genera (fol. 395v), five scales in the genera (one
diatonic, two chromatic, and two enharmonic, fol. 400v–401r), and five polyphonic examples,
three showing each genus separately and two with different kinds of mixture (fol. 401v–403v).
The diagram of the gamut present in the first draft is missing in the first version of the second
draft. The second version of part two in the second draft contains no actual illustrative material,
but leaves blank spaces at the relevant locations, so that it could be copied in at a later point. A
blank page (fol. 416r) is reserved for the full gamut, present in the first draft but absent in the
first version of the second draft. A half page is allocated for the comparative diagram of the
genera (fol. 417r). A blank page is reserved for the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic scales
(fol. 422v), but is separated into three sections, not five sections as in the first version of the
second draft. The end of the second version of part two, which coincides with the end of the
gathering, contains Danckerts’s introduction to his polyphonic examples. It does not include the
examples themselves or the concluding chapter (cf. first draft, fol. 371r–371v; and second draft,
version one, fol. 404r–404v). It is possible that these were recorded on a separate gathering, now
lost, or that Danckerts deemed the readings in the first version of the second draft to be
sufficient.
The third draft of the manuscript, prepared by another scribe, combines elements of the
first and second versions of part two in the second draft. The comparative diagram of the genera
(fol. 580v) appears as in the previous drafts. The gamut is omitted entirely. The scales in the
genera are given (fol. 587v), but follow the second version of draft two in reducing their number

85

to three, giving only one example for each genus. Finally, blank pages are reserved for the
polyphonic examples; the pages are ruled and four headings are given, one each for the
chromatic and enharmonic genera, and two for combinations of all three genera. Omitted in this
draft is an exemplar of the diatonic genus—the title page of draft two indicates that these are to
be drawn from the works of the author, presumably in the manuscript of his own compositions at
I-Rsc.
The illustrations in part two undergo a dramatic transformation from draft to draft. The
only element to survive intact is the comparative diagram of the genera, which is present or
planned for in every draft. Danckerts appears to have equivocated about including the gamut,
eliminating it in version one of draft two, then restoring it in version two of draft two, then
finally eliminating in draft three. The gamut partitioned into the genera in draft one is
transformed into scales in drafts two and three. Between version one and version two of draft
two, Danckerts eliminated two of the scales. Finally, the polyphonic examples are introduced
only in the second draft and one is eliminated from the final draft. The gamut partitioned into the
genera and the scales in the genera (figures 2.6–2.8) are particularly significant, because they
record Danckerts’s decisions about how to present a complex theoretical idea. The transition
from the gamut to scales was a natural one, as it allowed Danckerts to sidestep the issue of
solmization tied to the representation of the gamut—a subject that neither Lusitano nor Vicentino
dared to tackle. The scalar forms of the first version of the second draft allowed Danckerts to
demonstrate that the chromatic and enharmonic genera had two different forms that hinged on
whether each new tetrachord begins on the final note of the previous tetrachord or the first note
after it. For the sake of simplicity, however, in the second version of the second draft and in the
third draft, Danckerts gives only one scale for each genera; the chromatic and enharmonic scales

have the same high note, facilitating comparison between their intervallic content. The text that
introduces and explains the partitioned gamut and the scalar genera remains much the same from
draft to draft. The transformation of these examples shows how Danckerts attempted to master
their visual presentation for the ease of reading and theoretical consistency.
One final aspect of the manuscript’s presentation is Danckerts’s marginal annotations in
the second version of part two in the second draft. Here, Danckerts considers the genera in the
works of previous music theorists. Throughout the entire version of part two, Danckerts inserts
marginal keywords, including the subjects considered and the names of authorities discussed
(“Pietro Aron,” “Boetio,” “Franchino Gaffurio,” “Guido Aretino,” “Macrobius,” “Margarita
philosophica,” “Pittagorici,” “ptolomeus,” “Neoterici,” “.S. Ambrosio,” and “.S. Gregorio”).106
This second version of part two in the second draft is perhaps the most complete section of the
entire manuscript, missing only the polyphonic examples (probably on a separate, now-lost
gathering). It also presents the most coherent reading of the section; both the first draft, the first

106

Of this list of authorities, only two require clarification. “Margarita philosophica” refers to Gregor Reisch,
Margarita philosophica (1503), a humanistic compendium of the liberal arts, including a chapter on musica.
“Neoterici” refers to the Neotericoi, a group of late Hellenic poets, including Callimachus and Theocritus. Exactly
which Neoteric works Danckerts has in mind is unknown, although he claims they ascribed three properties to the
hexachords.

88

version of the part in the second draft, and the third draft are covered with strikethrough,
cancellation, and interlineal and marginal additions, sometimes to the point of illegibility. It is
also worth noting that this is the last version of the manuscript that is given entirely in
Danckerts’s hand. The third draft records Danckerts’s struggle with its copyist, who had different
dialectal or linguistic preferences. (For example, Danckerts corrects “se poño” to “si possono”
and “sariano” to “sarebbono,” fol. 584v–585r.) The scribe also omitted many features of the
second draft, including the marginal annotations. Thus, as far as the visual presentation of the
manuscript is concerned, the second version of part two in the second draft preserves
Danckerts’s final intentions.
What is significant is that the second draft, as a whole, incorporates many framing and
organizational devices typical of printed books: two title pages, a table of contents (although left
blank), and marginal side notes (in the second version of part two). The second draft also
witnesses the most extensive textual revisions of all the drafts. Longer chapters are shortened,
terminology is standardized (e.g., “concenti,” “compositioni,” “canti,” “cantilene” are rendered
in most cases as “cantilene”), syntax is simplified, and arguments are clarified. Although this is
typical of the writing process in general, I suggest that these particular changes reflect
Danckerts’s attempts to conceive of the work as a printed object. His efforts to clear up and
improve the form and content of the manuscript shed important light on how authors prepared a
work for publication. As we have seen, these included not merely cosmetic revisions, but deep,
substantive changes to the text and illustrations and their manner of presentation.
It is all the more curious, then, that the manuscript never was printed and published.
There are several possible explanations. The most immediate is that Danckerts may have lacked
the time and energy needed to finalize the manuscript. It also is possible, given the work’s arcane

89

subject matter and the length of time elapsed since the debate, that Danckerts was unable to
attract a publisher’s interest or that he himself lost interest in the project or lacked funds to
support its publication himself. Indeed, I show in chapter three that every Roman music
publisher working during the 1550s had already published on the subject of ancient Greek music
theory; it seems unlikely that any of these publishers would dilute sales of previously-released
works by printing Danckerts’s new work.
Despite not being published, the treatise managed to attain a certain level notoriety, as it
was known by many musicians well after Danckerts’s death. The most extensive citation of it is
Giovanni Maria Artusi’s L’Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (1600),
which gives a short account of the debate between Lusitano and Vicentino in the form of a
dialogue between two friends, Luca and Vario, set at Ferrara in November 1598. Although
Artusi, with Vario as his mouthpiece, agrees that Lusitano rightfully won the debate, he concedes
that Vicentino’s argument was correct, but that Vicentino lacked the ability to articulate why.107
As the fame of the Lusitano–Vicentino debate embedded itself in music-historical memory and
imagination, Danckerts’s manuscripts emerged as the most reliable account of the proceedings.
Both John Hawkins and Charles Burney used Danckerts’s narration of the affair in their
eighteenth-century histories of music.108 During the early nineteenth-century, Giuseppe Baini,
maestro di cappella of the Papal Chapel and Palestrina scholar, prepared an edition of
Danckerts’s manuscript for his own use, now I-Rc, Ms. 2880 (olim O.III.118). Baini’s pupil

“Voglio concludirvi che Don Nicola havea ragione, à tenere questa Conclusione; Che la Musica, che si canta &

perdere la scomessa fatta col Lusitano.” Artusi, L’Artusi (1600), fol. 38r. In the entire passage on the debate (fol.
37v–38r), Artusi cites Danckerts by name only once, although his opinions about Vicentino’s distortions and
imprecision clearly follow Danckerts’s arguments.

Adrian de La Fage prepared his own study of the debate from this copy, which for many years
stood as the most authoritative account of the debate.109

Crafting Zarlino’s legacy
Cristle Collins Judd has argued that Zarlino’s publications constituted “an attempt to position
himself for an appointment like the one at San Marco.”110 Judd has suggested furthermore that
“with remarkable canniness, Zarlino masterfully and meticulously manipulated his public image
through the medium of print over a forty-year period beginning with [his] first publication in
1549.”111 In short, Zarlino exploited his skill as a writer and eventually his position as maestro di
cappella at the Basilica di San Marco to create a lasting legacy. I offer here a contrasting
approach to Judd’s perspective on Zarlino’s publishing career. The focus of her study is the
sequence and timing of Zarlino’s various publications. I trace instead successive editions of a
single publication, Le istitutioni harmoniche, showing how their changing bibliographical shape
functioned to consolidate Zarlino’s authority. His broader career strategies, as articulated by
Judd, resemble a milder and less calculated version of Lusitano’s succès de scandale. What I
intend to demonstrate here is a concern not necessarily with getting ahead, but rather with getting
it right. By situating Zarlino within what Anthony Grafton has termed a “culture of correction,” I
aim to demonstrate Zarlino’s attempts to make his writings more coherent and accessible to
readers.112

The printing history of Le istitutioni harmoniche (summarized in table 2.2) is a

complicated matter, which I will treat briefly here only as it relates the present argument. The
printing and publishing of the first edition of 1558 is a problematic, as its title page contains the
device of Pietro da Fino, a Venetian bookseller, and the typographical material, including the
single-impression musical type of Francesco Marcolini.113 This suggests that the edition was
commissioned, although the identity of its underwriters remain obscure; the length and
typographical complexity of the treatise would have required a substantial outlay of capital for
the book’s publisher. Further copies of the treatise appeared in 1561 and 1562, each with the
device and name of Francesco de’ Franceschi Senese appearing on the title page.114 These are not
new editions, but rather separate issues of the 1558 edition. That is, Franceschi discarded all of

113

Compare, for example, the typographical materials used in Zarlino’s Istitutioni (1558) and Marcolini’s edition of
Lusitano’s Introduttione (1558). It is not widely known that Marcolini printed music after the 1530s, when he used
the multiple-impression method. Armelli, “Francesco Marcolini” recently discovered that Marcolini was
commissioned to print four musical editions for Plinio Pietrasanta in 1557; these editions use the same typographical
materials as the Lusitano and Zarlino editions. I am at work on a larger study of Marcolini’s printing of Zarlino’s
Istitutioni.

114

RISM lists two copies of the Istitutioni dated 1572, which appear to be a further issue of the first edition. Their
existence must be doubted, because neither copy is available today; both libraries do, however, possess copies of the
1562 issue: CZ-Bm, shelfmark D 546; and F-Pm, shelfmark 2º 4749 A.

92

the first sheets from the remaining copies of the first edition, which contained the title page,
privilege, and errata list, then printed as needed a replacement sheet with new versions of these
pages; the only changes on these replacement sheets are the year of publication and the wording
of the full title. Copies of this new sheet were then combined with the remaining old sheets to
form a separate issue of the first edition. Only a year later, in 1562, Franceschi released a further
issue of the Istitutioni with a second revised date of publication.
The motivations behind these issues are unclear. Judd correlates them to the declining
health of Willaert, of whose will Zarlino is named executor.115 (He died 7 December 1562.) In
this interpretation, Zarlino released a new issue at each morbid anticipation of Willaert’s passing.
Careerism may well have played a role in the release of these issues, but I propose another, more
mundane, explanation: these issues relate to Franceschi’s developing activities as a publisher. I
will show in chapter three that Franceschi’s first publication was a new book by Zarlino, the
Utilissimo trattato della patientia (1561). It seems plausible to suggest that, around the same
time, Franceschi purchased the unsold stock of the 1558 edition of the Istitutioni to sell at his
shop alongside the Trattato. This stock—whether previously held by Zarlino, da Fino, Marcolini,
or some combination of the three—represented a significant financial investment yielding little
return; Franceschi may have acquired it at a heavily-discounted wholesale price. Another
plausible explanation might be a quid pro quo arrangement between Franceschi and Zarlino; in
return for printing the new sheet for the Istitutioni, Zarlino permitted Franceschi to publish the
Trattato. In either case, the appearance in close proximity of Zarlino’s Trattato and two new
issues of Zarlino’s Istitutioni represents the beginning of a fruitful business relationship with
Franceschi.

115

93

In 1573, Franceschi published a completely new edition of Zarlino’s Istitutioni. The
book’s material evolution records important changes in the author’s conception of both this work
and his broader oeuvre. The textual transformation of the treatise is fairly well known and has
been discussed at length by other scholars.116 The most important revision is Zarlino’s reordering
of the twelve modes, from pairs of authentic/plagal modes on D–E–F–G–A–C to pairs of modes
on C–D–E–F–G–A. The material evolution of the book is less well documented and reflects
important changes in Zarlino’s professional circumstances and approach to crafting the book’s
ideal presentation.
A number of paratextual changes that appear in the 1573 edition merit further discussion.
First, the title page advertises numerous revisions to the work (“newly improved in many
passages and amplified with many beautiful secrets about practical matters”).117 In 1565, Zarlino
had been appointed to the post of maestro di cappella at San Marco. The title page of this new
edition—like those of his 1566 motet print and his 1571 Dimostrationi harmoniche—proudly
announces his appointment. Furthermore, the 1573 edition is styled simply Istitutioni
harmoniche, omitting the definite article “le” from the title of the 1558 edition. This seemingly
minor alteration intimates a new conception of the book. Zarlino first proposed reordering the
modes in the Dimostrationi, published two years prior; Zarlino revised the Istitutioni to adopt
this revision. The close resemblance between the title pages of the 1573 Istitutioni and the 1571
Dimostrationi (figure 2.9) suggest that they were sold as matching companion volumes. Many
surviving copies of the books are bound together in one volume; indeed, several surviving copies

of the 1562 issue of the Istitutioni are bound with the Dimostrationi, suggesting that this pairing
strategy began before 1573.118
Second, Zarlino adds marginal citations to classical authorities in the 1573 edition. These
are sprinkled lightly throughout the treatise to provide references for some of Zarlino’s allusions
and quotations. Also a seemingly minor addition, these signal an expansion in the potential

1562 Istitutioni are bound with the 1571 Dimostrationi, such as at I-Vnm (shelfmark Musica 87) and US-Ws

readership of Zarlino’s work. The 1558 edition (and its issues in 1561 and 1562) contained no
authorial annotations to the text, suggesting an assumption that readers would be familiar with
the sources embedded in the text (or that would not be interested in pursuing them any further).
The marginal citations in the 1573 edition might indicate that Zarlino and Franceschi sought to
make the work more accessible to those without extensive humanistic or musical training. In this
regard, Zarlino’s notes represent a larger attempt to promote the vibrancy of classical literature to
new readers, especially considering that the marginalia refer almost exclusively to classical and
medieval sources.119 These were clearly an effective tool for potential readers; their number is
nearly doubled in the third edition of 1589. One might also interpret the addition of marginal
notes in the 1573 and 1589 editions as Zarlino’s attempts to bolster his intellectual credentials,
especially in light of the critiques of Vincenzo Galilei and others.
Third, Zarlino adds a subject index to the back of the volume. This complements the table
of contents that also appeared at the front of the edition. Zarlino plays up these two tavole on the
1573 title page, suggesting their use as ways of navigating the text: “with two tables, one which
contains the principal subjects, and another which contains the more notable things invoked in
the work.”120 The table of contents (sig. π3r–5v) straightforwardly lists chapter titles and their
page references. The twenty-page index (sig. a1r–b4v) provides page references for subject
entries arranged alphabetically. Entries are divided evenly between musical topics (e.g., “Arte
del Contrapunto quello che sia, 171”) and nonmusical topics (e.g., “Autorità di Avicenna
esplicata, 35”). Both tavole might have offered the reader powerful tools for searching Zarlino’s

book. The index functions along similar lines as the marginal citations, allowing the reader to
scan the contents of the book without reading it. The index also hints at topics that Zarlino and
Franceschi expected sellers to find interesting, especially in light of the disproportionate
representation of classical topics in the index as compared to their minimal, if still respectable
showing in the main text. The tavole clearly were useful contrivances for selling the book.
Finally, the 1573 edition corrects numerous typographical infelicities in the 1558 edition.
One example typifies the care taken in cleaning up the page (figure 2.10). In a chapter in the
middle of part three Zarlino describes and illustrates the different mensuration signs. In the 1558
edition (chapter 48), these are run-in with the prose, breaking up the visual flow. In the 1573

97

edition (chapter 49), these signs are brought together and printed as one group on the edge of the
text block. Notable, too, is that the first edition uses woodcuts and the second edition uses type to
reproduce the mensuration signs. The latter solution is simpler from the perspective of the
typesetter, and clarifies the overall scope and argument of the chapter. The second edition
witnesses Zarlino and Franceschi attempting to perfect the work by ensuring ease of use,
readability, and even profitability.
In sum, the paratexts to the 1573 edition show that Zarlino and Franceschi worked
together closely to position it within the marketplace. Zarlino and the bookmen involved in
printing, publishing, and selling the first edition learned a valuable lesson from the fifteen-year
period required to sell off the stock: consider one’s readership. Its conception as a companion
volume to the Dimostrationi brought new texts to new readers; indeed, Zarlino’s new approach
to ordering the modes might have been the main contributing factor in the publication of the
1573 Istitutioni. The marginal annotations, tavole, and cosmetic facelifts transformed reader
perceptions of the text from a continuous, undigested narrative into a coherent collection of
discrete ideas. This made the edition more reader-friendly, accessible to new audiences, and
emphasized trends in the reception of classical thought—all while making relatively few changes
to the text-proper. Furthermore, like the Trattato of 1561, the 1573 edition of the Istitutioni
functioned as a cross-promotional platform for his publications of music; compositions from
Zarlino’s 1566 motet print are discussed throughout the 1573 edition.121 Whereas Judd argues
that Zarlino possessed a preternatural understanding of print culture, I suggest instead that the
1573 edition demonstrates recovery from a steep learning curve, negotiated in close coordination
with Franceschi.

Zarlino published in 1588 and 1589 an opera omnia in four volumes under the title De
tutte l’opere del R. M. Gioseffo Zarlino da Chioggia. By this point, Zarlino was in his seventies,
approaching the end of a distinguished career. This was a momentous achievement for any living
writer, reserved for the likes of Erasmus and Martin Luther.122 As the first volume of his
complete works, the Istitutioni was Zarlino’s proudest accomplishment. Although the text is
largely the same as the 1573 edition, it reflects further changes in Zarlino’s conception of his
life’s work. The publication of different works together in series reflects an intellectual
continuity that was only latent in the separately-printed earlier editions. Although ostensibly a
defense against attacks from Vincenzo Galilei, the Sopplimenti musicali (volume three, but the
first to be printed) allows Zarlino to discuss explicitly the connections between the Istitutioni and
Dimostrationi.123 The collected works manifest Zarlino’s belief that all his different prose
publications, even nonmusical ones, were unified under a single field of inquiry. Each volume
reflects increased attention to the needs of readers, including further typographical cleanups and
marginal citations. Furthermore, the subject index placed at the back of the second edition is
promoted to the front of the volume—an indication of its importance and utility for readers. In
short, Zarlino’s complete-works edition consolidates his authority and crafts his legacy as a
writer on the subjects of music, poetry, history, philosophy, and religion. The 1589 edition also
restores the definite article “le” to the title (L’istitutioni harmoniche), which might suggest a
return to the claim of intellectual completeness in this final edition.
The multivolume edition trades on Zarlino’s status as an eminent figure in Venetian civic
life. Lengthy works on difficult subjects, Zarlino’s music treatises needed to be positioned

carefully within the market for printed books. The Sopplimenti drew public attention to the
ongoing dispute between Zarlino and Galilei, acting as a promotion for the soon-to-arrive
Istitutioni and Dimostrationi, which aimed to offer definitive statements on the subject (“now
reprinted together, newly corrected, expanded, and improved”).124 The subjects of the essays in
the fourth volume—calendric reform, chronology, the growth of religious orders, and theology—
were all of public interest and proven sellers.125 By publishing these as the fourth volume,
Franceschi tapped into growing trends in book collecting. These essays would be the main draw
for many buyers, who would be loath to buy only the last of a multivolume set. Indeed, many
copies of the set survive complete in contemporary bindings.126
At the onset of the seventeenth century, Giovanni Antonio and Giacomo de’ Franceschi,
faced a problem. Zarlino had died in 1590 and Francesco de’ Franceschi Senese in 1599, leaving
the Franceschi heirs with a large stock of unsold copies of volumes one and two of Zarlino’s De
tutte l’opere. The Franceschi firm followed a well-worn tactic in rereleasing these volumes, once
in 1602 and again in 1622, but took lengthy measures to create these issues, which combined the
Istitutioni and Dimostrationi into a single volume. Although releasing issues of old works was
common practice (as was the case with Franceschi’s issues of Marcolini’s first edition), thirtythree years (from 1589 to 1622) was an extraordinarily long time to attempt to sell a work.
Making a revised title page for the combined volume was not difficult—copies of the first sheet
of the Istitutioni were discarded and a replacement was printed up with a revised title page and a
reset errata list on the conjugate leaf. A comparison of two copies reveals that the initial imprint

Adjusting the second volume (the Dimostrationi) required more extensive doctoring to
the unsold copies. The first gathering of the volume originally consisted of four sheets
comprising eight leaves: a title page, dedication, subject index, and errata list. The leaves
containing the title page and dedication needed to be removed, but their conjugate leaves (which
contained the end of the index and the errata) needed to remain. One solution was to reset anew
the index and errata list as a gathering of six leaves. This, however, would have taken time and
money, not to mention more paper. Instead, the Franceschi firm sheared the first two sheets in

which was then pasted to the outside of the remaining two sheets. This resulted in a composite

the volume. When sold to buyers, the Institutioni et dimostrationi di musica consisted of the two
volumes from 1589 jerry-rigged into one enormous volume of 780 pages. These gatherings, also

Printing technology enabled writers to reach an international community, while raising
their status within the local sphere. The shifting bibliographical shape of Zarlino’s Istitutioni
reveals that this was not an automatic, effortless process—authors and their publishers had to
work together carefully to achieve this type of success. I have argued that the editions of 1573
and 1589 were situated carefully within a network of multilayered publishing strategies designed
to avoid the lengthy period required to sell of the stock of the 1558 editions. Franceschi’s heirs
continued and extended these strategies in selling off the stock of the 1589 edition during the

102

early seventeenth century. In chapter three, I will consider further Francesco de’ Franceschi’s
cooperation in this process and his own marketing initiatives.

Conclusion
The case studies exemplify how authors engaged printing technology in different ways.
Lusitano’s motet collection prompted a scandal that resulted in the publication of a treatise that
was printed three times. Vicentino attempted to rescue his professional reputation by publishing
a fuller account of the encounter with Lusitano. Danckerts, too, attempted to cash in on his
newfound notoriety by setting to work on his own account of the proceedings and correcting
Vicentino’s errors. Zarlino’s treatise earned him a coveted position, which allowed him to
continue composing, theorizing, and writing. Anxiety unifies these interrelated tales. In this
chapter, I have shown that printing technology was a tool that did not guarantee success or
failure. All of the authors I have considered had to exercise extreme caution throughout their
publishing activities. There was a very real risk of publishing a book that no one wanted to buy
or that seemed to serve no broader purpose. Clearly these were fraught ventures. Bonnie
Blackburn has shown that, at the same time, authors had to consider the dangers of being
scooped or making the wrong enemies.128
In short, this chapter has examined how authors adapted their books about music to the
medium of print. This adaptation could assume multiple forms. One of these forms was textual
and bibliographical—authors adapted their books to anticipate, conform to, and even subvert the
expectations of readers. The evolution of Danckerts’s and Zarlino’s works demonstrate the
importance of visual presentation in positioning books as printed objects. Danckerts’s constant

103

revisions show how his manuscripts gradually assumed the shape of a printed book. Zarlino’s
Istitutioni accumulated by degrees the textual and paratextual aids that readers came to expect.
Another form that this adaptation took was social and behavioral—authors learned to take
actions that dovetailed with their publishing interests. In this respect, Lusitano seems to have had
a masterful and instinctive understanding of how to manipulate printing technology and realworld events, much to Vicentino’s detriment. In the chapter that follows, I pursue this idea from
the complementary perspectives of printers, publishers, and booksellers, showing how the
medium of print adapted to Renaissance books about music.

104

CHAPTER THREE: PRINTERS

This chapter explores the perspectives of the bookmen responsible for producing, financing, and
disseminating printed Renaissance books about music. Such books came to light through a
complex process that involved many different craftsmen and tradesmen traditionally divided into
three occupational categories, printers (tipografi), publishers (editori), and booksellers (librai).1
Although its title addresses only printers, this chapter considers the individuals and firms who
acted in all three capacities, as operators of presses, as sponsors of editions and series, and as
sellers of books printed and published in-house or otherwise. This chapter also emphasizes the
fluidity and flexibility with which individuals undertook this variety of tasks and objectives.
Such a treatment of the book trade allows us to consider the intersections among their different
kinds of work, foregrounding their agency in shaping the expression of music and ideas rather
than relegating them to the status of neutral conduits or middlemen.
I begin with an overview of how printers designed and shaped their books. By examining
the designs of Renaissance books about music, we may recover significant aspects of the social
and bibliographical function of these books. This allows us to see not only how authors and
readers perceived printers’ profiles, but also how printers targeted authors and pitched their
products to the reading public. I then turn to one particular technical innovation, scores printed
from moveable type, exploring the negotiations between authors and printers to produce books

that were simultaneously well-designed for readers and cost-effective for printers. Finally, I
explore the subject of advertising and the association of music theorists and their works with
particular printers. The unifying focus of this chapter is the ways that printers facilitated
interactions between authors and readers, whether through typography or marketing.

Book design in Renaissance books about music
In a classic essay, historian of typography Beatrice Warde argued that typographical design
complements and enhances the text itself. She compares the material form of a text to a crystal
goblet, showing how it acts to transmit and expose ideas:
Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own
favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep
shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid
gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass,
thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice
of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you
have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of
drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if
you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will
choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than
to hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.2
Warde further extends the wine-glass metaphor, comparing the stem of a goblet to the margins of
a book (which allow one to partake of the thing without touching it) and the leading of lines to
the base of the goblet (which provide a foundation for observing the thing). Her ultimate point is
that printing “conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other minds.”3
This section focuses on Warde’s idea of the nonverbal conveyance of expressive meaning
through typography. The expressive meaning of typography in music books has not yet played a

106

significant role in the study of music and print culture.4 Bibliographer D. F. McKenzie has
argued for the importance of how “the material forms of books, the non-verbal elements of the
typographic notations within them, the very disposition of space itself, have an expressive
function in conveying meaning.”5 In the field of musicology, Jessie Ann Owens has proposed
“the importance of working directly with [books about music] themselves, and of learning to
understand the significance of their material forms.”6 I surveyed in chapter two the textual and
paratextual features that came increasingly to characterize printed books about music; in chapter
four, I will show that these features were of immense value to readers, allowing them to make
sense of their often-confusing books. Here, I explore the points of connection between authors’
words and readers’ bodies, showing how printers contributed further layers of meaning and value
to their books through design and typography. I begin by surveying the basic elements of book
design, then propose three basic archetypes for the design of Renaissance books about music. By
examining these instances of mise-en-page, I hope to indicate the importance of modes of
bibliographical and typographical signification, what Jerome McGann has called “bibliographic
codes” (visual or otherwise nonverbal cues to readers about the texts they accompany), which
have not yet played a significant role in music scholarship.7

Basic elements of book design
One instance of continuity between the worlds of printed books and manuscripts is the
consistency of design between these otherwise very different commercial goods: no matter their

means of production, most codices followed the conventions of textual production and
reception.8 Printers developed ways of designing books that borrowed from scribal traditions;
indeed, the first generations of printers were composed primarily of former scribes.9 This section
describes those elements of design particular to the printer’s domain: the relationship between
text-block, page size, and margins; columnar layout; and typeface selection. This lays the
foundation in the subsequent section for a basic typology of design in Renaissance books about
music.
The principal element of a book’s design is the text-block—the area of the page in which
the body of the text appears.10 The text-block is measured in two ways, by the maximum number
of lines per page (its height) and the maximum number of characters per line (its width, called
the measure). The size of the text-block is a function of page size, itself a function of the book’s
format.11 I will show in chapter four that a book’s format (and therefore its page size) was related
to its subject matter and intended audience; for example, learned books were typically in larger
formats, whereas textbooks and popular literature were typically in smaller formats. Another
feature that shaped the text-block was the margins. Various kinds of paratextual matter could be
added to the margins: headlines, folios, side notes, catchwords, signatures, and so forth. The size
and placement of the text-block conditioned the ways that readers interfaced with the page. A
page with too many lines of text, an overly long measure, or very narrow margins appeared

Another significant factor in shaping page size and the text-block was the size of paper sheets, which came in
various standard sizes that varied significantly by region. Gaskell, Introduction, 67. For paper sizes in books of
music, see Bernstein, Music Printing, 62–64.

cluttered and impenetrable. Conversely, a page with too few lines of text, an overly short
measure, or very wide margins appeared bloated and inconsequential. Striking an optimal
balance between page size, margin size, and placement of the text-block ensured an optimal
layout for readers. There were many different solutions to this problem; the differences between
these solutions suggested information about the intended genre classification, audience, and
social or regional context of a given text.
Historians of book design have observed a consistent proportional relationship between
the dimensions of the page, text-block, and margins in Renaissance books.12 For example, most
sheets of paper were manufactured in simple ratios, which also meant that the dimensions of
most books’ leaves were in simple ratios: broadsides, quartos, and duodecimos have wider page
dimensions with the ratio of 4:3; folios, octavos, and sextodecimos have narrower page
dimensions with the ratio of 3:2. In one frequently-employed layout, the height of the text-block
is equal to the width of the leaf; the measure (width) of the text-block is established by mirroring
the ratios of the leaf dimensions (table 3.1). The text-block is then positioned on the page such

12

109

that the dimensions of the bottom, outer, top, and inner margins are in a respective ratio of
6:4:3:2.
The literature on this subject describes these relationships as harmonious in a casual
sense, merely evoking its musical meaning.13 I wish to highlight the harmony of this design in a
more literal sense. The relationship between single pages and two-page spreads relies on the
concept of inverse proportions. Historically speaking, the simplest method of finding these
proportions was to conceive of them as musical intervals. The proportion 3:2 represents the
diapente (interval of the perfect fifth) and the proportion 4:3 represents the diatessaron (interval
of the perfect fourth); their relationship by inversion was most easily demonstrable by reference
to musical terminology. The dimensions of the margins manifest a preference for simple
harmonic ratios. The language for expressing these numerical and proportional relationships was
pioneered first within the field of music theory by Pythagoras and perfected by Boethius.14 Even
during the Renaissance, notions of music as a branch of philosophy continued to be bound up in
the study of proportions and proportionality.15
The proportions of the margins in the example above (6:4:3:2) are familiar to
musicologists from the debate over Guillaume Dufay’s motet Nuper rosarum flores, composed
for the consecration of the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore at Florence in 1453. In 1973,
Charles Warren claimed that the proportional lengths of sections of the motet mirrored the
architectural proportions of the basilica; in 1994, Craig Wright argued instead that the motet

mirrored the proportions of King Solomon’s temple.16 Warren and Wright suggest a mystical
connection between musical composition and architecture. I suggest instead that the shared
proportion shows how composition and architecture used terms of music theory to endow objects
with aesthetic meaning; put another way, both composition and architecture were practical
applications of pure mathematical arts.17 In this sense, basic principles of music theory were
crucial tools for any kind of design that emphasized proportion, whether it was manifested
visually, sonically, or metaphysically. The proportions of varying page layouts carry with them
distinct expressive meanings, different nonverbal signals about how the text should be read.
The partitioning of the text-block into columns was another such non-verbal signal about
language and content-matter. Like margins, columns offered an additional sense of visual
punctuation and clarity. During the Renaissance, most printed books about music used a singlecolumn layout. Layouts with multiple columns were reserved for texts on technical subjects,
especially law and theology; they also were common in liturgical reference works (missals,
breviaries, etc.).18 Works on technical subjects benefitted from a columnar layout because they
often contained long words or complicated syntax. The shorter line lengths of a column layout
allowed printers to avoid placing several long words on a single line; more frequent line breaks
compensated for syntactical complexity by helping readers proceed down the column more
rapidly.19 One prominent example of a book about music with a two-column layout is Guillermo
de Podio’s Ars musicorum (1495). In this folio-sized book, the columnar layout compensates for

the highly technical nature of the text, which proceeds systematically through nearly every topic
of importance to practicing musicians.20 The layout invokes the look of liturgical music books,
especially in the extended musical examples clustered at the end of the book. As a book that
questioned the precepts of those writing before him, especially Gaffurius and Ramis, its layout
invoked the authority of the church and a seriousness of purpose. This was in stark contrast to the
works of Gaffurius and Ramis, clearly linked to their courtly and scholarly ambitions outside the
church. Because the single-column layout was not as prevalent in books during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries as it is today, its prevalence in Renaissance books about music is therefore
significant. Single-column layouts were associated with books that employed a more casual
style, simpler terminology, and looser syntax.21 Whether this is actually true of the language in
books with a single-column layout is immaterial; I showed in chapter two that music theorists
themselves conceded a tendency to write in a convoluted manner. Rather, the single-column
layout appears to have been a printer’s connotative statement to readers about the language and
subject matter of such works.
The appearance of the text itself was shaped by the printer’s selection of typeface.
Typefaces were modeled on fifteenth-century styles of handwriting, which fell broadly into two
categories, blackletter and roman, each with several variants.22 Blackletter scripts and typefaces
were the most common across Europe during the Renaissance; its variants were associated with
particular regions (e.g., fraktur and textura with Germany, bastarda with France, rotunda with
Bologna, etc.). Roman scripts and typefaces emerged in the wake of Petrarch’s reactions to

112

blackletter script, but were confined to the local context of intellectual circles in Italy, especially
Florence and Venice; Petrarch alleged that his script was modeled on ancient Roman
handwriting, originating the usage of the term “gothic” as a pejorative descriptor of blackletter
scripts.23 The points of contrast between these two families of typefaces are visually apparent—
blackletter emphasized the separation of penstrokes, roman the continuity; blackletter
emphasized a heavy contrast between thick and thin penstrokes, roman a relative uniformity of
thickness.
Each family of typeface carried an expressive meaning tied to its perceived origins;
blackletter stood for authority and tradition, whereas roman stood for insight and the recovery of
older knowledge. Within individual works, changes in typeface (whether between families of
type or variants within a single family) also carried expressive meaning, indicating changes in
structure or authorial voice (e.g., identifying quotations or dialogue). Naturally, many scripts and
typefaces borrowed from different families and not every instance of a typeface’s usage
necessarily invokes its origins or connotative meaning. One instance, however, of a strong
correlation between a typeface, its origins, and expressive meaning is italic type. First employed
by Florentine and Venetian scribes during the fifteenth century, italic script combined elements
of roman script with the Italianate varieties of blackletter, especially rotunda.24 The first italic
typeface was introduced by Aldus Manutius at Venice around 1500 after acquiring a ten-year
privilege to protect his exclusive right to use it.25 Its association both with Florentine humanists
and with the Aldine firm led to italic script becoming known as humanistic script. Through the

beginning of the seventeenth century, the use of italic typefaces in printed books connoted social
status and learnedness.26
These elements of page layout and type design—considered together with the textual and
paratextual devices considered in chapter two (title pages and colophons, visual decoration,
indices, textual segmentation, and marginal annotations)—established a book’s mise-en-page, its
characteristic disposition of content on the page. This constituted the main point of connection
between the author and the reader. In the section that follow, I posit three basic archetypal page
designs common among Renaissance books about music, showing how their layout mediates the
communication of meaning with regard to language, genre, audience, and regional context. I do
not intend these archetypes to be the only available options; they were put into practice flexibly,
often borrowing elements of different designs, and some instances defy categorization. Rather, I
propose that these archetypes represent typographical conventions common in Renaissance
books about music, which could be altered or avoided as suited a printer’s and author’s needs.

The scholastic page
This design is particular to books about music that approach the subject of music primarily from
a philosophical perspective. Notable examples include Nicolò Burzio, Musices opusculum
(1487); Guillermo de Podio, Ars musicorum (1495); Franchinus Gaffurius, Theorica musice
(1492); the folio editions of Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples, Musica libris quatuor demonstrata
(1496); and Giorgio Valla’s translation of Cleonides, Harmonicum introductorium (1497). Many
exemplars of this design archetype, such as the books by Lefèvre d’Étaples and Valla, are
miscellany volumes associated with university instruction. The Lefèvre d’Étaples volume, for

26

114

example, contains his edition of Jordanus de Nemore’s thirteenth-century book on arithmetic, an
original book about music, a commentary on Boethius’s approach to arithmetic, and instructions
on playing rithmomachia, a board game used to teach number theory.27 The full title represents
both the scope of its content and the printers’ perplexity over what to call the book:
In hoc opere contenta. | Arithmetica decem libris demonſtrata | Muſica libris
demonſtrata quattuor | Epitome ī libros arithmeticos diui Seuerini Boetij |
Rithmimachie ludus գ & pugna nūero appellaŧ28
Contained in this work are: Arithmetica explained in ten books, Musica explained
in four books, Epitome of the books on arithmetic by St. Severinus Boethius,
Rythmomachia, a game named for and played by numbers.
The intent of the edition, as stated in the colophon, is to provide complete instruction in the two
chief quadrivial arts (arithmetic and music), “given by Jean Higman and Wolfgang Hopyl for the
benefit of students.”29 The Burzio and Podio volumes, both standalone works, were likewise
used for instruction respectively at the universities of Bologna and Salamanca.30 Given their
context in university education, most scholastic books are in Latin.
The design of the scholastic page presents a book’s text as compactly and as efficiently as
possible; figure 3.1 provides a representative example from the Lefèvre d’Étaples book. Foliosize pages with narrow margins minimize wasted space on the page. Illustrations, sometimes
copious, are presented in the margins; this meant that illustrations were sometimes trimmed out

of the book.31 Combined with frequent orthographic abbreviations, the uniformly narrow
letterforms of the blackletter typeface (in this case a variety of bastarda) allowed a longer
measure, typically between 80 and 100 characters per line including spaces; modern books tend
to use between 45 and 75 characters per line.32 The text-block in the Lefèvre d’Étaples volume is
also quite long, 62 lines. In this example, the printer employs two different sizes of the same

typeface (one each for the headings and the remaining text), although the contrast between them
is minimal to conserve space on the page. Margins are not increased to accommodate any
paratextual aids; this example includes a short headline, section numbers, and signatures (not in
the figure). The section numbers notably are placed in the inner margins, buried in the gutter of
the book. Ornamentation is kept to a minimum; decorative initials are reserved only for the
beginnings of major structural divisions (e.g., the beginning of ending of part of a book). The
capitulus (the ancestor of the modern pilcrow, ¶) is used to indicate the beginnings of sentences
and paragraphs, often unceremoniously in the middle of a line.33 Additional leading or
whitespace is given sparingly between paragraphs or sections.
By maximizing the use of space on the page, the printers of the Lefèvre d’Étaples book
made it economical and profitable. Owing to the folio format, narrow margins, and minimal
spacing, the book used as few sheets as possible. At this time, Lefèvre d’Étaples was a professor
of philosophy at the University of Paris, which meant that his books were reliable sellers for
printers catering to students. Between 1492 and 1503, Higman and Hopyl printed at least eight
books by Lefèvre d’Étaples, all of which teach various branches of natural philosophy.34 After
around 1503, Henri Estienne emerged as the main printer at Paris catering to university students,
reprinting many of the volumes first brought out by Higman and Hopyl. Such a design drove
down costs, which helped increase earnings. It also kept the book thin, maximizing its
convenience and portability for students.

Profit was not the only factor that drove the shaping of the scholastic page. The design of
the page supported the nature of scholastic writing, which admitted a plurality of authorial
voices. Many such books about music aim to bring classic works to new audiences or to present
them with a new twist. The publications of Lefèvre d’Étaples, for example, rely heavily on
Aristotle and Boethius, presenting the precepts of these classical and medieval authors within an
updated fifteenth-century intellectual framework. The scholastic mise-en-page masks the shifts
in authorial perspective, making it difficult to distinguish what is new and what is old. The net
effect is to present the entire book as an accumulation of reflections and meditations on older
thought.

The humanistic page
This design is particular to books about music that consider the subject in a spirit of discovery or
exploration, especially with a practical bent. As such, they generally present new ideas or
theories within a monographic scope or vision. Such books tended to be written by authors
without a university affiliation and were aimed not at students, but at a general literate public.
Notable examples include Pietro Aaron, Toscanello in musica (1523); Heinrich Glarean,
Dodecachordon (1547); Othmar Luscinius, Musurgia seu praxis musicae (1536);35 Nicola
Vicentino, L’antica musica (1555); and Gioseffo Zarlino, Le istitutioni harmoniche (1558).
Humanistic page design emerged out of the coalescence of individual variations to
scholastic page design. The most characteristic feature of humanistic page design is the more
generous usage of whitespace, which led a simpler, more minimalistic appearance (figure 3.2).

35

This particular edition has a very unusual bibliographical format. It results from sheets folded three times (i.e.,
once into thirds and once into halves) to form six leaves in oblong orientation. This format also is found in table 4.1.

118

Figure 3.2. The humanistic page. Sample two-page layout in Heinrich Glarean, Dodecachordon
(Basel: Heinrich Petri, 1547), 174–75.

This is manifested in a variety of ways. Most importantly, page margins, especially the bottom
and outer margins, are more ample. This in turn creates a smaller text-block. Glarean’s
Dodecachordon, for example, has a text-block with a maximum measure of 70 characters and
maximum height of 39 lines. Further significative aspects of the design are a taller and wider
typeface of a roman variety and larger paper (resulting in a leaf with maximum leaf dimensions
210 × 319 millimeters; cf. 204 × 289 millimeters for the Lefèvre d’Étaples volume).36 A more

36

These dimensions are composite, taking the largest individual measurements from different copies of these books.
Few surviving copies retain the original sizes of their pages because new owners frequently had their books trimmed
and rebound.

119

direct comparison with the Lefèvre d’Étaples volume analyzed above comes from Zarlino’s
Istitutioni (1558), which uses an italic typeface with similar height and width as the blackletter in
the Lefèvre d’Étaples. The text-block in Zarlino’s book has a maximum measure of 93 characters
and maximum height of 52 lines, still significantly smaller than most examples of scholastic
page design. Zarlino’s treatise also is printed on larger paper (resulting in a leaf with maximum
dimensions 213 × 308 millimeters), which accommodates bigger margins without decreasing the
amount of text on the page. An important factor in the increased use of whitespace was the wider
availability of cheap paper during the course of the sixteenth century.
Additional whitespace also accompanies major textual divisions. In Glarean’s book,
chapter headings have additional leading, visually separating the end of one chapter and the start
of the next. Heinrich Petri, the book’s printer, also uses three sizes of type with a high level of
contrast to reinforce divisions within the text. Drop caps are given at the beginnings of chapters
in the largest typeface. Headlines and the first lines of chapter headings are given in a medium
typeface. The remainder of the text (body text, remaining lines of chapter headings, folios,
signatures, and catchwords) are given in a small typeface. (An even smaller typeface appears
inside illustrations and tables.) Whitespace also marks internal divisions within the text. The
figure shows that a quotation from Horace—as we shall see, to Glarean’s great displeasure—is
accompanied by additional leading above and below and indented at the left. This identifies the
quotation as such and allows different authorial voices to be distinguished with ease. At the same
time, this identifies these other voices as outside Glarean’s narrative, seeming to downplay their
importance. Names of other writers and historical figures discussed by Glarean, such as Erasmus
and Jesus Christ, are given occasionally in small caps; this also highlights the visual contrast
between different voices. Further stylization appears in the form of decorative initials, which

120

appear at the beginnings of each part of the book. The decorative initials and drop caps reinforce
the hierarchy of in the structure of the book, respectively marking major divisions within the
book and divisions with each part of the book.
The placement of illustrative material also is more integrated on the humanistic page than
on the scholastic page. Scholastic book design tended to relegate illustrations to the margins or
inset them with lines of text, whereas humanistic book design placed them primarily as blocks,
temporarily pausing the flow of text. Illustrations narrower than the measure of the text-block are
centered almost universally within the text-block; this introduced additional whitespace between
the edges of an illustration and the start of the page margins. The whitespace has the effect of
drawing the eye to the illustrations, promoting their importance. Regardless of authorial intent,
marginal illustrations, merely because they are not integrated visually with the text, appear to be
less important, as afterthoughts or as impure physical manifestations of ideal, intangible thought.
(Not coincidentally, the outer margins are what one touches as one leafs through a book.)
Humanistic books about music tend to be more extensively illustrated, demonstrating an
important shift in attitudes toward exemplarity suggested by Erasmus.37 Cristle Collins Judd
argues that this was particularly important in books about music, which depended on musical
examples to illustrate abstract ideas in ways that other subjects did not.38 The integration and
centering of illustrations within the text-block provides a perfect visual analogy to their
increasing prevalence and centrality within music discourse during the Renaissance.39

On this phenomenon, see Balensuela, “Ut hec te figura docet”; and Whittaker, “Musical Exemplarity,” both of
which trace this development to the late fifteenth century.

121

An important typographical feature of the humanistic page is its use of roman and italic
typefaces. Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin were among the first modern scholars to argue
that the increasing prevalence of roman and italic typefaces represented the ascendancy of
humanistic thought, and a number of scholars have offered useful refinements to this assertion.40
These scholars have established that, during the Renaissance, roman scripts and typefaces were
perceived to be modeled on ancient Roman paleography and associated strongly with humanistic
circles of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Although, in the context of books about music,
they were first introduced in otherwise scholastic page designs (e.g., Gaffurius, Theorica musice,
1492), roman typefaces are a distinctive marker for humanistic page. The simplicity and
individuality of roman letterforms lent them a readability that was lacking in blackletter. This,
combined with the larger page sizes and wider margins, represented a significant break with
scholastic models of book design, emphasizing newness of thought, especially as a reflection of
ancient wisdom.41 Readers and potential buyers might have been able to see this in the pages of
humanistic books before they could read about it.
The increasing use of vernacular languages marked an important shift in the development
of writing about music during the Renaissance. The use of roman and italic typefaces visually
accompanied this linguistic shift. The first widely-read book about music in the Italian
vernacular was Pietro Aaron’s Toscanello. The work was printed, reprinted, and revised at
Venice during the sixteenth century (five editions, 1523–1562), consistently mimicking the
house style of Aldus Manutius with a relatively large roman typeface, generous margins, and an
uncluttered humanistic design. Beginning in the 1540s, Italian books about music, especially

122

those issuing from Venice, and even those in Latin, consistently began to employ italic
typefaces. An early example of this was Aaron’s Lucidario (1545), an Italian-language edition in
quarto. The use of italic typefaces in Italian books about music came to be so consistent that its
occasional absence became noteworthy. Writing in 1789, Charles Burney noted the following of
Tigrini’s Compendio della musica (1588):
This Compendium is not only well digested by the author, but rendered more clear
and pleasant in the perusal, by the printer, who has made use of large Roman
types, instead of Italic, in which most of the books that were published in Italy,
before the present century, were printed.42
Italic and roman typefaces were an important component of the humanistic page, although they
were not exclusive to it. The typography and design of the humanistic page functioned as a
nonverbal cue for, and visually reinforced, humanistic kinds of writing about music.

The dialogic page
This design is particular to books that provide comprehensive instruction in a single area within
the study of music. The dialogic page is common among textbooks, although it is not restricted
to books used for classroom instruction. Although such works typically have a single author,
they provide the service to readers of digesting a large volume of existing literature or previous
thought. Notable examples include Giovanni Maria Artusi, L’arte del contraponto ridotta in
tavole (1586 and 1589, in folio); Heinrich Faber, Compendiolum musicae pro incipientibus (first
ed. 1548, in octavo); Giovanni Maria Lanfranco, Scintille di musica (1533, in oblong quarto);
Thomas Morley, A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597, in folio); and
Oratio Tigrini, Il compendio della musica (1588, in upright quarto). The typographical design of

the dialogic page made it useful in a variety of different literary contexts, and thus it appeared in
books of every bibliographical format.
The design of the dialogic page is basically humanistic in orientation, but to a different
effect (figure 3.3). Abundant whitespace and a smaller text-block reflects a continued emphasis
on readability while clarifying the structure of the text at all levels, even individual phrases or
sentences. The essential point of contrast with the humanistic page is the stylization of multiple
authorial voices typical of these works.43 Faber’s Compendiolum musicae pro incipientibus, an
immensely popular textbook written for the German Latin schools (53 known editions, 1548–
1608), provides a case in point. Faber’s treatise is written as a catechism, a dialogue in questionand-answer format imitating the rote method of learning in the classroom:
What are connected notes called? When two or more simple notes are connected
by a stroke on the right or left sides, these commonly are called ligatures.
How many kinds of ligatures are there? Two: square and oblique.

43

My discussion of dialogues and dialogic thought is indebted to Cox, The Renaissance Dialogue; Judd, “Music in
Dialogue”; and Rigolot, “Problematizing Exemplarity.”

124

What is a square ligature? […]
Why are oblique ligature so named? […]44
The two voices are distinguished typographically; the questions are set in roman type and the
answers in italic type. Although there is no direct evidence to indicate this occurred, it would
have been simple for teachers and students in a classroom to use Faber’s book together, each
reading their respective parts of the dialogue. The terse linguistic style was suited ideally for
students still learning Latin grammar; indeed, the classification and definition of vocabulary
terms is a significant objective of Faber’s text. The book was translated in German by Christoph
Rid (Musica, ein kurtzer Inhalt, first ed. 1572); Adam Gumpeltzhaimer later edited both Faber’s
and Rid’s versions, printing them in a side-by-side Latin–German edition (Compendium musicae
pro illius artis tironibus, first ed. 1591).45 Gumpelzhaimer’s edition allowed German pupils to
follow the Latin more easily, suggesting the book’s value for language acquisition.
Books sometimes were reprinted with different page designs and layouts, which altered
the framing of the texts for their readers. I analyzed above the first edition of Jacques Lefèvre
d’Étaples Musica libris quatuor demonstrata (1496) as an exemplar of scholastic book design. In
1551 and 1552, the Parisian printer Guillaume Cavellat brought out new editions of this work.
Cavellat’s letter to the reader—a feature lacking in earlier editions—describes his reasons for
bringing the book to light:

44

Faber, Compendiolum (1580), sig. B3v. “Quae dicuntur ligatae [notae]? | Cùm duae vel plures simplices notae per
virgulam in | dextra vel sinistra parte coniuguntur. Atqȝ communi- | ter ligaturae vocantur. | Quotuplex est ligatura?
| Duplex. | Recta & obliqua. | Quae est recta? | […] | Quae dicitur obliqua?”

Figure 3.4. Another example of the dialogic page. Sample two-page layout in Jacques Lefèvre
d’Étaples, Musica libris quatuor demonstrata (Paris: Guillaume Cavellat, 1551), fol. 13v–14r.
This figure is scaled down in size to facilitate comparison with figure 3.1, the same passage on
the scholastic page.

I sense that there is a great lack of Latin writing on music, especially that which is
written knowledgeably and methodically. There are few copies of such works and
they have not been corrected adequately. This can be seen as the cause of why
music often is considered inferior.46
Cavellat’s editions employ a dialogic design, which re-envisions the text as a commentary on
the sparse ancient writing about music (figure 3.4). The editions, in upright quarto format,
employ the more generous whitespace of the humanistic page to create a more readable textblock with a measure of 78 characters and a height of 37 lines on a leaf with maximum
dimensions 140 × 192 millimeters. The beginnings of sections also are marked visually with

46

“Intelligo Latinorum musicorum magnam penuriam, eorum praesertim qui artem calluerint, & methodo
scripserint, exemplaria non adeo multa & ea non satis emendata, quae causa videri potest, cur musice minus sit
frequens.” Lefèvre d’Étaples, Musica libris quatuor demonstrata (1552), fol. [1]v.

126

additional whitespace; the beginning of each major part is marked with a decorative initial
capital. The illustrative material is simplified and placed within the text-block.
Cavellat’s editions of the Lefèvre d’Étaples volume use both roman and italic typefaces.
The contrast between the typefaces marks shifts in authorial voice: roman type is given for timetested precepts and axioms, italic type given for the author’s explanations and commentary. The
effect is different from that of the humanistic page. The dialogic page marks different voices to
privilege their perspectives, whereas the humanistic page marks them to minimize them.
Cavellat’s edition, like Higman’s and Hopyl’s, was probably intended for students at the
University of Paris; after all, his shop was located at “the Sign of the Fat Chicken across from the
Collège de Cambrai,” a department within the University of Paris.47 The difference in
appearance has a dramatic effect on the way a reader might have interfaced with Lefèvre
d’Étaples’s text. Here the old precepts and new explanations receive equal priority, like in the
catechistic volumes analyzed above. These two authorial voices are interdependent, each one
needing the other as a reason for existence; neither the terse precepts nor the more verbose
explanations could stand alone. The dialogic page makes this dual purpose visible
typographically, in a way that was disguised on the scholastic page and minimized on the
humanistic page.
Illustrations in the dialogic page function as material for further investigation and
reflection. In Faber’s Compendiolum, the musical examples function as sites of interaction
between the different speakers in the dialogue.48 Some examples in the book act as samples that

Bishops, after its founders) and was later the site of the Collège Royale de France; The History of Paris, 2:291–95.

The following discussion is indebted to Judd, “Music in Dialogue.”

127

students present to the teacher; others are presented by the teacher for student discussion or
performance. This conceit draws readers imaginatively into the book’s discursive framework,
inviting them to consider multiple perspectives on an illustration of a given subject. The dialogue
prompts the reader to consider what other particular examples might be adduced as
demonstrations of a given subject. This is different from the humanistic presentation of
illustrations, which function more as proofs of concept, ideal and authoritative instantiations of a
given theory. The monological character of the humanistic page narrates and argues, while the
polyphonic character of the dialogic page invites participation and independent thought.
Examples of the dialogic page need not be dialogues in themselves while incorporating a
dialogic character in their texts and designs. For example, Lanfranco’s Scintille (not a dialogue),
Tigrini’s Compendio (not a dialogue), and Morley’s Introduction (a dialogue) all include lists of
authors whose works are recommended to readers.49 Throughout these works, the names of these
writers are mentioned and their works are discussed. Furthermore, Tigrini’s and Morley’s books
make ample use of printed marginal annotations to highlight the contributions of other authors.
Although these works do indeed make their own original contributions, their conception is
unabashedly unoriginal. The scholastic page allowed authors to stand on the shoulders of
previous writers, improving and building on them by degrees; the humanistic page allowed
authors to emphasize their own original insights while citing relevant authorities. In contrast, the
dialogic page allowed authors to incorporate previous writers as equals, experts whose ideas
needed contextualization and curation, not improvement. The original contribution was to collate

49

Lanfranco, Scintille (1533), sig. π3v (“i nomi di coloro, dietro alle cui pedate ne i nostri ragionamenti noi siano
seguitti”); Tigrini, Compendio (1588), sig. π4r–π4v (“tanti Eccellenti scrittori”); and Morley, Introduction (1597),
sig. 3χ4v (“Authors whose authorities be either cited or used in this booke”).

128

and bring together the wisdom of various authorities. Tigrini articulates this purpose in his letter
to readers, appended above the list of authors cited in his book:
Having resolved, my most humane readers, to collect together all those things that
I have judged to be most useful and necessary to the art of counterpoint, which are
found in so many widespread and scattered writers that they can hardly be
understood, it seemed fitting to me to make a selection from all that has been said
by the most noble and excellent authors, and to arrange them together with as
great a brevity as possible such that those who desire to learn this art will trouble
themselves less by going around searching for them now in this or now in that
author.50
The dialogic page makes this selection and curation visually apparent by allowing these voices to
be distinguished. In chapter two, I observed that, during the course of the Renaissance, sections
of text in books about music became shorter and the number of sections in a given book
increased. This was most prominent in textbooks and other sorts of compendia and digests. The
employment of shorter sections and more of them accompanied their dialogic typographical
presentation, which allotted more whitespace at these structural interstices.

Section summary
Because this is a new formulation, it is worth restating briefly the features of each design
archetype I have proposed, in order to highlight their direct points of contrast. The scholastic
page presents content as compactly on the page as possible, avoids extraneous whitespace, and
presents the text with minimal decoration. The effect of this manner of presentation is to blend
authorial voices and to emphasize the continuity of intellectual traditions. Books with such a

50
“Havendo io deliberato Lettori miei humanissimi, raccorre insieme tutte quelle cose, lequali ho giudicato essere
piu utili, & necessarie all’Arte del Contapunto, che appresso molti scrittori tanto diffuse, & sparse si trovano, che
maleagevolmente comprendere si possono, mi è parso à proposito, tra tutte quelle che da i piu nobili, & eccellenti
Autori sono state dette, farne una scelta, & con quella brevtà maggiore, che sia possibile ridurele insieme, acciò che
quelli, che desiderano imparare tal Arte, meno s’affatichino in andarle hora in questo, hora in quello Autore
ricercando.” Tigrini, Compendio (1588), sig. π4r.

129

design often (but not exclusively) are in folio format; employ blackletter typefaces; are in Latin
or a decorous vernacular style; combine multiple works destined for university students; and date
from the 1470s through the 1520s, although the scholastic page continued throughout the
sixteenth century, especially in Germany.
The humanistic page presents content expansively, employs ample whitespace, and
visually highlights textual structures and hierarchies. Illustrations are integrated into the textblock, mirroring their deep embedding within the discursive framework. The effect of this
manner of presentation is to highlight the author’s contributions to the field of knowledge and to
present these as departures from previous knowledge. Books with such a design often (but not
exclusively) are in folio or quarto format; employ roman and especially italic typefaces; are in a
casual vernacular or Latin style; prioritize the vision of a single author; and date from the 1520s
through 1580s.
The dialogic page follows the humanistic page in its expansive presentation of content
and clarity of structural divisions. Illustrations are integrated into the text-block, but function in
myriad ways depending on their presentation in the text. The perspectives of multiple authors are
reflected in different typefaces and set apart in lists, marginal annotations, and other paratextual
devices, marking them as authorities on equal footing with the author. Books with such a design
are in any bibliographical format; mix typefaces, especially to reflect changes in language or
authorial voice; are in a casual or simplistic style; prioritize the views of several authors; and
date from after the 1530s.
Attending to the design of Renaissance books about music allows one to make fine
distinctions among books that might otherwise seem homogenous in subject, method, or literary
style. Book design also permits one to understand why certain books assume the shapes that they

130

do. The process of adapting and translating works for the medium of print involved decisions
about how to present the work to readers. Such decisions were neither cosmetic adornments nor
defaults of a house style. A book’s design makes an argument about its text—different designs
make different arguments. The three design types that I have proposed in this section clearly are
not the only available options. I hope, however, to have shown how a variety of factors influence
the way a book appears and the relationship between its appearance and the meanings possible
within the text itself. In the following section, I explore in depth another site of negotiation in
Renaissance books about music, showing how the technological possibilities and limits of
moveable musical type influenced the ways that authors and readers conceived of their musictheory books.

The struggle for score format
For many readers, the most intriguing aspect of Renaissance music was counterpoint. Still today,
neophytes quickly understand that reining in polyphonic voices requires a good ear and careful
study. Before the emergence of printing technology, instruction in counterpoint occurred orally
between student and teacher and occasionally in manuscripts with a very limited circulation. The
first printed books on counterpoint coincided with the first attempts to unify musica speculativa
and musica practica; that is, printed counterpoint treatises, more than those on other musical
topics, blended aspects of different strands of music-theoretical thought such as the rudiments of
musical notation, harmonics and advanced mathematics, musical aesthetics, and so on.
Furthermore, the most significant Renaissance books about music discussed the rules of
counterpoint, even when ostensibly about other subjects—Gaffurius’s Practica (1496), Aaron’s
Toscanello (1523), Glarean’s Dodecachordon (1547), and Zarlino’s Istitutioni (1558), to name
only the most prominent examples. This only further whetted public appetite for information
131

about the secret musical art of counterpoint, satisfied in the later sixteenth century by such
counterpoint manuals as Tigrini’s Compendio della musica (1588) and Artusi’s L’arte del
contraponto ridotta in tavole (1586).
Musical examples played a key role in teaching the rules of counterpoint in books about
music. Jessie Ann Owens has presented a survey of the kinds of notational formats (i.e., the
various visual dispositions of multiple voices on the page) employed in counterpoint treatises.51
Of the rich variety of notational formats, score format was the most effective for teaching how to
interweave musical lines. Score format, unlike others that present each voice in disjunct spaces,
collates each part so that congruent moments in the parts are vertically aligned (at least roughly).
Barring at a regular temporal interval allows the reader to track and compare the lines with ease.
An arrangement of the parts, usually one but sometimes more per staff, from low to high allows
harmonic intervals to be reckoned quickly. Edward E. Lowinsky has shown that scores emerged,
both in print and manuscript, around 1530.52 A number of scholars working in Lowinsky’s wake
have explored the function of scores, showing their use in study and performance at the
keyboard.53 A recent study by Christine Jeanneret explores the technical production of printed
scores after 1580.54 In this section, I explore the obstacles that prevented their prevalence in
books about music in spite of their seemingly obvious pedagogical and didactic utility. I focus on
the period before 1580, showing how printers used a variety of techniques to print musical
examples, and especially scores, while still protecting their bottom lines and working schedules.

The printers of the earliest music-theory treatises employed a variety of technical
strategies to produce musical notation (see chapter two). Before the maturation of singleimpression music printing, woodcuts were preferred over multiple-impression type.55 Perhaps the
most widely cited example of this is the sole polyphonic example in Nicolò Burzio’s Musices
opusculum (1487; reproduced in figure 3.5 and transcribed in figure 3.6).56 This particular

example often is adduced as one of the drawbacks of the method; given that few engravers had
knowledge of musical notation, the result often was less than elegant.57 Although the execution
of Burzio’s example is undeniably clumsy, I wish to draw attention to the example’s efficient
manner of composition and presentation. The most salient aspect is the presence of homorhythm
among all three voices, and its near total presence in the cantus and tenor voices. The rhythmic
sameness facilitates study by allowing the harmonic intervals between each voice to be followed
with ease (although this is not highlighted in the woodcut). Additionally, except for cadential
moments, Burzio employs a limited harmonic vocabulary confined to the unison, third, and sixth
(and their compounds at the octave) between the upper two voices. The stated purpose of the
musical example is to demonstrate a simple technique for creating counterpoint against a tenor
voice; the musical example is composed to simplify the novice’s task of comparing the harmonic
content of the voices.
Burzio’s example makes several further concessions to the reader. The signum
congruentiae (m. 12) locates the midpoint of the example in case the reader encountered
difficulty tracking the separately-notated voices. Burzio also notates pitch inflection with
redundancy, adding both diesis and mollis signs. These inflections are implicit in the notation
itself; Burzio adds the signs to make his intentions absolutely clear and to illustrate several
singing conventions. The first diesis sign (m. 8) signals a cadence on C. The mollis sign (m. 17)
demonstrates the rule “una nota supra la semper est canendum fa” (i.e., the F is to be solmized as
fa, preceded and followed by E as la); the final diesis sign (m. 22) warns against a potential

la musica (1523), sig. I3r.

misapplication of this rule (i.e., the B is to be solmized as mi, not fa).58 These moments of
notational redundancy acted as hints to the reader and might demonstrate an early awareness of
the need to make an example’s content and didactic purpose clear for readers.
Sixteenth-century authors and printers preserved this tradition of presenting musical
examples carefully. Pietro Aaron’s Toscanello in musica (1523) contains eighty-two woodcut
musical examples presented in various ways. Six examples are allotted an entire page each. Over
half (44 examples) are set off as blocks that appear after the conclusion of a sentence. The
remainder (32 examples) are run-in with the text, with the notation interrupting midsentence. The
physical production of Aaron’s Toscanello required careful coordination between its author, its
printers Bernardino and Matteo de Vitali, and the unknown engraver who produced the large
quantity of woodcuts. The quality and consistency of their craftsmanship is remarkable—there
are very few errors and their design accomplishes their didactic purpose.59 For example, Aaron’s
demonstration of imperfect consonances (figure 3.7) improves on Burzio’s example thirty-six
years prior. Here the notes are given in equal values and their intervallic composition is labeled

58

The quality of these woodcuts, combined with their close resemblance to his other work, might suggest that
Andrea Antico, whose activities between 1521 and 1533 are unknown otherwise, was the engraver.

136

explicitly (“thirds and sixths with the tenor” and “thirds and sixths with the soprano”).
Furthermore, each voice appears on a single staff exactly one line long and the voices are
vertically aligned. The woodcutter, either mimicking the author’s copy or following the
instructions of the author or printer, executes the example to demonstrate its purpose in a clear
manner.
This example required the vertical alignment of each voice and the placement of a textual
legend below each staff; accomplishing both presented a technical challenge for the printer.
There were two possible solutions, although the printer’s and woodcutter’s exact choice is
unknown. The first solution was to create two blocks with one staff each, which made the
placement of text between them simple. But this made the vertical alignment of the voices
difficult to achieve because the two blocks had to be engraved independently. The second
solution was to create a single block with both staves and then to saw it in half to make room for
the text.60 In either case, the printer and engraver took extra steps to execute the example
correctly, which required an additional outlay of time and money. The end result has a visual
simplicity that masks the significant effort expended on its creation. The vertical alignment of
the voices allowed the reader to verify Aaron’s comments about its composition. The two later
editions published during Aaron’s lifetime (1529 and 1539) used the same woodcuts, indicating
that they were in Aaron’s possession—he was, after all, the holder of the work’s privilege, not
the printer. The proud advertisement “CON PRIVILEGIO” at the bottom of the title page
confirms this point about Aaron’s perception of the work’s value; in the first edition (1523),

60
A further possibility was that engraver modified the block into a compartment—that is, a single block with
gouged holes into which type was inserted. This seems unlikely, as woodcut compartments were reserved for
elements applicable to many editions, such as borders or ornaments; Krummel and Sadie, Music Printing and
Publishing, 500. This solution also can be ruled out definitively, because the reprints of 1529 and 1539 (made with
the same woodcuts) contain slightly less vertical space between the staves, indicating that they were two
independent blocks. It remains uncertain whether these were engraved initially as one or two blocks.

137

these words are set off in black ink, in contrast to the red ink of the rest of the title.61 In this case,
the author and several craftsmen worked in close collaboration to achieve a result that was
designed optimally for the reader.
Single-impression musical type greatly simplified the incorporation of musical examples
into books about music and enlarged the range of examples that were possible. Not only was the
necessity of hiring a woodcutter eliminated, but also the owner or lessee of a font of musical type
could typeset as many musical examples as the font permitted at no cost other than time. Run-in
examples—which account for about a third of Aaron’s examples and which likely required a
great deal of fiddling by the woodcutter and printer—became simple to execute; individual sorts
(i.e., pieces of type containing a single letter or glyph) of musical type could be combined with
sorts of alphabetical type. The only complication was the different heights of the sorts; musical
type tended to be taller than alphabetical type. Zarlino’s Istitutioni (1558), like Aaron’s
Toscanello, presents musical examples using a number of notational formats and manners of
presentation. Run-in examples are plentiful (figure 3.8), allowing Zarlino to discuss with
exacting specificity very small pieces of musical information. Zarlino also presents polyphonic
examples in separate parts, each given its separate own space on the page (figure 3.9). Such
examples follow Burzio’s and Aaron’s technique of homorhythm. In this instance, the addition
of bar lines, like the signum in Burzio’s example, helps the reader track the voices through
musical time.

Zarlino’s Istitutioni also makes use of printed scores from single-impression musical
type. The first scores in books about music appeared in Martin Agricola’s Musica instrumentalis
deudsch (1529) and Auctor Lampadius’s Compendium musices (1537); both examples are
produced through woodcuts.62 The majority of Zarlino’s scores are short duos in a simple

Bermudo, Declaracion de instrumentos musicales (Osuna: Juan de Leon, 1555), fol. 83r.

contrapuntal style; many printed scores before 1580 share these characteristics.63 One reason for
their brevity and simplicity might be that vertically aligning the parts required extra sorts of
blank staff lines—because different polyphonic voices tend to move at different rates, printers
had to insert filler sorts to occupy moments when a note is sustained. The result could be jagged
in appearance. See, for example, the score in Juan Bermudo’s Declaracion de instrumentos
musicales (1555; figure 3.10). The printer of this example, Juan de Leon, is obligated to fill
twelve bars of blank staff for the rests in the cantus, altus, and bassus voices, not to mention the
additional sorts needed to align the parts vertically.

63

Owens, Composers at Work, 35–38 designates these as “quasi-scores,” by which she means superimposed staves
without barring or vertical alignment. Zarlino’s scores, in spite of their contrapuntal simplicity, are scores-proper,
superimposed by range, vertically aligned, and barred at regular intervals.

140

Scores made from single-impression musical type presented a fundamental paradox for
authors, printers, and readers of counterpoint treatises. By its very nature, moveable type was
most useful and economical for printing one polyphonic part at a time, each in its own separate
space on the page. Notational formats involving separate parts wasted the least amount of sorts
(i.e., nearly every sort conveyed musical information other than staff lines) and conformed to
musicians’ expectations about the appearance of mensural notation. Yet, as I will show in
chapter four, such formats placed severe restraints on readers’ abilities to make sense of how the
parts fit together, never mind how principles of counterpoint were deployed in a given example.
Scores, it would seem, helped readers understand the contrapuntal construction of musical
examples, but involved waste on the printer’s part. In addition to the extra labor and
typographical material involved, scores required significantly more real estate on the page than
other notational formats, due to the horizontal stretching required of each part to align them
vertically. This also required the compositor to set multiple lines at once and then to justify their
horizontal spacing, which presumably took a significant amount of tweaking to perfect. The
result also tended to be visually unappealing and defied conventions of mensural notation.
Single-impression musical type thus presented new challenges to authors, to printers, and to
readers of musical examples in Renaissance counterpoint treatises. Although scores were suited
ideally to counterpoint treatises, I suggest here that their cost in terms of time, labor, and material
deterred authors and printers from using them. Only in the 1580s, when counterpoint treatises
came into greater demand, did printers deem scores a commercially-viable option in them.
An important and previously unrecognized feature of this phase between the introduction
of single-impression musical type around 1530 and the wider acceptance of scores by printers
around 1580 is a general spirit of experimentation. The obstacle to printing scores appears to

141

Figure 3.11. Woodcut illustration of rules for counterpoint. In Vicente Lusitano, Introduttione
facilissima et novissima (1553), sig. C2v.

have been the nature of moveable type, not lack of willpower. Musicians and printers were keen
to find workarounds to this obstacle. Some of the more successful solutions involved a return to
woodcuts, by then an outmoded method for printing music. Although woodcuts were common in
many kinds of books as decorative elements, woodcut musical notation was rare after around
1530, especially in Italy. After the introduction of moveable musical type, the appearance of
woodcut musical notation generally is confined to musical examples that push beyond the limits
of what was feasible with moveable type.64
Consider, for example, Lusitano’s rehashing of Gaffurius’s rules for counterpoint in the
Introduttione facilissima et novissima (1553; figure 3.11). In the middle of the page, Lusitano
illustrates on a single staff several exceptions to the rules: consecutive perfect intervals created
by voice-crossing, consecutive fifths of unequal quality, and unlimited consecutive thirds and
sixths. Placing two voices on one staff was the most compact solution—using two staves,
whether in score format or some version of separate parts, would have wasted valuable page real

64

Woodcut musical examples also continued to be used by printers who did not have access to musical type;
Vincenzo Luchrino, discussed below, furnishes one example.

142

Figure 3.12. Illustration of rules for counterpoint using nested single-impression moveable

estate.65 Woodcuts were the only technique for creating such an example, short of using nested
type (i.e., a font of type consisting of individual sorts with fewer than five staff lines, which
could be stacked to create the full staff).66 In this example, one notices that the vertical alignment
of notes is inexact; it is not clear whether this was purposeful or a misreading of the text. The
filler staves inserted after the woodcut in single-impression moveable musical type, only after the
first line, is also puzzling. In the second edition (1558; figure 3.12), the example is produced
using nested moveable type, although again the vertical alignment is inexact. The third edition
(1561; figure 3.13) furnishes one of the earliest examples of copperplate engravings of musical

65

Lusitano’s model for these examples may have been Dentice, Duo dialoghi della musica (1552), sig. K4v, which
contains a woodcut musical example with two voices on a single staff in equal note values.

notation.67 The reversion to moveable type for the example of consecutive thirds—a clear
misunderstanding of Lusitano’s intent—demonstrates the kinds of mistakes made by artisans not
familiar with musical notation. After all, this was Francesco Rampazetto’s first book.68
No matter the method of their production—typeset, woodcut, or engraved—combining
musical examples with text presented opportunities for mistakes to printers, even seasoned ones.
One example occurs in Giovanni Maria Lanfranco’s Scintille di musica (1533). The chapter on
the imperfection of the maxima (pp. 59–61) contains seven different musical examples. For the
last example of this chapter, the printer accidentally included the woodcut for the last example of
the next chapter, on the imperfection of the longa, there with the correct woodcut (figure 3.14).

67

Krummel and Sadie, Music Printing and Publishing, 40–54 note that the earliest known example is the
Intabolatura da leuto del divino Francesco da Milano, probably printed sometime before 1536. The Lusitano
example stands as perhaps the next example after this, and is the first example that is securely datable.

Figure 3.14. Error corrected by overprinting. In Giovanni Maria Lanfranco, Scintille di musica
(1533), 61 (top); the overprinted woodcut appears correctly on p. 63 (bottom).

Later realizing his mistake, the printer printed over the first example using woodcut decorative
initials (otherwise absent in the edition), leaving only the second, correct woodcut intact. The
book contains over one hundred woodcut musical examples, both plainchant and mensural, all
monophonic; this marks it as a particularly lavish production for its printer at Brescia, Lodovico
Britannico. I suggest that storing and keeping track of all the woodcuts in the workshop was an
logistical challenge, especially because the Britannico firm did not specialize in music printing or
book illustration at this time.69 The visual similarity of the two examples made the confusion
even more likely; the only substantive difference is the horizontal length of the notehead on the
maxima and longa, an easy feature to confuse.
Renaissance authors of all kinds complained about the inaccuracy of their editions.70
Heinrich Glarean furnishes a particularly vivid example of this practice. Glarean sent more than
a dozen presentation copies of his Dodecachordon (1547) to various individuals, hoping in

exchange for patronage, protection, or gifts.71 Included in these copies are lists of errata and
marginal corrections, which vary among the known presentation copies. Some of Glarean’s
autograph corrections make specific complaints about the printer. The copy at US-Wcm
(prepared from a now-lost presentation copy to Publius Francisco Spinola) includes several
comments about the printing of the treatise:72
These notes should be combined in pairs, which the printer has totally botched.73
This diagram is not made from the original copy, in which two minor semitones
are smaller than a tone, and which wisely may be perused in my house at Freiburg
im Breisgau.74
There was no need for so much spacing when this discourse continues on.75
The tone of Glarean’s marginal corrections varies with respect to his apparent frustration with
the error. The final annotation quoted above also appears in a copy at US-R, which Glarean sent

71

The most detailed study of these presentation copies is Kölbl, “The Politics of Dedication.”

72

The copy contains at the back of the volume four additional flyleaves, beginning with the following inscription:
“Anno Jesu Christo natali MDLIII. | Clarissimo viro P. Francisco Spi= | nolæ Glareanus a Fri= | burgo Brisgoæ | D.
M.” The last page is signed “Glareanus propria manu Anno salutatis 1553. mense | Nouembri. Friburgi Brisgoæ cum
lxv iam per Christi gratiam exis= | set annum…” Glarean, Dodecachordon (1547), back flyl. 1r and 4v (US-Wcm,
shelfmark ML171 .G54 case). None of the inscriptions, however, are in Glarean’s hand, although the content and
style of the annotations match those of other presentation copies securely attributable to Glarean. This exemplar,
then, appears to be a copy made during the late eighteenth century of a now-lost presentation copy for Spinola; there
is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the annotations even if they are not in Glarean’s hand. Weiss, “Vandals,
Students, or Scholars?” 243n briefly discusses this exemplar, labeled incorrectly as an autograph presentation copy.
Kölbl, “The Politics of Dedication,” 62 briefly describes this exemplar.

“Binae notulae colligate | esse debeant. Quae | omnia Typographus | corrupit.” Glarean, Dodecahordon (1547), 82

partitioned into respective diapente and diatessaron; the note indicates, for example, that the D–A and A–D for the
Dorian mode should be ligated.

to the Roman doctor Bartholomeus Emanuel.76 In this version of the note, Glarean plays up the
the spacing of the quotation:
There was no need for such magnificent spacing when this oration continues on.77
The same annotation also appears in a copy at D-Mbs, which Glarean inscribed to Johann
Albrecht Widmanstetter, at the time the chancellor to the Bishop of Augsburg. In this version of
the note, Glarean changes the final phrase in order to ridicule the printer directly:
There was no need for such magnificent spacing, yet here the printer shows
himself to be of no intelligence.78
These different instantiations of autograph corrections show how Glarean negotiated his personal
identity in relation to the printed traces of his thought. By commenting on the physical object,
Glarean distances himself from its inherent imperfections. Correcting printers’ errors gave
authors an opportunity to address readers directly, bypassing the mediation of the printed text.
Even in typeset errata lists, authors seem to whisper to readers behind the backs of their printers.
Not coincidentally, many of Glarean’s autograph corrections appear in musical examples,
diagrams, and illustrations. Musical examples in score format were especially prone to printer
error.79 Books with many scores, such as Tigrini’s Compendio, further highlight the
complications that compositors of early printed scores faced. Typesetting scores represented a

the presentation copies customized for certain recipients, Glarean prepared several copies with boilerplate

deviation from the familiar work routines of compositors. Typically, a compositor worked from
right to left through a text, placing the appropriate sort for each letter or glyph. Upon reaching
the end of a line, the compositor then justified the line, adjusting the spacing between notes as
needed so that the line occupied the full body of page. The compositor then began the next line.
In contrast, typesetting a score likely forced the compositor to alternate between horizontal and
vertical dimensions as he juggled the different voices. The compositor likely set a single measure
at a time, probably from the bottom to the top voice, then justified the measure for optimal
vertical alignment between voices. The process of justifying multiple lines required more
fiddling than with a single line of alphabetic text, as there was a back-and-forth between the
staves. The complex process was jarring to craftsmen accustomed to the repetitive, horizontal
process of typesetting alphabetical texts and music in separate parts.
In summary, a number of factors contributed to the brevity and simplicity of early printed
scores in books about music. The additional material and labor required to produce scores
limited the extent of their application in printed books. Contrapuntally-complex scores also were
more likely to be botched in execution. But this had a pedagogical benefit, as well: practical
constraints kept writers focused on the instructional task at hand, laying bare the precepts of
counterpoint. Brief scores with simpler voices were ideal vehicles for teaching their intended
lessons—assuming readers learned to balance reading the parts both horizontally and vertically.
Complex examples like Tigrini’s furnished less adept readers not with exemplars worthy of
contrapuntal analysis, but with models for imitation, stock gestures to be deployed “in many and
almost infinite other ways.”80 Another benefit to keeping scores short and simple was that it

148

protected the interests of composers and music theorists, who might not want to lay bare every
secret of the art of counterpoint. An important social function of music books was to promote the
status of their authors as authorities on the subject. Withholding or obscuring more advanced
topics likely helped them attract new, eager, and well-heeled students.81 It is worth remembering
that books in general were relatively expensive commodities aimed at the upper echelons of the
literate public.82 Prospective buyers of books about music were precisely those who might be
willing to pay an expert to tutor them in the art of music. Keeping examples of full-length
compositions, especially preexisting ones written by a figure other than the author of a given
book (what scholars have termed, not unproblematically, “real music”), in separate parts ensured
that they were fully accessible only to the best, most able readers.83 This served printers, as
well—such examples were quicker to produce and raised fewer complications, whether in the
form of commissioning and organizing woodcuts or handling typographical errors.

Marketing music theory
In chapter one, I examined the geographical and chronological production of printed books about
music during the Renaissance. A significant aspect of this analysis is that near every major

Pettegree, The Book in the Renaissance, 65–90 and 249–69; and Richardson, Printing, Writers and Readers, 107–
121 and 155–57. A book’s purchase price was dependent on its number of sheets (related indirectly to its page
length). For example, most partbooks use 3 to 6 sheets per partbook (i.e., 12 to 24 leaves or 24 to 48 pages in oblong
quarto), ranging from 9 to 30 sheets for a full set of partbooks. The shortest books about music probably cost less
than a full set of partbooks; for example, most editions of Faber’s Compendiolum used two or three sheets (16 or 24
leaves or 32 to 48 pages in octavo format). Longer music treatises probably cost much more than a full set of
partbooks; e.g., Glarean’s Dodecachordon uses 124 sheets (i.e., 248 leaves or 496 pages in folio format). Prices of
music publications and their audiences are discussed in Bernstein, Music Printing, 121–37; Boorman, Ottavianio
Petrucci, 331–81; Fenlon, Music, Print and Culture, passim; and van Orden, Materialities, 39–112.

music-printing firm working during the sixteenth century published at least one book about
music.84 Jane A. Bernstein has show that the music printers in a given location partitioned the
marketplace into separate niches and subspecialties.85 Publishing books about music presented
opportunities for advertising that transcended the simple hawking of wares on title pages.86
Authors of such books thus appear to integrate themselves into their printers’ businesses and to
reinforce each other’s mutual interests. In this section, I argue that books about music helped to
define the natures of printers’ niches and the profiles they presented to buyers. I begin by
examining the segmentation of the market for books about music, showing how such
publications helped to shape and to characterize their printers’ disparate catalogs. I then turn to
the subject of advertising in these books, showing how music theorists and their printers
promoted each other’s works.

Market segmentation at Rome and Venice
Many sixteenth-century music printers cultivated distinctive professional profiles. These printers
maintained consistent editorial policies regarding the selection of works to be published that
resulted in a cohesion within their catalogs—that is, a brand identity. This was not a simple
matter, given that printers needed carefully to balance repertorial selection against a number of
constantly-shifting priorities, such as netting profits, acquiring prestige, or targeting buyers.
Clearly, not every publication helped establish its printer’s brand. Rather, a given firm’s brand

84

The only significant exceptions of which I am aware are Ottaviano Petrucci and Andrea Antico. Nonetheless,
Petrucci’s lute intabulations begin with a short primer on performing from tablature, which first appeared in
Francesco Spinacino, Intabulatura de lauto libro primo (RISM 15075).

identity emerges most clearly in considering how its publications differentiate themselves from
those of its competitors. I showed above that typographical design provides a useful means of
discerning how books about music were positioned within the wider book trade; Richard Agee
has argued that privileges are another means of identifying those works in which a printer had
invested the most energy and capital, and which therefore helped to define their brands.87
Composers whose works, especially single-author publications, appear uniquely in one firm’s
catalog also helped shape both that firm’s and that composer’s public profiles. All of these
methods help us identify a given firm’s brand identity, niche, and subspecialty, which were the
means by which a firm approached various segments of the market. In this section, I examine the
manifestations of these methods in patterns of publishing music theory at midcentury Rome and
late-sixteenth-century Venice.
Three printing firms owned a font of musical type at Rome during the 1550s: Antonio
Blado, Valerio and Luigi Dorico, and Antonio Barrè.88 Blado’s firm dominated Roman printing
at large as the papal printer, producing over 1,400 editions in total, of which nine are musical
editions (i.e., books that contain musical notation). Dorico’s firm printed books on a wide variety
of subjects, especially vernacular poetry and comedies (34 musical editions of about 300 editions
total). Barrè’s was the only Roman firm that focused heavily on music (13 musical editions of 20
editions total).89 A fourth firm, that of Vincenzo Luchrino, printed music from woodcuts for one

edition, which complemented his catalog of learned treatises on geography, medicine, and
history (about 75 editions total).90 These printers’ catalogs each include exactly one book about
music (table 3.2).
These books about music were aligned closely with the public profiles and activities of
each printer. In chapter two, I explored the Lusitano–Vicentino debate at length, considering how
the timely publication of Lusitano’s Introduttione and Vicentino’s L’antica musica served the
interests of their authors. These publications likewise served the interests of their printers.
Blado’s position as the papal printer made him a logical choice to publish a work by Lusitano,
the victor of a contest held in the apostolic chapel. Prior to this time, Blado had printed only two
musical publications, Giovanni Animuccia’s Il secondo libro de i madrigali a cinque voci (1551
= RISM A1242) and Hubert Naich’s Exercitium seraficum madrigali (c. 1542 = RISM N7).91
Lusitano’s Introduttione appeared in September 1553, a short two years and three months after
the debate. Blado benefitted from publishing Lusitano’s book because it drew attention to his

90

Barbieri, Tipografi romani, 112 argues that Luchrino was strictly an editore (a publisher or underwriter) who did
not operate his own press, but commissioned others to print on his behalf.
91

Krummel and Sadie, Music Printing and Publishing, 177 attributes Costanzo Festa’s Madrigale…libro primo for
four voices (1538 = RISM FF642a) to Blado; Mary Lewis, Antonio Gardano, 2:152 attributes the edition more
plausibly to Ottaviano Scotto.

152

burgeoning music catalog, which expanded steadily over the next decades to include seven
further volumes.92
Vicentino’s L’antica musica responded directly to Lusitano’s treatise. L’antica musica
was among the first publications to issue from Barrè’s press, established in 1555. Barrè began his
firm ambitiously, issuing in its first year eight publications, five of which are publications of or
about music.93 Maureen Buja notes that this was an extraordinary undertaking, given the costs of
commissioning typographical material, acquiring retail space (in the Campo del Fiore, the
epicenter of the Roman book trade), and securing repertory to print.94 His connections to the
Roman musical scene likely helped in this regard—from 1552 to 1554 he sang in the Cappella
Giulia. Barrè also witnessed the debate personally, signing in 1556 several documents affirming
the veracity of Danckerts’s and Vicentino’s accounts of the debate.95
Publishing L’antica musica was good business sense, because it was likely underwritten
by the book’s dedicatee and Vicentino’s longtime patron, Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este. This is
suggested by the phrase in the colophon “a instantia di Don Nicola Vicentino.” The only other

92
These are, in chronological order, as follows (works after 1567 are by Blado’s heirs): Guerrero, Psalmorum
quatuor vocum liber primus (1559, no surviving copies); Zoilo, Libro secondo de madrigali a quattro e a cinque
voci (1563 = RISM Z338); Martelli, La nuova et armonica compositione a quattro voci (1564 = RISM M757);
Petrucci, Pars prima introitum dominicarum et festivitatum totius anni (1568 = RISM P1656); Animuccia, Il
secondo libro delle laudi (1570 = RISM A1238); Zaccardi, Psalmi vespertini quinque vocum modulati (1577 =
RISM Z1); and Il terzo libro delle laudi spirituali (1577 = RISM 15773a).
93

In addition to Vicentino’s L’antica musica, these are as follows: Primo libro delle muse a quattro voci (RISM
155527); Primo libro delle muse a tre voci (no surviving copies); Secondo libro delle muse a tre voci; Primo libro
delle muse a cinque voci (RISM 155526); Rime di diversi eccellenti autori in vita e in morte dell’illustrissima
Signora Livia Colonna (“ad instantia di M. Francesco Christiani,” privilege dated 22 July 1555); Giovio, Dialogo
dell’imprese militari et amorose (dedication dated 8 October 1555); and Gorgevic, Opera nova che comprende
quattro libretti (colophon, “si vendono alla bottegha del segno della Gatta in campo di Fiore”).
94

Buja, “Antonio Barrè,” 75–86. Ibid., 26–27 notes that the bookshop in the Campo del Fiore was probably shared
among several printers.

95

From November 1555 to May 1556, Danckerts requested four witnesses of the debate to verify the accuracy of his
copies of Vicentino’s transcripts of the proceedings; Barrè’s verifications—dated 1 May 1556 and given in
Danckerts’s hand, not Barrè’s—appear in Danckerts’s treatise, I-Rv, Ms. R56, fol. 389r, 390r.

153

Barrè print to carry such an indication is the Rime di diversi eccellenti autori (1555), which also
is dedicated to Ippolito II d’Este and which also carries a similar phrase in its colophon (“ad
instantia di M. Francesco Christiani”). Christiani, the volume’s editor, was in the service of the
Colonna, a patrician family at Rome; the book commemorates the life and death of Livia
Colonna (1522–1554).96 If indeed these were underwritten by members of the Este or Colonna
families, then this provided the benefit to Barrè of producing these ennobling books at no cost to
himself. Moreover, both L’antica musica, a large imposing volume in folio, and Christiani’s
Rime, a collection of dignified poetry in quarto protected by a papal privilege, would have
conferred an air of authority and distinction to Barrè’s image as a printer—even if he could not
claim official responsibility as their publisher.
Diego Ortiz’s Trattato de glosas (1559) stands apart from the treatises of Lusitano and
Vicentino. Its theoretical content is strictly practical, assuming prior knowledge of the basic
rudiments of music and indulging in no speculative pursuits. Due to its oblong quarto format, the
book stood apart physically from every other Roman music treatise of its time. (Vicentino’s
L’antica musica was in folio; Dentice’s Dialoghi and Lusitano’s Introduttione were in upright
quarto.) Readers strongly associated oblong quarto volumes with practical music and lack of
authorial pretension.97 In 1553, the Dorico firm was the most well-known music printer working
at Rome; Suzanne Cusick calls Valerio Dorico the “tipografo to the musicians of Rome.”98 By
this point, the Dorico firm had printed thirteen musical editions concentrated in three bursts of
productivity, the first 1526–1533 (using the multiple-impression method) and the second in 1544

(two large folio editions of the masses of Cristóbal de Morales, marking Dorico’s adoption of the
single-impression method). The third burst of productivity began in 1551 with the printing of
Lusitano’s motets (see chapter two) and continued through the remainder of the firm’s existence.
Ortiz’s Trattato coincides with this final period of sustained activity and its content implicitly
promotes the other items in the Dorico catalog of music.
The Trattato de glosas is composed in two parts. The first treats of melodic
ornamentation, providing readers with models of ornamenting melodies and cadences. The
second part teaches how to adapt preexisting music for instrumental performance, using as
examples Jacques Arcadelt’s “O felice occhi miei,” Pierre Sandrin’s “Doulce memoire,” and the
anonymous melody “La spagna.” Ortiz concentrates on madrigals and chansons, showing how to
arrange them for the keyboard and viola da braccio by ornamenting single parts and by
improvising additional ones. The emphasis is on the pragmatic—regarding improvising new
parts, Ortiz states that these “are not obligatory for the player who is inexperienced or has little
compositional ability.”99 He also promotes experiential learning, suggesting that “by practicing
together, [musicians] will discover many excellent and admirable secrets that are inherent in this
manner of playing by fantasy.”100 This also acts as a feint, ensuring that not every secret is given
away in the book: “[Playing by fantasy] cannot be demonstrated; every good performer plays it
from his head, from his studies, and from his experience.”101 Before 1559, Dorico published
exclusively vocal music—Ortiz’s book thus made Dorico’s existing catalog accessible to a new

audience: instrumentalists. The Trattato de glosas, by promoting extensive rehearsal and study
but stopping short of giving too many examples, might have suggested to its buyers a need to
own more music, conveniently sold alongside the treatise in Dorico’s shop. The commercial
strategy is subtle, but its outlines are evident nonetheless.
The second edition of Luigi Dentice’s Duo dialoghi della musica (1553) exploited
contemporary enthusiasm for music theory at Rome. There is no evidence to suggest that Dentice
had any involvement in the debate between Lusitano and Vicentino, although it is possible that
he was in Rome in 1551.102 The first edition was published at Naples in 1552; Richard Wistreich
suggests that Dentice’s publication was designed to solidify his relationship in absentia with
Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, a courtier and singer at Naples.103 Vincenzo Luchrino’s Roman
edition of the Dialoghi removes the book from its original Neapolitan context. Consider the two
respective title pages:
1552: DEL SIGNOR | LVIGI DENTICE GENTIL’ | huomo Napoletano, duo
Dialoghi | della Musica. | [ornament] || CON PRIVILEGIO.
1553: DVO DIALOGHI | DELLA MVSICA | DEL SIGNOR LVIGI DENTICE |
G E N TI L ’ H U O M O | Napolitano. | [ornament] | Delli quali l’uno tratta della

Latini. | Nuouamente poſti in luce. | [printer’s device with motto] | IN ROMA |
Appreſſo Vincenzo Lucrino | 1553.
Luchrino’s title page prioritizes the book’s title over its author, while highlighting the its
relevance to then-recent discussions about ancient Greek music. The 1553 edition lacks the letter
of dedication in the 1552 edition, which placed the action of the dialogue in Naples. Luchrino’s

102

Dentice’s whereabouts between his departure from Naples in 1547 and his settlement in France in 1557 are
uncertain; Fabris, “Vita e opere di Fabrizio Dentice,” 81. Dentice left Naples in 1547 in the wake of aristocratic
protest of the institution of the Spanish Inquisition; for this episode, see Lea, The Inquisition in the Spanish
Dependencies, 69–78.

edition thus re-contextualizes the discourse between the interlocutors, named Soardo and
Sermone, amid Roman discussions about ancient Greek music. Luchrino’s edition of Dentice’s
Dialoghi differentiates itself from similar volumes in the marketplace around the same time by
filling a gap in the literature on ancient music published at Rome; whereas Lusitano and
Vicentino focus on Boethius and Guido, Dentice focuses on Platonic and Pythagorean musical
thought. Luchrino followed up on the subject in 1556 with the publication of Nicola Scutelli’s
translation of Iamblichus’s De mysteriis Aegyptiorum, which contained a brief sketch of
Pythagorean musical thought.
Given the concurrent circulation of similar texts about a contentious issue, one might
assume that there was a spirit of fierce competition among their printers. This seems not to have
been the case. Barrè, Blado, Dorico, and Luchrino were interconnected personally and
professionally. Barrè used Blado’s musical type for several editions during the 1560s and
partnered with the Dorico firm to produce at least one edition;104 Blado’s son married Livia
Dorico, the daughter of Luigi Dorico;105 and Luchrino and Blado published the 1556 Iamblichus
volume in collaboration.106 Richard Agee argues that Venetian music printers cooperated in a
friendly manner; I suggest likewise that printers of books about music at midcentury Rome
partitioned the market into subspecialties so as not to compete directly.107 Each treatise had close
ties to its printer’s catalog of music and each printer specialized in a different market niche

The title page of the Iamblichus volume reads in part, “Romae, apud Antonium Bladum Pontificis Maximi
excusorem. M. D. LVI. Sumptibus .D. Vincentij Luchrini.” Some copies of the edition lack the ascription to
Luchrino, suggesting that the Blado and Luchrino divided the stock to sell in their respective bookshops.

(liturgical or devotional sacred music; vocal or instrumental secular music; scholarly books;
vernacular literature, etc.). These publications served the respective needs and interests of their
printers, even when their authors antagonized one another.
This same pattern of market segmentation holds true in other locations. Tim Carter has
argued for a similar kind of strategy among printers working amidst the controversy between
Giovanni Maria Artusi and Claudio Monteverdi:
Indeed, it seems possible that the controversy was fuelled precisely by the presses
themselves as a way of drawing attention to, and therefore enhancing the market
for, their wares. Artusi is consistently published by the Venetian printer Giacomo
Vincenti, and Monteverdi (like, for that matter, a good number of his seconda
pratica colleagues) is closely allied with Vincenti’s erstwhile partner and now
rival, Ricciardo Amadino…Even if Vincenti and Amadino were not actively
involved in the controversy, there is no reason why they should have discouraged
it. The result was obviously good for business.108
But just as Roman printers continued to work amicably while their authors bickered, so did
Amadino and Vincenti, former partners who shared typographical material and divvied up
composers and repertory in a seemingly mutually-beneficial manner.109 The theoretical points of
departure between Monteverdi and Artusi provide a means of discerning the respective
subspecialties of Amadino and Vincenti during the 1590s and 1600s. Amadino printed first
editions of works by Agostino Agazzari, Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, and Claudio Monteverdi;
Vincenti printed first editions of works by Giovanni Croce, Lodovico Viadana, and Giovanni
Battista Biondi; both printed first editions of works by Giammateo Asola and Adriano Banchieri.
Carter notes that Amadino’s stable of composers tended to write in a more progressive style,
embodying the characteristics of the seconda pratica as famously outlined in Giulio Cesare

109

Krummel and Sadie, Music Printing and Publishing, 138 and 460. Carter, review of Harrán, Salamone Rossi,
301–303 argues further for the association between composers of various localities with either Amadino or Vincenti.

158

Monteverdi’s “Dichiaratione.” The books of and about music printed by Amadino and Vincenti
reinforce each other—the books of music clarify the arguments of the treatises and the treatises
help contextualize and explain broader repertorial choices in presenting the books of music to the
public.
The controversy between Artusi and Monteverdi initially unfolded in a circumspect
manner; Artusi at first declined to identify the composer of the madrigals he quoted in L’Artusi
(1600; fol. 39v–40r and passim) and Monteverdi published these madrigals shortly thereafter
without acknowledging Artusi’s attacks. But as the controversy escalated and as names were
named, Monteverdi and Artusi both continued to serve and protect the publishing interests of
Amadino and Vincenti. I would emphasize, for example, that several of the composers that
Giulio Cesare Monteverdi cites approvingly as followers of Cipriano de Rore were fixtures in the
firms of Amadino and Vincenti, to judge only from their single-composer prints.110 For example,
of these composers, Tomaso Pecci belonged to Vincenti’s stable of composers, Marcantonio
Ingegneri to Amadino’s; Luca Marenzio’s works appear both in Vincenti’s and Amadino’s
catalogs during and after their initial partnership (table 3.3).
Carter’s observation that the controversy was good for business may be refined to say
that Artusi’s and Monteverdi’s individual discussions of specific composers benefitted both
presses simultaneously. That is, a reader of Monteverdi’s “Dichiaratione” (Amadino) who was
curious about Giulio Caccini, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, or Pecci had to seek out their single-

110
Giulio Cesare Monteverdi cites by name Carlo Gesualdo, Emilio de’ Cavalieri, Alfonso Fontanelli, one “Conte di
Camerata” (i.e., Girolamo Branciforte), Giovanni del Turco, Tomaso Pecci, then later Marcantonio Ingenieri, Luca
Marenzio, Giaches de Wert, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, Jacopo Peri, and Giulio Caccini. Among these, Bardi, Branciforte,
Cavalieri, Fontanelli, Gesualdo, Peri, Turco, and Wert had no single-composer prints published by Amadino or
Vincenti. Caccini had three Vincenti publications, Luzzaschi had one Vincenti publication. Most of the collections
of these composers’ works are concentrated in the catalogs of the Gardano firm and the Florentine firms of
Marescotti and Pignoni.

composer prints in Vincenti’s catalog. Conversely, a reader of Artusi’s L’Artusi (Vincenti) who
was curious about Gastoldi or Monteverdi had to seek out their single-composer prints in
Amadino’s catalog.111 For his part, Vincenti’s theoretical publications cite Vincenti-aligned
composers more meticulously (or at least minimally cite Amadino-aligned composers) than
Amadino’s theoretical publications. For example, several printed marginal notes in Artusi’s
L’Artusi (Vincenti) identify “musici eccellenti” or “musici valenti” (“talented musicians”)
discussed in the text (fol. 3r, 8v, 42r, and 67v–68r). Several of these musicians were published
by Vincenti and not by Amadino: Croce (55 editions, 1588–1610), Ruggiero Giovanelli (10
editions, 1587–1600), Giovanni Bassano (6 editions, 1587–1602), and Palestrina (4 editions,
1588–1605). Of course, works by these composers were published by other printers, even at
Venice; but the conspicuous and reciprocal absences in the catalogs of Amadino and Vincenti
point to careful market segmentation between the former partners. This was not the only
occasion that Amadino and Vincenti printed works for the opposing sides of a public argument;
as Carter notes, Artusi’s initial reason for publishing L’Artusi (1600, Vincenti) was to dispute
points in Ercole Bottrigari’s Il Desiderio (1594, Amadino).
I would add a further wrinkle to this picture: a previously-unnoticed connection between
Ricciardo Amadino (Monteverdi’s printer) and Francesco de’ Franceschi (Zarlino’s printer). I
showed in chapter two that, beginning in 1561, Franceschi was the exclusive printer of Zarlino’s
books about music. These are Franceschi’s only publications that contain musical notation; for
his edition of Zarlino’s complete works (four volumes, 1588–1589), Franceschi borrowed

111

Nonetheless, works by Caccini (as “Giulio Romano”), Gastoldi, Ingenieri, Monteverdi, and Peri are listed for sale
in the shop of Alessandro Vincenti in two printed catalogs, the latter of which includes pricing information;
Vincenti, “Indice di tutte le opere di musica.”

161

Ricciardo Amadino’s font of single-impression musical type.112 The editions of Amadino and
Vincenti of 1588 and 1589 use the same musical type. That it was Amadino, not Vincenti, who
loaned the font is confirmed by the presence of Amadino’s device, an organ with two angels
playing stringed instruments, in Zarlino’s Sopplimenti musicali (1588; p. 286). Also in 1588,
Amadino published Tigrini’s Compendio, ostensibly an abridgement of parts three and four of
Zarlino’s Istitutioni, given a third edition by Franceschi the following year in 1589. Amadino’s
edition of Tigrini’s Compendio was an ideal cross-promotional platform for Franceschi’s edition
of Zarlino’s complete works, using a quarto-size, beginner-friendly treatise on counterpoint to
advertise a folio-size, advanced-level book on the science and art of music. This coincided with a
war of words between Zarlino and his former pupil Vincenzo Galilei. Galilei earlier had
published his Dialogo della musica antica et della moderna (1581), which offered critiques of
Zarlino’s views about tuning systems based on ancient Greek music theory. Zarlino’s
Sopplimenti (1588) was his public rebuttal, to which Galilei responded with an extended, pointby-point response in his Discorso intorno all’opere di Zarlino (1589).113 The debates, arguments,
and feuds between Artusi and Monteverdi, between Artusi and Bottrigari, and between Galilei
and Zarlino were deeply enmeshed in the publishing activities of Amadino, Vincenti, and
Franceschi. Partitioning the market into discrete segments and cultivating brand identities made
this possible, allowing the firms to publish works on opposing sides while possibly colluding
behind the scenes to market their works.

112

The source of the musical type in the second edition of Zarlino’s Istitutioni (1573) remains obscure. It does,
however, very closely match Amadino’s musical type in the third edition of the Istitutioni (1589), which might shed
light on the early careers of Amadino and Vincenti, who are not recorded as printers before 1583.

Venetian publishing interests, see ibid., 265–270; cf., Galilei, Discorso intorno all’opere di Zarlino (1589), 12–16.

162

The case is similar with the firms of Angelo Gardano and the heirs of Girolamo Scotto. I
suggest that the music treatises they published established a synergy among their broader music
catalogs. In 1584, both firms brought out a single theoretical publication that remained the only
such publication in their catalog through the end of the sixteenth century:114 Girolamo Dalla
Casa’s Il vero modo di diminuir con tutte le sorti di stromenti di fiato, et corda, et di voce
humana in two volumes (Gardano) and the second, revised edition of Vincenzo Galilei’s
Fronimo…dialogo sopra l’arte del bene intavolare et rettamente sonare la musica negli
strumenti artificiali si di corde come di fiate, et in particulare nel liuto (Scotto).115 The volumes
share a number of similarities: lengthy folio volumes with elegant and grandly-worded title
pages, a focus on extended musical examples with shorter prose interjections, and an emphasis
on practical music-making. In terms of content, Dalla Casa focuses on melodic ornamentation
(performed vocally or on wind or stringed instruments) and Galilei on adapting polyphonic
music for performance on the lute. The musical examples in Dalla Casa’s Il vero modo di
diminuir draw from an older repertory, particularly the music of Jacob Clemens non Papa (1510–
1555), Thomas Crecquillon (c. 1505–1557), Clément Janequin (1485–1558), Cipriano de Rore
(c. 1515–1565), and Adrian Willaert (1490–1562)—all of whom had been dead for some time,
but whose music had been closely and continuously associated with the Gardano firm under the

114

Antonio Gardano (Angelo’s father) brought out Aiguino, La illuminata (1562) and Angelo Gardano brought out
Antegnati, L’Antegnata (1608). The Scotto firm had a much deeper commitment to publishing books about music,
which included the following: Del Lago, Breve introduttione (1540); Doni, Dialogo della musica (1544); Aaron,
Lucidario in musica (1545); and the first edition of Galilei, Fronimo (part 1, 1568; part 2, 1569).
115

The most extensive discussion of Dalla Casa’s life and works is Colussi et al., Girolamo Dalla Casa.
Canguilhem, Fronimo de Vincenzo Galilei provides a thorough overview of Galilei’s book and traces the changes
made in the second edition, which included 30 pages of additional counterpoint instruction. Palisca, introduction to
Galilei, Dialogue on Ancient and Modern Music remains the best general account of Galilei’s life and works.

163

helm of Angelo’s father, Antonio.116 In contrast, the musical examples in the second edition of
Galilei’s Fronimo are centered on a younger, still-living generation, particularly the music of
Orlando di Lasso (1532–1594), Philippe de Monte (1521–1603), Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina
(c. 1525–1594), Alessandro Striggio (c. 1536–1592), and Giaches de Wert (1535–1596)—all
strongly represented in the catalog of the Scotto firm.117
In all of these cases, both at Rome and at Venice, local music printers published treatises
that helped define their brand identities. Market segmentation also permitted publishers to
exploit and even to instigate public controversy from behind the scenes. Their treatises
namedropped the most noteworthy composers, especially those whose works were available
from the very same publisher. Likewise, their subject matters and theoretical approaches made
gestures toward the niches and strong points of their publishers’ outputs. Books about music also
allowed books of music to cross generic boundaries and performance conventions by making
vocal works available to instrumentalists. On a more basic level, by teaching the basics of music,
books about music made books of music accessible to new readers, while withholding more
advanced knowledge from public view. In this way, printers offered points of connection
between different items in their catalogs, and perhaps more importantly between composers,
authors, readers, and performers.

116

This is especially true of Janequin and Willaert. Gardano published three of Janequin’s four major Venetian
publications: La bataglie…libro primo (1545 = RISM J446), Il secondo libro de canzon francese (1548 = RISM
15485; reprinted 1560 = RISM 15608). Gardano published editions of the majority of Willaert’s works, perhaps most
importantly Musica nova (1559 = RISM W1126). Although not identical, the woodcut frame on the title page of
Dalla Casa’s treatise is very similar to the frame Gardano used for Musica nova.

117

See, especially, Scotto’s editions of works by Striggio (18 editions), Monte (35 editions), and Palestrina (30
editions). Gardano published works by many of these composers as well, but in fewer quantities.

164

Cross-promotion and product bundling in Franceschi’s Zarlino editions
The market segmentation I have proposed above is subtle, perceptible only in the broader output
of single printers and groups of printers. In this section, I consider more overt marketing
strategies. I examined in chapter two the textual transformation of Zarlino’s Istitutioni through
three editions, considering how each edition increasingly conformed to expectations about the
structure and appearance of printed books. In this section, I consider more intensively Zarlino’s
relationship with the Venetian publisher Francesco de’ Franceschi Senese, showing how the two
struggled to find effective strategies for marketing their publications. In addition to the
techniques of piggybacking on current events and playing into reader expectations (considered
above and throughout chapter two), I focus in particular on two marketing techniques, crosspromotion and product bundling.
The year 1561 marked a turning point for Francesco de’ Franceschi Senese. Prior to this,
he was merely a humble bookseller (libraio). That year, however, the Venetian Senate granted
him a license to establish his own press and granted him the exclusive privilege to publish four
books: an Italian translation of Strabo’s De geographia (part 1 appearing in 1562, part 2 in
1565), a book on the compounding of medicine by Girolamo Calestani (Osservationi nel
comporre gli antidoti et medicamenti, 1562), a now-lost work on the subject of obedience by
Giovanni Giovano Pontano, and “il libro di D. Pre. Ioseph Carlini De patientia.”118 This last item
is Zarlino’s Utilissimo trattato della patientia, which appeared that same year in a small
sextodecimo edition. Around the same time, in both 1561 and 1562, Franceschi came to create
two new issues of the first edition of Zarlino’s Le istitutioni harmoniche (1558) by printing new

first sheets with revised title pages—whether by purchasing the unsold stock or by some other
business transaction remains unclear.
Zarlino’s Trattato was the first of these books to appear in 1561 and is thus the first work
to issue from Franceschi’s press.119 The book is dedicated to Leonora d’Este, a nun and daughter
of Alfonso I d’Este and Lucrezia Borgia, the Duke and Duchess of Ferrara.120 The title page
commends the work to a pious, if self-selecting audience: “to all those who desire to live like a
Christian.”121 Behind the veneer of devotion is a shrewd attempt to market both the Trattato and
the Istitutioni, which is revealed in Zarlino’s dedicatory epistle to Leonora d’Este. The
dedicatory letter begins not by describing the contents of the treatise or by extolling the virtues of
its dedicatee. Instead, the text begins as follows:
I have always been of a mind, your Most Illustrious and Reverend Ladyship, as
much as my strength has been sufficient, to be of benefit to everyone, and all
those who know me know it too well. I have shown this the past few years, with
the publication of Le istitutioni harmoniche, a useful and (to tell the truth)
necessary work for all those who delight in music and desire to know with true
certainty those things—not only practical, but also speculative—that are discussed
in it.122
Only after this moment of self-promotion does Zarlino address how he came to write such a
work and presents it to Leonora as a reflection of her own spiritual devotion. This was not the

queries about this copy.

Zarlino’s relationship with the Este family is treated at length in Schiltz, “Gioseffo Zarlino and the Miserere
Tradition,” 202–15. Working only from Franceschi’s second edition of 1583, Schiltz notes incorrectly that Zarlino
dedicated the Trattato to Leonora posthumously.

tutti quelli che della Musica si dilettano, & desiderano di sapere con veri fondamenti quelle cose che in essa, non
solamente intorno la prattica; ma etiandio intorno la speculativa, si trattano.” Zarlino, Utilissimo trattato della
patientia (1561), sig. π2r.

166

first time Zarlino had done this—the first edition of the Istitutioni (1558) promotes his very first
publication (a book of motets, 1549) and the forthcoming theoretical sequel (Dimostrationi
harmoniche, 1571).
I read this as an early instance of the marketing technique known as cross-promotion or
product placement. In this technique, advertisements for one product are placed inside the
contents of others, creating a synergistic relationship between them. The effect, or at least the
desired one, is to increase attention and sales for the product placed the others. In this instance,
then, Zarlino’s Trattato advertises Franceschi’s newly-created issues of the Istitutioni. This was
good business sense. An affordable, pocket-sized book on the popular subject of patience would
have been a profitable venture for any publisher.123 This instance of cross-promotion directed
readers to a much larger, and likely expensive book. Assuming that Franceschi held the rights to
sell the Istitutioni, the profits from both books might have helped to secure Franceschi’s foothold
in the Venetian book trade.
During the 1570s, Franceschi published two more books by Zarlino, the Dimostrationi
harmoniche (1571) and a second edition of the Istitutioni harmoniche (1573). In both books,
Zarlino departs from strategies employed in his earlier works. The first point of departure is
literary style. Whereas the Istitutioni is conceived in a traditional didactic style, the
Dimostrationi is written as a dialogue, with well-known and erudite figures in witty
conversation. Zarlino’s Dimostrationi strategically draws on contemporary enthusiasm for

123
Around forty editions of books on the subject of patience were printed in Italy during the sixteenth century. The
more noteworthy works include the following: Baldacchini, Dyalogo de patientia (1525); Barbieri, Dialoghi
spirituali (1589); Cacciaguerra, Epistola…sopra l’infermità, patientia, et felice (1563); Campani, Lamento di quel
tribulato…sopra il male incognito, il quale tratta della patientia et impatientia (1521); Cavalca, Trattato della
patientia (1541); and Soncino, Dialogo di patientia (1558);

167

literary dialogues, most notably Baldassare Castiglione’s Il libro de cortegiano (1528).124 All of
the interlocutors, with the exception of one Signore Desiderio (a reader surrogate), were
prominent figures in Italian musical life:
•

Adrian Willaert (c. 1490–1562), recently-deceased maestro di cappella at the Basilica di
San Marco and the individual responsible for its rise in reputation;

•

Francesco dalla Viola (d. 1568), also recently-deceased maestro di cappella at the court
of Alfonso II d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, and author of the dedication of Willaert’s Musica
nova to Alfonso;

•

Claudio Merulo (1533–1604), the Basilica’s famed first organist, prolific composer, and
occasional printer of music; and

•

Gioseffo Zarlino (c. 1517–1591), then-current maestro di cappella at the Basilica di San
Marco and the individual responsible for ensuring its institutional stability and continued
excellence.125

All of these figures act as mouthpieces for the author’s ideas; Zarlino uses their distinctive
personalities to articulate and defend various perspectives on his theories. In the Dimostrationi,
Zarlino (the interlocutor) refers repeatedly to the Istitutioni and draws connections to the present
work. At one point in the dialogue, Willaert, who was Zarlino’s teacher, questions the pertinence
of such gestures in the context of a discourse aimed at systematic demonstration:
A D R IA N O :

Before we proceed to another subject, answer me this: You have referred
many times to ways of doing things as written in your Istitutioni. Nonetheless, in

124

Dimostrationi harmoniche and Demonstrative Methodologies.” Both Judd and Kelleher note that Zarlino’s
Dimostrationi (1571) is not a straightforward literary dialogue, but one hybridized with a formal demonstration or
mathematical proof.
125

Edwards, “Setting the Tone at San Marco.”

168

it you truly demonstrate few things, from what I recall, proceeding instead from a
practical angle. I want you to tell me more about this.
G IO S E F FO :

This, Sir, is of little consequence…But I want you to know that, although
in the Istitutioni I proceeded by showing things from a practical angle, as you
said, such methods are not undertaken haphazardly. On the contrary, they are
extracted from the source of the demonstrations [Dimostrationi] that
mathematicians themselves have made…But when it happens that you hear
mentioned something shown in the Istitutioni, don’t be shocked, because I have
demonstrated everything in it with all truth and with every piece of evidence, so
as not to need further demonstration.126

Taken at face value, Zarlino’s response defends the validity of his emphasis on experiential
knowledge in the Istitutioni by directing attention to its rigorously scientific origins. But
Zarlino’s response is also a self-referential play on words, suggesting that the Istitutioni drew not
merely from mathematical methods of demonstration, but from the same font of knowledge as
the Dimostrationi.
Zarlino’s references to his own works take readers outside the dramatic conceit of the
dialogue, referring to an intertextual play evident throughout his oeuvre. For example, in the
reader’s preface to the 1558 edition of the Istitutioni, he falsely claimed that the present work
“mentions the Dimostrationi harmoniche in some places, together with some other work to
which I have yet to give (as they say) a finishing touch.”127 Such references act as sophisticated
cross-promotions. Even in 1558, Zarlino was advertising the Dimostrationi, which appeared over

126
“ADRI. […] ma innanzi che si proceda piu oltra ditemi una cosa. Voi havete allegato molte fiate il modo di
operare alcuna cosa secondo le vostre Istitutioni: nondimeno in esse dimostrate poche cose, per quello che mi
ricordo; anzi piu tosto procedete con un’atto prattico: però desidero, che sopra di questo mi diciate qualche cosa.
GIOS. Questo Messere è di poco importanza. […] Ma voglio che sapiate: se bene nelle Istitutioni hò proceduto nel
mostrare le cose con atto prattico, come havete detto: che tali operationi non sono fatte à caso: anzi sono cavate dal
fonte delle Dimostrationi, che hanno fatto di loro i Mathematici. […] Però quando per l’avenire udirete nominare
alcuna cosa mostrata nelle Istitutioni, non vi scandalizate: perche hò dimostrato ivi il tutto con ogni verità, et con
ogni prova. onde non fa di bisogno di farne altra dimostratione.” Zarlino, Dimostrationi (1571), 38.

169

a decade later in 1571. The Dimostrationi reciprocates by advertising the Istitutioni. Zarlino’s
efforts at cross-promotion in the Istitutioni and Trattato della patientia lie on the surfaces of their
texts, acting merely as casual references. In contrast, Zarlino’s adoption of the dialogue genre in
the Dimostrationi allows Zarlino to embed more deeply his advertisements for the Istitutioni. As
an author, Zarlino contrived an opportunity to discuss this practice through Willaert’s pointed
query; Zarlino’s response as an interlocutor makes clear that the near-constant references to the
Istitutioni were an integral part of the dialogue. This was also an ingenious marketing ploy, as it
allowed the advertisement to become more pervasive while avoiding the appearance of crassness
or obvious salesmanship.
In 1573, Franceschi published the second, revised edition of the Istitutioni. I showed in
chapter two that Zarlino and Franceschi designed this edition to match closely the Dimostrationi,
omitted the definite article le from the title, and adopted the order of modes proposed in the
Dimostrationi; the new edition also introduced marginal annotations and a subject index. The
effect was to make the Istitutioni and Dimostrationi as companions, and they probably were sold
as such. These changes reflect a deeper attempt to harmonize the contents of Zarlino’s various
publications. I read all of this as an instance of product bundling or tying, a marketing technique
in which a company’s products are associated and sold together. By bundling the two books,
Franceschi (or any other bookseller, for that matter) could have increased sales for two lengthy,
folio-sized, expensive volumes. This was a win-win scenario for buyer and seller. One the one
hand, Franceschi could have appealed to buyers by setting a bundled price that was less than
their combined retail values. On the other hand, increased sales volume still could have netted
Franceschi a handsome profit. The large number of surviving copies bound together (listed in
chapter two) suggests that bundling books was an effective strategy for moving inventory. The

170

copies of the Istitutioni (1562) bound with the Dimostrationi (1573) suggest that this bundling
strategy may have taken root even before the second edition of the Istitutioni (1573) was
published.
A noteworthy aspect of this strategy is the layering of multiple marketing techniques in
Franceschi’s selling of Zarlino’s works during the 1570s. Literary and stylistic variety in the
Dimostrationi improved Zarlino’s image, both as a writer and mathematician, and made his
theories accessible and even entertaining. Revisions, both cosmetic and substantive, helped make
the Istitutioni more reader friendly. Bundling the two books stirred up sales for both volumes.
Finally, cross-promotion is instantiated at a structural level, integrated into the argument of the
Dimostrationi. This was true as well of the second edition of the Istitutioni, which included
significant references to his own collection of motets, the Modulationes sex vocum (1566 =
RISM Z100).128
This strategy seems to have succeeded. In the wake of the Dimostrationi the second
edition of the Istitutioni, four new books by Zarlino soon appeared, not from Franceschi’s firm,
but from the firms of Nicolini, Varisco, and Polo—all prominent and well-established Venetian
printers (listed in table A1.6). Zarlino’s ability to attract larger presses might have resulted from
the marketing of his most recent editions. But Zarlino’s pivot away from the subject of music is
telling; these books consider instead chronology, the growth of religious orders, and calendric
reform. I view this change in topic as a response to Zarlino’s initial troubles in the world of book
publishing and selling. (Consider, for instance, that copies of the 1558 edition and Franceschi’s
issues were still for sale in 1572). Books about music, no matter how well written, had a limited

128

171

audience (see chapter four). In his books of the late 1570s and early 1580s, Zarlino involves
himself in timely and culturally-relevant issues. For example, his treatise De vera anni forma
(1580), dedicated to Pope Gregory XIII, appeared in the midst of public debate on calendric
reform. Gregory’s 1582 reform ignored Zarlino’s recommendations; in the following year,
Zarlino published his pamphlet Resolutioni de alcuni dubii sopra la corretione dell’anno di
Giulio Cesare (1583). One senses bitterness in Zarlino’s explanation of the reform’s more
obscure points, which point up the confusion wrought by the reform among merchants and the
religious.129 In the address to his readers of the Resolutioni, Zarlino also took the opportunity to
advertise his previous works, including De vera anni forma, the Istitutioni harmoniche, and the
Dimostrationi harmoniche. He even gives advance notice of the Sopplimenti musicali, which he
promises will be “most useful and necessary (I believe) for understanding many things explained
by me in my Istitutioni and Dimostrationi harmoniche, which up to now many (from what I
gather in their writings) have misunderstood.”130 In De vera anni forma (1580), Zarlino also
made the earliest reference to his never-published and presumably-lost manuscript treatise De
utraque musica.131 Ultimately, even when writing about subjects other than music, Zarlino
continually returned to it as a means of self-promotion.

129

Zarlino, Resolutioni (1583), 28–29. Judd and Schiltz, introduction to Zarlino, Motets from the 1560s, xxiv briefly
describes Zarlino’s relation to Gregorian calendric reform.

“molto utili & anco necessarii (come credo) alla intelligentia di molte cose da me esplicate nelle mie Institutioni
& Dimostrationi harmoniche, lequali da molti fin’hora (per quello ch’io comprendo da i loro scritti) sono state poco
intese.” Zarlino, Resolutioni (1583), 5.
131
Zarlino, De vera anni forma (1580), sig. a2v describes to Pope Gregory XIII how he has “written twenty-five
books De utraque musica, composed with no little effort, which I hope to publish shortly for you to read” (“quin
etiam libros Vigintiquinque De utraque Musica inscriptos non sine multo sudore composuerim; quos brevi, ut
confide, tibi in apertum relatos leges”). Judd and Schiltz, introduction to Zarlino, Motets from the 1560s, xxiii traces
Zarlino’s numerous references to this work throughout his oeuvre, suggesting credibly that this work refers to the
Latin translations of the Istitutioni and Dimostrationi promised in the reader’s preface to the 1558 edition of the
Istitutioni and the privilege that protected it.

172

Franceschi’s publication of Zarlino’s De tutte l’opere (1588–1589), a four-volume set of
his complete works, was premised on a similar multilayered marketing strategy. The first volume
to emerge (but the third in sequence) was the Sopplimenti musicali, which appeared during
Zarlino’s protracted debate with Vincenzo Galilei. In it, Zarlino defends and consolidates the
positions of his previous works; like the Dimostrationi, polemical discourse allowed Zarlino to
embed advertisements into the argument of the work itself. A descriptive phrase on the work’s
title page about its contents makes this clear:
[Sopplimenti musicali,] in which are explained many things contained in the first
two volumes, the Istitutioni and the Dimostrationi, because they have been
misunderstood by many, who are answered alongside their calumnies.132
This was the only newly-composed work of the set; publishing it first, at a time when it was
controversial, made the set more appealing than simply beginning with yet another edition of the
Istitutioni. The fourth volume, which contained Zarlino’s nonmusical writings, likewise appealed
to buyers’ tastes. These works appeared previously in smaller formats (quarto, duodecimo, and
sextodecimo); their collection in a folio-sized collection is significant. I argued above that
changes in material form carried with them changes in connotative meaning. The promotion of
these works into folio was an elevating gesture that underscored their importance in Zarlino’s
output. By publishing a controversial new work as the third volume, and then known sellers as
the fourth volume, Franceschi cunningly manipulated his customers, drawing attention to
volumes one and two (the Istitutioni and Dimostrationi). I read this as another instance of
product bundling, but conceived on an even grander scale.

132

“Ne i quali dichiarano molte cose contenute ne i Due primi Volumini, delle Istitutioni & Dimostrationi; per
essere state mal’intese da molti; & si risponde insieme alle loro Calonnie.” Zarlino, Sopplimenti (1588), sig. a1r.

173

In chapter two, I observed that Zarlino’s De tutte l’opere reflected an intellectual
continuity only latent in their separate editions, attempts at cross-promotion notwithstanding.
Throughout the complete-works edition, Zarlino and Franceschi take several opportunities to
make these ties explicit. For example, Zarlino’s Discorso intorno il vero anno et il vero giorno
nel quale fu crucifisso il nostro Signor Giesu Christo (1580) begins with a dedication to
Giovanni Trevisano, the Patriarch of Venice. In it, Zarlino begs Trevisano’s pardon for the
work’s delay, explaining that he was too busy to engage sufficiently in studying the necessary
subjects. In the complete-works edition, Zarlino modifies his statement to draw attention to those
subjects that proved a distraction from his studies in astronomy, chronology, and history.
1580: I had not been able to attain this desired end, chiefly because earlier I did not
continue, due to my having to attend to other things, with the study of
astronomy, nor did I work as long at that of chronology or history—very
important things for this enterprise.133
1589: I had not been able to attain this desired end, chiefly because earlier I did not
continue (due to my having to attend to other, much more important things,
chiefly those pertaining to music) with the study of astronomy, nor did I work
as long at that of chronology of history—very important things for this
enterprise.134
This, and similar tweaks, allowed Zarlino and Franceschi to tease out the through-lines among
his output, making note of the points of intersection between his works. Much like his comment
about the Sopplimenti’s relation to the Istitutioni and Dimostrationi, these cross-referential and

133

“non havesse potuto conseguire il fine desiderato; massimamente perche prima non ho continuato, per haver’io
atteso ad altre cose, lo studio dell’Astronomia, nè meno dato opera lungamente à quello della Chronologia, overo
Historia; cose molto importanti à questo negotio.” Zarlino, Discorso (1579), 3.
134

“non havesse potuto conseguire il fine desiderato; massimamente perche prima non havea continuato (per haver
io atteso ad altre cose maggiormente importanti & massimamente à quelle della Musica,) lo studio dell’Astronomia,
nè meno dato opera lungamente à quello della Chronologia, over Historia; cose molto importanti à questo negotio.”
Zarlino, De tutte l’opere, 4:68.

174

self-referential moments of revision allow Zarlino to make the four-volume set more cohesive,
certainly a selling point for would-be buyers.
Franceschi’s strategy for promoting Zarlino’s complete works extended to works by other
authors. I examined above the relationship between Amadino and Franceschi, considering the
presence of Amadino’s font of musical type in Franceschi’s publications and how Amadino’s
publication of Oratio Tigrini’s Il compendio della musica (1588) coincided with Franceschi’s
editions of Zarlino’s complete works—another instance of market segmentation as the two
products seem to have appealed to different kinds of buyers. Furthermore, around the same time,
Franceschi published Fabio Paolini’s Hebdomades (1589), a numerological exploration of the
seven liberal arts.135 Paolini’s book discusses music at great length (pp. 57–108), focusing
extensively on the mathematical basis of music. Paolini is well-versed in Greek and Latin writers
on the subject of music, but draws from a limited set of modern authors: Nicola Vicentino,
Stefano Vanneo, and Zarlino. Zarlino receives praise above all other sources. Phrases such as “ut
praeclarè ostendit Zarlinus” (“as Zarlino so brilliantly shows”) appear repeatedly in Paolini’s
chapter on music.136 Franceschi concurrently released Paolini’s Hebdomades and Zarlino’s
complete works; Paolini’s references to Zarlino’s works establish a synergistic relationship
between several books in Franceschi’s catalog. The emphasis on music as mathematics in
Paolini’s Hebdomades also suggests that Zarlino’s works, by virtue of their breadth of topic,

135

The only musicological study of this book is McDonald, “Music, Magic, and Humanism.”

136
Paolini, Hebdomades (1589), 62. Citations to Zarlino’s works label him “eruditionis vir” (“man of erudition,”
67), “doctissimus vir” (“most learned man,” 86), and “praestantissimus vir” (“most excellent man,” 102). Ibid., 64
describes Zarlino’s works as follows: “One might profitably endeavor to read through his books about music, which
have brought the greatest light to this art” (“velit uberius degustare, eius de Musica libros perlegat, quibus summam
lucem huic arti attulit”).

175

appealed to many different kinds of readers in ways that more practically-oriented music
treatises could not.
In summary, Franceschi executed a multilayered marketing strategy to publish Zarlino’s
complete works. The multivolume edition makes the bundling technique explicit. The
Soppimenti, in responding to Galilei and other unnamed critics, drew on current debates in Italian
musical thought. The folio-sized reprints of his books on timely subject matters increased their
desirability. The timing and placement within the set of volumes three and four directed readers
to the first two volumes, the Istitutioni and the Dimostrationi. Revisions in these volumes make
them still more accessible to new readers. Finally, cross-promotion within other publications by
Franceschi and Amadino advertise Zarlino’s works.
This entire section has analyzed the activities of printers and publishers from contrasting
levels of observation. From the macroscopic level of entire markets in a particular city or region,
one notes how groups of printers partitioned the marketplace into individual niches and
subspecialties. From the more microscopic level of a single author’s works in a printer’s catalog,
one notes how the two worked together in a way that was mutually beneficial. Both levels bring
out this pattern of segmentation and brand identification. Printed books about music were a
central part of these enterprises. The verbal discourse in such books allowed their authors,
editors, and printers to make explicit statements and arguments about repertories of music. The
shrewdest and keenest of these went beyond the limited marketing strategies evident in the
paratexts of other kinds of musical publications. Such books about music made vital connections
between their printers’ catalogs by advertising or at least suggesting the value of other books to
prospective buyers. This little-appreciated commercial aspect played a significant role in shaping
the development of musical theory and practice during the Renaissance.

Conclusion
Many Renaissance music theorists cultivated friendships and professional relationships with their
printers and publishers. Heinrich Glarean, for example, is mentioned in the infamous Epistolae
obscurorum virorum (1517), a printed collection of satirical poems and letters censured officially
by Pope Leo X. One poem, written by one Magister Philipp Schlauraff, relates a fictional
encounter that lambasted Glarean for his vainglorious and pugnacious attitude:
There, within the house of Froben, many heretics abide,
Notably one Glareanus, who my aching back and side
Buffeted with thumps resounding, then to finish, knocked me down,
Though I cried aloud for pity, “Mercy! by thy laurel crown!”137
Among the many significant aspects of this reference is the image of Glarean ensconced
chummily in the retinue of the printer Johannes Froben, the publisher of Glarean’s Isagoge in
musicen (1516) and several other early works. At least in this satirical book, the printer’s house
was not a desirable place in which to be seen. In Schlauraff’s letter, the printing house stands as a
synecdoche for the city of Basel, known for its tolerance of religious heterodoxy, coincidentally
the reason Glarean fled there in 1529 for Freiburg im Breisgau.
Also implicit in Schlauraff’s letter is the notion that the ideal expression of thought is
antithetical to everyday concerns about finance and commerce. This chapter seeks to disrupt this
idea, showing how printers of Renaissance books about music used business acumen and the
tools of the trade to facilitate communication between authors and readers. I have considered the
nature of several instances of this facilitation through the activities of printing, publishing, and
selling books. The design of printed books about music helped to communicate a book’s

message to its readers. Changes in design and format allow us to see how printers altered a
book’s message in relation to the priorities of its buyers. Similarly, the technical struggle to print
scores in books about counterpoint illustrates the balancing of priorities negotiated in the printshop between, on the one hand, a printer’s efficiency and profitability and, on the other hand,
clear communication between authors and readers. Finally, marketing practices and strategies
show how books about music served to expand the market for books of music both by promoting
musical literacy and by advertising individual music books and groups of them. The nature of
this facilitation offers critical insight into the development of the book trade during the
Renaissance, as few other subjects faced similar obstacles in bringing works to the public.

CHAPTER FOUR: READERS

This chapter considers readers of Renaissance books about music from two interrelated
perspectives: the social functions of such books and the subject of musical literacy. The first
section surveys generally patterns of ownership—who were the typical owners of different types
of books about music? The second section considers patterns of book-use—how did readers use
their books? On the basis of these patterns of ownership and use, I propose that annotations left
behind in books about music provide extensive evidence of early-modern patterns of musical
literacy, which should be interpreted from the context of the bibliographical cues in these books
and their social functions. The third section presents a new assessment of musical literacy during
the Renaissance by examining how readers derived meaning from musical examples without
reference to sound.
The history of reading during the Renaissance has received very little attention from
musicologists, especially compared to the scholarly attention lavished on authors and printers of
books of music. This is a reflection of the state of sixteenth-century musical sources. Only a
handful of books of music survive in great quantities and many copies show little apparent
evidence of use; this is true of sources in both print and manuscript. The attrition rate of
surviving copies, their wide geographical dispersal at present, and the preferences of
antiquarians, book-dealers, and libraries have filtered access to musical sources and shaped the
ways that scholars interact with them. These have discouraged the study of the historical use of
and reader engagement with books of music.

179

The intersection of musical literacy and notational format (score, choirbook, partbook,
etc.) has been an important musicological concern for several decades. The existing literature
seeks to understand the role that different material forms and notational formats played in
understanding and composing music.1 The most extensive study on this subject, Jessie Ann
Owens’ Composers at Work, shows how the musical texts in music-theory books shed light on
issues of musical literacy. A recent study by Adam Whittaker traces developments in medieval
reading practices through the musical examples in the treatises of Johannes Tinctoris.2 To date,
no scholar has approached this subject using the wealth of evidence encountered in surviving
copies of them.3
At the outset, it is worthwhile to meditate briefly on some methodological concerns,
especially because this area of study is so fresh within musicological inquiry. Evidence of
ownership and use of books about music must be interpreted carefully. Although books about
music survive in far greater quantities than books of music, book historians estimate that
approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of any given edition have not survived to the present.4
Extant copies are the remnants of a process of self-selection that gives preference to pristine
copies, so-called association copies (those formerly owned by well-known historical figures),
and bibliographical curiosities (copies with distinctive bindings, unusual pairings of contents,

etc.).5 These must be understood as extreme ends of a spectrum of ownership and usage during
the period immediately following publication. Copies lying between these extremes demonstrate
reading habits of lay readers, as opposed to professional musicians, aristocratic elite, and
bibliomaniacal collectors, whose books have received the most attention from scholars. Because
their owners generally are unknown, these copies in the middle of the spectrum—the most useful
for present purposes—are precisely those that have vanished over time in the greatest quantities.6
Readers are notoriously difficult to pin down. Books transform their readers as much as
readers transform their books. To read annotated books is to read the development of their
readers; their skills, interests, and habits evolve dynamically in relation to their books and are
thus difficult to isolate or fix conceptually. Sometimes, we know only the name of a book’s
owner, if that, and nothing else. In the intervening centuries since their first creation and use,
dramatic upheavals—social transformations, political conflicts, tragic genocides—also have
dispersed Renaissance books across the globe. All of these factors make it difficult to place
books and their readers in their original contexts.
Two kinds of readers pose special problems. Anonymous readers are those whose
identities are unknown entirely, because we have no record of their name, whether in the form of
signatures or of provenance records. Then there are those readers whose identities are known, but
about whom we know very little. Both anonymous and little-known readers routinely are ignored
in scholarship on the history of reading, for the obvious reason that it can be difficult to establish
the context in which they lived. This is unfortunate, as the kinds of marks they leave in their
books sometimes provide the most penetrating insights: brutally honest commentaries about their

181

books and reading abilities, or consistent evidence about their reading practices and habits. In
some cases, we can deduce certain aspects of their identities other than their name (e.g., age or
occupation) based on these marks and the books in which they appear. For example, annotations
in an uncertain hand with confused Latin grammar in a book on the rudiments of singing strongly
suggest that the book’s owner was a student in a German Latin school.
These reservations notwithstanding, the surviving copies of books about music afford a
synoptic overview of their use and ownership. Many copies of a given book show only moderate
to light evidence of use, but this sparse evidence, considered altogether, presents a wide range of
that book’s usage. This is the chief benefit of a wide collative survey such as that undertaken for
this study. Moreover, thanks to higher rates of survival, books about music are positioned as the
ideal sources for the study of musical readership during the Renaissance. References to books in
contemporary historical documents (booklists, seller catalogs, letters, other books, etc.) indicate
that there are a significant number of so-called “ghost editions” of printed books of music (i.e.,
books for which no copies have survived).7 The same is not true for printed books about music.
Thus, we have a more complete picture of patterns in the publication of books about music and
their subsequent usage.

Patterns in ownership
Who owned and read printed books about music during the Renaissance? This question is key to
assessing the reception of music discourse during the Renaissance, an increasingly important

J. Bernstein, “Buyers and Collectors”; L. Bernstein, “The Bibliography of Music”; Chapman, “Printed Collections
of Music”; Haar, “The Libraria of Antonfrancesco Doni”; Krummel, Bibliotheca bolduaniana; Ongaro, “The
Library”; van Orden, Matieralities, 67–116. It is notable that none of the booklists, catalogs, and libraries considered
in the studies by J. Bernstein, Chapman, and Ongaro contain any books about music. Krummel’s study crossreferences the appearances of books about music in seller catalogs at the Frankfurt Book Fair and in Bolduan’s
bibliography. Further traces of books about music in the book trade are recorded in appendix three.

182

subject in the history of music theory. This question also helps to contextualize the production of
these books, allowing us to understand better their target audiences and rationale. Evidence for
answering this question comes from several sources. Exemplars of the books themselves and
references to them in other documents provide the most direct evidence. We must be wary,
however, of biases within this evidence. Signatures and inscriptions in exemplars sometimes are
forged and testimony that anyone owned or read a given book should be treated as suspect.8
More importantly, ownership is only half the story; we must also consider its use, which is
discussed separately below.
The owners of books about music are as diverse as the books themselves, if not more so.
This makes it difficult to offer blanket generalizations about patterns of ownership. The most
effective strategy to delineate book ownership is by bibliographical format; this also has the
benefit of highlighting the ways that a book’s materiality carried significative meaning. The
standard nomenclature of bibliographical format—folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo, or
sextodecimo, in either upright (portrait) or oblong (landscape)—indicates the number of leaves
printed on the book’s sheets, which were then folded, gathered, and bound. As the number of
leaves increases, so the book’s format and its size decrease. Paul F. Grendler has shown that,
during the Renaissance, a book’s format correlated roughly to its contents; generally speaking,
the larger the book’s format, the greater the scope, ambition, and relative prestige of its
contents.9 Jessie Ann Owens has observed that this holds true in the realm of music theory.10 My
research, summarized in appendix three, shows that patterns of ownership follow this correlation

of format and content. In the sections that follow, I discuss each bibliographical format, from
smallest to largest.11

Octavo format
Books in octavo are made from sheets folded three times to produce gatherings of eight leaves or
sixteen pages. Octavo is the smallest format commonly used in books about music.12 Its modest
size, approximately 10 × 15 centimeters, meant that the resulting books were portable. This is
significant because reading traditionally took place in a single location, whether library, study, or
classroom.13 Overwhelmingly, music books in octavo were used in classroom instruction to teach
the rudiments of music theory, and especially the singing of chant and simple polyphony. The
portability of octavo was appropriate in these cases, because students benefitted from the
reinforcement of studying in multiple locations. Many of these books are catechistic in content,
their question-and-answer format mimicking the method of rote instruction employed in the
classroom. Books about music in octavo thus maximized pedagogical utility.
A select few octavo books about music were published in Italy, such as the anonymous
Cantorinus seu compendium musices (1513) and Bonaventura da Brescia’s Regula musicae
planae (1497). The vast majority, however, were transalpine in origin and destined for German

11

My rationale for proceeding upward in scale is that most similar surveys of this kind proceed downward in scale,
privileging folio volumes. In terms of relative size of ownership, the opposite seems to have been the case—smaller
books were owned in greater quantities.
12

Smaller formats (duodecimo and sextodecimo) were possible, of course, but were used very rarely. I do not
discuss here broadsides about music (single-sheet publications), which are very rare before the late sixteenthcentury. One of the more well-known music-theory broadside is Vicentino, untitled description of the arciorgano
(1561), about which see Vicentino, Ancient Music, xxiii; and Kaufmann, “Vicentino’s Arciorgano.”

Latin schools, which trained choirboys for liturgical singing in Protestant churches.14 The
following were among the most popular books about music published during the sixteenth
century, judged in terms of number of editions and surviving copies.
•

Heinrich Faber, Compendiolum musicae pro incipientibus (first ed. Nuremberg: Johann
von Bern and Ulrich Neuber, 1548). Forty-six known later eds. at Augsburg, Breslau
(now Wrocław), Brunswick, Erfurt, Franfurt an der Oder, Görlitz, Goslar, Greifswald,
Leipzig, Magdeburg, Nuremberg, and Wolfenbüttel, 1548–1617.

•

Johannes Galliculus, Isagoge de compositione cantus (first ed. Leipzig: Valentin
Schumann, 1520). Four later eds. as Libellus de compositione cantus (Wittenberg: Georg
Rhau, 1538–1553).

•

Nicolaus Listenius, Musica (first ed. Wittenberg: Georg Rhau, 1537). Forty-five known
later eds. at Augsburg, Frankfurt an der Oder, Leipzig, Nuremberg, Wittenberg, 1537–
1583.

•

Georg Rhau, Enchiridion untriusque musicae practicae (first ed. Wittenberg: Georg
Rhau, 1517). Thirteen known later eds. at Leipzig and Wittenberg, 1517–1553).

The books by Faber and Listenius, in particular, formed the basis for many students’ knowledge
of music. Many of these editions are attested in only a single surviving copy, indicating that the
books were read and reread to the point of literal destruction, or perhaps that they were not
deemed important enough for preservation in a permanent collection of books.

Livingstone, “The Theory and Practice.” Two octavo books about music produced for use outside primary
education were Glarean, Musicae epitome (1557) and Glarean, Uss Glareani Musick ein Usszug (1557), which were
designed for university students. Galilei, Discorso intorno all’opere di Gioseffo Zarlino (1589) is another curiosity
in octavo, perhaps viewed as an occasional text.

185

The owners of books in octavo are the most difficult to identify by name. Often, they are
identified simply by first name, toponym, or monogram (“Johannes,” “Johannes Lipsensis,” or
“IL”/“JL”). And yet many of these readers left behind abundant or distinctive annotations. Such
octavo-sized instructional books provide alluring glimpses into the world of schoolboys. For
example, a copy of Martin Agricola’s Musica instrumentalis deudsch (1542) at US-Cn
(shelfmark Vault Case 3A 726) contains in the back of the volume a liber amicorum consisting
of twenty-four flyleaves (forty-eight pages) filled with handwritten comments from the owner’s
friends—the sixteenth-century equivalent of yearbook signatures.15 Only through his friends’
annotations, dated from 1573 to 1575, do we know the identity of the book’s owner, one
Johannes Colostrius, a student at the Kreuzschule in Dresden. For example, one representative
annotation (figure 4.1) includes sayings by Cicero and Menader, and ends with the following
signature:
Hæc, Joanni Colostrio | amico & ſodali ſuo, ſcri= | pſit Matthias Metthuius |
Dreſdæ: 5 Nonas August. | Anno 1573.
Thus wrote Matthias Metthuius to his friend and comrade Johannes Colostrius, in
Dresden, the fifth of August, 1573.
Colustrius’ copy of Agricola’s book is but one of many further copies of instructional books in
octavo that provide strikingly detailed evidence of reader use.

Quarto format
Books in quarto are made from sheets folded twice to produce gatherings of four leaves or eight
pages. The size of quarto format, approximately 15 × 20 centimeters, connoted approachability
of topic, practicality of language, and an introductory scope. Books about music in quarto,

although learned in content, mostly were aimed at and read by lay readers, not specialists or
professionals; generally, they provide an entry-level exposition of a music topic, so as to inspire
further study. A handful of books about music in quarto were published outside Italy, such as
Simon de Quercu’s Opusculum musices (Vienna, 1509), and posthumous editions of Jacques
Lefèvre d’Étaples’s Musica libris quatuor demonstrata (Paris, 1551). All of these edizioni
oltremontani are in Latin and subscribe to the traditional view of music as a mathematical
science; very few touch on practical concerns such as liturgical singing or counterpoint, Claudio
Sebastiani’s Bellum musicale (Strasbourg, 1563) being a notable counterexample.16
The vast majority of books about music in quarto were published in Italy. By and large,
they present comprehensive overviews of particular musical topics. Among the first of these to
appear was Johannes Tinctoris’ Terminorum musiace diffinitorium (c. 1495), the first printed
dictionary of music. The following are among the more popular books about music in quarto,
again judged in terms of number of editions and surviving copies:
•

Pietro Aaron, Lucidario in musica (Venice: Girolamo Scotto, 1545).

•

Angelo da Picitono, Fior angelico di musica (Venice: Agostino Bindoni, 1547).

•

Luigi Dentice, Duo dialoghi della musica (first ed. Naples: Matteo Cancer, 1552; second
ed. Rome: Vincenzo Luchino, 1553).

•

Vicente Lusitano, Introdutione facilissima et novissima (first ed. Rome: Antonio Blado,
1553; two later eds. at Venice, 1558 and 1561).

•

Oratio Tigrini, Il compendio della musica (Venice: Ricciardo Amadino, 1588; second ed.,
1602).

16

Owens, “You Can Tell a Book by Its Cover,” 351–57 and 368–71 provides a helpful list of later English examples
that address practical concerns; many of these notably have oblong orientation.

188

An important commonality among these books is their use of vernacular Italian. Books about
music in Italian first emerged in folio format (see appendix one for the works of Franchinus
Gaffurius and his pupil Francesco Caza, 1492 and 1508). Nonetheless, the vernacular came to be
associated most closely with books about music in quarto, given their accessibility and
friendliness to lay readers.
The approachability of quarto-sized books is exemplified best in the Dialogo della
musica (1544) of Antonfrancesco Doni (1513–1574), a famous Florentine poligrafo living at
Venice. Doni’s Dialogo is a one-of-a-kind dialogue that mixes performances of madrigals and
motets with witty conversation in the vein of Baldassare Castiglione’s Book of the Courtier.17
The book consists of four partbooks, the first of which contains the text of the dialogue and the
canto parts of the musical numbers; the alto, tenor, and bass partbooks contain only the musical
numbers. The partbooks are notable for their upright (portrait) orientation, whereas oblong
(landscape) was the industry standard for most books in quarto format.18 Books about music
generally followed patterns in the publication of prose books, not music of books, in their upright
orientation. Several important counterexamples of this trend are accounted for in the booklists of
Doni (see below).
The readers of books about music in quarto about whom we know the most are the most
atypical readers of such books—musicians, composers, and music theorists who mentioned other
books in their own writings or record them in their booklists. Thus, for example, we know from
Antonfrancesco Doni that he owned or at least knew of a host of books of and about music. He

because Doni lists a book does not mean he had even seen it, nor are his entries entirely free of

errors.21 The posthumous revision of Doni’s La seconda libraria (1580) provides confirmation of
this point. The list—probably not complied by Doni, who died in 1574—includes four books by
Gioseffo Zarlino: “Institutioni armoniche. Dimostrationi armoniche. Trattato della Patienza.
Dialogo della Musica.”22 The last item is clearly an error, a duplicate of Zarlino’s dialogue, the
Dimostrationi harmoniche (1571).
More typical owners of books about music in quarto are very difficult to discern. Unlike
books about music in octavo, which attracted a unified audience of students, these books
attracted a more diverse assortment of owners and readers. Although most readers seem to have
been adults—on the basis of matured handwriting—we are left with little information about their
occupational or regional identities, except that they tended to write in Latin or Italian and seem
not to have been professional musicians. (“Non intendo”/“I do not understand” is a frequently
encountered annotation.) Although many of these books contain reader signatures and
inscriptions, many such owners fall into the category of little-known readers, about whom we
only know their names. This is likely a consequence of their being musical amateurs, typically
forgotten over time.

Folio format
Books in folio are made from sheets folded once to produce gatherings of two leaves or four
pages. Folio format, which measured approximately 20 × 30 centimeters, connoted academic
style, formal language (whether in Latin or a vernacular), and a comprehensive scope. Books

about music in folio typically were aimed at the intellectually-minded elite (aristocrats,
collectors, clerics, etc.), the libraries of institutions (monasteries, civic organizations, academies,
etc.), and musicians (singers, instrumentalists, composers, and music theorists, to the extent they
may be distinguished). They generally provide an authoritative exposition on a broad topic
within the study of music (harmony, counterpoint, mode, etc.). The roominess of the folio-sized
monograph made it the ideal vehicle for the introduction and explication of new concepts and
theories. Unlike quarto and octavo, which tended to be viewed as cheap or workaday formats,
folio was viewed as a luxurious format reserved for important or groundbreaking works. Editions
and translations of ancient Greek and classical Latin texts, some newly recovered through the
efforts of humanists, were published almost exclusively in folio, such as Giorgio Valla’s
translation of Cleonides’s Harmonicum introductorium (1497) and Heinrich Glarean’s
translation of Boethius’s complete works (1546).23
The publication of books in folio was geographically diverse. Italy in general, and Venice
in particular, remained the center of production of such books about music, although examples
may be found in almost every region of Europe, especially Basel, London, Paris, and Salamanca
(see chapter one). This was a consequence of the international reach of the Latin language, which
still dominated primary and secondary education and which continued to shape patterns of
thought. During the second quarter of the century, vernacular-language books in folio emerged
as a popular alternative for works of serious intellectual weight. Pietro Aaron’s Toscanello in
musica (1523) followed the lead of Gaffurius and Caza, also drawing explicitly on the heels of
Pietro Bembo’s Prose della volgar lingua (completed 1519–1524, with excerpts widely
circulated in manuscript before completion; first ed. 1525), which aimed to establish the Tuscan

dialect as the proper basis for the Italian language.24 Appearing in the last years of the sixteenth
century, Thomas Morley’s A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597)—
another genre-bending dialogue like Doni’s—was the first English-language book about music in
folio.
Books in folio were the least accessible to general audiences because they typically
assumed prior knowledge of music or at least a solid foundation in the liberal arts curriculum.
But because they were viewed as deluxe products, we have the most surviving copies of these
works, and therefore know the most about their ownership. The following are among the more
popular books about music in folio, again judged in terms of number of editions and surviving
copies:

Not surprisingly, the most avid consumers of Renaissance music theory were Renaissance
musicians and music theorists. Although precious few copies of their books survive, we know
that many of them read widely and attentively in their field, to judge at least from their written
references to other authors. (References to printed books in the writings of Renaissance
musicians also are recorded in appendix three.) However carefully music theorists read the works
of their contemporaries, generally speaking, they did not preserve their responses in the books of
their libraries. I show in appendix one that Gioseffo Zarlino, for example, typically did not write
anything other than his name in his books. Bonnie Blackburn has shown that Giovanni Spataro
typically included only brief corrections, sometimes omitting even his name.25 Claudio
Monteverdi wrote only his name on his copies of Zarlino’s books; their heavily-used condition
and his response to Giovanni Maria Artusi’s critiques indicate, nonetheless, that he read them
very closely. Rather, music theorists and other musicians likely recorded their thoughts in
journals or commonplace books, which afforded more space for reflection than the margins of
the books themselves. Copying out passages and arranging them by topic—whether in a formal
commonplace book or not—was a time-honored tradition for digesting important works.26 Thus,

the reactions of many such readers are accessible only through the filter of their own
publications, which are an important record of the dissemination of Renaissance music theory in
print.

Bibliographical format and scholarly value
Different bibliographical formats appealed to different kinds of readers, both musicians and nonmusicians. Books in octavo served students beginning their musical studies. Books in quarto
served musicians, both amateur and professional, interested in expanding their intellectual
horizons. Books in folio served professional musicians and well-educated lay readers. The
topical and bibliographical variety of books about music and the diverse audiences for them have
been underemphasized within the limited scholarship on their readership. Scholars have paid the
most attention to folio-sized music theory books in studying the impact of Renaissance music
theory. The names of Aaron, Gaffurius, Glarean, Vicentino, and Zarlino, authors of the most
historically-significant books about music in folio, have attained places of honor in most
histories of music, and indeed in this study. This has an appealing air of historical authenticity, as
books in folio were viewed then and continue to be viewed now as prestige publications.
But this creates a skewed picture of the field of Renaissance music theory and its readers.
Scholarly focus on books about music in folio leads to the tacit assumption that the subject
appealed only to professional musicians and humanists, and that these individuals only read these
kinds of books about music, whether in folio or any other format.27 Although smaller-format

27

This perhaps is made most explicit in Palisca, Humanism, which is dominated overwhelmingly by books in folio
and manuscripts, both luxury commodities. Owens, “You Can Tell a Book by Its Cover,” 377–78 makes a similar
observation about the disproportionate representation of folio-sized books in Reese, Fourscore Classics (1957).
Many overviews of the field of Renaissance music discourse that are balanced with respect to bibliographical
formats (e.g., Moyer, Musica Scientia) could be enriched and refined substantially by making explicit reference to
format as a connotative determinant of intended content, style, or audience.

195

books have assumed increasing importance in recent surveys of music education, their role as the
most widely-read books about music and as establishers of paradigmatic thought during the
Renaissance merit further attention.28 Another area for further study is the connotative meanings
of format beyond content, examined in chapter three. Studying a wider range of books about
music and the habits of their diverse readers will contribute to an enriched picture of music
education and the place of books in everyday life during the Renaissance.

Patterns in book-use
In 1602, Sir Thomas Bodley established a permanent library at the University of Oxford. Keen to
prevent the misfortunes of previous libraries at Oxford, which had all but disappeared by the
seventeenth century, he drafted a lengthy memorandum, the famed “Bodley Statutes,” which
established the library’s governance, organization, and mission. Among the statutes is the
following provision:
You shall Promise and Swear in the Presence of the Almighty God, That
whensoever you shall repair to the Publick Library of this University, you will
conform your self to study with Modesty and Silence; and use, both the Books,
and everything else appertaining to their Furniture, with a careful Respect to their
longest Conservation: And that neither your self in Person, nor any other
whatsoever, by your Procurement or Privity, shall either openly or underhand, by
way of embezling, changing, razing, defacing, tearing, cutting, noting, interlining,
or by voluntary corrupting, blotting, blurring, or any other manner of mangling or
misusing, any one or more of the said Books, either wholly or in part, make any
Alteration: But shall hinder and impeach, as much as lieth in you, all and every
such Offender or Offenders, by detecting their Demeanour unto the ViceChancellor, or to his Deputy then in place, within the next Three Days after it
shall come to your Knowledge: so help you God by Christ’s Merits, according to
the Doctrine of his Holy Evangelists.29

Today, first-time patrons of the library are required to swear an oath affirming the same, but in
much simplified language:
I hereby undertake not to remove from the Library, or to mark, deface, or injure in
any way, any volume, document, or other object belonging to it or in its custody;
not to bring into the Library or kindle therein any fire or flame, and not to smoke
in the Library; and I promise to obey all rules of the Library.30
This oath has become a quaint tradition; the library’s gift shop sells t-shirts, towels, and tote bags
emblazoned with the oath in both English and Latin in a pseudo-decayed sixteenth-century
typeface, complete with rubricated initials and antique letterforms (e.g., “æ,” “œ,” and the
pilcrow, ¶).
As one of the first public legal-deposit libraries, the oath provided an important safeguard
for the collection’s long-term preservation.31 This is because, up until the twentieth century,
readers were taught to write in their books, and extensively so.32 This is very different from
injunctions taught to young readers today, that to mark a book is to defile its sanctity. A motto by
Geoffrey Whitney, the sixteenth-century English poet, makes explicit the imperative to use one’s
books in the fullest sense: “Usus libri, non lectio prudentes facit” (“The use of a book, not
reading makes wise”).33 Accompanying the motto are a woodcut illustration (figure 4.2) and a
poem. The illustration juxtaposes two modes of book-use. The reader at the left stands at a

distance, gazing passively at the book open on the lectern. The reader at the right stands erect,
actively reading the open book, touching it with his fingers, and probably reading it aloud. The
poem hammers home the moral interpretation of the motto and illustration:

He reapes but toile, and neuer gaineth fame:
Firste reade, then marke, then practise that is good,
For without vse, we drinke but L E TH E flood.

And wisedome then, doth euermore ensue:
Then printe in minde, what wee in printe do reade,
Els loose wee time, and books in vaine do vewe:

Nor hide it vp, whereby no good shall growe.34

Whitney’s instruction first to read and then to mark one’s books exemplifies the actions of
Renaissance readers of books about music, which abound with evidence of their use. In this
section, I outline broadly the kinds of marks made by their readers and consider briefly their
functions. In sum, these marks enabled readers to chart their progress through a book and to
make sense of its meanings. They fall roughly into two categories that correspond to the two
kinds of texts encountered in books about music, textual marks and musical marks.35 The end of
this section considers further patterns in book-use involving customizations that allowed readers
to modify the structure of a book without marking in it.

Textual marks
Sixteenth-century readers entered into a dialogical relationship with their books.36 A reader’s
marks constitute one side of a kind of conversation with a book’s author that allowed the reader
to process, understand, and retain its contents. This applied doubly so for readers of books about
music, which presented a difficult subject withheld during former times from general knowledge
by a guild-like instinct toward secrecy. Marks of agreement form the most significant category of
textual marks. The words “yes,” “good,” and “true” in various languages—sì/oui/ja/si,
bene/bien/gut/bonum, and vero/vrai/wahr/verum—are among the most frequently encountered
marginalia in books about music of all kinds. Likewise for their negations, “no,” “bad,” and
“false”—no/non/nein/non, cattivo/mal/schlecht/male, and falso/faux/falsch/false. Their symbolic
equivalents—check marks and exes, and, more rarely, exclamation marks and question marks—
served as a convenient shorthand system.

35

Here, I follow the lead of Greer, Manuscript Inscriptions, which lays out a broad typology of reader marks in
printed books of music.

199

Marks of emphasis form another important category of textual annotations. With these
marks, readers indicated important and significant passages, or ones to revisit at a later point in
time. Underlining was the most prevalent method for marking emphasis, appearing in over
eighty percent of the annotated exemplars I have examined. Longer passages were marked with
vertical lines or brackets in the margins near the passage in question. Readers who underlined
prolifically faced the problem of distinguishing and prioritizing their marks. Readers sometimes
placed keywords, check marks, and variations of the phrase “nota bene” beside underlined
passages to mark the most important ones. To mark special emphasis, Renaissance readers
adopted a symbol developed by medieval scribes to denote important passages, the manicule
(ඪ).37 This mark, also called a fist, index, or pointer, quickly draws the eye. Stylizations of the
manicule varied widely, even among individual annotators of books about music. Sometime a
single squiggle sufficed; other times, readers introduced three-dimensional effects or added
fingernails and cuffs. Figure 4.3 presents three variants of the manicule found among a single
reader’s annotations; the first variant merges the pointed finger of the manicule with the bracket.
Other kinds of marks afforded a broader range of reader interactions beyond simple
agreement or emphasis.38 The most common of these are marks of clarification. These include
keywords explaining shifts in subject matter, definitions of terms, and indications of a text’s
inner structure (e.g., marking items in a list embedded in prose or noting the introduction of a
new idea mid-paragraph). Occasionally, these are lengthier explanations of a text’s general
meaning or significance, which present valuable insight into a reader’s thought processes. Marks
of interrogation likewise indicate points at which the reader failed to understand the author’s

meaning or challenged propositions and assertions in the text. Marks of expansion—typically in
the form of cross-references to other authorities and sources—illustrate how ideas and books
figured into a reader’s larger interests and habits. Marks of correction bear witness to a reader’s
recognition of the shortcomings of an author, editor, or printer.
In chapter two, I showed that during the Renaissance authors and printers of books about
music began to add printed marginalia to their books as a means of anticipating readers’ needs.
This was a reflection of well-established contemporary reading practices. Paul Saenger, Michael
Heinlin, and Tobin Nellhaus have argued that annotating books provided authors, printers, and
readers alike ways to make each page visually distinct.39 The visual homogeneity of a plain
typeset text presented challenges to the reader by offering very few optical vantage points;
annotations made it easier for readers to scan and track passages along each page and provided a
means for remembering the contents of a page through its appearance. For readers, this
functioned in a tactile sense, too. Rebecca L. Fall has shown that the expression “mark my
words,” which originated during the Renaissance, had both literal and figurative meanings.40 We
encounter traces of this process in the form of fingerprints, handprints, and ink smudges, a
material reminder that inkwells were never far away from a reader’s hand. Readers sometimes
copied out passages of a book verbatim, either in the margin, elsewhere in the book, or in a
commonplace book. This process helped readers digest, understand, and remember a text’s
meaning.

One kind of copying-out particular to books about music is the sequence of integers
developed by Guido of Arezzo to represent the pitches of the gamut.41 Arithmetic with large
numbers is required to find the common terms for every intervallic possibility latent within the
gamut. Today, such pitch sequences are represented numerically in cents or Hertz, which admit
decimals and fractional parts that were only first developed during the sixteenth century.42 The
resultant integer sequence puzzled many sixteenth-century readers, some of whom ventured to
understand its logic. Consider, for example, the proportions of the lowest diapente (a segment of
five contiguous pitches) of the gamut. The method for calculating the common terms of multiple
proportions is to multiply the values of the common term and then cross-multiply to produce the
other terms, proceeding iteratively with new proportions. To avoid having to reduce the terms,
one expands the set by introducing where possible proportions with the smallest integers (i.e.,
3:2 is preferred over 9:8). Thus, one begins with the perfect fifth (3:2) between Γ and D and the
perfect fourth (4:3) between Γ and C. The common terms are found first by multiplying the
values of the shared term for Γ (3 × 4 = 12), then cross-multiplying this product to yield the other
terms. Thus, the term for D is 2 × 12 ÷ 3, or 8; and the term for C is 3 × 12 ÷ 4, or 9.
Incidentally, this process offers a proof that the proportion of the tone (between C and D) is 9:8.

The most well-known examples of this interval sequence are Gaffurius, Practica (1496), sig. a3v; Glarean,
Dodecachordon (1547), 4; and Zarlino, Istitutioni (1558), 104. It should be noted that the integer sequence
represents lengths of a string; thus lower pitches have larger numbers and vice-versa, which runs counter to modern
systems that assign larger numbers to higher pitches.
42

The modern system of decimal notation was first described by Flemish mathematician and physicist Simon Stevin
in De thiende (1585).

203

This diagram shows that the proportion in smallest terms of Γ:C:D is 12:9:8. One continues the
sequence with the perfect fourth between A and D:

This method produces immediately the smallest common terms. By and large, however, readers
filled in the diapente moving upward by pitch, which required reducing the terms to those given
above (in this case, dividing each term by three):
D

These are only the first five notes of the twenty-two standard ones; to proceed in similar fashion
through the entire gamut required the outermost terms of 10,368 (Γ) and 1,536 (ee)—which
challenged the arithmetical skills of most readers, especially when it required reducing to lowest
terms. Figure 4.4 provides a representative example of one anonymous reader’s attempts to make
sense of this seemingly arbitrary integer sequence. Another kind of textual working-out common

43

Although the proportion with the smallest integers, technically speaking, would be the Ptolemaic ditone (5:4 =
1.25) between Γ and B, most theorists took at this point the tone (9:8) between A and B. The reason for this is that it
created equal-sized tones between Γ and A, A and B, C and D, D and E, and F and G, which in turn also created the
slightly larger Pythagorean ditone (81:64 = 1.265625) between Γ and B.

case.

in books about music is the addition of solmization syllables to musical examples, discussed
below.
These kinds of textual marks—marks of agreement, emphasis, clarification, interrogation,
correction, and expansion—serve many different, and sometimes overlapping functions for their
writers. The most salient function, and one that pervades most kinds of reader marks, is that of
memory aid. One of the drawbacks of the medium of print was that it eliminated the need to
labor after knowledge—that is, to struggle with unfamiliar handwriting, to transcribe
painstakingly an entire manuscript, or to hunt through libraries, archives, and scriptoria in search
of a particular work. Copying and working out passages in a printed text enabled comprehension
by slowing the pace of textual digestion. It also encouraged retention by involving different

205

modes of sensory engagement. Books about music witness the resurgence of the ancient notion
of reinforcing knowledge through the various senses during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries.44 One edition of the collected works of Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples (1510) concludes
with a full-page woodcut illustration of the “active scholar” (“studiosus palestrites,” figure 4.5).45
The illustration suggests that the faculty of imagination, represented as stars in the scholar’s
head, results from connections between the sensory organs. The ears and the mouth facilitate the
ability to hear and to speak; the eyes and the hand facilitate the ability to read and to write. The
woodcut illustrates the reinforcement of knowledge through the pairing of receptive (hearing and
reading) and productive (speaking and writing) modes of sensory engagement, modes in which
stimuli respectively enter and exit the body. The dual presence of the quill and book in the hands
of the scholar provides further confirmation of the importance of writing in one’s books during
the Renaissance as at tool for mastery of content.
In spite of these ennobling ideals, books about music also lived mundane lives as material
objects. Books preserve traces of their everyday existence—worn bindings, torn-out page
corners, damage from exposure to light, water, and pests. Some readers engaged their books in
trivial, inane ways, such as coloring in illustrations and doodling (figure 4.6). Owners even used
books in ways unintended by their makers. A copy of Thomas Morley’s Plaine and Easie
Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597) at US-Wcm (shelfmark shelfmark ML171 .G12)
provides an especially rich case-in-point. Alongside extensive annotations pertaining to music

The woodcut appeared earlier in a treatise on the senses in Charles de Bovelles, Que hoc volumine
continentur…liber de sensu (1510), f. 60v. The rendering of “studiosus palestrites” as “active scholar” fails to
account for the rich layers of meaning in palestrites, which refers both to the subject of rhetoric and to gymnastic
activity. The palaestra was an ancient Greek academy that included various exercise facilities, cloisters, and
spacious rooms filled with “seats where philosophers, teachers of rhetoric and other studious persons can sit and
discuss.” Vitruvius, On Architecture, 1:309.

books—then and now—languish on shelves, hide underneath piles on desks, and serve as scratch
paper just as often as they engage the imaginations of their readers.

Musical marks
Music was a difficult, multifaceted subject to learn, involving at once the study of many different
specialized topics—terminology, arithmetic, history, philosophy, and foreign languages. The
biggest challenge most readers faced was learning to read, write, and perform from musical
notation; this is a commonplace in the scholarship on musical literacy during the Renaissance.46
Readers of books about music used a wide range of marks that demonstrate the learning
processes they employed to acquire these skills.
Many readers of books about music added solmization syllables to musical examples.
Basic instruction during the Renaissance relied on a centuries-old system developed around the
year 1000 by Guido of Arezzo. Jane Daphne Hatter has argued that Renaissance compositional
practice continued to invoke the hexachord both practically and symbolically.47 Stefano
Mengozzi has noted the near-universal anxiety of students created by the application of
overlapping hexachords to real, polyphonic music in a cyclic system of seven pitches.48 The
addition of solmization syllables demonstrates readers’ efforts to approach musical examples
from a practical perspective. It further indicates genuine engagement with broader didactic

purposes, a first step toward understanding the theoretical principles underlying a particular
musical example. An individual reader’s addition of solmization syllables seems to correlate
inversely to their skill as a musician; students add in more syllables than professionals. The sheer
quantity of solmization syllables added by readers to their books about music, especially to
singing primers for beginners, suggests their value for the study of music pedagogy during the
Renaissance. One example is particularly significant, encountered in a copy of Oratio Tigrini’s Il
compendio della musica (1602), which contains examples that are solmized, then transcribed into
organ tablature in the margin nearby (figure 4.8). This book’s annotations place its reader in a
specific physical location and social context, alone at the organ bench. I would emphasize that
such annotations remind us that the study of music occurred in many different physical spaces
and social contexts, from the noisy rote memorization in the classroom, to private contemplation
in the carrel, or intense engagement in the studio.
The introduction of bar lines solved one problem of studying examples of polyphonic
music, the need to track parts that proceed at different paces. David Greer has shown that bar
lines were the most common musical mark added by readers to books of music printed in
211

Figure 4.9. Bar lines added to a musical example. In Oratio Tigrini, Il compendio della musica

England during the Renaissance.49 This was necessary in almost every notational format,
including variations of score format (figure 4.9). The problem was compounded in choirbook
format, in which parts are separated by substantial vertical space. Cristle Collins Judd has drawn
attention to one instance in which bar lines were not enough to help a reader of Thomas Morley’s
Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597) to spot congruent moments in two
parts, necessitating the addition of alphabetical labels or rehearsal marks.50 Occasionally readers
introduced the signum congruentiae (sign of congruence) in multiple parts to indicate
corresponding moments; early on, printers added them to musical examples for the convenience
of readers (see figure 3.5). To judge from the relative frequency of bar lines added by readers (in
about twenty percent of the annotated exemplars I have examined), many attempted to perform

Judd, Reading Renaissance Music Theory, 9. Ibid. nonetheless argues that “the relative infrequency of such
annotations in surviving sources suggests that earlier in the century such a reading together of disparate parts was a
skill assumed on the part of at least some readers and writers of treatises.” I concur that reading from separate parts
was possible and expected, although my research indicates that reader annotations are far more common than Judd
allows. Many readers used a range of annotative techniques, including bar lines, to read musical notation from
separate parts (see below, under “Textual function.”) For a similar instance of early-modern alphabetic rehearsal
marks in the context of a primer on lute intabulation, see Owens, Composers at Work, 53 (plate 3.7).

the musical examples in books about music in an effort to understand and analyze them.
Although performances by small vocal ensembles were possible, it seems likely that most efforts
were at the lute or organ. This raises the question of how these examples were read for
comprehension; the subject of silent reading of musical notation is discussed below.
Another analytic technique widely used by readers was the addition of numerals between
staves to indicate intervallic sequences. The reckoning of vertical intervals was central to the
study of counterpoint, whether in note-against-note progressions or more florid styles. Writing
out numerals between staves served various purposes. On a fundamental level, it gave readers a
chance to practice different, overlapping skills—reading pitches in different clefs, tracking
different locations simultaneously, calculating intervals between pitches—in a nonthreatening,
rudimentary context. On a higher level, writing out intervals allowed readers to understand,
assess, and try out the contrapuntal precepts described in the text. The practice of writing out
intervals likewise instilled into the minds of would-be contrapuntists the balancing and
interweaving of melodic (horizontal) and harmonic (vertical) modes of musical thought. The
markings in a copy of Franchinus Gaffurius’s Practica musicae (1502) exemplify this critical
mode of thought (figure 4.10). The annotator, an unknown member of the Monastery of San
Zeno in Bavaria, has barred the example to rein in the different parts; added numerals between
the staves represent the intervals; and added numerals below the staves to indicate the
contrapuntal rules that each bar illustrates. This reader’s thorough analysis of the musical
example reflects the profound lengths to which readers went to achieve mastery over their books.
Yet mastery eluded many readers. The margins of many books about music preserve
traces of their readers’ struggles. Most often, these annotations take the form of rewriting
musical passages. Many factors contributed to reader confusion with musical examples. Notation

was the most significant; the inconsistent application of notational formats (score, separate parts,
and numerous varieties in between) challenged the skills of readers, especially in individual
sources. In mensural notation, notes were not spaced in proportion to their durations; that is, a
breve, semibreve, minim, and semiminim all took up roughly the same amount of horizontal
space on the page. Thus, the pace at which readers followed individual parts was constantly in
flux, which made it very difficult to assess the flow of musical time in multiple parts. This was
true of every notational format, even score format—figure 4.9 shows a typical example of the
horizontal skewing encountered in early-modern scores. The physical distance between
separately-notated parts posed further challenges to readers. I argue below that reading music
silently from separate parts was possible to learn with practice, although the nature of the
comprehension derived in this way defies current notions of musical literacy. Readers rewrote
musical examples to minimize these challenges, often using score format, proportionally-spaced
notation, or instrumental tablature. This was true also of canons, conceptually-complex, but

notationally-elegant musical examples. The conceptual wrinkle of reading a canon was that one
must track two or more locations simultaneously on the same musical part (as opposed different
locations on different musical parts). Even professionals struggled with this skill. The copy of
Zarlino’s Istitutioni belonging to the Bolognese music theorist Ercole Bottrigari contains several
canons rewritten in the margins using barred score format (figure 4.11). Such instances of
rewritten musical examples point up the complexities of mensural notation that largely have been
ignored by modern scholars of musical literacy during the Renaissance.
Books about music provided their writers with a convenient medium for jotting down
musical ideas. Although this use was unintended by the book’s makers, it was fitting
215

nonetheless, given that such books inspired the imaginations of their readers. Often these jottings
provide clues into the provenance of the exemplar. For example, the copy of Illuminato Aiguino
da Brescia’s La illuminata de tutti i tuoni di canto fermo (1562) at US-Cn (shelfmark Vault Case
4A 2102) contains several layers of rich annotation by a single reader. The only direct evidence
of the reader’s identity is the cryptic monogram “FGV” written on the title page. The
annotations, however, make repeated reference to the city of Padua and musicians working there
at the Basilica Pontificia di Sant’Antonio. Alongside these annotations are newly-composed
fragments of chant and a canon written by Costanzo Porta, the most famous musician who
worked there. Instances of copied-out musical excerpts show how books about music functioned
in diverse contexts, whether in a close-knit community of chapel singers or among the cramped
shelves of a scholar’s library.

Customizations
One important category of evidence concerning a book’s use is the customizations that a reader
made to the physical form of the book. The history of reading largely has focused on reader
marks in the forms of annotations and marginalia, ignoring this valuable category of
bibliographical evidence. It is important to remember that books were sold exactly as they were
printed, as unbound, unfolded loose sheets of paper.51 Even before it could be used, a book
needed to be folded, bound, and trimmed. Given this extra outlay of money, readers developed
particular preferences for customizing their books. Even purchasers of secondhand copies had
them rebound and trimmed. Unfortunately, only about a third of the exemplars I have examined

firsthand retain period bindings and decorations; the majority of extant bindings date from late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the collecting of music books reached its peak.
Binding was the most characteristic form of customization. The subject of bookbinding
has been well studied, and surviving copies of books about music tend to follow broader patterns
in bookbinding.52 Period bindings of books about music ranged all way from simple cardboard or
parchment covers to lavishly-decorated leather bindings with elaborate stitching. Endpapers—
sheets of paper glued to the inside covers and sewn into or glued to the bookblock—ranged from
plain paper to colored or decorated papers. Exceptionally well-heeled readers had book-edges
gilt or sprinkled. By and large, however, most readers of books about music used simple,
unpretentious bindings—these were not books to display to one’s friends, but books to read and
to study.
Bookbinders offered additional services beyond finishing and decorating the assembled
book. Many copies of books about music have ribbons sewn into the stitching that date from the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; these ribbons acted as bookmarks for readers, much like
those in bibles, lectionaries, and hymnals today. Many of these ribbons are in poor condition,
even detached from the stitching, suggesting heavy use. Although we usually cannot tell into
which pages readers placed bookmarks, their presence indicates a particularly intense mode of
engagement with that book, a desire to return repeatedly to it.
Another option bookbinders offered clients was interleaved pages. By inserting a blank
sheet of paper between each printed sheet, the folded, assembled book would have one or more
blank pages facing each printed page, offering additional room for annotations. Blank sheets also
could be added to the front or back of the volume, creating what are known as flyleaves.

52

For a basic introduction to the subject, see Gaskell, Introduction, 146–53.

217

Interleaved pages and flyleaves are most commonly associated with smaller-format books,
especially those used in classroom instruction. A copy of Heinrich Faber’s Compendiolum
(1575) at US-Cn (shelfmark Case 3A 737) contains interleaved pages filled with additional
notes, including explanations, cross-references other books, and a reading list probably from the
1570s (table 4.1). Like bookmarks, interleaved pages indicate a desire for close, repeated
reading—even if, in the end, many of the pages remained blank.
Many readers bound two or more books together. Sometimes this was merely an
economic expedience, as binding was a necessary, discrete cost of owning books. Other times,
binding books together helped readers to arrange burgeoning collections. Very seldom are books
about music bound with non-music books.53 The commonality of subject reflects an instinct to
organize and group. Large volumes of books bound together, so-called binder’s volumes or tract
volumes, are common with oblong quarto partbooks, although practical use in that state seems
doubtful; such volumes probably belonged instead to collectors and institutional libraries.54
Binder’s volumes of books about music are common for octavo-sized instructional books, many
of which display evidence of heavy use. Many of these books about music in octavo treat of only
a single aspect of music, meaning that they were often combined with other books to round out a
student’s knowledge of the subject. A binder’s volume at US-R that contains sixteen music
treatises in octavo provides special insight into classroom instruction (table 4.2). Its owner,
Abraham Ursinus, an unknown student at an unidentified Latin school in Germany, preserved all

53

Several binder’s volumes in appendix three provide counterexamples of this trend.

extraordinarily detailed picture of music instruction during the Renaissance.55

Silent reading and musical examples
It remains an open scholarly question how Renaissance readers approached the act of reading
musical notation. Indeed, the word “read” itself needs redefinition, as musical texts are different
in nature than alphabetic ones.56 Alphabetic texts may be understood by fully literate readers
without reference to sound, permitting silent reading and comprehension.57 Musical texts
traditionally are viewed as scripts for performance, symbolic mediators between the eyes, ears,
and minds of composers and listeners, which are devoid of meaning in and of themselves outside
the context of sounded performance.58 Indeed, marks left behind in books about music indicate
that some readers understood the didactic functions of musical examples only through
performing them vocally or instrumentally.
There are, nonetheless, many heavily-used copies of these sources that contain no
annotations to their musical examples. The evidence of their particular uses indicates that their

Apel, “The Importance of Notation,” 117: “Considering the fact, for example, that our present system of notation
has served the purpose of Monteverdi as well as that of Bach, Beethoven and contemporary composers, how can one
expect it to be anything but an irrelevant expedient, a casual and superficial method?” Bent et al., “Notation,” §II.1
reduces musical notation to “an assemblage of ‘signs’…that forms an analogue with the system of musical sound.”
Boorman, “Early Music Printing,” 222 makes the most specific (and most often quoted) statement about the nature
of musical notation during the Renaissance: “The arrangement of printed volumes of polyphony in partbook format
means that titles were useless to anyone except a complete set of performers. The act of silently studying the music
from such books was, if not impossible, very tedious. Until the appearance of these volumes in score, one cannot say
that there was a reading public for musical printing but only a using public.” Newcomb, “Notions of Notation”
offers a useful critique of these approaches to the nature of musical notation around the year 1600.

221

readers did derive meaning from musical notation without recourse to sound. I take this as a
suggestion that it was possible to read and comprehend musical notation silently during the
Renaissance.59 This kind of non-performative musical literacy has a number of important
differences from the kinds of musical reading that scholars have considered previously. In this
section, I explore the nature of this difference between silent and performative musical literacies
by positing four contrasting functions that musical examples play in the context of silent reading.
These functions offer new ways for understanding the material and intellectual contexts in which
these examples appear and the kinds of meaning that readers could derive from them. I do not
understand these functions to be the only possible ones; the same musical example can be read in
different ways by different readers, and even by a single reader. The possible readings of a
musical example depend on the competencies and motivations of each reader,
Following the work of Adam Whittaker, I contend that the context of silent reading offers
a advantageous approach to the subject of musical exemplarity—the qualities of a musical work
that make it optimal for demonstrating something—that is firmly grounded in aesthetic reader
response, rather than artistic or poietic literary creation.60 That is, my interest here is the
dialectical relationship between the ways that authors constructed musical examples and the
ways that readers approached them. Furthermore, I seek to decenter the role of sound in
scholarly conceptions of musical literacy; in this respect, I proceed from the suggestion of Cristle

59

In the relevant secondary literature, this ability occasionally is referred to as “silent hearing.” I am not concerned
here with whether musical audiation was possible for readers, as this is a question more anthropological in
orientation than historical. Rather, I take as my subject the silent reading of musical examples, because I am
interested in the ways that readers approached musical notation without reference to sound in any form—assessing
and reckoning the size and appropriateness of interval successions, judging the well-formedness of musical lines and
combinations of them, and so forth.

60

For the artistic–aesthetic binary as it pertains to reading, see Iser, The Act of Reading. For exemplarity in general,
see Gelley, Unruly Examples. For musical exemplarity, see Judd, Reading Renaissance Music Theory. Nattiez,
Music and Discourse, 17 provides a useful conceptualization of poietic and aesthetic approaches:
(poietic process) Producer → Trace ← Receiver (aesthetic process).

222

Collins Judd that “there are times when notation serves a purely iconic function—we are meant
to see notation, but not hear it.”61 I also consider more broadly other kinds of meaning that
musical notation can adopt on the page and in the mind. The musical examples in Nicola
Vicentino’s L’antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica (1555), one of the most notationallycomplex books about music published during the sixteenth-century, provide fertile ground for
analyzing these issues.

Iconic function
In the context of silently-read Renaissance books about music, the iconic function is perhaps the
most fundamental aspect of a musical example. In this sense, a musical example served only as a
representative symbol or token of the concept being discussed. At the very least, a caption,
legend, or prose introduction to the example was all a reader needed to understand what the
example was supposed to represent. Its actual content was irrelevant; a reader could take it on
faith that what was in the example actually corresponded to the example’s stated purpose and to
its text’s larger theoretical agenda. In this reading, the very presence of a musical example served
as a good-faith gesture on the part of the author that their theoretical concepts were valid and
consistent—skepticism notwithstanding, of course.
Musical examples always retained a baseline iconic function, even after being performed
or read by a reader. Once the didactic purpose of an example—for example, demonstrating the
qualities of a particular mode or good and bad interval progressions—was comprehended, by
whatever means, that example no longer needed to be read again.62 Its purpose was understood,

61

Judd, Reading Renaissance Music Theory, 8 (emphasis in original).

62

Ibid. makes a similar point: “At other times, the notation serves as a generalized reminder of music as sounding
phenomenon.”

223

its inner complexities comprehended. The musical example then served only as a visual reminder
of the concepts it embodied. Of course, a reader could reread the example for pleasure or in case
of memory lapse. But in the context of a single, continuous reading of a text, once an example’s
exemplarity, its broader reason for existence, was deciphered, its function was reduced to the
iconic level, serving as a representative sign of its purpose.
The iconic function explains many puzzling musical examples in books about music.
Consider, for example, Nicola Vicentino’s eighteen-page, systematic presentation of every
possible scale in every possible key at the end of the fifth book of L’antica musica (fol. 134v–
143r). It seems unlikely that many readers took the time to read these pages in detail; more
likely, readers examined a few of the scales or skimmed a few pages, understood the example’s
broader purpose, and then skipped to the next section. In such a reading, the musical example, by
its very presence alone, endows the author with credibility and authority through its iconic
function.
This also explains musical examples that cannot be read directly or immediately from the
notation on the page. Consider, for example, Vicentino’s four-voice motet “Musica prisca
caput,” which is notated in L’antica musica over three pages, with the cantus, altus, and tenor
voices appearing on one opening (fol. 69v–70r), and the bass voice appearing after a page turn
(fol. 70v). It perhaps was possible for an advanced reader to make sense of the top three voices,
but the page turn required to access the fourth voice meant that the full four-voice texture could
not be apprehended visually. In fact, it was impossible even to perform the motet from in this
physical manifestation; to do so would require a second copy of the book or transcription into
another source. As I will show, such notational conundrums support other functional
interpretations. But it is true that only needed to read the motet’s introductory phrase (“now the

224

abovementioned example of the differences between the three kinds of music is notated
presently”) to understand what the example was meant to illustrate without comprehending its
musical content.63
From a modern perspective, the use of illustrative material merely as a visual token of an
explanandum seems strange. Elizabeth L. Eisenstein has shown that this was common in
Renaissance books; many authors and printers used and reused illustrative materials simply to
denote a particular topic rather than to embody the topic being discussed.64 For example, the
Liber chronicarum (1493) uses the same stereotyped image of the walled medieval village to
represent both Mantua and Verona.65 The images are not meant to represent or to illustrate these
towns specifically, merely to direct readers’ attentions generally to discussions of geography.
The images are iconic rather than illustrative. The iconic function allows musical examples to
operate in a capacity beyond their discursive and didactic purposes—completely aside from their
content, they signify credibility and topicality for both author and reader.

Copy-text function
Musical examples also represent intermediate stages in a process of handwritten transmission. In
other words, the notation on the page was a sort of visual code that needed to be decoded
visually or translated before it could be comprehended through silent reading. Although some
readers certainly had the ability to comprehend polyphony presented in separate parts, clearly
this was not the most pedagogically-effective method for understanding the inner workings of

counterpoint. Scores, short scores, ten-line staves, and the like were better suited to theoretical
instruction, yet were difficult and expensive to produce.66 I suggest that authors and printers
employed various kinds of notation in separate parts—notational formats that in some ways
obscure musical content and meaning—with the understanding that less advanced readers would
not attempt to read them without first copying them into an easier-to-read format.67 These
musical examples thus function not as texts-proper, but as copy-texts, the meanings of which
cannot be understood directly by reading, but which require translation into another textual form.
The extra labor involved in reading musical examples this way forces the reader to
engage actively with the text. In contrast to the iconic function—in which meaning is derived
without regard to content—the copy-text function requires initiative and perseverance to engage
with musical ideas; this is not to mention the need for an expensive writing medium, be it paper,
parchment, or an erasable tablet. The act of translating one notational format into another has the
effect of completing a lap through the communications circuit: a musical idea begins in the mind
of the author; the author translates this into one visual form (a manuscript); the printer encodes
the first form into another (the print); the reader decodes this into the original form (another
manuscript); and in the process the musical idea becomes engrafted onto the mind of the reader.
But this was a dangerous game of telephone, and printers’ errors proved a formidable challenge
to authors and readers. The increasing lengths of errata lists and prolific reader corrections in
books about music amply attest this problem. The extensive correspondence between music

Lowinsky, “On the Use of Scores”; and Lowinsky “Early Scores in Manuscript.”

67

Reese, Music in the Renaissance, 155 makes a similar point about the earliest publications of Ottaviano Petrucci:
“All three [Harmonice musices odhecaton A (1501), Canti B (1502), and Canti C (1504)] are in choir-book form,
like most of Petrucci’s later prints of secular part-music. His aim was evidently to offer ‘raw material,’ from which
copies for specific performance requirements could be derived. He printed sacred music in part-book form, however,
for direct practical use.”

226

theorists Giovanni Spataro, Giovanni Del Lago, and Pietro Aaron—rife with complaints about
printers further confirm this basic problem of transmitting music through layers of mediation.68
The copy-text function of such musical examples forces readers into what has been called
“intensive reading,” the act of studying single texts with focus on complete mastery and
absorption.69 The copy-text function easily facilitated the contemplation and internalization so
desired by authors. Readers’ marks of confusion and frustration also demonstrate that this turned
off more than a few readers. Those readers who paid attention and did the work were rewarded
with a kind of ownership not typically associated with so cheap a medium as print. Obscure
notational formats not only intermediated authors’ manuscripts and readers’ handwritten notes,
but also mitigated against the immediacy of printed knowledge. Many music treatises highlight
the difficulty of their subject matter; Vicentino’s, for example, opens with a large woodcut
illustration of the author, which promotes the image of the “secret and uncertain knowledge”
exposed by the book.70 As the Venetian scribe Filippo de Strata put it, “The pen is a virgin,
printing a whore.”71 By slowing down the reading process, the copy-text function drew readers
more intimately into an author’s line of reasoning and method of presentation.
The copy-text function explains some of the more bizarre notational choices in
Renaissance music-theory texts. Examples that require page turns to see all the parts present no
problems from this perspective; they need not be used directly for comprehension. Vicentino’s
examples of acceptable uses of the imperfect fifth (the tritone) provides an instructive case in

point (figure 4.12). Vicentino gives ten melodic fragments, each lasting three semibreves and
labeled with a voice type (alto, tenor, or bass). The legends “à due voci,” “à tre voci,” and “à
quattro” indicate how the examples are delimited and constructed by combinations of these
fragments. The two-voice examples are easiest to discern (figure 4.13a). The corresponding
legend appears nearest the first five fragments; solutions may be created from any combination
of successive fragments (i.e., 1+2, 2+3, 3+4, or 4+5). There are three solutions for three voices
(figure 4.13b). The first three-voice legend indicates one solution (fragments 5+6+10); the
second such legend indicates two further solutions (fragments 7+8+9 and 8+9+10). The fourvoice solution is problematic (figure 4.13c); from every possible four-part combination of these
fragments, a number of solutions emerge, none without a significant counterpoint error. The best
of these solutions, incidentally those that involve the fragments nearest the legend, create either
parallel octaves (fragments 6+8+9+10 and 5+6+9+10) or illegal simultaneities (fragments
7+8+9+10). In this situation, the notation in separate parts and the obscurity of the legends draw
readers in and forces them to grapple with theoretical issues and to make critical judgments—
even if an individual reader did not need to rewrite the solutions. An uncharitable interpretation
of this particular example is that Vicentino and his printer, Antonio Barrè, sloppily planned and
executed the example. But such an interpretation fails to recognize that the examples engaged
readers in ways that more straightforward and better notated examples do not. The algorithmic
process of trial-and-error invited readers into the author’s mindset and rationale.
In the iconic and copy-text functions, what appears on the page is not meant to be
comprehended directly. Examples with an iconic function serve as a visual token of a topic rather
than an illustration of its substance; examples with a copy-text function serve as an intermediary

source, the meaning of which readers derive only through the act of rewriting. The following two
functions provide opposing perspectives, functions in which musical examples assume meanings
through reading and comprehending notation from their immediate textual forms.

Textual function
On the basis of the marks left behind in books about music, I believe that moderately advanced
readers easily could comprehend musical examples in a variety of notational formats featuring
separate parts.72 This runs counter to received musicological wisdom, which holds that
comprehending music from parts was prohibitively difficult for most musicians, much less lay

72

Choirbook format—in which each part occupies a separate space on a single two-page opening in one book—is
the classic example of notation in separate parts; this is the format of choice in Glarean, Dodecachordon (1547).
There is no standard terminology for other kinds of formats in separate parts. Owens, Composers at Work, 35
designates as “compact choirbook” when the parts are printed consecutively on a single page or gathering but not in
the typical choirbook ordering; and “quasi-score” when each part occupies “a single staff and all are superimposed
without barlines or vertical alignment.”

230

readers.73 My point of departure is the conception of what constitutes a literate reading of
musical notation. It seems clear from evidence adduced by scholars that very few musicians
could audiate polyphony from separate parts; that is, that musicians could mentally envision the
sound of a polyphonic composition without recourse to sound. A familiar if apocryphal story
from the German humanist Johann Manlius, based on the accounts of Philip Melanchthon,
relates Josquin des Prez’s process of proofreading his compositions:
Whenever he had composed a new song, he gave it to the singers to be sung, and
meanwhile he walked around, listening attentively whether the concordant sound
came together well. If he was dissatisfied, he stepped in: “Be silent,” he said, “I
will change it!” Not one of us had this ability, but we likewise sing together other
previously-composed songs, listening for good or bad harmonies.74
Jessie Ann Owens relates similar stories of Adrian Willaert and Giovanthomaso Cimello
evaluating compositions not by reading parts, but by listening to performances.75 These
anecdotes indicate that if the best composers could not imagine the combined sonic effect by
looking at separate parts, then very few indeed could.
But audiation sets the bar too high for an understanding of music literacy in general, and
what it meant to read polyphony silently in particular. I have already described particular
strategies that readers used to parse polyphonic musical examples into manageable bits of

Owens, Composers at Work, 48: “The ubiquitousness of this format [separate parts] suggests that reading in parts
must have been a common skill. Although some scholars have doubted the ability of sixteenth-century musicians to
read in parts, there is strong evidence…that they could.” Nonetheless, ibid., 55 avers: “In suggesting greater facility
for reading or reading/memorizing in parts than has generally been assumed, I do not wish to make the process seem
anything but cumbersome. Once a piece was notated in separate parts, it was difficult to catch mistakes without
having it sung or checking one voice against another. Perhaps as a result of these difficulties, during the second half
of the century musicians began to employ scores to help them study polyphonic music.”

information that could be combined mentally, such as solmization syllables, barring, and interval
notation. The mental image that likely resulted from these strategies is more analytic than
auditory in nature. Consider a hypothetical homorhythmic musical example presented in separate
parts. I believe, based on the annotative strategies outlined above, that sixteenth-century readers
fully and quickly could apprehend the intervallic content of each simultaneity in such an
example; whether they were able to audiate the sound of each simultaneity and the relationships
between them is immaterial. Merely to identify and recognize patterns and structures of intervals
in a musical example constitutes a valid, literate, and substantive reading of its content.
Oratio Tigrini concludes the second part of his counterpoint treatise Il compendio della
musica (1588) with this useful chapter:
Chapter 25: How to examine compositions and rid them of every kind of error.
Now that we understand the way that one must follow to compose in three, four,
or more voices, it remains only to see the method that one must follow to discover
for oneself every kind of error that was committed inadvertently during
composition, and to find the parallel fifths, parallel octaves, and other similar
mistakes made in it. Therefore, once the composition in four, five, six, or more
voices is finished, one takes the canto part and compares it note by note with all
the parts, that is, with the alto, with the fifth part, with the tenor, with any other
parts, and with the bass. Afterward, one takes the alto part and compares it
similarly with the tenor, with any other parts, with the fifth part, and with the bass
in the same way that one followed with the soprano. And the same is done, note
by note, for the tenor, for any other parts, and for the bass. Thus are found all the
errors that were committed inadvertently in it, which one may then easily purge
and cut out by observing the abovementioned rules.76

“Modo di rivedere le Compositioni, & emendarle da ogni sorte di errori. Cap. XXV. Hora che s’è inteso il modo,
che s’ha da tenere volendosi comporre à tre, à quattro, & a più voci; resta solo, che si vegga l’ordine, che s’ha da
tenere volendo ciascuno da se stesso ritrovare ogni sorte d’errore, che per inavertenza fossero stati commessi nella
Compositione, & vedere se in essa fussero due Quinte, due Ottave, & altri simili falli. Però, dopò che si serà fatta la
Compositione à quattro, à cinque, à sei, & à più voci, si piglierà la parte del Canto, & à Nota per Nota si raffronterà
con tutte le parti, cioè, con l’Alto, con la Quinta parte, co’l Tenore, con uno, ò più, che seranno, & co’l Basso. Di poi
si pigliera quella dell’Alto, & si raffronterà similmente co’l Tenor, con uno, ò più che saranno, & con la Quinta
parte, & co’l Basso nel medesimo modo, che si serà fatto quella del Soprano. Et il medesimo si farà del Tenore con
gli altri Tenori, & col Basso à Nota per Nota: & così si ritroveranno tutti gli errori, che per inavertenza in essa
fussero stati commessi, da i quali si potrà poi commodamenta purgarla, & ridurla secondo l’osseruanza delle
sopradette Regole.” Tigrini, Compendio (1588), 51–52.

232

Tigrini’s methodical process suggests one way that sixteenth-century readers silently might have
read polyphony by themselves (“da se stesso”). Parsing the texture into pairs of voices lessened
the burden of tracking multiple parts simultaneously; a permutative understanding of all the
contrapuntal combinations within the full polyphonic texture compensated for any diminished
understanding of its sound—in much the same way that Vicentino’s reader internalized the rules
of permissible imperfect fifths through the process of trial-and-error to find viable examples.
The textual function of musical examples reminds us how the process of reading and the
end-product of understanding are linked inextricably. Current scholarly notions of musical
literacy during the Renaissance are bound up in the artistic process of composition; the subject is
raised typically to shed light on the means by which composers wrote music. As a result, the
concept of musical literacy has acquired a prescriptive, poietic valence that ill serves the
aesthetic process of reading (not creating) musical notation. That is, the scholarly preoccupation
with reading as a conceptual inroad to understanding compositional process has created a onesided picture of musical literacy. By taking seriously the reading of musical examples as textsproper, musical literacy takes on a descriptive valence that offers a complementary perspective,
that of readers approaching preexisting musical works. This entails a shift in approach, a change
in question from asking how to compose, to asking how something was composed. As Howard
Mayer Brown has noted, it was never the goal of most books about music to offer
comprehensive, thoroughgoing instruction in the art of composition.77 Vicentino puts it
succinctly:
By working thusly, a composer will learn a thousand other beautiful devices
[fantasie], because one will lead him to another. One also must note that it is
impossible to teach everything that is needed in compositions, for the

77

Brown, “Emulation, Competition, and Homage,” 9–12: “No treatises on ‘free composition,’ no books that tell the
budding composer precisely how to go about his craft were written so early as the first half of the sixteenth century.”

233

happenstances of composing teach certain things that the student has not
considered, nor considers.78
Anna Maria Busse Berger has shown that memory was crucial to musical thought in
general during the Middle Ages; I argue here that it was crucial as well to the processual aspects
of reading Renaissance polyphony.79 Tigrini’s method for examining compositions required the
reader to assemble the larger texture in the mind one pair of voices at a time. Error correction
would be impossible without a mental assembly of the piece, because changing one voice
affected its relationship to the others. This mental assembly did not need to resemble a score in a
modern sense, an image of the parts marching along in aligned, parallel rows. Rather, it gave the
reader a sense of the work’s global architecture, a scaffolding that allowed the reader to navigate
each part anew while trying out local corrections. For readers of musical examples, such a
mental recollection emphasized not exclusively harmonic content, but also melodic relatedness
of parts—shared melodic content and patterns, points of imitation, cadences, sectional
organization, and so forth. Establishing points of comparison or moments of musical likeness
lessens the burden of retaining every musical detail in the mind, while building up an image of
how the work unfolds.
This point is confirmed by physiological studies of reading musical notation. In a seminal
study, nineteenth-century ophthalmologist Émile Javal showed that humans read by alternating

78

My translation. “e cosi il Compositore operando imparerà mille altre belle fantasie, perche si caverà una da l’altra;
e si dè avvertire che non si può insegnare il tutto che occorre nel compositioni, perche gl’accidenti nel comporre
insegnano certe cose, che lo Studente non ha pensato, ne pensa.” Vicentino, L’antica musica (1555), fol. 86v.
Vicentino, Ancient Music (1996), 273: “An experienced composer will learn a thousand other clever devices because
one will lead him to another. He will also understand that it is impossible to teach everything that occurs in
composition, for the act of composing teaches things that a student cannot imagine.”

fixations on stimuli with saccades (quick jerking motions of the eyes between fixations).80
Subsequent studies have shown that musically-literate readers subconsciously coordinate
fixations and saccades in a way that maximizes the capacity of the sensory buffer (the extremely
short-term memory that allows the brain to process stimuli).81 In this sense, literacy means not
only the fluent ability to read pitches and rhythms, but also a competent understanding of
musical style and syntax. Thus a musically-literate, stylistically-competent reader fixates on one
entire syntactic or formal unit of music at a time (a phrase, figure, pattern, mensural unit, etc.),
stores it in the sensory buffer, begins to comprehend or execute it, and then fixates on the next
musical unit. In contrast, the musically-literate but stylistically-incompetent reader fixates more
frequently on smaller pieces of information, using only part of the sensory buffer, and
contributing to a less cohesive, literally myopic grasp of the music. (By way of analogy, consider
this reading of the previous phrase using un-syntactic fixations: “andcon · tributi · ngtoale ·
sscohes · ivelite · rallymy · opicgra · spofthe · music.”)
Both readers’ approaches to musical examples and accounts such as Tigrini’s that
describe how to read polyphonic compositions taught in effect stylistic competency alongside
musical literacy. Barring taught readers to fixate on discrete chunks of musical notation in equal
duration, despite unequal visual lengths. Solmization taught readers to comprehend individual
lines abstractly.82 Interval notation taught readers to internalize combinations of lines. Reading

“Pioneers of Eye Movement Research.”

Movement, Memory and Tempo.”
82

At least in books about music, solmization was taught in the context of short introductions to the hexachords,
which emphasized the placement of semitones within melodic interval sequences. Although solmization could
suggest to readers a performed, exteriorized mode of reading, it equally suggested a conception of line abstracted
into theoretical terms.

235

methods such as Tigrini’s established iterative routines of physiological and cognitive work.
These factors communicated stylistic competency while reading polyphonic music by
coordinating the physical motions of the eyes. For silent readers, those not performing but
studying the music, all of this created in the mind a holographic image of the polyphonic musical
example, a conception full of rich, granular detail about the musical surface, but one that was
impossible to grasp entirely at once. Although this mental image likely had some sonic elements
attached to it, audiation was neither the exclusive goal, nor was it a prerequisite for a literate
reading of polyphonic music.
Reading music from parts for the purpose of study seems to have been a skill that
required practice, especially given that some writers on music attempted to teach this valuable
skill. The complexity of Vicentino’s examples compelled him to write out instructions on how to
read them; for example, Vicentino provides “a brief and easy guide for learning to read all kinds
of notes in every clef.”83 In his treatise, many polyphonic examples are homorhythmic, making
them considerably easier to understand. Similarly, clusters of shorter examples reuse and
recombine material flexibly; both individual musical examples and groups of them are composed
to facilitate silent comprehension. Implicit in their manners of composition and presentation are
concessions and clues to readers that suggest ways of breaking down mental labor into easier
tasks. Not the least of these is the use of barring in short musical examples, a practice common in
a wide range of counterpoint treatises. Barring suggested to readers a way of making sense of
longer musical examples—as we have seen, a suggestion they picked up on in their annotations.

di note in ogni chiaue.” Vicentino, L’antica musica (1555), fol. 133v. Other examples at Vicentino, Ancient Music

236

Vicentino himself presents a similar method for detecting contrapuntal errors, perhaps Tigrini’s
source of inspiration. In it, Vicentino endorses the use of bar lines as method of studying music:
When the pupil wishes to check a composition for six, seven, eight, or more
voices, it does no discredit even to a well-experienced person to bar [partire] the
composition by breves and longs. Checking a composition in this way constitutes
a reliable method of correcting mistakes.84
Simply because convention dictated that mensural notation be unbarred did not mean that adding
bar lines or rewriting the parts in score compromised the reading process, nor did they diminish
the quality of comprehension derived therefrom. Barring and scoring were not cheating.
Likewise, the process of checking polyphonic parts in pairs did not form a mental conception of
the work that was inferior to or less complete than an audiated one. The textual function of a
musical example admitted numerous kinds of silent reading that engage substantively with the
didactic purposes of musical examples and the larger discursive contexts in which they appeared.

Digestive function
The musical examples in books about music form a kind of musical compendium that may be
understood without reading the surrounding prose. This is the opposite of the iconic function, in
which the prose could be understood without reading the intervening musical examples. In the
copy-text and textual functions, readers approach musical examples from the context of intensive
reading, dwelling on, and internalizing individual examples in an effort to relate them to the
larger prose narratives. I propose that that musical contents in books about music also may be
considered as compendia to be perused by their readers, largely ignoring the prose text. In this

84

Vicentino, Ancient Music (1996), 299 (adapted). “& quando il Discepolo vorrà incontrare una compositione fatta à
sei, à sette, à otto, & à più voci, non sarà mal nissuno, ad ogni gran prattico, partire la compositione à brevi, à
lunghe, & terrà il modo sopradetto, da rincontrare detta compositione: che sarà sicuro modo di correggere i falli.”
Vicentino, L’antica musica (1555), fol. 88r (some copies wrongly fol. 88r; i.e., sig. Q4r). The word “partire” also
may connote rewriting a composition into score format.

237

interpretation, readers enact on treatises a kind of extensive reading, skimming its pages and
gathering and collecting bits from different examples. The musical examples in a treatise thus
stand as a synecdoche for the treatise itself, a digest or abridgement of it. Cristle Collins Judd
makes a similar observation about Glarean’s prolific musical examples: “For many readers, for
whom Glarean’s Latin might be difficult, if not prohibitive, his instantiations of the modes with
notated polyphony provides the means for understanding the text.”85 Put more strongly, one who
read only the musical examples in Glarean’s treatise came away with a fairly accurate
representation of the content of the prose.
Reading musical examples in this way provides a synoptic interpretation of a treatise that
may reinforce or run counter to an author’s claims about his book. Title pages were notoriously
unreliable for their inflated rhetoric of originality.86 In the case of Vicentino’s treatise, a
digestive, extensive reading of the musical examples bears witness to the book’s claim to contain
“molti segreti musicali” (sig. A1r). In contrast, the ubiquity of the musical examples in Zarlino’s
Istitutioni harmoniche casts doubt on the book’s claim to discuss “many passages by poets,
historians, and philosophers.”87 Within books about music, musical examples serve as an index
of an author’s priorities. At least from a reader’s perspective, a heavily or systemically illustrated
concept appears to receive authorial priority. The illustrations in Zarlino’s Istitutioni make clear
that he was at heart a practical musician, despite his humanistic and speculative aspirations. This
was further confirmed in the 1573 revision of his treatise, which featured new and extended
musical examples.

Several Renaissance books about music catered to this predilection for abridgement and
curation. An example comes from the two revisions of Glarean’s Dodecachordon, the Musicae
epitome, sive compendium ex Glareani Dodecachordo (1557) and the Uss Glareani Musick ein
Usszug (1557), edited by Glarean and his stepson Johannes Litavicus Wonnegger. Inga Mai
Groote has shown that these books functioned as “more popular digests of the
Dodekachordon.”88 Aside from their brevity, the most significant departures from the larger
volume are language, content, and format. The Usszug is in German and the Epitome retains the
Latin language; both simplify the tone and content of the original. Both treatises reduce the folio
size of the original to the much smaller octavo format—letters from Glarean indicate that he
hoped the work would spread his ideas into schools, monasteries, and convents; surviving
annotations in them indicate they were indeed used in the classroom.89 As was befitting the
instructional context, a significant number of polyphonic examples were omitted, focusing
instead on plainchant, and introducing a handful of singing exercises. The net effect was to
highlight the illustrative material and musical examples as the center of focus.
The later sixteenth century saw the proliferation of compendia, printed commonplace
books, and popularizing works on serious topics.90 Books about music were no exception to this
trend, Tigrini’s Compendio being a notable example. The text presents a compendium of musical
examples that illustrate the range contrapuntal topics and issues—one truly could read only the
examples to follow the points laid out in the prose. Tigrini’s marginal citations to the works of
contemporary music theorists indicate that the book itself was a product of extensive reading, a

239

result of Tigrini’s skimming through the books he read—or even his notes on them—to find
relevant excerpts and examples from different sources. At the same time, the book’s
compartmentalized approach to musical instruction promotes a detached, distant reading of the
text. Shoulder notes and plentiful captions for the musical examples could have allowed readers
to follow the sequence of topics easily without engaging the text deeply.
An important byproduct of the digestive function was that many books about music could
have assumed the role of a reference work, musical thesaurus, or memory aid. At a certain level,
books about music like Tigrini’s and Vicentino’s aimed to do the heavy lifting for readers by
listing every theoretical possibility exhaustively, or by laying out an entire subject schematically.
Also belonging to this category is Giovanni Maria Artusi’s L’arte del contraponto ridotta in
tavole (part one, 1586; part two, 1589), which consists of a series of diagrams “that contain
briefly the necessary precepts of this art.”91 It is significant that the works by Tigrini and Artusi
are pitched explicitly as digests of another important work, Zarlino’s Istitutioni harmoniche. The
change in literary style from treatise (Zarlino) to compendium (Tigrini) and tabular diagram
(Artusi) is accompanied by a reduction in size from folio (Zarlino and Artusi) to quarto (Tigrini).
Both books by Artusi and Tigrini translate Zarlino’s ideas into a different literary context for
different readers. Nor is it coincidental that both works emerged from the printing houses of
Vincenti and Amadino, who were associated with Zarlino’s publisher of choice, Francesco de’
Franceschi Senese (see chapter three). I propose that such works eliminated the need to labor
after knowledge, making the complicated subject of music more approachable. In so doing, these

240

works perpetuate extensive modes of reading and engagement—as reference works, they were
less likely to be read closely or intensively, referred to only periodically.

Demonstration
These four functions of musical examples—iconic, copy-text, textual, and digestive—are not the
only possibilities. The key element of their application to individual instances of musical
notation is that of reader agency. In an important study on the history of reading, Roger Chartier
demonstrates that meaning ultimately results from a negotiation between the reader and the text’s
material form.92 These functions of musical examples may lead to blatantly contradictory
interpretations. This is fitting, as motivations for and competencies and styles of reading were
diverse, resulting in vastly different interpretations of the same text. Meaning may be derived
from alternatively reading or ignoring a musical example; meaning alternatively may or may not
be derived from the material or notational form of a musical example; musical examples may be
read alternatively closely or distantly, intensively for study or extensively for perusal; a
notational format may be alternatively a necessary evil or a contemplated choice.
As a demonstration of the benefits of this multivalent way of reading meaning in musical
examples, I close this section with an analysis of a single musical example in Vicentino’s
L’antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica from the perspective of each of the four functions.
The treatise’s third book pertaining to music practice presents an overview of the diatonic,
chromatic, and enharmonic genera, a subject thoroughly identified with Vicentino’s professional

92

Chartier, Forms and Meaning, 6–24. Iser, The Act of Reading, 35 makes a similar point about a text’s language:
“The text must…bring about a standpoint from which the reader will be able to view things that would never have
come into focus as long as how own habitual dispositions were determining his orientation, and what is more, this
standpoint must e able to accommodate all kinds of different readers.”

241

profile.93 One particular musical example, for four textless voices, demonstrates the diatonic
genus (figure 4.14, transcribed for convenience in figure 4.15). Like the motet “Musica prisca
caput,” the example is spread over two openings, with the soprano voice straddling a page turn.
This material constraint makes it impossible to perform or to audiate the full polyphonic texture
in this particular format. In terms of its iconic function, this presented no problem: the example
did not need to be read in order to derive meaning. The example, by its very presence, was a
proof that such a demonstration of the diatonic genus could be offered, a token of what Vicentino
claimed the genus represented. The musical example’s meaning derives from the chapter
headings and legends to each voice part: “demonstration of diatonic music composed in four
parts,” “example of a diatonic soprano part,” “example of a diatonic alto part,” “example of a
diatonic tenor part,” “example of a diatonic bass part.”94 An important theoretical lesson is
gleaned from this information alone—for Vicentino, the genus of a composition resulted from
the combined genera of its component voices.
The copy-text function is the most obvious approach to the example, given its material
form. Transcription was the only way one could visually apprehend the entire composition. The
kinds of meaning a reader derived through this process depended on the notational format of the
transcription and the reader’s method. A melodic, sectional understanding might have emerged
from transcribing the piece voice by voice into any arrangement of separate parts—for example,
two salient aspects to emerge are the various points of cadential preparation in the voices and the
melodic relatedness of the soprano and tenor. A more harmonic, local understanding might have
emerged from barring or scoring the parts. This would have allowed the reader to see the

“harshness” (“asprezza”) that Vicentino attributes to the example through its studious avoidance
of strong cadences.95 Through this method, the reader also might have noted the rhythmic and
textural variety; seldom do the voices move together rhythmically for more than two notes. One
example of homorhythm occurs between the lower three voices toward the end of the example
(figure 4.15, m. 22); this instance provides a perfect example of the evaded cadences that
characterize the entire piece. Scoring and barring were not the only methods for achieving this
kind of understanding; the reader employing separate parts could have transcribed each part
breve by breve (or some other metrical unit), rather than part by part.
The textual function provides a more specific understanding of the composition’s musical
style. Following a routine for reading pairs of voices, like those suggested by Tigrini and
Vicentino, might have allowed the reader to understand all of the contrapuntal combinations
within the four voices. Consider, for example, the opening phrase (figure 4.15, mm. 1–6). The
reader begins with the tenor and bass voices, seeing that both are ascending figures separated by

95

McKinney, “Point/Counterpoint” argues that Vicentino played up the harshness of his examples of the diatonic
genus. See also the discussion in chapter two.

246

a perfect fifth and a minim. Abstracting the two voices into a sequence of intervals or a kind of
canonic rule allows one to read the alto voice, while mentally filling in the tenor and bass voice
through recall. Likewise for the soprano voice. To be sure, comprehending the entire texture in
this manner, voice by voice and phrase by phrase, required practice and a good memory. I
believe this was possible for Renaissance readers because, inspired by the words of the theorists
themselves, I have practiced and experienced this intense, embodied mode of engagement for
myself. The result is a thorough mental image of a composition, a vivid, multidimensional
appreciation of the contrapuntal whole that contrasts with flat, two-dimensional, score-based
modes of comprehension.96
The digestive function of this musical example consists in comparing it to others in the
treatise. There exists a mutual, but separable relationship between the prose and musical
examples of a book. Just as the prose provides an explanation of Vicentino’s example of diatonic
music, the example provides an explanation of Vicentino’s theory of diatonic music. In the
iconic function, the prose takes priority, in the digestive function, the example takes priority.
Further clarification of what constituted diatonic music emerges not from the prose, but from
comparison with the other musical examples. It becomes clear that diatonicism results from the
absence of the chromatic or enharmonic alterations that pervade the rest of the examples.
Moreover, the general neglect of musical examples in the diatonic genus demonstrates that
Vicentino’s artistic priority was the promotion of the avant-garde enharmonic and chromatic
genera.

96

Smith, The Performance of 16th-Century Music, 4–19 meditates on score-based and part-based modes of
comprehension and performance.

247

The kinds of meaning derived from this single example are all valid readings of it; one is
no less literate than any of the others. I do not wish to privilege one functional reading of musical
notation over the others. My aim in this section has been to orient the subject of musical literacy
around aesthetic reader response, which emphasizes the diversity of reader motivations and
competencies, rather than artistic or poietic creation, which emphasizes the author’s intent. This
orientation offers a conceptual approach to musical literacy that offers a broader picture of what
musical notation could mean during the Renaissance. Musical notation was an underdetermined
medium, indicating that reader agency was a key factor in fixing meaning. As we come to
appreciate the rich diversity of Renaissance readers, we can understand that musical notation
assumed many more kinds of significance than has generally been assumed.

Conclusion
Printing technology allowed the diffusion of knowledge to an unprecedented extent. It opened up
the subject of music for the first time to new readers. We have seen that those who owned books
about music were very diverse, ranging from young boys to elderly scholars, and from interested
amateurs to professional musicians. Readers left behind in their books numerous kinds of marks;
some copies remain to this day unmarked, others are blackened with annotations. Readers
extracted many different kinds of musical knowledge through the page and through their marks.
On this basis, I have proposed a new, expanded conception of what it meant to read musical
notation.
I showed in the previous chapters that authors and printers collaborated to maximize the
potentials of their books; authors wrote in ways that catered to distinctive ways of approaching
printed books and printers positioned their texts within the market through typography and
marketing. In this chapter, I have argued that readers contributed to this ongoing process through
248

the marks in their books. This was the case particularly when authors themselves became
readers. The most successful books—those that survive in the greatest quantities, those that went
through the most editions during the Renaissance, and those that achieved the most prestige—
conformed in many complex ways to reader expectations. Readers thus emerged as a generative
force in shaping music discourse during the Renaissance. In the following chapter, I trace this
process more directly, showing how books about music witness an increasingly close
communication and interaction between authors, printers, and readers.

249

CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION

Throughout this dissertation, I have considered separately the ways that single parties—authors,
printers, and readers—shaped and were shaped by their books about music. I have considered
these parties as members of the communications circuit, a concept proposed by Robert Darnton
in order to emphasize the dynamic transmission of printed texts. In chapter one, I explored this
concept with respect to the general dissemination of printed books about music during the
Renaissance. In this brief concluding chapter, I begin by articulating the latent points of
connections among the authors, printers, and readers discussed in the previous chapters. These
connections establish the circularity of the transmission of printed books about music—that is,
the ways that such books furnished authors, printers, and readers with a medium for interaction. I
then turn to the broader ramifications of these interactions, considering their broader effects on
music discourse during the Renaissance and pointing to directions for further research on
Renaissance music and print culture.
Gioseffo Zarlino’s Le istitutioni harmoniche, considered intensively in the previous
chapters, provides a particularly rich example of one text’s transmission along the
communications circuit. I have argued that the material and textual transformation of the book
through three editions was designed to meet the needs of readers. These changes resulted from
collaboration between Zarlino and his printer and publisher, Francesco de’ Franceschi Senese. I
also examined the professional relationship between Franceschi and Zarlino, arguing that the pair
used a range of marketing strategies to sell books about music, by both Zarlino and other authors.

250

Finally, I examined how readers approached Zarlino’s books using a variety of strategies to
understand the complexities of his ideas; in appendix one, I consider briefly Zarlino’s own habits
as a reader.
Zarlino’s Istitutioni, considered from these perspectives, made several laps around the
communications circuit. The book’s changing bibliographical shape brought its author, printers,
and readers into greater communication. I suggest here that each of Zarlino’s numerous
publishing ventures made him increasingly conscious of the imperative to reach out to readers.
The book’s eventual success—that is, the immense esteem in which it was held during his
lifetime and its status as a landmark of Renaissance musical thought—stemmed not from its
encyclopedic scope or dazzling insights. Although these certainly played a role in shaping the
book’s reception, the book had to get into the hands of readers in the first place; the book’s
material evolution testifies to Zarlino’s and Franceschi’s attempts to make the book more readerfriendly and to position it properly within the marketplace. Evidence in surviving copies of the
second and third editions indicate that Zarlino and Franceschi partially accomplished these goals.
Numerous volumes in period bindings containing both the Istitutioni and Dimostrationi indicate
that their marketing strategies bore fruit. Reader marks show that the printed marginal notes and
two tavole helped readers to navigate the book.1 The theoretical specifics, however, challenged
readers’ abilities, as shown by Bottrigari’s need to copy out canons into score and numerous
readers’ need to make sense of Zarlino’s number theories. Zarlino’s Istitutioni thus shows that

1

For example, the Bolognese natural historian Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605) annotated the subject index of his
copy of Zarlino, Istitutioni (1589; I-Bu, shelfmark A.4.Q.1.25/1.1) in order to flag passages that caught his interest.
Likewise, an anonymous reader’s annotations in a copy Zarlino, Istitutioni (1573; US-Wcm, shelfmark ML171 .Z37
1571) are confined to the marginal keywords, which clearly shaped the anonymous reader’s progress through the
book.

251

the communications circuit was not necessarily a sequential pathway, but an unordered,
interconnected network of nodes through which texts could pass freely and often unexpectedly.
The other books that I have considered enrich this picture of the re-conception of
Renaissance books about music through their transmission. Oratio Tigrini’s Il compendio della
musica provides a striking example of how one author’s own reading habits shaped his writings;
the fruits of his own research are presented in ways that makes them easily accessible to other
readers. The contrast between Zarlino’s struggle to find an audience and the naturalness of
Tigrini’s readability is reflected textually and materially in the Compendio, a relatively short
volume in quarto format that emphasizes pragmatic concerns, provides copious musical
examples as models for imitation, and digests the contents of several dozen other books about
music for his readers.
Similarly, Heinrich Glarean worked tirelessly to intercede on behalf of the
Dodecachordon. The plethora of presentation copies full of handwritten corrections and
comments witness his efforts to persuade his readers to approach his book with a gracious frame
of mind. They also provide detailed information about the challenges that books about music
presented to printers, particularly the need to find craftsmen equally competent in setting both
music and prose. Glarean’s redactions of the Dodecachordon, the Epitome and Usszug, brought
the larger book’s ideas to new readers, especially those with limited humanist credentials. This
intent is signaled both textually and materially—the employment of simplified Latin (Epitome)
and German (Usszug) compared to the high Latin of the Dodecachordon; the downgrade in
format from folio (Dodecachordon) to octavo (Epitome and Usszug); and an authorial emphasis
on illustration (Epitome and Usszug) over explication (Dodecachordon).

252

The works by Ghiselin Danckerts, Vicente Lusitano, and Nicola Vicentino witness a
similar attention to the needs and desires of readers. I showed that Danckerts revised his
manuscript so that it conformed to reader expectations about the appearance and language of
printed books about music. I argued that Lusitano’s extended and carefully-calculated marketing
scheme demonstrate a keen ability to discern what would attract readers to his books. I showed
how Vicentino’s L’antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica made explicit and repeated
reference to the demands of reading about music. These works coincided with attempts by
Roman printers to exploit interest in the subject of the ancient Greek music. Finally, Lusitano’s
and Vicentino’s books provided special insight into the roles that bibliographical format (i.e.,
folio, quarto, octavo, etc.) and notational format (layout of polyphony in score, separate parts,
choirbook format, etc.) played in helping or hindering readers to understand their books about
music.
My analyses of these books highlight the ways that printing technology allowed
individuals to act in new ways as producers and consumers of texts. This constellation of books
about music shows how for the first time individuals dynamically performed multiple roles in the
communications circuit. One of the more significant occupational twists to emerge in this
dissertation is the authorial agency of printers in conveying meaning and constraining readers
through typography. I proposed a typology of three basic book designs (scholastic, humanistic,
and dialogic) to indicate the ways that printers could shape a book’s content without altering its
text. Glarean’s manuscript comments in copies of the Dodecachordon also are especially
revealing: the author acted as a publisher by sending his own works to specific readers; his
comments show that he closely scrutinized the writing and printing of his own books as a reader.
Different actors exercised these roles in different ways. I showed how Zarlino revised editions of

253

the Istitutioni in order to shape readers’ perceptions of his broader oeuvre; given the close
relationship he maintained with his publisher Francesco de’ Franceschi Senese, he likely was on
hand to supervise its editing and printing. Glarean’s and Zarlino’s books reflect this difference in
their participation in the publication process. I propose, therefore, that the material condition of
Renaissance books about music results from the particular circumstances in which they were
produced. This is of course always true in a trivial sense. But on a deeper level, I hope to have
shown that books about music witness unusually intense interactions between their producers,
distributors, and consumers. These interactions furnish compelling evidence for the shaping of
music discourse during the Renaissance.
The specific effects of printing technology on music discourse were wide-reaching. The
most immediate effect was to make music discourse public for the first time. I have shown that
the producers and consumers of books about music reacted to this reality in idiosyncratic ways.
From the perspective of practical music theory, the essential challenge was to write about
music—a fleeting, ephemeral phenomenon—in ways that could be understood easily. Some
authors, such as Tigrini and Antonfrancesco Doni, attempted to make their books reader-friendly
and accessible by creatively forging literary, scholarly, and musical solutions to this challenge.
Other authors, such as Vicentino and Francisco Salinas, retreated to the ivory tower, writing
uncompromisingly about difficult aspects of the practice of musical art. Many authors, such as
Zarlino and Glarean trod a middle path, seeking simultaneously to break new ground and to
reach a wide audience. Printers, publishers, and editors helped to focus and filter these works for
wider consumption. Patrons sponsored the publication of works with a circumscribed audience,
as in the case of Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este and Vicentino’s L’antica musica; sometimes even

254

authors sponsored their own editions, as was probably the case with Glarean’s Dodecachordon.2
I argued that books about music, especially those published without the financial support of an
author or patron, served the commercial interests of the printer. Authors that sought to align their
works with their printers’ brands thus wrought an important and underexplored shift on discourse
about music; fleshing out the nature of this shift remains a promising area for further study.
Finally, readers provided feedback to authors and printers in the form of sales, in comments
added to their books, and in the publication of their responses and commentaries as new books.
The establishment of public discourse about music and the proliferation of books by past
and present writers contributed to another effect of printing technology: the formalization of
music theory as an area of study. The works of Franchinus Gaffurius provide an instructive
example. I suggest here that Gaffurius’s status as a central authority on music resulted from his
being the first author to publish exhaustive treatments of every topic of music at a time when
books about the subject were still a novelty to most readers. The initial success of his books,
especially the Practica musicae, laid the groundwork for a friendly posthumous reception; that
is, his books were widely dispersed geographically by the time they entered the secondhand
market. The significance of the lasting availability of his works emerges when compared to that
of other musical authorities. As Zarlino noted in a letter to Gian Vincenzo Pinelli, manuscript
copies of Guido of Arezzo’s Micrologus were hard to come by, despite being cited by many
writers of books about music. Put simply, then, Gaffurius’s works established and continued to
influence the intellectual framework of music discourse throughout the sixteenth century.
Subsequent Renaissance writers on music invoked and employed Gaffurius’s concepts,

2

In a letter dated 15 April 1545, sent to his friend and Swiss theologian Johannes Aal, Glarean reported that one
printer estimated a cost of 900 gold florins to execute the work properly. The letter is transcribed in Tatarinoff, Die
Briefe Glareans, 38. Several times in the Dodecachordon, Glarean concedes its heft and typographical complexity.

255

terminology, and musical examples—even when they disagreed with them.3 Leslie Blasius has
noted that that, during the Renaissance, new works by Pietro Aaron, Glarean, Vicentino, and
Zarlino worked alongside those of Gaffurius to help the field of music theory cohere into a set of
established areas of study and subtopics.4 I have shown that printing technology was a central
agent in this process by enabling the production, dissemination, and reception of these works on
a scale previously unseen.
The notion that printing technology contributed to the codification of knowledge during
the Renaissance is not a new argument. Nonetheless, it has not been noted previously that music
was among the first technical subjects to experience this effect of printing technology. Indeed,
this may have been because music theory was comparatively uncrowded as a subject area. In a
survey of the state of the field, Zarlino dismissed many previous writers as “commentators on
Boethius” (for the full context, see appendix one). This might be seen to refer to an unusual
situation in which Renaissance writers of books about music found themselves; prior to the
invention of printing technology, there were few standard, widely-read texts on the subject of
musical practice that were copied in scriptoria or part of curricula in schools or universities. I
argued that the formalization of music discourse during the Renaissance followed from the
challenges of writing and printing books about music. During the late fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries, writers were forced to grapple with the particular difficulties of writing
clearly about music. I have described several solutions to these problems, which included the
increasingly prevalent use of short musical examples as concrete instantiations of musical sound.

Blackburn, “On Compositional Process”; Corwin, “Le istitutioni harmoniche of Gioseffo Zarlino, Part 1,” 44–45;
and Judd, Reading Renaissance Music Theory, 163–65 provide examples of the impact of Gaffurius’s works on the
writings of Glarean and Zarlino.

256

I showed how reader-friendly and pedagogically-effective musical examples were technically
difficult to produce, regardless of their means of production. As early as the 1480s, authors and
printers of books about music collaborated to engineer acceptable solutions to these conceptual
and technical problems, reaching a high level of execution by 1500 with woodcuts. Moveable
musical type increased the efficiency and expanded the technical possibilities of what could be
illustrated. Given that books about music required specialized approaches to illustration, it is not
coincidental that several printers of Renaissance books about music also produced some of the
most notable illustrated works on other technical subjects. The following are among the
numerous examples:
•

The first edition of Nicolaus Copernicus’s De revolutionibus, printed in 1543 at
Nuremberg by Johann Petreius. Petreius also printed a number of books about music,
including Nicolaus Listenius’s Musica (1540) and Seybald Heyden’s De arte canendi
(1537).

•

The second edition of Nicolaus Copernicus’s De revolutionibus, printed in 1566 at Basel
by Heinrich Petri. Petri also printed Glarean’s Dodecachordon, Epitome, and Usszug.

•

Daniele Barbaro’s Italian translation of and commentary on Vitruvius’s De architectura,
printed with lavish woodcuts in 1556 at Venice by Francesco Marcolini. Marcolini also
printed Lusitano’s Introduttione (1558) and was the silent printer of Zarlino’s Istitutioni
(1558).

•

A series of woodcut broadsides depicting scenes from Amerigo Vespucci’s Mundus
novus, printed in 1505 at Augsburg by Johann Froschauer. Froschauer also printed
Michael Keinspeck’s Lilium musice plane (2 editions, 1498 and 1500).

257

Few other technical subjects faced such difficulties in printing illustrations, relying instead on
traditional methods of technical production (woodcuts and engravings) without confronting
deeply what needed to be illustrated, how it was to be illustrated, or why. Put another way, I am
suggesting that the challenges of crafting and preparing illustrations for books about music
compelled their authors and printers to reflect on what purposes such illustrations served. This
led in turn to a greater integration of illustrations with the surrounding prose and to more precise
analytic language for describing music. The host of music-theoretical controversies prosecuted in
print during the Renaissance—those between Lusitano, Danckerts, and Vicentino and between
Giovanni Maria Artusi and Claudio Monteverdi being prominent examples—witness the initial
development of vocabulary and methods for analyzing and critiquing musical compositions. The
ability to scrutinize compositions specifically and abstractly in writing greatly advanced with the
advent of printing technology thanks to the increasing production and geographical
dissemination of music discourse. The changing linguistic face of music discourse that I am
proposing is another promising area for further study.
The central method of this dissertation has been to trace the material evolution of books
about music along the communications circuit. This method also could be applied fruitfully to
the study of a related bibliographical category: books of music. In closing, I suggest a few
possible directions for such studies. I have traced several individual works through multiple
editions, showing how their material evolution reflected the particular circumstances of their
creation. My analyses hinged on the importance of readers and the end-uses of these works.
Taking multiple editions of individual books of music as a locus of study might reveal, for
instance, how the popularity of certain books related to their ability to appeal to diverse
audiences in different locations. Thomas W. Bridges’ widely-cited study of one such work,

258

Arcadelt’s first book of madrigals, focuses on its textual transformations through fifty-six
editions, grouped by place of publication.5 Using Bridges’ work as a point of departure, one
might explore instead how these editions reflect the changing circumstances of local markets for
printed music with regard to those who purchased books of music. Such a study might consider
more intensively, for example, the associations of bibliographical format (oblong versus upright
quarto as respective signifiers of practical intent versus musico-literary merit) or paratextual
devices (title page illustrations and phrasings, dedications, etc.). Bridges’ own conclusion (pp.
299–325) notes a number of further approaches, which are now rendered possible thanks to a
body of scholarship that addresses these issues, and thanks to better bibliographical control of the
corpus of printed music books and their ever-increasing searchability and digitization.
Additionally, I have addressed the relationship between books about music and other
kinds of books. For example, I considered books about music from the perspectives of their
printers’ catalogs and how selected authors constructed plans to publish books both of and about
music. Studies of music and print culture generally have taken a given printing firm’s musical
editions as the primary site of investigation. Very few firms during the Renaissance published
exclusively music; for example, although the catalogs of Ottaviano Petrucci and Antonio
Gardano were dominated overwhelmingly by music books, both firms did release a handful of
non-music books. Stanley Boorman has offered an excellent assessment of how Petrucci’s four
non-music books related to his departure from Venice and return to his hometown of
Fossombrone around 1510.6 At several points, I have indicated how various interests coincided
in the publication of certain books about music. Examining the non-music catalogs of larger

259

printing firms that also printed music might yield a more detailed and more interesting picture of
how music books related to those about other subjects. Daniel Heartz and Jane A. Bernstein have
provided magisterial accounts of music in the early-modern book trade at Paris and Venice.7 Yet
both scholars make only passing reference to the significant quantities of non-music books
printed by their subjects, Pierre Attaingnant and Girolamo Scotto. Further assessments of how
music fit into the broader interests of large printing firms, such as fleshed out in Tim Carter’s
studies of the circumscribed market at Florence, will yield a greater understanding of the social
and commercial functions of books of music.8
Further kinds of engagement with the wider book trade will allow Renaissance musicprinting to transcend its present ghettoization within the history of the book. A number of studies
of musical print culture have highlighted the alterity of books of music. For instance, Kate van
Orden has noted that books of music contain neither alphabetical nor discursive texts, but rather
musical and performative ones.9 Drawing on the work of Martha Feldman, she has noted further
that the composers and editors who compiled books of music seem at odds with book-historical
and literary notions of the author.10 From this perspective, books of music seem irreconcilably
and hopelessly removed from other kinds of books. In this dissertation, I have outlined several
solutions to this conundrum. I have proposed books about music as hybridizations of books of
music and other kinds of books. Writers of books about music were authors in a true sense of the
word—that is, they produced discursive texts alongside musical ones. Additionally, books about

music conformed more closely than books of music to expectations of what a book should look
like. A central contribution of this dissertation is to view the author’s words about music and
their manner of presentation as conceptual bridges between book-historical and music-historical
understandings of authorship. Furthermore, the extensive evidence of ownership and use
preserved in the pages of books about music suggests new models for understanding what it
meant to read during the Renaissance. In short, tracing Renaissance books about music along the
communications circuit offers rich points of connection between the theory and practice of music
and the world of printed books.

APPENDIX ONE: BOOKS IN THE
LIVES OF MUSIC THEORISTS

The works of seven authors are examined in different lights in the preceding chapters, which
analyze how authors, printers, and readers shaped the development of printed books about music
during the Renaissance. The present appendix considers each of these seven authors in turn,
providing a brief capsule biography and exploring the role of books and printing technology in
their lives. The intent is not to account exhaustively for these figures’ lives and works—tasks, for
the large part, already capably executed by other scholars. Rather, the aim is to provide essential
contexts for the discussions of the lives and works of these authors in the remainder of this
dissertation. Toward this end, each section of this appendix maintains three aims: (1) to describe
how these specific writers interacted with printing technology; (2) to indicate new discoveries or
clarifications about their lives and works; and (3) to delineate the connections among the
disparate discussions of their works in the preceding chapters.

Ghiselin Danckerts (c. 1510–1567)
Ghiselin Danckerts was born at Tholen in Zeeland, a western province in the Low Countries
(now the Netherlands).1 He began religious training and worked briefly as a cleric in the Diocese
of Liège.2 Two nephews, Petrus Adriano and Johannes Uberto, were both clerics active in Rome
at the time of his death. Danckerts claimed to have served Pierluigi Caraffa, a member of the

Danckerts’s life comes from his own testimony in his treatise (discussed below).

He is recorded as a “clericus leodiensis diocesis” at the time of his entrance to the Sistine Chapel; relevant archival

Neapolitan noble family: “I have seen various gestures made by many people in favor of the
diatonic genus; among others, by Signor Pierluigi Caraffa, the Neapolitan gentleman, called the
granmaestro Caraffa, who so delighted in music that he always kept salaried musicians in his
household up to his death, of which I was one.”3 The move to Naples was a sensible one, as both
the Low Countries and Naples were under the control of the Holy Roman Empire, then headed
by Charles V.
On 21 March 1538, he was admitted to the Sistine Chapel as a tenor. Vatican archives
indicate that Danckerts was involved deeply in the administration of the choir, serving often as
keeper of the roster and diary (punctator) and paymaster (abbas or camerlengo).4 His most
notable absences were brief sojourns to Naples in 1547 and 1548. In 1565, at the instigation of
Pius IV, cardinals Borromeo and Vitellozi thoroughly overhauled the papal choir.5 At the
conclusion of their investigation, Danckerts was forced into retirement, allegedly a result of his
infirmity, declining ability, and predilections for money and women.6 He remained on the payroll
until November 1567, presumably around the time of his death. That he died in or about 1567 is
suggested by a last will and testament and an inventory of his household effects, both dated 3
October 1567 and recently discovered by Arnaldo Morelli.7

Danckerts’s participation in the 1551 debate between Lusitano and Vicentino was a
defining moment in his career. The judges of the debate, Danckerts and the Spaniard Bartolome
de Escobedo, both had served over a decade as members of the Papal Chapel. The participants in
the debate regarded Danckerts and Escobedo as authoritative and impartial figures; the warrant
signed by Lusitano and Vicentino identifies them as “learned and expert in music.”8 In the wake
of the debate, Danckerts began to transcribe his records of the heated proceedings. (A synthetic
account of the debate based on the writings of Danckerts and Vicentino appears below.) As
Lusitano’s and Vicentino’s own writings appeared and as the subject became increasingly
fashionable in Roman circles (see chapter three), Danckerts expanded the notes to include his
own thoughts on the application of ancient Greek music theory to modern musical practice. Over
the course of a decade, he produced in total three manuscript copies of the document, now
preserved at I-Rv, shelfmark Ms. R56.
Although numerous scholars have cited and referred to this document, a general
description of its structure and contents is not readily available.9 The manuscripts at I-Rv survive
in a large volume of sixty-four manuscripts. The collection was assembled and bound together
during the seventeenth century in vellum-covered paper boards with two soft leather ties. The
face of the folio-sized volume measures 235 × 295 millimeters, although individual manuscripts
vary significantly in size, with codicological formats ranging from folio to duodecimo, including
those made from various half-sheets and quarter-sheets. (To give a further indication of the
volume’s heft, its spine measures 145 millimeters.) The volume is titled “Raccolta di varie

of this warrant.

scritture spettanti all’istoria, erudizione, costumi, et varia altre cose curiose” (“A Collection of
Various Writings Pertaining to History, Learning, Customs, and Various Other Curiosities”).
Topics of the manuscripts range from observations on the works of Aristotle (nos. 4–8), to dirty
Neapolitan jokes (no. 31), advice on escaping prison (no. 49), and an anecdote about a Bengalese
man who claimed in the year 1606 to be 380 years old (no. 28). The provenance of the collection
is unclear; the manuscripts that comprise the collection are in diverse hands and were prepared at
numerous points during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The compiler probably had a
more-than-passing interest in music, as there is also a single-leaf primer on adapting keyboard
works for the guitar (no. 57).
Within this collection are three manuscript drafts of Danckerts’s treatise (nos. 15a, 15b,
and 33). I follow Stefano Campagnolo in dating the initial composition of these drafts to 1551–
1552, 1552–1554, and 1554–1556, although all three were revised at different points after
1555.10 The codicological and topical structure of each draft is indicated in table A1.1. During
the nineteenth century, no. 15a was taken out of the larger collection, restored, bound
individually, and assigned a new shelfmark (Ms. R56b; the larger volume is retrospectively
labeled R56a). This probably was an effort to conserve the document, because it was larger than
the other manuscripts in the collection (the average leaf height is 340 millimeters, compared to a
maximum leaf height of 295 millimeters for the other items in the bound volume). Prior to this
point, the entire collection was foliated 1–854 in red ink, which has faded on some pages to pale
pink, at the upper, outer corners of each leaf. After this point, Ms. R56a was re-foliated 1–821
and Ms. R56b was re-foliated 1–33 with a mechanical stamp in black ink, at the bottom center

Danckerts’s are among the few surviving Renaissance manuscripts of music theory that
were working drafts. Music-theory manuscripts more familiar to music historians, such as those
containing the works of Johannes Tinctoris and Franchinus Gaffurius, were produced
professionally and record more-or-less completed texts.11 Manuscript letters by music theorists,
such as those by Girolamo Mei and Giovanni Spataro, did function as drafts, but witness far

Notes

The structure of this gathering is anomalous. It originally consisted of two bifolia. Early on, the fourth leaf was
separated from its conjugate (now ℓ. 382) and discarded. A sheet with solmization exercises was pasted formerly
onto fol. 384v. During conservation, this sheet was removed, foliated as ℓ. 383, and tipped in backward (hence the
sequence verso/recto). Also during conservation, fol. 382v was pasted onto fol. 384v at the spine fold.

Gatherings 2–4 appear at first glace to be a single gathering of 10 leaves. Stitching is nonetheless visible at the
spine folds of the following bifolia: ℓℓ. 385+386, 389+390, and 393+394. During conservation, these three
gatherings were pasted onto a set of interlocking supports, making them appear as a single gathering.

publication. Yet Lusitano’s changes to his manuscript are of a simpler, more linear nature than
Danckerts’s; the vast majority consist of entire sentences and paragraphs canceled by
strikethrough then neatly rewritten interlineally or marginally. In contrast, many pages of
Danckerts’s autograph copies of the treatise (I-Rv, Ms. R56, nos. 15a and 15b) are blackened by
copious corrections and revisions. Danckerts’s third draft (I-Rv, Ms. R56, no. 33) is a fair copy
produced by a professional scribe, but contains numerous corrections in Danckerts’s hand. I
show in chapter two that the work’s concept shifted throughout the entire period of composition.
Danckerts vacillated over whether to include certain sections, changing his mind several times
during the course of assembling even single drafts. His manuscripts thus provide an unparalleled
window into the mind of an author preparing his work for publication.
The inventory of Danckerts’s household effects paints a vivid picture of the role of
writing and books in his everyday life. The first item of the inventory is “a walnut study with all
its drawers, the which drawers were all full of various writings and little books, and also other
things of no importance, and among others one was full of various prints of music made from

268

metal type.”13 The inventory also mentions “a cabinet full of various books and sheets of music
and other things, ranging from small to large, and many old books and sheets of music, and two
shelves, namely one to hold books and the other to hold dirty, old rastrums.”14 These furnishings
provide a detailed picture of the author composing his various manuscripts. All in one place
Danckerts had the materials he needed to prepare a manuscript, namely a supply of paper and
various writing implements. Danckerts’s surviving manuscripts, including the one at I-Rv and
another one at I-Rsc (shelfmark G. Ms. 968, described in chapter two), witness the use of at least
three rastrums of various sizes and spacing. In the same space, Danckerts also had all his books,
which he consulted while writing. The manuscript copies of his treatise at I-Rv refer regularly to
printed books of and about music. Chapter three of part three, for example, gives Danckerts’s
“opinion concerning the errors committed by those who title their songs chromatic.”15 He cites
four books, giving their titles and full facts of publication, omitting only the names of their
composers:
They title [their works] chromatic, as one sees from the first book of chromatic
madrigals for four voices, printed at Venice by Girolamo Scotto in 1543, and
from the first book of chromatic madrigals for five voices, similarly printed at
Venice but by Antonio Gardano in 1544, and thus from the first book of
chromatic duos to sing and to play, one part composed above the others with the
resolution of the part, printed at Venice by the said Antonio Gardano in 1545, and
from the second book of chromatic duos by the same author, composed one part

ancho altre cose di poco importanza, et tra li altri uno era pieno di diverse stanpe [sic] di metallo da stampare in
musica.” Morelli, “Una nuova fonte,” 88. What exactly is meant by “stanpe” is unclear; it may refer to sorts of
musical type or perhaps even stamps of musical notation, which would be of particular interest to musicologists. I
follow Morelli in identifying “stanpe…in musica” as “prints of music.”

di musica, et dui stucci, cioè una da tenere libri et l’altro da tenere pettini vecchi brute.” Morelli, “Una nuova fonte,”
105. Ibid., 88n argues that the “pettini” are various rastrums for drawing staff lines.

above the other printed at Venice by Girolamo Scotto in 1549, leaving aside
others for the sake of brevity.16
Throughout his treatise, Danckerts also invokes the authority of Pietro Aaron, Franchinus
Gaffurius, and Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples. He cites the errors in Vicentino’s L’antica musica
with bibliographical precision: “Here follows the chapter on the foresaid musical debate, printed
in the foresaid musical book by the said Don Nicola, on folio 95 with the changes and additions
to the words that are not in the originals, as was said above.”17 This evidence suggests that
Danckerts, like Vicentino, might have recognized that print was an ideal medium for
adjudicating disagreements.
The scope of Danckerts’s publishing agenda was ambitious. His manuscripts at I-Rv and
I-Rsc present comprehensive accounts of the theory and practice of modern music; in chapter
two, I show that, despite never making it to the press, Danckerts prepared both for publication.
Even before the debate and before he entered papal service, while at Naples, Danckerts made
formidable plans to publish several collections of music. On 22 March 1537, he obtained from
Pope Paul III a privilege to protect a large variety of sacred and secular works for voices and
instruments: “various works of figural song, such as masses, motets, hymns, psalms, orations,

16

“Intitolandole per Chromatice, come pare per il libro primo de i Madrigali Chromatici a quattro voci: stampati in
Venetia da Hieronimo Scotto nel 1543. & per il libro primo de Madrigali Chromatici a cinque voci stampato
similmente in Venetia: ma dà Antonio gardane nel 1544. et cosi per il primo libro di duo cromatici, da cantar et
sonare composti una parte sopra l’altra con la sua resolutione da parte stampato Venetis apud detto Antonium
gardane 1545. et per il 2º libro di duo cromatici dal medesimo autor Composti una parte sopra l’altra stampato
Venetis apud Hieroni Scottum 1549. et altri, lasciati qui per abbreviarla.” Ibid. (cancellations and marginal additions
incorporated silently). It is possible to identify all but the first of these, which are as follows: Cipriano de Rore, Il
primo libro de madregali cromatici a cinque voci (1544 = RISM R2480); Agostino Licino, Primo libro di duo
cromatici (1544 = RISM L2342); and Agostino Licino, Il secondo libro di duo cromatici (1546 = RISM L2344).
Danckerts seems to err in attributing the last publication to Scotto in 1549 (it is Gardano in 1546), although this and
the first book listed may be ghost editions.

lamentations, songs [cantiones], dialogues, and others of this kind, and also intabulations of their
parts for the lute, viol, keyboard [cimbali], organ, and other similar musical instruments.”18
Scholars have doubted that Danckerts ever composed this much music, although Morelli
indicates that the papal breve specifies that the music was written by Danckerts and others.19
Donna Cardamone hypothesizes that Danckerts was involved in the publication of two prints of
Neapolitan compositions around 1537: the Canzoni villanesche alla napolitana (RISM 15374);
and Madrigali a tre et arie napolitane (RISM [c. 1537]8).20 Danckerts’s papal privilege indicates
that he may have acted more broadly as a publisher, selecting and sponsoring the publication of
many other works by numerous composers. His possible activities in this capacity deserve
further study.

Franchinus Gaffurius (1451–1522)
During the early years of the sixteenth century, the Italian writer Pantaleo Meleguli penned an
extensive biographical sketch of Gaffurius.21 The sketch was printed at the conclusion of
Gaffurius’s treatise on ancient Greek music, titled De harmonia musicorum instrumentorum opus
(1518).22 Its accuracy—or at least its adherence to Gaffurius’s preferred self-fashioning—is

verified by its presence in several earlier manuscripts prepared under the supervision of
Gaffurius.23 Like many of his contemporaries, Gaffurius lived a peripatetic early life, traveling
from town to town throughout the Italian peninsula. He was born on 14 January 1451 at Lodi in
the northern Italian province of Lombardy. His father, called Betino, was a soldier from
Bergamo working in the service of the Ludovico Gonzaga at Mantua. After being ordained a
priest at Lodi in 1474, Franchinus’s travels took him to Bergamo, Cremona, Genoa, Mantua,
Naples, and Verona, along the way working diligently and establishing a network of far-flung
correspondents. Two such correspondents were Johannes Tinctoris, one of the most significant
fifteenth-century music theorists, and Gaspar van Weerbeke, a singer in the Sforza chapel at
Milan.
In 1484, he was appointed maestro di cappella at the Duomo at Milan, a post he held for
the remainder of his life. Clement A. Miller’s translation of Meleguli’s sketch says that
Gaffurius’s appointment coincided with the rise of his friend Romanus Barnus, a theologian from
Lodi, to the position of Archbishop of Milan.24 This confuses the facts. In 1484, Cardinal
Giovanni Arcimboldo became the archbishop; he was also the dedicatee of Gaffurius’s first
publication, the Theoricum opus musice disciplinum (1480). The precise identity of Barnus
remains obscure; Meleguli states, as Burney notes, that Barnus was an advisor of Arcimboldo
(“ubi Archiepiscopi vices”) who might have taken over unofficially during the archbishop’s
frequent absences.25 Moreover, Gaffurius was friends with a distinguished predecessor at the

Gaffurius, De harmonia (1977), 213: “Finally the Lodi canon, Romanus Barnus, theologian and jurisprudent,
succeeded as archbishop of Milan with the greatest authority. Through his own love of music and the fame of
Gaffurius, he brought the latter to him.”

Duomo, Josquin des Prez.26 In any event, it seems likely that Gaffurius’s appointment as maestro
di cappella at the Duomo resulted from personal connections. In this capacity, Gaffurius
composed and wrote about music, and taught schoolboys to sing.27 The post was significant
because the Duchy of Milan was a hub of Italian cultural activity, regularly hosting monarchs,
clerics, and diplomats from across Europe.
At this time, the Duchy of Milan was controlled by the House of Sforza, and Gaffurius
quickly ingratiated himself into their good graces. In 1497, he became a professor at the
university in Milan founded by Ludovico Sforza (1452–1508); this perhaps was a concession for
Ludovico denying Gaffurius’s request for a benefice two years earlier. Still, Gaffurius was not
above following the tides of public favor. In 1499, Louis XII of France (1462–1515) seized the
Duchy of Milan. In subsequent publications, Gaffurius fashioned himself as the “regius musicus”
(“royal musician”), despite having no connection whatsoever to the royal court in Paris, and
despite the natural antipathy between Ludovico and Louis.28
Gaffurius maintained diverse intellectual interests. He claimed to have instigated the
scholar Giovanni Francesco Burana to translate a number of classical Greek works in Latin,
which formed the basis for most musicians’ knowledge of ancient music: Aristides Quintilianus,
De musica (c. 300); Bacchius Geron (called the Elder), Introductio artis musicae (c. 300);
Manuel Bryennius, Harmonica (c. 1300); and Claudius Ptolemy, Harmonica (c. 150).29 Clement

For a selective study of Gaffurius’s compositions, see Gasser, “The Marian Motet Cycles of the Gaffurius
Codices.”

28

Control of the duchy returned to the Sforza in 1512, although the French, now under Francis I (1494–1547),
reasserted control in 1515. Aided by the Austrians, the French were repelled in 1521 and Francesco II Sforza (1495–
1535) took over as duke.
29

Palisca, Humanism, 12–13, 191–92, and 208–211 questions Gaffurius’s direct knowledge of these sources.

273

A. Miller has compiled a list of sources cited directly or indirectly in Gaffurius’s works—the
array is impressive, especially considering patterns in the transmission of humanistic manuscripts
during the fifteenth century.30 Beginning in the 1490s and lasting until his death in 1522,
Gaffurius was embroiled in a pamphlet war with the Bolognese music theorist Giovanni Spataro
(1458–1541).31 Spataro, in following his teacher Bartolomeo Ramis de Pareia (c. 1440–after
1491), undermined many of the tenets of medieval music theory, arguing against Pythagorean
tuning, suggesting intonations based on simpler ratios, and rejecting the Guidonian system of
hexachords as outmoded. Spataro fell under attack from both Gaffurius and another Bolognese
writer on music from Parma, Nicolò Burzio (1453–1528), both of whom argued that timehonored musical traditions needed no such innovations.
Two features of this exchange are remarkable. First, the exchange was deeply embedded
in the culture of books. Letters both in print and in manuscript refer constantly to printed books,
showing how important they had become in music discourse even at this early stage. Second,
these printed books reinforced notions of regional identity and traditions. Gaffurius is styled
consistently as “laudensis” (“of Lodi”), Spataro as “bolognese” or “bononiensis,” and Burzio as
“parmensis.” Despite physically crossing geographical and political boundaries, printed books
reinscribed their importance. Gaffurius’s epithet for Spataro (“vaginarius bononiensis”) has as
much to do with the toponymic adjective as with the crude noun.32 Also of note for this study is

30

Miller, “Gaffurius’s Practica musicae,” 110–111.

31

In addition to the printed exchanges, see Spataro’s correspondence in Blackburn et al., A Correspondence.

32
Blackburn, “Gaffurius, Franchinus” notes correctly that “vaginarius” was a Latinized form of “Spataro” meaning
“sheath-maker.” Given the acrimonious spirit of the exchange, however, it seems likely that the English cognate also
seems to have been invoked in this rendering of Spataro’s name. Barnhard, Chambers Dictionary of Etymology,
1191 notes that the English word is first attested in an anatomical sense in 1682, although it had probably acquired
that sense in Latin for some time beforehand.

274

the genesis of the debate. Gaffurius was a profligate annotator of books and this practice
extended to books that he borrowed. Probably around 1490, Spataro lent Gaffurius a copy of his
teacher’s treatise, Ramis’s Musica practica (1482). Spataro’s ire was sparked initially when he
discovered that Gaffurius had littered the margins of his book with annotations critical of his
revered teacher’s theories.
Although many Renaissance authors of books on music spoke about the role that books
played in their lives, Gaffurius does this more extensively than any other, speaking frequently of
the material aspects of his books. At the beginning of chapter two, I quote the epigram to
Gaffurius’s De harmonia (1518), a dialogue between the author and his book. The epigram
demonstrates Gaffurius’s immersion in the world of books, which—it is worth emphasizing—
continued to circulate in both print and manuscript throughout the Renaissance.33 Meleguli’s
biography also concedes the importance of printing technology to Gaffurius’s fame: “Because he
had written [the Theorica and Practica] with perhaps less effectual solicitude, he allowed his
recent works (also in the vernacular), as if white clay kneaded and exactly shaped, to be printed
in this distinguished city.”34 The first editions of his most important works—the Theorica,
Practica, and De harmonica—all were printed at Milan (his single-author publications are listed
in table A1.2). Gaffurius conceived of these works as a trilogy, treating of the entire field of
musical study: the mathematical and philosophical foundations of music (Theorica), the art of

musical practice (Practica), and ancient Greek harmonics (De harmonia).35 This was an
immense intellectual achievement that established him as a central thinker on the subject of
music. His influence on the development of Renaissance music discourse was inestimable; with
very few exceptions, every subsequent Renaissance music theorist knew his works and read them
carefully.36 Gaffurius’s De harmonia, in particular, was central in priming wider interest in

ancient Greek music theory, then coming under increasing scrutiny with the recovery of ancient
testimony.37
Gaffurius’s books abound with illustrations and musical examples, and were among the
earliest printed books about music to do so.38 These include diagrams, tables, charts, examples of
plainchant (in the Gregorian and local Ambrosian rites), simple representations of notes, rests,
and ligatures, and full-length samples of polyphony—all executed through woodcuts. Given the
general state of technical illustrations during the incunabular period, they are of a high quality.39
James Haar has noted that the first edition of the Practica (1496) integrates the book’s
illustrations into its theoretical arguments.40 The full-page illustrations on the title page and at the
start of each of the book’s four parts visually reflect the points of topical continuity and contrast
in the text. H. Edmund Poole has shown that the musical examples in the several editions of the
Practica are identical, which suggests that they belonged to Gaffurius, who lent them to the
firms that published these reprints.41 The Practica was especially successful; the first edition sold
out within a year, and was reprinted four times at Brescia and Venice. Few other books of such a
scope and magnitude achieved similar success; the works of Vicentino and Zarlino, both
important works, were notably slow sellers (see below and chapter two). An important material
feature of all the works of the Gaffurian trilogy were printed marginal notes, which identify

readers to follow the progression of the text at a distance.
All of the first editions of Gaffurius’s books included a portrait of the author. The
Theoricum (1480) and Theorica (1492) both include a woodcut portrait of the author seated at

is the first instance of which I am aware of a book about music that distills the precepts of the

book in graphic form on the title page.42 One of the full-page woodcuts in the first edition of the
Practica includes a miniature of Gaffurius teaching a group of schoolboys (figure A1.2). The
teacher is seated at a lectern, with his left hand placed on an open book as he observes the class.
In front of him are five young boys, each one reading aloud from an open book in hand.
Both the large portrait of Gaffurius at the organ from the title page of the Theorica and
the mythological scene from the title page of the Practica reappear in De harmonia (sig. N6v and
M6v, respectively). This helped the trilogy to cohere graphically as a set—it also might reflect
Gaffurius’s keenness to make the most of the expensive woodcuts in his possession. A third
woodcut of Gaffurius teaching on the title page of De harmonia makes the cohesion of the set
explicit (figure A1.3).43 Around the edges of the image runs an inscription that stakes a claim for
his reputation and refers specifically to his theoretical triptych: “Franchinus Gaffurius of Lodi,

who wrote most accurately three books on the theory, practice, and instrumental harmony of
music.” Gaffurius’s fortunes as a teacher have improved since his portraiture in the Practica.
Here, he sits elevated before a rapt audience of twelve pupils, who appear to be older than the
schoolboys in the earlier scene (one is tonsured); they sit silently before their master. Gaffurius’s
left hand props open a large, richly bound-volume from which he quotes the maxim, “Harmony
is discord concordant.” This is stylized visually through organ pipes at his right and line
segments at his left, both in the ratio 3:4:6 (which produces an octave partitioned, from the
bottom up, into a fifth and a fourth). Also at Gaffurius’s left is a compass, the traditional tool of
measurement, a critical instrument for assessing harmony in its physical manifestations. The

280

image functions as a visual representation of the subject matter of the De harmonia. All of the
author portraits in these editions invoke the authority of Gaffurius by presenting him as a
knowledgeable figure in a position of respect. Gaffurius’s books also established the trend in
books about music of including portraits of their authors and scenes of reading, both of which are
taken up in more detail in chapter two. Gaffurius’s books also anticipate two important trends in
Renaissance books about music: an emphasis on pragmatism over scholasticism and the adoption
of the vernacular. The Practica begins with a dedication to Ludovico Sforza. In it, Gaffurius
states his aim to present a comprehensive picture of the art of music without giving excessive or
arcane details:
If I exert myself to the utmost, it is only with the hope that my industry be of
value to the advancement of the studious, and that I may be considered as having
made a suitable and concise compilation of material, so that whatever is needed
from the writing of varied authors may be found in a single work arranged in a
convenient order. We have endeavored to present all subjects from their origins in
an unbroken sequence from beginning to end, so that the reader does not wander
about in confusion in an otherwise difficult art and struggle with writings that are
more inept than obscure in subject matter.44
This concern with (or at least the rhetorical conceit of) reader-friendliness and the general
approach of curating the best extracts from various writers find echoes in a many subsequent
Renaissance books about music.
Gaffurius also is the author, at least nominally, of the first books about music in the
Italian language. The year 1508 saw the publication of the Angelicum ac divinum opus musice,
an adaptation of the Practica in Italian. The Angelicum is dedicated to Simone Crotto, a

Milanese patrician and member of the Knights Hospitaller.45 In the dedication, Gaffurius
explains his rationale for its publication:
Now to be sure, since the publication in the Latin language, as was fitting and
proper, of the Theorica and Practica and also the Instrumentorum harmonia, I
have composed by request a work on the same subject in the vernacular, to the
end that those who have not learned letters [i.e., do not read Latin] may be able to
derive some profit from the work I have done.46
Sixteen years prior, in 1492, his student Francesco Caza published at Milan the Tractato vulgare
de canto figurato, an abridged Italian translation of the Practica.47 Caza’s little-studied Tractato
also furnishes one of the earliest overt examples of advertising in Renaissance books about
music, as it appeared four year before the work it abridged. Thus, one might interpret the
Tractado as advance marketing for the Practica, a book that came to earn a place of honor on the
bookshelves of musicians for the next century and a half (see appendix three).

Heinrich Glarean (1488–1563)
Glarean was born in the town of Mollis, in the Swiss canton of Glarus.48 As a young child, he
expressed a fascination with musical practice. In 1506, he enrolled in the University of Cologne
as a student of philosophy and theology. He later added music to his course of study, which

supplemented his practical knowledge of music with its origins in Boethian number theory. His
music professor at Cologne was Johannes Cochlaeus (1479–1552), who also provided
extracurricular instruction in musical practice. Cochlaeus, a then-recent recipient of the BA
(1504) and MA (1507) degrees from the University of Cologne, would go on to confront Martin
Luther at the Diet of Worms in 1521.49 In 1512, Glarean performed for Maximilian I (1459–
1519) a song that he composed in honor of the Holy Roman Emperor. Glarean recounts this tale
in his treatise on music, the Dodecachordon (1547):
[The Dorian mode] is very suitable for heroic poetry, as I have myself
experienced at one time as a youth in Cologne in the presence of the celebrated
Kaiser Maximilian and many princes, not without the reward of the merited laurel
branch (which is said without boasting).50
The emperor, in addition bestowing a laurel wreath, placed a ring on Glarean’s finger and named
him poet laureate of the Holy Roman Empire—all at the age of twenty-four. Glarean’s awareness
of the significance of this moment is signaled by the qualification that his narration of the event
is “said without boasting” (“absit verbo invidia”).
In 1514, Glarean moved to Basel to direct a boarding school for young boys. While there,
he made the acquaintance of Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536), the celebrated Dutch humanist,
theologian, and one of the most noted writers of the Renaissance.51 Erasmus became a steady
friend and trusted advisor to Glarean. In 1516, Glarean followed Erasmus to Paris and enrolled in
the university. There he expanded his network of friends and correspondents. Guillaume Budé
(1467–1540), the French humanist and scholar, facilitated his access to the French royal court.

Through an interpreter, Glarean conversed with Jean Mouton (c. 1459–1522), the principal
composer for the royal court. He also befriended the theologian and scholar, Jacques Lefèvre
d’Étaples (c. 1460–1536), formerly a professor of mathematics at the University of Paris whose
Musica libris quatuor demonstrata (1496), became a standard work in the university curriculum
(see chapter three).
In 1519, Glarean returned to Basel and resumed teaching. Basel was a central hub in the
European book trade, and Glarean cultivated ties with two of the city’s distinguished printing
houses, those of Johann Froben and Heinrich Petri. In 1517, Glarean was mentioned several
times in the infamous collection of satirical letters, the Epistolae obscurorum virorum. In one
letter (quoted at the end of chapter three), Glarean is depicted in the company of heretics in the
Froben printing shop. Even a whiff of reformed theology, such as in this satirical, fictional
account, was enough to ruin a promising career like Glarean’s. Troubled by Basel’s increasing
embrace of Protestantism, Glarean moved in 1529 to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he became a
professor of poetry and theology. He settled there into a steady routine of teaching, research, and
writing. The 1530s and 1540s were an extraordinarily productive period for Glarean, witnessing
the publication of over 120 editions of his works.
Glarean was a man of bookish learnedness. A contemporary portrait of Glarean appears
in the margins of a copy of Erasmus’s Encomium moriae owned by his friend Oswald Myconius
(1488–1552).52 This famous exemplar includes numerous pen sketches by the German artist
Hans Holbein the Younger (c. 1497–1543)—another mutual friend of Erasmus, Myconius, and
Glarean; Holbein also contributed the elegant title-page woodcut for Glarean’s first book about

music, Isagoge in musicen (1516). The portrait of Glarean (figure A1.4) appears humorously
next to Erasmus’s discussion of the follies of the poet. Glarean is depicted in a hooded robe with
a book open in his hands. He walks forward but gazes absentmindedly at his book. In fitting with
the subject of the folly, Holbein portrays Glarean as disheveled, his expression nonplussed; what
appears to be a fool’s cap hangs behind his head atop the robe.
A significant amount of evidence survives concerning how Glarean used the books he
owned. After his death, Glarean’s library of some 6,000 volumes passed to several individuals
and institutions; today, at least 108 volumes survive at D-Mu and another twelve at other

285

European libraries.53 The books about music that Glarean owned are, for the most part, the usual
suspects: two editions of Boethius’s complete works, one edited by himself (1546), and an earlier
Venetian edition (1497–1499); Johannes Cochlaeus, Musica (1507); Johannes Froschius, Rerum
musicarum opusculum (1535); and Gaffurius, Practica and De harmonia. Unlike Zarlino’s books
(see below), many of these contain important annotations. Cristle Collins Judd has examined
Glarean’s copy of Gaffurius’s Practica, showing how Glarean attempted to square his own
theories with the authority of Gaffurius and how he incorporated Gaffurius’s musical examples
into his own writings.54
Also present was Glarean’s library is a collection of various theoretical manuscripts
compiled during the thirteenth century (now at D-Mu, shelfmark 8º Cod. Ms. 375).55 In the
margins of this manuscript, Glarean added a significant number of annotations, including subject
keywords, cross-references, and corrections to misconceptions about ancient sources. The most
heavily-annotated section is a copy of Guido of Arezzo’s Micrologus (pp. 82–124), which
Glarean marked up with headlines naming the author and work, subject keywords, identifications
of unnamed authorities, and, most importantly, labels for each part and chapter (highlighted to a
lesser degree by the scribe of the manuscript). In this respect, Glarean appears to have adapted
the manuscript to suit his own needs as a reader. I suggest here that these annotations greatly
aided Glarean’s use of Guido’s work when composing the Dodecachordon—citations to Guido’s
Micrologus are frequent. Such annotations not only recorded Glarean’s thoughts on Guido’s

ideas, but also helped to excavate and clarify their structure hidden in the manuscript’s manner of
visual presentation.
For Glarean, manuscripts and printed books appear to have coexisted uneasily.
Manuscripts protected treasures waiting to be discovered by new readers eager to decipher their
mysteries. In the preface of the Dodeachordon, Glarean describes a trip to St. George’s Abbey in
the Black Forest, where, at the instigation of the abbot Johannes Kern, he read one particular
collection of writings in manuscript:56
In his [Kern’s] care was a codex that contained various treatises on all branches of
knowledge, an encyclopedia, as the Greeks say. In it were five books about music
by St. Severinus [Boethius], beside some by Guido d’Arezzo, Berno [of
Reichenau], Wilhelm [of Hirschau], Odo [of Arezzo], Theogerus the Bishop [of
Metz], and John, later pope, XXII. I cannot deny that I have been made more
venturesome through these books, especially through the Boethian works, which
heretofore I had had in an imperfect condition, but which at that place in one way
or another I found in a purified state.57
The purity of ancient knowledge in manuscript contrasted the imperfections of the printed page.
Such corruptions extended, unfortunately, to Glarean’s own works. Writing in his own personal
copy of the Dodecachordon, Glarean disclaims responsibility for the accuracy of the edition:
Among these errors, which may be seen noted in our hand, many are likewise
inexcusable. So little shame the people had who put this volume to press, even
though they had a copy corrected very carefully by author himself. An evil spirit

was flitting about in order to prevent this work, published to the glory of God, the
best and highest of all, from coming into people’s hands in a more correct state.58
From this perspective, Glarean’s assessment of printing technology’s utility might have been
colored by his perception of the reliability of printers. This might explain why he went to such
lengths to send copies corrected in his own hand to his most important readers, a subject
explored at length in a recent study by Bernhard Kölbl.59
Glarean’s books of music also shaped his approach to composing the Dodecachordon.
Among Glarean’s library was a set of four partbooks of motets in manuscript (D-Mu, shelfmark
8º Cod. ms. 322–325). The partbooks contain annotations in Glarean’s hand indicating authorial
and modal attributions to each composition. In a virtuosic analysis of the collection, Judd
demonstrates that most of the motets were selected from Petrucci’s Motetti A (RISM 15021) and
Motetti B (RISM 15031); and that the partbooks served as the copy-texts for the printer of the
Dodecachordon, Heinrich Petri.60 Glarean’s manuscript partbooks demonstrate a common, yet
seemingly inverted pattern of transmission, from Petrucci’s prints to Glarean’s manuscripts.
From his manuscripts, Glarean could study these motets without defacing expensive and rapidlyaging copies of Petrucci’s prints.61 The manuscripts also allowed Glarean to curate works from
several sources, arranging them to suit his needs and to facilitate maximal comprehension. As

Judd notes, the manuscript partbooks afforded a deeper sense of ownership of their contents:
“Physical possession of the material object was far less significant than the intellectual
possession of the wealth of material acquired and ready for (re)use in the manuscript entries
obtained from printed books.”62
I would highlight the central role that manuscripts assumed in this entire process of
mediating between the prints of Petrucci and Glarean. Once the manuscript partbooks had been
compiled and thoroughly studied, a second process of curation occurred; from these partbooks,
Glarean selected ten of the nineteen motets for inclusion in the Dodecachordon. The process
involved was one of sifting, a gradual discernment of the best exempla for his modal categories.
While Judd rightly notes that such extensive consumption of printed music was only possible
with the advent of printing technology, Glarean’s thinking and writing manifested itself in a
context that placed trust primarily in manuscripts. Moreover, I would highlight the importance of
selection and curation in Glarean’s navigation of an expansive sea of repertory. Judd places the
manuscript partbooks within an Erasmian context in which exempla proliferate for the sake of
variety or mere collection. But Glarean, in his manuscripts and in his writings, emphasizes the
choiceness of his exemplars. In fact, Glarean criticizes Gaffurius for mindless collection, for
failing to select only the most apt examples: “It is very apparent not only from this book
[Gaffurius’s De harmonia] but also from his Practica musicae that he does not know more than
seven modes. He has collected things from various writers, both Latin and Greek, but they are
not helpful in the matter.”63 Glarean also criticized Gaffurius at the end of part one of the

62

63

Glarean, Dodecachordon (1965), 130 (adapted). “Neque ille ultra septem recte nouit, quod cum ex eo opere, tum
ex activa ipsius Musica plane apparet. Et quae ex varijs authoribus cum latinis tum Graecis collegit, negocium nihil
adiuvant, ut priore quoque libro attestati sumus.” Glarean, Dodecachordon (1547), 92.

289

Dodecachordon, forgiving Gaffurius’s ignorance of the twelve modes, but censuring his
mindless addition of source material:
This is strong evidence that Franchinus, so that he would not appear to have
neglected any common knowledge through ignorance, thought it sufficient to
have shown the reader in some way the names which he saw so frequently among
authors and which he could not explain himself, as something almost to be
regarded as lost, which no one in posterity would understand…Meanwhile we
warn the reader that any remarkable heaping together of names changes nothing
in regard to the nature of the modes.64
Such statements intimate that Glarean selected his own examples more carefully than Gaffurius
did. This process of selection is attested amply in the complex material genesis of the
Dodecachordon: Glarean wrote his own book in manuscript, using as sources both printed
books, native manuscripts, and printed books copied in manuscript. The issue of the materiality
of texts adds a new layer of depth to Judd’s argument about intellectual context of Glarean’s
Dodecachordon.

Vicente Lusitano (c. 1520–after 1561)
Lusitano was born around 1520 in Olivenza, Portugal (now in Spain).65 Archival documents
refer to him as a “homem pardo,” a term given to children of parents of different ethnicities; on
this basis, Giuliana Gialdroni argues that his father was Portuguese and his mother was an
African slave.66 As a teenager, he received musical training from Pero Bruxel, appointed in 1534

by Jaime de Lencastre (d. 1568), the Bishop of Ceuta, to oversee the liturgy of the Iglesia de
Santa María Magdalena at Olivenza. Around 1545, Jaime, a member of a prominent Portuguese
noble family, ordained Lusitano a priest. Lusitano dedicated his first publication, a collection of
Latin motets titled Liber primus epigramatum (Rome, 1551), to Dom Dinis de Lencastre (d.
1598), a distant nephew of Jaime. Robert M. Stevenson argues that Lusitano was in the service
of the Lencastre family, specifically Dinis’s father Dom Afonso de Lencastre (d. 1569).67
Lusitano appears to have followed Afonso to Rome in 1550, when he was appointed Portuguese
ambassador to the pope.
While at Rome, Lusitano sought new patrons and career prospects, perhaps even in the
Papal Chapel. That he attained this lofty goal seems unlikely, given that Lusitano is not recorded
in any of the chapel records, nor is he referred to in this way by Danckerts, a member of the
chapel who would have been eager to acknowledge a colleague. Lusitano certainly did cultivate
relationships with members of Roman musical elite, facilitated in large part by the publication of
his music by the Dorico firm (see chapter two). His Introduttione facilissima (1553) is dedicated
to Marcantonio II Colonna (1535–1584), a member of the prominent Roman patrician family
who fought with the Spanish in the Medici-led Siege of Siena (1553–1554) and served as an
admiral during the Battle of Lepanto (1571). Based on the wording of the dedication, Giordano
Mastrocola argues that Lusitano already was in Marcantonio’s service in 1553.68 This is
intimated further by Lusitano’s connection to the composer Giovanthomaso Cimello (c. 1510–
1579), who contributed a prefatory poem in Lusitano’s honor to the Liber primus epigramatum
and who was in the service of both Marcantonio and his mother Giovanna d’Aragona (1502–

1575).69 In the years after his victory in the debate with Vicentino (about which more presently),
Lusitano travelled throughout the Italian peninsula as a private music teacher, settling for a time
in Viterbo and Padua. Lusitano’s teaching provided a ready audience for and sustained interest in
reprints of the Introduttione facilissima (1558 and 1561). Given the identical xylographic
material used in all three editions of the Introduttione, Lusitano himself likely instigated these
reprints, which might have served as a calling card for prospective patrons.
In 1561, Lusitano converted to Protestantism in order to marry.70 Given that he was an
ordained Catholic priest, this necessitated a move toward a less orthodox region. He angled
initially for an appointment to the protestant court of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg (1515–
1568) at Stuttgart. Although the court remitted payment for some compositions Lusitano sent, he
was not offered a court position. In May 1561, Lusitano entered the service of Duke Christoph’s
one-time employee Giulio da Thiene (1501–1589), the protestant count of Vicenza. At the time
of Lusitano’s appointment, Giulio was in exile, dividing his time between Geneva and
Strasbourg. There are no further traces of Lusitano’s life after 1561. Lusitano probably
abandoned the toponym “Lusitano” (“of Portugal”) in his later career, which has frustrated
attempts to discern his activities through archival sources. Barbosa hypothesized that Lusitano
settled later on in France and that traces of his life are to be found under a different name in asyet-unidentified French archives.71 Mastrocola extends this argument by suggesting that Lusitano

sent his works to France, where they ended up in the library of Philippe Desportes (1546–
1606).72
In 1551, during the months of May and June, Lusitano debated with Nicola Vicentino
over the ancient Greek genera at Rome.73 This seminal event in history of Renaissance music
theory is considered intensively in chapters two through four. I offer the following narration of
the debate to establish a basic context for the discussions in the previous chapters and as a means
of highlighting the role of printing technology in Lusitano’s life. The disagreement began after a
performance of a polyphonic “Regina caeli” at the palazzo of Bernardo Acciaiuoli-Rucellai
along the Tiber River. In chapter two, I argue, following Stevenson, that this was Lusitano’s
setting of the text, published in the same year in the Liber primus epigramatum. Lusitano
maintained that the composition was in the diatonic genus, Vicentino that the composition was
not. They agreed to settle the disagreement in a public debate, each wagering two gold scudi.74
The specifics of the subsequent events of the debate are cloudy; we have firsthand testimony
from both Danckerts and Vicentino in their respective treatises.75 Both testimonies are riddled
with internal inconsistencies and contradict each other. Whether, as Danckerts maintained, this
occurred out of malice or, more plausibly, from faulty recollection remains uncertain. The
established outline of the events are as follows. On Tuesday, 2 June and Thursday, 4 June,
Lusitano and Vicentino gathered in the presence of Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este, his retinue, and

depositions (“informationi”) outlining their arguments. On Sunday, 7 June, Lusitano and
Vicentino presented oral arguments at the Apostolic Chapel in front of the judges, the papal
choir, and a large public assembly. Very quickly the judges realized that the debate would not be
settled by disputation, imploring the litigants instead to submit their depositions into evidence.
The parties agreed, read their depositions to the gathering, and surrendered them to the judges.
Deliberations were brief. That same day, the judges drafted the sentence and delivered it to
Ippolito, who read it before the assembly: Lusitano was acclaimed the winner and Vicentino was
ordered to forfeit his two gold scudi.
The sentence incensed Vicentino, inspiring him to write in great detail about it in
L’antica musica (1555). Vicentino complained that Lusitano’s presentation of his argument in
the deposition was significantly longer than the brief abstract requested by the judges—the
proximate cause, he argued, for his losing the debate. It is true that Lusitano’s deposition
included a lengthy quotation from Boethius, an ever-reliable authority on musical concerns,
whereas Vicentino’s was a simple précis of his argument that merely namedropped Boethius.
Vicentino imputes ungentlemanly conduct on the part of Lusitano, suggesting that Lusitano
wrote out his deposition after learning the contents of Vicentino’s. Vicentino further alleged that
Ippolito—his longtime and loyal patron—chastised Lusitano for a smug attitude in the face of an
obviously-unjust verdict. Adding insult to injury, Vicentino correctly noted that Lusitano
reversed his position in his chapter on the genera in his Introduttione (1553), adopting the exact
opinion that Vicentino himself espoused. In L’antica musica, Vicentino quoted this chapter by
Lusitano, showing point by point how Lusitano abandoned his earlier position to avoid the
embarrassment of appearing wrong. Throughout his narration of the debate and its aftermath,

294

Vicentino emphasized the correctness of his transcriptions of the documentary evidence: “The
arguments…and sentence are copied faithfully below without the fraudulent subtraction or
addition of a single word. Indeed, they are copied down to the last period from the authentic
copy made by the judges.”76
In his manuscripts, Danckerts, a stickler for accuracy, excoriated Vicentino for altering
several minor details in L’antica musica. The most vexatious was Vicentino’s addition of the
word “simple” (“semplice”) to his deposition (see chapter two). Danckerts claimed that this
addition disingenuously altered his position, changing his original assertion that modern music
was not in the diatonic genus, to the assertion that modern music was not simply in the diatonic
genus.77 Furthermore, Danckerts presents a different view of Vicentino’s basic argument: “no
composer of music knows the genus of the music that he himself composed.”78 From this
perspective, the sentence seems cut-and-dried in Lusitano’s favor. Against Vicentino’s claim,
Lusitano’s deposition clearly defined the genera and how they applied to modern music. Indeed,
Vicentino argues against this construal of his own point; his deposition ends with the flat
assertion that “the music we sing today is a mixture of the three genera rather than purely
diatonic, as Messer Vicente Lusitano avers.”79 From Danckerts’s point of view, Vicentino argued
against himself by identifying the genera used in modern music. But this understands only a part

of Vicentino’s argument. L’antica musica makes clear that Vicentino was unable in the
deposition to articulate the broader significance of his argument, which required an essential
redefinition of the genera and their reckoning in polyphonic music. To judge from what little
remains of Lusitano’s and Vicentino’s oral and written arguments, each party presented a
distinctive and nonetheless theoretically-consistent interpretation of the ancient Greek genera.
Lusitano won because his argument played to common understandings of the genera and quoted
the authority of Boethius. Vicentino lost because his argument called for a bold revision of
terminology and concepts that exceeded the discursive constraints of a brief memorandum and of
oral disputation.
Lusitano was strangely silent on the debate in the flurry of writings that issued in its
wake. He won the debate already and stood nothing to gain by crowing about it; indeed,
litigating the dispute in print was bound to backfire. In chapter two, I show that Lusitano took
great lengths to ensure that Vicentino did not publish the sentence, even though it was in
Lusitano’s favor. I argue that, even before the debate began, Lusitano orchestrated a complex
publishing strategy to bolster his professional standing. This began with the publication of his
motets, including the “Regina caeli” setting that may have precipitated the debate. He then
parlayed his victory in the debate into the publication of his treatise. For Lusitano, publication
does not appear to have been a commercial or professional end in itself. Rather, his publications
dovetailed with events that took place outside the pages of books with real professional and
economic advantages; the motet print culminated in the debate, and the treatise culminated in his
career as a traveling teacher. Lusitano never wrote directly and publicly about the debate,
publishing only two short pages on the ancient Greek genera that reversed his opinion. As
Vicentino noted, Lusitano’s language on the subject is noncommittal and confusing; furthermore,

296

the subject is unrelated to the didactic purpose of the treatise as a whole, which focuses on the
basics of singing and improvised counterpoint.
Throughout this affair, Lusitano took several steps to protect his work. I examine in
chapter two the privilege that Pope Julius III granted to Lusitano to protect the Liber primus
epigramatum. Its unusual provisions gave Lusitano one important advantage after the debate.
Given Vicentino’s propensity for quotation, and if indeed Lusitano’s “Regina caeli” was the
composition that sparked the debate, then the privilege prevented Vicentino from reprinting and
discussing the motet in L’antica musica. Publication formed only one component of a larger
agenda to advance Lusitano’s professional standing; that is, unlike Tigrini and other writers, he
never sought patronage directly in his publications. Rather, he sought positions and preferment
through his personal connections and through intermediaries. His service to Dom Afonso de
Lencastre at Rome resulted from his association with Afonso’s relatives at Portugal. Lusitano’s
attempt to secure a post at the court at Württemberg took place through the intercession of a
friend, Pier Paolo Vergerio (c. 1498–1565), an exiled, converted papal diplomat in the duke’s
service.80 Books and printing technology thus played an important albeit circumscribed role in
Lusitano’s professional life.
A little-known autograph manuscript treatise by Lusitano further confirms this point.81
The Spanish-language manuscript, now at F-Pn, shelfmark ms. Espagnol 219, is a volume in
small folio consisting of eighty-five leaves. The treatise consists of three sections on mensuration

signs, improvised counterpoint, and mensural proportions and the ancient Greek genera. Part two
of the manuscript on improvised counterpoint is the longest and most expansive section (98½ pp.
versus 24½ for part one and 45 for part three). Like Danckerts’s manuscripts, Lusitano clearly
prepared this document for publication, perfecting its language through revisions and adding
marginal keywords as an aid to readers. Mastrocola shows that an entire draft of the work must
have been completed around the time of the debate in May/June 1551.82 Lusitano continued to
revise the manuscript after the debate, particularly the end of part three, which touched briefly on
the genera. Yet the manuscript never saw the light of day in its complete form. Instead, Lusitano
abridged its contents in the Italian-language Introduttione facilissima. I suggest that the
differences between these two works reveal Lusitano’s process of adapting the work for print.
The most obvious difference is the change in language from Spanish to Italian; the Introduttione,
after all, was published at Rome. Also revealing are Lusitano’s choices of what to preserve, what
to excise, and what to introduce. Lusitano added a brief primer on singing from mensural
notation and greatly condensed parts one and two. Of part three, Lusitano preserved only the
final chapter on the genera and significantly reduced its scope. In so doing, Lusitano transformed
the highly technical manuscript into a more approachable introduction to the subject of
counterpoint. (Note that the contrast in discursive approach mirrors the contrast in
bibliographical format, folio versus quarto.) Lusitano’s approach to adapting the manuscript for
publication appears to reveal a keen awareness of his audience’s identity, their expectations, and
their needs as readers. This in turn might suggest that Lusitano, or at least his editor, was familiar
with the conventions and norms of printed books, those nonverbal aspects of presentation that
shaped the way readers approached them (see chapter three).

Oratio Tigrini (1541–1591)
In a recent article, Claudio Santori provides an account of Oratio Tigrini’s life pieced together
from traces in various archival sources.83 Tigrini’s entire career was centered in Arezzo, a
Tuscan town southeast of Florence, most known to music historians as the birthplace of the
famed medieval music theorist Guido of Arezzo (c. 992–1033). At various points, Tigrini
worked for the city’s two largest churches, the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Pieve and the Duomo
di Arezzo (also called the Cattedrale di Santi Donato e Pietro). He rose from a lowly birth,
studying music early on with Paolo Aretino, maestro di canto and maestro di cappella at the
Duomo. The young teenager received financial and in-kind support from the Confraternity of
Murello, an association of the Duomo responsible for its seminary and hospital.84 Material
support from the confraternity included several books, including ones by Terence and Cicero,
indicating an early aptitude for scholarship and an appreciation for the classics.
In 1558, at the age of seventeen, he began his career as a singer at the Pieve, where he
was ordained a subdeacon in 1561. Beginning in October 1562, Tigrini served as maestro di
canto at the Duomo, where he taught choirboys the fundamentals of singing and counterpoint.85
He was dismissed from his post at the Duomo in April 1571, a result of prolonged conflict with
cathedral administrators egged on by musical competitors. After a period of respite in the Aretine
countryside at Bagnoro, he began in 1574 an ecclesiastical career, becoming parish priest at the
Chiesa di San Giusto (no longer extant). He also served as an officer, then the secretary, and

finally the prior of the Confraternity of Murello. At the same time, he served intermittently as
organist at the Pieve.
In 1587, he was reappointed to the Duomo to the dual post of maestro di canto and
maestro di cappella. He thus assumed sole responsibility for overseeing the musical activities at
the cathedral for the short remainder of his career. He died, aged fifty-one, at Arezzo, the city of
his birth. The death certificate, dated 15 October 1591, indicates that he had been named
honorary canon of the Pieve, reflecting prolonged and distinguished service as priest to the
Diocese of Arezzo. This was announced proudly on the title page of his Il compendio della
musica, published in 1588 just after his reinstatement to the Duomo. The death certificate
indicates further that he was on Olivetan monk and was buried in the Chiesa di San Bernardo in
Arezzo.86
In the remainder of this section, I examine for the first time Tigrini’s ambitious attempts
to secure a more lucrative court post through his musical publications (table A1.3). In short,
Tigrini’s work for the church was only one component of a multifaceted career and his
publications record a perspective on his life apart from the tedium of clerical work. To be sure,
his 1579 collection of twenty-nine psalms-settings for four and five voices indicates a sincere
religious sentiment. The dedication—dated at Arezzo, 15 July 1579 and addressed to the vicar
general of the city (i.e., the principal deputy of the Bishop of Arezzo)—records his progressive
attitude toward church music, which he desired to compose “in accordance with the reforms of
the Council of Trent, so as to inspire the piety of the faithful.”87 This publication marks the

Tigrini’s madrigal publications attest a different, more secular orientation to his
professional life. His sacking from the Duomo in 1571 was a protracted affair and his experience
with meddling clerics clearly left him hesitant to continue religious work.88 Tigrini’s madrigal
prints offered a chance to pursue a different career path in the courts of the Tuscan aristocracy.
The dedications to these prints reveal the targets of his campaign to obtain court appointments
and patronage. On the whole, his targets seem logica if conservative choices for prospective
patrons. Perhaps, then, they reflect a certain self-consciousness about his own stature within the
Italian musical world, not worthy of the largesse of wealthier aristocrats. The choices reflect
equally plausibly a preference for less metropolitan locales.

Tigrini dedicated his first publication, a collection of four-voice madrigals, to Federico
Barbolani (1513–1582), member of the Tuscan family that held the hereditary title of Count of
Monteauto, a small village outside Arezzo.89 Federico served bravely in Cosimo de’ Medici’s
siege of Siena (1554–1555); in June 1557, when the Medici assumed control of Siena, he was
rewarded for his service with the command of a garrison in the city. Federico worked his way up
the bureaucracy, eventually rising in 1572 to the position of governor of Siena, a position that
carried significant respect and administrative responsibility, if little real power.
Tigrini’s four-voice madrigals were published during this later period of Federico’s life.
Outside the steady employ of the church, Tigrini need significant support, especially if he
intended to devote himself to composition. An Aretine nobleman working in Tuscany, Federico
was an obvious choice for patron. The print’s dedication—dated at Venice, 15 April 1573—
draws attention to Federico’s competent execution of “the many undertakings, all things of
importance, and various governances” required by the administration of the city.90 At the end of
the dedication, Tigrini asked Federico to “find them [the madrigals] worthy of having me under
your protection.”91 Tigrini addresses Federico formulaically as “my most respected patron”
(“patron mio osservandissimo”); this is more likely aspirational than real, given that there is no
evidence of a patronage relationship. The print thus resembles an audition of sorts for a would-be
patron, as there is no evidence of activity by Tigrini outside Arezzo beyond his Venetian
publications.

Tigrini dedicated his first book of six-voice madrigals to Vincenzo Vitelli (d. 1583),
member of a prominent Umbrian family from the town of Castello (just on the border with
Tuscany).92 Like the Barbolani, the Vitelli were noted patrons of art and loyally served the
Medici through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. At the time of Tigrini’s publication,
Vincenzo was the signore of Montone and Citerna, small Umbrian villages southeast of Arezzo.
Previously, Vincenzo served as general of the pontifical infantry of Gregory XIII, fighting in
1571 against the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto. During a visit to Rome in 1583, Vincenzo was
shot and stabbed viciously in the middle of the night, the victim of a longstanding feud between
Gregory and the Orsini, a Roman patrician family. The pope awarded an annuity to Vincenzo’s
grief-stricken family, enabling Vincenzo’s young son Francesco (1582–1646) to attain a classical
education; he would rise to the position of cardinal and papal ambassador to Venice.
The dedication—dated at Arezzo, 1 March 1582—addresses Vincenzo as “mio signore et
padrone osservandissimo,” although it is clear from the remainder of the dedication that he was
not in Vincenzo’s service, but sought patronage through this publication. Tigrini claims to have
composed the madrigals explicitly for Vincenzo: “My musical labors are wont to have written
along their neck, as on the rich jewel of the white deer of Caesar, ‘Let none touch me.’”93 The
reference here is multilayered. Most immediately, it might refer to Petrarch’s invocation of
Laura’s untouchable beauty, the result of his intense and laborious pining (Canzoniere, sonnet
190). This itself refers to the legend of Julius Caesar’s stag being found alive three centuries after

Caesar’s death, with a collar inscribed “Do not touch me for I am Caesar’s.”94 The inscription
hearkens further to the words of Jesus Christ, conflating his exhortations to Mary Magdalene not
to touch his resurrected body (John 20:14–17) and to the Pharisees to render to Caesar what is
Caesar’s (Matthew 22:13–21). The reference seems designed to persuade Vincenzo that these
madrigals represent works inspired in his image and truly meant for his possession.
The print opens with “A voi, Vincentio, invio,” a madrigal meant to inaugurate the
patronage relationship. The poem was a boilerplate honorific text into which any three-syllable
name could be inserted; this is the case with “A voi, Londonio, invio” in Pietro Vinci’s Il terzo
libro de madrigali a cinque voci (1571 = RISM V1675).95 A heading at the beginning of the
second madrigal in the print indicates that it is dedicated to Vincenzo’s wife, Faustina Vitelli (d.
1584); the text of this madrigal, a popular sonnet by Bembo (“Cantai un tempo, e si fu dolce il
canto”), does not refer by name to its honoree.96 Both madrigal texts invoke the notion of music
acting as an external agent for the text’s speaker. I cite the full text of Tigrini’s “A voi,
Vincentio, invio”:
To you, Vincenzo, I send
These my low notes and these high ones
And I beg of your heart’s desire
That you deign to defend and protect them
And that you have them sung

94

“Noli me tangere Caesaris sum.” This legend was first related in Gaius Julius Solinus, De mirabilis mundi
(c. 250).
95

The coincidence extends only to the texts of the madrigals; Tigrini’s and Vinci’s musical settings are very
different.

96

Other settings of the sonnet appear in Philippe de Monte, Il secondo libro de madrigali a sei voci (1569 = RISM
M3344); Girolamo Conversi, Il primo libro de madrigali a sei voci (1584 = RISM C3551); and Sperindio Bertoldo,
Il secondo libro de madrigali a cinque voci (1562 = RISM B2129). The best-known setting is of the sonnet’s octave
only, in Claudio Monteverdi, Il secondo libro de madrigali a cinque voci (1590 = RISM M3456).

304

So that with your wisdom and favor
They are adorned with grace and splendor.97
Vincenzo, like Federico Barbolani, was an obvious choice for a prospective patron, one working
near Arezzo but with a sizable network of contacts across Italy. Nonetheless, his overtures to
Vincenzo seem to have gone unnoticed, as Galliano Ciliberti has shown that there is no direct
evidence of any formal relationship between the two.98 It thus remains unclear how Tigrini
earned a living during this period without a church appointment.
Tigrini’s final publication, a second book of six-voice madrigals, is dedicated to
Francesco Albergotti, member of a prominent Aretine family.99 Little is known about
Francesco’s life except that he was elected to the Medici-created Order of Saint Stephen in
1589.100 The print brings together Tigrini’s madrigals and those by three other composers
working in Arezzo: Gioseffo Apolloni (fl. 1591–1607), Tiberio Rivolti (fl. 1574–1580), and
Oratio Peccatori (about whom nothing is known except the toponym “Aretino” assigned in the
print). Although the publication would seem to be a joint venture among the four composers,
Tigrini makes no mention of the others in the dedication, dated at Arezzo, 1 February 1591.
Tigrini promises Francesco that “if God and my bad luck grant it, I am most eager to offer you
on a different day another present worthy of Your Excellency.”101

305

Tigrini addresses Francesco, as in his previous madrigal prints, as “patron mio
osservandissimo.” The text of the dedication is particularly striking. Tigrini claims that, in spite
of the various self-serving reasons that motivate authors’ dedications, he was moved to do so in
admiration of Francesco’s Christ-like splendor. Unlike his other dedications, Tigrini repeatedly
emphasizes his own unworthiness of Francesco’s favor—whether this is sycophantic or sincere is
not clear, although it appears more strongly in this dedication than in his others. It seems
unlikely, however, that Tigrini sought patronage for himself with this publication. By this time,
he had returned to work at the Duomo and had risen within the ecclesiastical orbit of Arezzo, at
this point the See of the Diocese of Tuscany.
The most likely explanation for the dedication to Francesco is that Tigrini used the print
to obtain patronage for the other composers represented in the volume, Apolloni, Rivolti, and
Peccatori. By all appearances, these composers seem to have been Tigrini’s pupils or disciplines,
and it makes sense that he might leverage his status to help his students get a professional start.
The continuing association of Tigrini and his circle, on the one hand, with members of the
Albergotti family, on the other hand, suggests that Tigrini’s strategy paid off. Apolloni
succeeded Tigrini at the Duomo and later dedicated the first publication of his own music to
Francesco’s younger and better-known relative, Girolamo Albergotti (elected both to the Order
of Saint Stephen in 1613 and to the Knights Hospitallers in 1659).102 Rivolti, a trombonist, later
became maestro di cappella at the Santa Maria della Scala in Siena, despite a rocky relationship
with the Sienese civil and ecclesiastical authorities.103

306

Considered overall, Tigrini’s publication strategies typify those of sixteenth-century
musicians seeking to garner patronage or to elevate their status. But Tigrini, somewhat like
Lusitano, reaped only indirect benefits of having his music published. His periodic presence as
an organist at the Pieve suggests that he did not secure continuing patronage from the dedicatees
of his prints; whether he received in-kind or one-off payments remains to be ascertained. Yet the
steady publication of his music surely helped to improve his professional reputation within the
local sphere of Arezzo and ultimately contributed to his rehiring at the Duomo. A further
possibility is that Tigrini in fact did secure patronage from these dedicatees in the form of onetime subventions for these prints.
In 1588, Tigrini published at Venice his treatise on the art of counterpoint, Il compendio
della musica. At face value, the Compendio is a redaction of parts three and four of Gioseffo
Zarlino’s Le istitutioni harmoniche (1558). On a deeper level, though, the treatise collates
Zarlino’s writings with related passages by other music theorists ranging from Boethius and
Guido to contemporaries such as Vicente Lusitano and Nicola Vicentino. Tigrini’s printed
citations demonstrate Zarlino’s unacknowledged debt to the works of earlier Italian music
theorists, especially Franchinus Gaffurius’s Practica musicae (1496), Pietro Aaron’s Toscanello
in musica (1523), and Nicola Vicentino’s L’antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica
(1555).104 In chapters two and four, I examine these printed marginalia in greater detail, showing
how Tigrini’s treatise resulted from a process known as extensive reading and provided its own
readers with a helpful textual aid. Part three of the Compendio includes an extended section of
sample cadences in each mode for four, five, and six voices, which were reproduced without

attribution in Thomas Morley’s A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597).105
In chapter three, I show how these cadences challenged the abilities of its printer, Ricciardo
Amadino, and how the Compendio helped to popularize the use of scores in counterpoint
manuals.
The treatise contains extensive front matter that sheds further light on Tigrini’s circle of
intellectual acquaintances. The book opens with Tigrini’s dedication to Zarlino, followed by a
highly unusual response from the dedicatee that expresses gratitude for the “laurel crown”
(“corona di Lauro”) that Tigrini has bestowed on him. There follow several poems composed in
Tigrini’s honor, poems which have yet to be examined by scholars. The authors of these poems
place Tigrini in a slightly different intellectual context than his madrigals, although it remains
unclear exactly how well these writers knew Tigrini. Lodovico Panzani (fl. 1588–1609) was a
priest at the Chiesa di San Tomà at Venice.106 Several turns of phrase in Panzani’s poems make
sly references to Tigrini’s madrigals that suggest he knew Tigrini personally (e.g., “al caldo al
gielo,” a reference to no. 4 of the first book of six-voice madrigals, and “che mentre il Sole,” a
reference to no. 12 of his second book of six-voice madrigals, which had yet to be published).
Luca Guadagnoli (fl. 1587–1588), a poet at Arezzo, also probably knew Tigrini personally; his
poem thanks Tigrini for helping him to learn how harmonies may be better formed (“Imparando
da voi come i concenti / Formar possin migliori”).107 Paolo Bozi (c. 1550–c. 1628) was a
Veronese composer, poet, and dramatist, whose clever sonnet seems to refer to Tigrini’s

highlights a significant theme in chapter three, the importance of an author’s association with the
right publisher. Finally, a sonnet by the composer Cesare Acelli (fl. 1586–1588) addresses
Tigrini as the “new lawgiver” (“novo legislator”) for the subject of music.109 Tigrini’s letter to
readers ends with a lengthy list of authorities on the subject of music, discussed in chapter three.

Nicola Vicentino (1511–c. 1576)
Nicola Vicentino was born at Vicenza, a town in the Veneto midway between Venice and
Verona.110 His birth year is surmised from the portrait published in his treatise L’antica musica
ridotta alla moderna prattica (1555), which states his age at the time of publication as fortyfour.111 Vicentino styled himself as “Don Nicola,” which suggests that he might have been a
priest. There are no records to indicate when Vicentino began his religious studies, nor are there
traces of his early clerical career.112 Ghiselin Danckerts confirms that Vicentino was a priest by
referring to him in his manuscripts as the chaplain (“capellano”) to Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este.113

108

Bozi’s sonnet begins as follows: “Lascin gl’Orsi li sdegni, e i fier Leoni / L’alta superba lor pongano, homai /
Cada al Lupo la rabbia, e i duri guai / Quivi habbian fine, e al devorar perdoni.” The bear and lion (“orso” and
“leone”) were symbols of the Gardano publishing firm. Bozi published at least four plays, a collection of poetry, and
several books of madrigals, of which only a five-voice collection and a six-voice collection survive, both labeled Il
secondo libro. Ricciardo Amadino, the same publisher as Tigrini’s treatise and two of his madrigal prints, published
several of Bozi’s prints.
109

Acelli only published known five madrigals during his lifetime, which appear in four Venetian collections.
Lincoln, “Acelli, Cesare” also suggests that Acelli was connected with Mantuan composers.

Vicentino likely began studies with Willaert at Venice during the 1530s. In the dedication to his
1546 print, Vicentino claims that he “spent some time with the divine Adrian Willaert,” which
Henry W. Kaufmann takes to mean that his studies concluded well before the print’s
publication.114 In 1549, Vicentino was granted a ten-year privilege from the Signory of Venice to
print his enharmonic and chromatic compositions. The opening of the privilege helps establish
some chronology: “He has given fifteen years to his studies of musical theory and practice and
with heavy labors and vigilance has restored to the world the practice of singing and playing the
two genera (long ago lost), namely the enharmonic and chromatic.”115 This again would suggest
that began his studies of the ancient Greek genera coincided with his studies with Willaert during
the mid-1530s.
Vicentino later began a lengthy and fruitful association with the Este court at Ferrara in
general, and with Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este (1509–1572) in particular. Many studies have
examined the Este family’s considerable and noted patronage of art and music.116 Willaert
himself had been in the service of Cardinal Ippolito I d’Este (1479–1520), son of Duke Ercole I
d’Este and brother of Isabella d’Este, from 1515 to 1520; Duke Alfonso I d’Este (1476–1534),
brother of Ippolito I, from 1520 to 1525; and Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este, son of Alfonso I, from
1525 to 1527.117 In all likelihood, Willaert helped Vicentino to secure the patronage of the Este
family.

Vicentino, despite serving the Ferrarese court at-large, only was in the private employ of
Ippolito II. In 1519 (at the age of ten), Ippolito was appointed the Archbishop of Milan; in 1538,
Pope Paul III installed him as a cardinal. Furthermore, Ippolito was papabile three times, upon
the deaths of Paul III (1549), Julius III (1555), Paul IV (1559). Although he failed to attain the
papal tiara, after his third attempt, Ippolito became a close confidante of Pius IV (r. 1559–1565)
and served as papal liaison to French court and to the Council of Trent. All of these ecclesiastical
activities entailed extensive travel, and Vicentino accompanied Ippolito on these trips between
Ferrara, Milan, and Rome. While at Ferrara, Vicentino entertained other members of the Este
court, including Ippolito’s elder brother Duke Ercole II (1508–1559) and Ercole’s son Alfonso II
(1533–1597). During this time, Vicentino fully fleshed out his system of composition based on
the ancient Greek genera. Vicentino gave demonstrations of his strange-sounding compositions
during several trips with Ippolito. According to Danckerts, during one such trip to Rome in
October 1549, a performance of Vicentino’s chromatic music fell apart. His embarrassment was
furthered by his requirement that everyone present swear not to reveal the secrets of his art. After
the demonstration went south, the audience allegedly mocked his request because it hardly
seemed a secret worth keeping, calling him a charlatan.118 By far, the event that shaped
Vicentino’s life the most was his debate at Rome in 1551 with Vicente Lusitano (summarized
above).
Throughout his professional career, Vicentino angled for new and better positions.
Vicentino’s career strategies are strikingly diverse, taking place through personal networks,
public dedications in print, and private petitions in letters. The 1546 madrigal print is dedicated

to Countess Lucretia Chiericati, a member of the Vicentine nobility. Jane A. Bernstein speculates
Lucretia was the wife of Count Girolamo Chiericati, whose sumptuous villa at Vicenza was
designed by the famed architect Andrea Palladio.119 The obsequious language of the dedication
reads as a plea for patronage, suggesting that Vicentino sought opportunities beyond the service
of Ippolito. Danckerts suggested similarly that the failed performance in 1549 was an audition
for the papal chapel, which would compound further Vicentino’s embarrassment over its
failure.120 Vicentino eventually returned to Vicenza as maestro di cappella at the cathedral there,
a position he held between 1563 and 1565. Vicentino’s motet print of 1571 is dedicated to Count
Lodovico Galerato, a nobleman in the duchy of Milan, who also was the dedicatee of a madrigal
print by the Milanese composer and organist Gioseppe Caimo, whose compositions also are
noted for their extreme chromaticism.121 The year prior, in 1570, Vicentino wrote to Wilhelm V,
Duke of Bavaria to request a position there. In the letter, Vicentino claimed to be rector of the
Chiesa di San Tomaso in Terramara at Milan; although he did receive a payment from the
Bavarian court shortly thereafter, a lasting relationship with the ducal court never materialized.122
The variety of career strategies that Vicentino employed is a theme explored throughout chapter
two, which considers the ways that authors of books about music leveraged printing technology
to achieve professional goals. I argue that the negative public reception of Vicentino’s theories

may have resulted from his failure to adapt sufficiently to the medium of print by presenting an
incoherent personal image in different publications.
The idiosyncratic numberings of his publications further indicate his awkward relation to
the printed medium. During his lifetime, Vicentino published five single-author works (table
A1.4). It has been suggested, on the basis of their titles, that many of Vicentino’s publications
have been lost or that formally-titled collections circulated in manuscript.123 Although it is likely
that some compositions have been lost, I suggest that this might be a misreading of his works’
titles. The 1546, 1571, and 1572 books of music are numbered respectively as first, fourth, and
fifth. (The 1555 treatise and 1561 broadside are not numbered in any way.) Vicentino’s
numberings are not connected explicitly to the genres or numbers of voices in the volumes.
Many sixteenth-century composers published multiple “first books”; for example, Tigrini

123

Kaufmann, The Life and Works of Nicola Vicentino, 96–99.

313

published both a first book of madrigals for four voices and a first book of madrigals for six
voices. In contrast, Vicentino’s enumerations might be divorced from the contents of his works:
“By a student of the unparalleled Adrian Willaert, Don Nicola Vicentino, madrigals for five
voices composed by theory and practice in the new manner discovered by his very celebrated
master: A first book.”124 I propose that Vicentino’s enumerations are absolute, like opus
numbers, not indications of a burgeoning or ongoing series, as is the case with most other
musicians. In this reading, L’antica musica and the Descrizione dell’arciorgano are the putative
libro secondo and libro terzo—which might suggest that less of Vicentino’s music has been lost
than previously believed.125
Vicentino was an avid reader of contemporary books about music, to judge from the
authorities referred to or paraphrased in L’antica musica (1555).126 Gaffurius, unsurprisingly,
was a significant influence, especially his De harmonia (1518), which helped to establish the
Renaissance preoccupation with ancient Greek music. Gaffurius’s Practica musicae also
informed Vicentino’s discussions of counterpoint and composition. Vicentino’s theories
regarding intonation and ancient music borrow heavily from distinguished two sources,
Lodovico Fogliano’s Musica theorica (Venice, 1529) and Heinrich Glarean’s Dodecachordon
(Basel, 1547). In contrast to Tigrini, Vicentino identifies very few of his contemporary

authorities by name, instead borrowing from them without any attribution or giving attributions
to “some authors” or “some people.” Vicentino thus follows what Frans Wiering argues was a
prevalent practice in interspersing original material among insights from unnamed
predecessors.127 Vicentino also withheld the names of authors whose works he mocked,
including Danckerts and Lusitano (see chapter two).
Vicentino more frequently cited by name classical and medieval authorities. Vicentino
mentions Boethius’s De institutione musica over a hundred times; it informs almost all of the last
two parts of L’antica musica. In a recent study, Grantley McDonald demonstrates that Vicentino
borrowed numerous ideas from the works of Plato, St. Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas.128
Henry W. Kaufmann has suggested that Vicentino was familiar with Gian Giorgio Trissino
(1478–1550), a humanist from the patrician family at Vicenza.129 Maria Rika Maniates has
argued that Trissino introduced Vicentino to a wide range of classical literature, especially the
works of Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, and Vitruvius.
Vicentino’s writing suggests a belief in the power of print to fix knowledge and to
establish truth. L’antica musica—a wide-ranging book touching on many different issues—reads
as a full-length response to the debate. Vicentino closes the prefatory letter to readers by
commending the book to their good graces:
Nothing else occurs to me, dearest readers, except to say that those of you who
wish to learn from me the practice and science of music and not of language
should pay close attention to the heart of my subject matter rather than to idle
chatter and trifles. If you do so, I hope you will reap from my labors no ordinary

harvest. Love me, then, and defend me against calumniators just as I, loving you,
did not shrink from all this hard work. Farewell.130
Such rhetorical gestures were commonplace in prefaces and letters of dedication, as Mary S.
Lewis has argued.131 In Vicentino’s case, however, the preface refers to very real antagonists,
and throughout the book Vicentino attempts to anticipate and counteract their attacks. Here he
dismisses their critiques as “idle chatter and trifles.” At the end of his account of the debate,
Vicentino reprints Lusitano’s example of consonances in the three genera.132 In the ensuing
commentary, Vicentino notes how Lusitano misunderstood the application of the genera to
modern music:
How it grieves me to have to show this example, so false in harmony! But I am
comforted by two reasons why no one may reprimand me: first, because it is
printed and I am not the first to make it public; and second, it permits everyone to
judge the erudition of the pretensions of some men.133
Vicentino’s sarcastic exclamation suggests that he relished catching Lusitano in error. Publishing
the critique in this way allowed Vicentino to avoid violating decorum; this exchange took place
in public for all to see and without any of the scandal that characterized the debate itself. Printing
technology thus allowed Vicentino to adjudicate the debate publicly and in a manner ideally
suited to the rich complexity of his theories.

Gioseffo Zarlino (c. 1517–1590)
Gioseffo Zarlino was born in 1517, probably during the month of January, at Chioggia, an island
in the south of the Venetian lagoon.134 He soon embarked a clerical career, receiving his first
tonsure in 1532. His early career was focused at Chioggia, where he took minor orders (1537)
and was ordained a deacon (1539). His musical career developed concurrently; he was appointed
as a singer at the Duomo at Chioggia (from 1536) and later became an organist there (from
1539). As a man with strong academic and musical interests, he naturally gravitated toward
Venice, a bustling hub of northern Italian cultural activities, where he move in 1541. Zarlino
appears to have been a student of Adrian Willaert, the maestro di cappella at the Basilica di San
Marco, with whom he claimed to study the entire art and science of music. At the same time,
Zarlino nurtured other related interests, studying philosophy, theology, mathematics, alchemy,
astronomy, Greek, and Hebrew under other notable Venetian scholars. His relationship with
Willaert probably was close, as he was the executor of Willaert’s estate and was deeded ten
ducats by his mentor.
Zarlino’s rise within the Venetian musical establishment was surprisingly rapid for the
native son of a region favorably disposed in previous decades to foreigners.135 In 1560 he

The most thorough biographical treatments of Zarlino are the following: Corwin, “Le istitutioni harmoniche of
Gioseffo Zarlino,” 3–33; Horn, “Zarlino, Gioseffo”; Palisca, “Zarlino, Gioseffo”; and Schiltz, “Gioseffo Zarlino and
the Miserere Tradition.” Caffi, Storia della musica sacra, 127–61 remains an important source, but contains
numerous errors and unverifiable assertions. In addition to those cited below, useful summaries and
contextualization of Zarlino’s works are given in Da Col, “The Tradition and Science”; Fend, Theorie des
Tonsystems; Haar, “Zarlino’s Definition of Fugue and Imitation”; Judd, introduction to Zarlino, Motets from 1549,

competed unsuccessfully for the position of maestro di cappella at the Basilica di Sant’Antonio
at Padua. Finally, in 1565 he was appointed to the post of his late teacher, maestro di cappella at
San Marco; the disastrous tenure of his predecessor, Cipriano de Rore, certainly was a
contributing factor in his appointment. In this capacity, he was called upon to compose music
celebrating the Venetian victory at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 and the consecration of the
Chiesa del Santissimo Redentore in 1577. He also directed the musical festivities for the state
visit of Henry III of France in 1574. Unfortunately, all of these occasional compositions are
believed to be lost. His dealings with the procurators of San Marco demonstrate that he was well
disposed to administrative work, receiving a fifty-ducat bonus in 1582 in recognition of his
outstanding contributions.136 This gesture also enticed Zarlino to remain at Venice when he was
offered the distinguished position of Bishop of Chioggia, which he respectfully declined.137
Books formed a central part of Zarlino’s life. His last will and testament indicated that he
possessed a library of some 1,144 volumes of printed books and one large manuscript volume
bound in parchment.138 Given that these figures reflect only the number of bound volumes, some
of which comprised several editions each, the sum total of the books he owned was likely much
larger.139 The known books owned by Zarlino are listed in table A1.5, which includes four new

copies that I have discovered.140 Two features of these books are of interest. First is their range
of topical variety—beyond the subject of music, Zarlino read the latest research on astronomy
(Copernicus); metaphysics and medicine (Fernel, the inventor of physiology); and physical
therapy (Mercuriale). Second is the general lack of annotations in his books; aside from a
signature on the title page, his surviving books contain very few manuscript additions. His own
writings attest that he was a careful reader of other works, suggesting that he possessed a good
memory or kept notes on the books that he read in a diary or commonplace book.
A broader picture of the books that Zarlino read emerges from those cited and discussed
in his own writings.141 Toward the end of part three of Le istitutioni harmoniche (1558), Zarlino
briefly narrates the history of music theory up to the present. He laments the lack of general
progress since Boethius and an idle obsession with subtleties of mensuration theories:
As regards theoretical or speculative music, few have taken the right path. Apart
from Boethius, who wrote in Latin about our science and whose work is also
imperfect, there has been no one who has gone beyond him into speculation on
things pertaining to music, discovering the true proportions of the intervals—
leaving aside the learned Franchinus [Gaffurius] and [Jacques] Lefèvre d’Étaples,
for one might call them commentators on Boethius—except Lodovico Fogliano of
Modena. He, having perhaps considered what Ptolemy left written on the syntonic
diatonic, took the pains to write a Latin book on the subject to demonstrate the
true proportions of the intervals involved. The other theorists, leaning on what
Boethius wrote on these matters, were unwilling or unable to go further, and

140
Judd, Reading Renaissance Music Theory, 182n lists three of these editions (as noted in the table). Following
Godt, “Italian Figurenlehre,” 192n, Judd reports that Zarlino’s copy of Julius Caesar Scaliger, Poetices libri septem
is held at I-Bu. I have examined the library’s two copies of this work: shelfmarks A.5.AA.3.3 (Lyon: Jean Crespin,
1561) and A.5.R.6.2 (Lyon: Antoine Vincent, 1561). Godt is correct that the latter belonged to Philippe de Monte,
but errs in attributing the former to Zarlino (there are no indications of early provenance in the volume). It appears
that the bulk of Zarlino’s library remained in Venice; I am in the process of identifying further books owned by
Zarlino from a very large accession to I-Vnm.

occupied themselves by writing of the things mentioned.142 These things, which
they said belonged to the quantitative genus, have to do with mood, time, and
prolation, as may be seen in the Recanetum de musica, the Toscanello, the
Scintille, and in a thousand other books like them.143 In addition there are on such
matters a diversity of opinions and lengthy disputations without end. There are
also many tracts and apologies, written by certain musicians against others,
which, were one to read them a thousand times, the reading, rereading, and study
would reveal nothing but vulgarities and slander rather than anything good, and
they would leave one appalled.144
Like other writers of the time, Zarlino tended not to identify his sources, whether by author name
or work title; only Boethius and Gaffurius merit repeated reference by name, and many of these
references are slights.145 The only other Renaissance music theorist mentioned by name in
Zarlino’s Istitutioni is Othmar Luscinius, whose Musurgia (1536) he invokes with reference to
ancient musical instruments.146 Aaron and Vanneo are referred to several times not by name but
by the titles of their works. Zarlino borrows from or invokes several writers of books about
music without mentioning either their names or the titles of their works; the most famous

142

“Things mentioned” refers to “so many dots, rests, colors, ciphers, signs, ratios, and other strange things”
pertaining to mensuration theory. Zarlino, The Art of Counterpoint, 265. “tanti Punti, tante Pause, tanti Colori, tanti
Cifere, tanti Segni, tanti Numeri contra numeri, et tante altre cose strane.” Zarlino, Istitutioni (1558), 279.

143

These are Vanneo, Recanetum (1533), Aaron, Toscanello (1523), and Lanfranco, Scintille di musica (1533).

si vedeno esser stati quelli, che habiano tenuto la buona strada: conciosiache, oltra quello, che scrisse Boetio in
lingua latina di tal scienza, che si trova anco essere imperfetto; non si trova alcuno (lassando il dotto Franchino, & il
Fabro stapulense da un canto, i quali sono stati, si può dire, commentator di Boetio) che habbia procedesto più oltra,
speculando intorno le cose appartenenti alla Musica, ritrovando le vere Proportioni de gli intervalli Musicali; da
Lodovico Fogliano Modenese in fuori; ilquale havendo forse considerato quello, che Tolomeo lassò scritto del
Diatonico sintono, si affaticò nel scrivere un volume latino in tal facultà; per mostrare con ogni verità le vere
Proportioni delli nominati intervalli. Il resto poi delli Musici Theorici, stando a quello, che scrisse Boetio intorno a
simili materie, non volsero, ò non potero passare più oltra: ma si diedero a scrivere le cose mostrate, le quali
chiamarono del genere Quantitativo, che sono contenute nel Modo, nel Tempo, & nella Prolatione; si come nel
Recaneto di musica, nel Thoscanello, nelle Scintille, & in mille altri libri simili si può vedere. Et di più si trovano
anco sopra tali materie varie opinioni, & disputationi longhissime, da non venire mai al fine. Si trovano etiandio
molti Trattati, & molte Apologie di alcuni Musici, scritti contra alcuni altri, ne i quali (se bene si leggessero mille
fiate) dopo letti, riletti, & essaminati, non si ritrova altro, che infinite villanie, & maledicentie, & poco di buono; di
maniera che è un stupore.” Zarlino, Istitutioni (1558), 279.

example is Zarlino’s adoption of Glarean’s twelve-mode system.147 Immediately following the
section quoted above is a chapter on the ancient Greek genera addressed to “some musicians
today who labor and take great pains to put them to use”—a clear reference to Nicola
Vicentino.148
Zarlino, unlike Glarean, seems to have viewed printed books as ideal vehicles for
learning and study. Writing about the intricacies of counterpoint, Zarlino recommends the works
of Willaert as models for imitation:
To be brief I shall stop at this point. One can see daily many compositions by the
most excellent Adrian Willaert which, in addition to being full of a thousand
beautiful and graceful inventions, are eruditely and elegantly composed. There are
innumerable others composed by other very excellent musicians, many of which
can be found in a booklet printed in octavo by Andrea Antico in Venice. Studying
those can be of much help in devising similar effects, and with their light anyone
can undertake larger and more difficult compositions creditably.149
The reference to seeing (“si veggono”) the compositions of Willaert, as opposed to merely
hearing them, implies Zarlino’s assessment of how print might be used. Iain Fenlon has drawn
attention to Zarlino’s ambitious program to print a series of masterworks of music theory under
the auspices of the Accademia Veneziana della Fama.150 This list included ancient Greek works

147

Palisca, Humanism, 298–301 summarizes Zarlino’s relationship with Glarean’s Dodecachordon, noting in
particular in the tension between their intellectual frameworks.

Zarlino, The Art of Counterpoint, 267. “alcuni Prattici molto si affaticano, & pongono ogni lor cura per volerli
porre in uso.” Zarlino, Istitutioni (1558), 280. Harrán, “New Light” further considers Zarlino’s complicated
relationship with Vicentino’s writings.

Zarlino, The Art of Counterpoint, 240 (adapted). “Ma per non esser lungo, faro fine; massimamente perche ogni
giorno si veggono molte altre compositioni, composte dallo Eccellentissimo Adriano Vuillaert, lequali, oltra che
sono piene di mille belle, & leggiadre inventioni; sono anche dottamente, & elegantemente composte. Infinite altre
etiandio ve ne sono, composte da altri Eccellentissimi Musici; delle quale molte se ne ritrovano in un libretto, ilquale
gia fù stampato in Vinegia da Andrea antico in ottavo foglio; lequali vedute, potranno esser di grande aiuto per
ritrovare altre simili invention: percioche da quelle, si haverà un tal lume, che ciascuno dipoi si potrà porre a
maggiori, & a più difficili imprese, & honorevoli.” Zarlino, Istitutioni (1558), 266. For the Antico print in relation to
Zarlino’s Istitutioni, see Judd, Reading Renaissance Music Theory, 242.

translation include Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples’s Musica libris quatuor demonstrata and Lodovico
Fogliano’s Musica theorica—the same works cited approvingly in Zarlino’s Istitutioni. Claude
V. Palisca has doubted Zarlino’s motivation to read and access to the surviving manuscript
sources of ancient and medieval music theory.151 Zarlino’s letters show, however, that his lack of
genuine humanistic credentials did not prevent him from seeking out copies of ancient sources.
Writing on 30 October 1579 to the humanist and bibliophile Gian Vincenzo Pinelli (1535–1601),
Zarlino replies to a query about the works of some unfamiliar authors:
Of the authors that Glarean cites, I have seen only the Guido, which I send to
Your Excellency although it is imperfect, and which will serve your convenience.
I saw likewise the Odo; the other I have not seen. The Odo has slipped my grasp,
having been taken by untrustworthy people. But none of these have been printed;
all are written by hand. That which I send to Your Excellency is the Introduttorio
by Guido, truly both incorrect and incomplete, from what I recall seeing in other
exemplars, especially with regard to the poem that begins Gliscunt corda meis
hominum mollita camoenis—which is very long and contains everything
belonging to the art of music of its time.152
For Zarlino, manuscripts hid knowledge by virtue of their scarcity and often-partial survival.
Zarlino’s program to publish books about music and his efforts to track down sources for his
correspondents suggest furthermore that he might have viewed printed books as a remedy to the
inaccessibility of manuscripts.

“Degli autori che cita il Glareano ho veduto solamente Guidone, il quale mando a V. S. anchora che sia
imperfetto: del quale se ne servirà a suo comodo: et vidi anco Ottone; l’altro non l’ho veduto. Et l’Ottone mi scappò
dalle mani per haver havuto a fare con persone di poca fede: ma niuno di questi si truova a stampa; tutti sono scritti a
mano. Questo ch’io mando a V. S. è l’introduttorio di Guidone veramente et scoretto et imperfetto: per quello ch’io
mi ricordo haver veduto negli altri esemplari: et specialmente in quella sua canzone che incomincia Gliscunt corda
meis hominum mollita camoenis: la qual si trova esser lunghissima, et contiene tutta l’arte della musica de’ suoi
tempi.” Caffi, Storia della musica sacra, 160–61. Further on Zarlino’s correspondence with Pinelli, see Farina,
“Gerolamo Mei e Gioseffo Zarlino”; and Sanvito, “Le sperimentazioni nelle scienze.”

Zarlino’s own publications are remarkably diverse (table A1.6). In addition to his familiar
trilogy of books about music—the Istitutioni harmoniche (1558), Dimostrationi harmoniche
(1571), and Sopplimenti musicali (1588)—Zarlino published books on chronology, the growth of
religious orders, and calendric reform. In chapters two and three, I examine at length Zarlino’s

324

relationship to print culture, showing how he adapted only gradually to the medium of print
through a partnership with the Venetian printer and publisher Francesco de’ Franceschi Senese.
Cristle Collins Judd draws an essential contrast between Glarean’s Dodecachordon and Zarlino’s
Istitutioni correlated to their “strongly differentiated relationships to notated music.”153 In closing
this discussion, I propose that the differences in their treatises also relate to their opposing
perspectives on and experience with printed books. Glarean approached printed books cautious
of their corrupting influence, whereas Zarlino embraced their potential to disseminate
knowledge. Glarean’s books were the end-results of an intellectual thought process, whereas
Zarlino’s reflect an ongoing process of intellectual gestation carried out through several editions.
The previous chapters have focused primarily on books about music themselves,
examining their material forms and social contexts. This appendix has offered a complementary
approach focused on the authors of such books, examining their interactions with print culture as
authors, publishers, and readers. The contrasting approaches of Glarean and Zarlino provide an
especially vivid illustration of how the richly-variegated culture of books both shaped and was
shaped by the approaches and attitudes of representative authors of Renaissance books about
music. Likewise, Danckerts, Gaffurius, Lusitano, Tigrini, and Vicentino maintained distinctive
professional profiles that enrich purely materialistic or bibliographical analyses of their works.

APPENDIX TWO: THE DISSEMINATION OF
MUSIC THEORY IN PRINT

This appendix shows the chronological and geographical dissemination of music theory in print
during the Renaissance. The following table encompasses all the printed books that touch at least
partly on the subject of music from the period 1474 to 1609. By reading the rows, one sees how
many works were printed during any given five-year interval and where. By reading the
columns, one sees how many works were printed in any given city and when. Accounted for in
my data are printed books about the theory, practice, and history of music, as well as substantive
sections dealing with aesthetics, criticism, or introductions to music in larger books about other
subjects.1 My starting points for this appendix were the enumerative bibliographies given in
RISM (series B/VI, Écrits imprimés concernant la musique) and Davidsson, Bibliographie der
musiktheoretischen Drucken des 16. Jahrhunderts. While Davidsson’s bibliography accounts
more accurately for the total number of editions of the smaller group of works it lists, RISM has
a more comprehensive scope, including encyclopedias, and books on theater, liturgy, and
acoustics. I have attempted to maintain the accuracy of Davidsson within the broader scope of
RISM. Toward this end, I have attempted to verify the accuracy of each of the entries in these
bibliographies and provided additional entries absent in both sources from my own research. I
am in the process of adapting this dataset into a searchable online database that will facilitate the
kind of statistical analysis presented in chapter one.

1

I also follow RISM in excluding the following categories from consideration: regulations of musical organizations;
legal documents; catalogs and bibliographies; concert notices, programs, and reviews; reference works with few
entries on music; travelogues and guidebooks; fictional works; works in non-European languages; and primers on
musical technique that consist mostly of exercises. By “books,” I understand the more traditional codices and
broadsides, although coverage of the latter is spotty in many bibliographies. In this appendix, I do not include
editions for which it has not been possible to ascertain a place or date of publication.

APPENDIX THREE: EARLY OWNERS,
READERS, AND REFERENCES

This appendix presents a broad sample of the dissemination of music theory during the
Renaissance by means of individual exemplars and early references to readers. This appendix
includes books about music published between c. 1480 and 1610, a period that witnessed a
dramatic transformation in approaches to writing about music. I aim to show that these textual
changes also were manifested in readership; as new kinds of books and writings emerged, so did
new audiences. Evidence concerning the ownership and readership of copies comes primarily
from three sources: (1) provenance records in library catalogs; (2) scholarly accounts of
individual libraries; and (3) my own survey of exemplars in several major repositories. Each of
these kinds of sources offers an incomplete glimpse of the field of book ownership and
readership. Few libraries, despite the persistent nagging of scholars, include provenance records
in their catalogs; many such records are incomplete or uneven and require additional verification.
Scholarly accounts of individual libraries tend to focus on the largest and most noteworthy
collections, which also suffer from poor survival rates and the vagaries of historical cataloging
practices. Lastly, any survey of copies in the present, no matter how thorough, can assess only
extant copies, which typically reflect a minority of those sold and used in the period immediately
following publication. Therefore, any such accounting can never be complete or even exhaustive;
I welcome further contributions and corrections from my own readers. I intend this appendix as
an initial contribution toward the broader study of reading about music during the Renaissance.
Supplemental sources about readership come from individual testimonies about these
books. Such testimonies take the form of early bibliographies, booklists, and inventories; auction
catalogs; commentaries or extended references to books inside other books; and other historical

335

documents that suggest that a certain individual read or owned a particular book. Of these, I have
elected to focus most heavily on references before around 1800 and on catalogs of the largest and
most significant collections. Naturally, all of these sources of information should be subjected to
careful scrutiny. Note also that I only refer to direct testimony within a book that its author knew
or read another book. This means that instances of borrowing and what now we might call
plagiarism are not included—thus, for example, Morley does not appear as a reader of Tigrini’s
Compendio. I include all of these supplemental sources as a way of rounding out the picture of
the dissemination of books about music throughout the centuries, especially in light of their high
rate of attrition. Toward this end, I present provenance histories as fully as possible, noting all
known readers regardless of when they owned their books. I note anonymous readers (i.e., those
who left no inscription) only where some details may provide clues to their identity in the future
(e.g., distinctive stamp, motto, inscription, etc.).
The entries are arranged alphabetically by author and title, then chronologically. In the
interest of space, only the author’s last name, short title, year of publication, and bibliographical
format are given (e.g., Ornitoparchus, Micrologus (1519), 4º upright); full facts of publication
are given in the bibliography. Each entry is divided into two sections: (1) a list of surviving
exemplars, indicated by RISM sigla and shelfmark, and their corresponding verifiable owners;
and (2) a list of other known readers whose books remain as-yet undiscovered; several entries
contain only this latter section, as surviving copies are scarce. Readers listed as “other” are
grouped together under the earliest edition of the book listed, except where a specific edition
other than the first is identified.

336

Key to abbreviated references
For the sake of brevity, I have abbreviated references to certain owners, collectors, and libraries
that possessed more than a few books about music. The following key provides brief
biographical sketches of these collectors and citations to the sources in which their libraries are
cataloged.
Pietro Aaron

Italian music theorist and composer (c. 1480–after 1545). Many of
his works contain references to Renaissance books about music.
The most numerous are references to his own works; identified
below are references to books by other authors. I cite only the first
or most extensive references within each work.

St. Anna-Kirche

Protestant church at Augsburg, patronized during the 16th cent. by
the Fugger family. In 1470, the Carmelites founded a singing
school (the Kantorei) at the church, which amassed a large
collection of books of and about music. From 1620 until his death,
Adam Gumpelzhaimer (1559–1625, cantor at the Cathedral of
Augsburg from 1581) drew up an inventory of the library of the
Kantorei. Page references are to Schaal, “Das Inventar der
Kantorei St. Anna in Augsburg.” Where possible, I have provided
Gumpelzhaimer’s appraisals of each volume, given in the form
Florin/Kreuzer.

Giovanni Maria Artusi

Italian composer and music theorist (c. 1540–1613). Page
references are to his treatise L’Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni
della moderna musica (1600), which contains numerous references
to Renaissance books about music. I cite only the first or most
extensive references; identifications that have involved guesswork
are flagged as “likely.”

Paul Bolduan

Pastor and bibliographer at Pomerania in Prussia (fl. 17th cent.),
who published a three-volume universal bibliography that includes
a substantial section on music (vol. 2, Bibliotheca philosophica,
1616). Page references are to Krummel, Bibliotheca Bolduaniana,
which includes useful cross-references to contemporary booklists
made at the Frankfurt Book Fair, indicating that Bolduan
purchased or saw these books there.

Pierre-Jean Burette

French physician, scholar, and amateur musician (1655–1747); son
of composer and harpsichordist Claude Burette (fl. late 17th cent.).
Possessed a large library of books on mathematics and science.
Page references are to Catalogue de la bibliothèque de feu M.
Burette.

337

Charles Burney

English music historian and composer working at London (1726–
1814). Page references are to Burney, A General History of Music,
vol. 3.

Pietro Cerone

Italian priest and music theorist working at Naples and Spain
(1566–1625). The second part of his treatise El melopeo y maestro
(1613)—like those of Lanfranco, Morley, and Tigrini—ends with a
list of notable writers on music that presents a comprehensive
retrospective of Renaissance musical thought (pp. 335–336).
Cerone’s list includes mostly authors’ names; only a few works are
specified. Identifications that have involved guesswork are flagged
as “likely.”

Alfred Cortot

French pianist, conductor, and bibliophile (1877–1962). His library
included a significant collection of Renaissance books about
music, many of which were purchased at auction by or donated to
US-Cn during the 1960s and 1970s. Page references are to
Goldbeck, Bibliothéque Alfred Cortot.

Edmond de Coussemaker

French musicologist and jurist (1805–1876). Owned a sizeable
collection of music books of all kinds, auctioned over four days in
iv.1877. Page references are to Catalogue de la bibliothèque et des
instruments de musique de feu M. Ch. Edm. H. de Coussemaker.

Antonfrancesco Doni

Florentine poligrafo living at Venice (1513–1574). Books cited are
listed in his booklists, La libraria (1540) and La seconda libraria
(1551). Both are revised posthumously in La libraria (1580).
Further on Doni’s booklists, see chapter four.

Giusto Fontanini

Italian cleric, historian, and Archbishop of Ankara (1666–1736).
Page references are to Zeno, Biblioteca dell’eloquenza italiana di
Monsignore Giusto Fontanini (1804); this edition records
appraisals for each volume. Apostolo Zeno includes notes, some
extensive, on most of the items in Fontanini’s library, and should
thus be understood to accompany Fontanini as a reader; additional
testimony about Zeno’s readership is noted where relevant.

Vincenzo Galilei

Florentine composer and music theorist (1520–1591). Page
references, except where noted otherwise, are to Galilei, Dialogo
della musica antica et della moderna (1581), which mentions
several other books about music. I cite only the first or most
extensive references.

Conrad Gesner

Swiss humanist and bibliographer (1516–1565). Gesner compiled
three large bibliographies in hopes of cataloging every known
book: Bibliotheca universalis (1545), Pandectae sive partitionum
universalium libri xix (1548), and Appendix bibliothecae Conradi

338

Gesneri (1555). Page references are to the list of books cited by
Gesner in L. Bernstein, “The Bibliography of Music in Conrad
Gesner’s Pandectae (1548).”
John IV of Portugal

King of Portugal (1604–1656). Possessor of one of the largest
monarchal libraries of the seventeenth century, destroyed in a
major earthquake that devastated the city of Lisbon in 1755. Page
references are to Primeira parte do index da livraria del música de
el-rei João IV.

Horace de Landau

French baron born at Budapest, banker, and bibliophile (1824–
1903). Established a villa at Florence with a notable library, largely
purchased in 1866 from his employer, the French banker James de
Rothschild (1792–1868). Upon his death, the library passed first to
his niece Eugenia Ellenberger-Finaly (1850–1938) and then to his
great-nephew Horace Finaly (1871–1945). Upon the latter’s death,
the collection was sold at auction by Sotheby’s (London) on
17.ix.1949. Page references are to Roediger, Catalogue des livres,
manuscrits et imprimés composant la bibliothèque de M. Horace
de Landau.

Giovanni Maria Lanfranco

Italian composer and music theorist (c. 1490–1545). Served as
maestro di cappella in the cathedrals at Brescia (1536–1540) and
Parma (1540–1545). His treatise Scintille di musica (1533)
includes a list of noteworthy authors of books about music whose
theories he adopts (sig. π3v). Lanfranco’s list includes only names
of authors, although Lee, Giovanni Maria Lanfranco’s “Scintille di
musica” identifies his precise sources throughout the book.

Thomas Morley

English composer and music theorist (1557–1602). Appended to
Morley’s A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke
(1597) is a list of “authors whose authorities be either cited or used
in this book such as have written of the art of music” (sig. 3χ4v)
Morley’s list includes only authors’ names. Although the body of
the book occasionally gives book-titles, most of the specific works
identified below are speculative.

Antonio Possevino

Jesuit priest, papal diplomat, and encyclopedist born at Mantua
(1533–1611). After retiring from diplomacy, Possevino set to work
compiling a universal bibliography of works in line with Jesuit
orthodoxy. The work includes a long list of “Auctores qui scripsere
de Musica Practica, & Speculativa,” which mentions names of
authors and only a few titles. In some cases it is possible to deduce
the book that Possevino had in mind (e.g., Lusitano); other cases
involve some guesswork (e.g., Gaffurius), flagged in the entries
below as “likely.” All references are to Possevino, Bibliotheca
selecta (1593).

339

Sacred Harmonic Society

Amateur choral society at London (active 1832–1882). Possessed a
large library of ancient and modern books of and about music,
administered by the Society’s librarian, William Henry Husk
(1814–1887). Page references are to Husk, Catalogue of the
Library of the Sacred Harmonic Society; and Husk, Supplement to
the Catalogue of the Sacred Harmonic Society.

Francisco de Salinas

Spanish music theorist and organist (1513–1590). Page references
are to lengthy and relevant discussions of earlier and contemporary
writers in his treatise De musica libri septem (1577).

Thomas Selle

German composer and music director for the city of Hamburg
(1599–1663). Possessed a large library of books of and about
music. Page references are to the scholarly edition of the Selle’s
library catalog: Neubacher, Die Musikbibliothek des hamburger
Kantors und Musikdirektors Thomas Selle (1599–1663).

Oratio Tigrini

Italian composer and music theorist working at Arezzo (1541–
1591). His treatise Il compendio della musica (1588) cites a wide
range of contemporary writers on music, giving marginal
references to 73 works by 51 authors, often to specific pages or
chapters. Tigrini also gives a list of authors on sig. π4r–π4v that is
of immense value for studying the dissemination of music theory
in print during the late sixteenth century.

J. G. von Werdenstein

Johann Georg von Werdenstein (1542–1608). Canon of Augsburg
and bibliophile. Sold his very large collection of books in 1592 to
Wilhelm V of Bavaria (1548–1626) for 6,000 florins, which
became a central accession for the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek at
Munich. Page references are to Charteris, Johann Georg von
Werdenstein.

Werner Wolffheim

German musicologist and book collector (1877–1930). Amassed a
very large collection of books and manuscripts of and about music,
which was sold at auction by Martin Breslauer and Leo
Liepmannssohn (Berlin) over the course of a week (11–
16.vi.1928). Page references are to Versteigerung der
Musikbibliothek des Herrn Dr. Werner Wolffheim, both volumes of
which begin with estimates of each item auctioned.

Gioseffo Zarlino

Italian composer and music theorist (c. 1517–1590). Although
Zarlino seems to have used a wide range of sources in composing
his own books. Identified below are the handful of books that
Zarlino cites by author or title. I cite only the first or most
extensive references within each work.
