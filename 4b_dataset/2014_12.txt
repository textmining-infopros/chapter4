ABSTRACT
The advent of Information Communication & Technology (ICT) has resulted into a
revolution in the ways of production, dissemination, preservation and accessibility of
information. Traditional librarianship has opened its doors and embraced ICT to
enhance and improve the quality and quantity of services provided by libraries.
Libraries have expanded their scope to Library & Information Centres. With the
changing trends of libraries, the users have also moved to advanced stages of
accessing the information.
Theses and dissertations are one of the major sources of authentic in-depth
information on a particular topic on which a researcher conducts extensive research
work. In spite of being a main source of scholarly communication, the print theses and
dissertations is mostly not accessible to outside world. In this way, the important
information remains unused and unknown to users. The Electronic format of the
theses and dissertations makes it possible for the information content to be used by
information seekers.
„Open Access‟ is a boon for the users who strive for information. Policy Guidelines
framed by National and International Organizations like UNESCO, BOAI, Berlin
Declaration, ECHO Charter, Bethesda Statement, Salvador Declaration, National
Open Access Policy and National Knowledge Commission‟s Report on Open Access
(India) have promoted the benefits of open access for researchers, organizations,
public and funding organizations.
Institutional repositories provide access to various institutional documents through
open access. The type of contents vary from books, journals, conference proceedings,
theses, dissertations, newspaper clippings, datasets, manuscripts, software, lectures,
learning objects, maps, pre-prints, post-prints, research reports, audio-visual material
etc.
The present research work deals with the Electronic Thesis Repositories which are a
major form of grey literature of any organization. There are various benefits of ETDs
xv

like they help in increasing the citation count of the author and the institution,
minimum time required for dissemination of scholarly information, various file
formats can be incorporated in the electronic form which is not possible in the print
theses and dissertations and they provide a solution of long term preservation of
theses and dissertations. In spite of the benefits of ETDs, authors hesitate in
depositing their research work in electronic format mainly due to fear of plagiarism.
There are various concepts in the whole process of setting up of an ETD Program.
The present research work aims to study the various concepts of ETDs by analyzing
the E-thesis Repositories in the world and collecting data from the Repository
administrators through Web Questionnaire. The fourteen research objectives are
divided into nine sections of Background Information of E-thesis Repository;
Repository Materials; Hardware & Software;Ways of Providing Access to ETDs;
Budget & Human Resource; Metadata & Interoperability Standards; Preservation
Policies; Copyright Issues;Language Compatibility, Linkages with various National
and International ETD Projects & Currency of Information.
The Review of Literature was conducted exhaustively using various keywords
belonging to the area of research from print and non-print sources of information. The
major trend observed in the international literature emphasized on importance of
ETDs in academic libraries, world wide open access initiatives, overview of country
specific ETD Projects, copyright and preservation issues related to ETDs, selection of
software and Policy Guidelines framed by international organizations. Trend observed
in ETD literature published in India highlight on contribution of UGC, NKC and
INFLIBNET towards Open Access and ETDs, selection of software, copyright and
IPR issues, developments in open access initiative in India and development of ETD
projects in various institutions across India.
List of E-thesis Repositories was prepared using Registry of Open Access
Repositories (ROAR) and Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR).
Only those E-thesis repositories were considered whose interface was in English and
which contained English language theses and dissertations. Out of total population of
258 repositories in English Language, 154 were finalized using Krejcie & Morgan
Table for Determining Sample Size. The selected repositories belonged to 43
xvi

countries and had more than 1000 ETDs in their repositories. The Repository
Administrators of these repositories were mailed the Web Questionnaire Link through
e-mail for data collection. The Web Survey Questionnaire was developed using
SurveyMonkey Web Questionnaire Tool.
NDLTDs support and promotion of the present research work helped the researcher to
get a good response rate of 62.33% from across the world. The USA and UK ranked
highest in the list of respondents. The researcher received overwhelming response
from various developing countries also. This proved that Open Access Movement is
gaining momentum not only in developed countries like the USA and UK but also in
several developing countries.
The findings are presented in Chapter 6 with objective wise conclusion and
suggestions. Some major recommendations are:
1) Institutions prefer pilot testing stage before final implementation in order to
understand and rectify any problems related to uploading of data, software related
problems and choice of most appropriate user friendly repository software.
2) All institutions should motivate their researchers to contribute their work in the
repository and wherever required there should be a mandatory policy for
deposition of research work in electronic format.
3) Benefits of ETD submission should be promoted in order to encourage the
institutes in setting up ETD only repository.
4) Institutions must make the choice of appropriate open source software depending
on their requirements. Thorough study of available documentation should be
referred for getting a complete overview of facilities provided by the software.
5) All E-theses repositories must employ at least basic method of monitoring usage of
items deposited in the repository.
6) State/ Central Governments must make policy guidelines to promote open access,
building of institutional repositories and a central pool of research work should be
built which will help to promote ETD submission in controlled budgetary
provision.
7) Metadata being the most important part of submission of research work in
repository must be prepared by Librarian or at least library staff members since
metadata creation needs accuracy, completeness and should be accessible easily.
xvii

8) Repositories must have well defined policies for preservation, withdrawal and
copyright of items deposited in electronic format.
9) Measures should be adopted for protection and copyright and institutes should
provide full-text access to ETDs without any restriction.
The researcher in the concluding part has suggested some topics related to ETDs in
which research can be conducted.
The present trend of growth and development of E-thesis repositories assure that there
is a promising future of the concept and open access will spread its wings in more and
more countries across the world.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction:
The present age of information has changed the traditional library concept.
Nowadays, the concepts of digital library, electronic library are being popularized.
Application and development of Information Communication and Technology
(ICT) brought a revolution in collection and services provided by libraries. The
knowledge that was traditionally kept closed in a book, journal, conference
proceedings, research reports, thesis or dissertation etc. has now got an
opportunity to break the barriers and reach out to maximum users in minimum
time. „Open Access‟ has expedited the process of dissemination of information to
anyone, anytime and anywhere.
The Open Access movement led to development of Institutional Repositories that
emerged as a new strategy in 2002. The leadership of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) in the development and deployment of the DSpace
institutional repository system http://www.dspace.org/, created in collaboration
with the Hewlett Packard Corporation, has been a model pointing the way forward
for many other universities.
Information explosion, lack of library budget, space problem, high information
demand, increasing subscription amount of journals, have forced the libraries to
seek different ways by which one can collect, store and disseminate information
among the users. To solve such problems, the concept of Institutional Repositories
is developed among the academic institutions all over the world. Institutional
repositories contain digitized assets of the institute like books, journals,
conference proceedings, theses and dissertations, research reports, datasets,
newspaper clippings, datasets etc.

Page 1

The Open Access movement which started with Budapest Open Access Initiative
(BOAI) in 2002 has now spread its wings to almost all developed and developing
countries with several National and International Organizations framing Policy
Guidelines for development of open access.

1.1.1 Definition of Institutional Repository:
According to Clifford Lynch “a university based institutional repository is a set
of services that a university offers to the members of its community for the
management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and
its community members. It is most essentially an organizational commitment to
the stewardship of these digital materials, including long term preservation where
appropriate as well as organization and access or distribution.” 1
Institutional repositories may be made accessible to users locally or globally with
or without restrictions. These repositories contain pre-prints/ post-prints of
research articles, research reports, conference papers, teaching materials, project
reports, doctoral theses and dissertations, datasets resulting from research
projects, committee papers, computer software, works of art, photographs, audio/
video recordings, patents, standards etc. The IR may cover content of which
copyright is owned by the workforce or the institution or for which permission
has been obtained from the publisher to include a copy of the content in the
repository. The content of the IR is institutionally bounded, scholarly in nature,
cumulative in growth and perpetual in access.

1.1.2 Need for Institutional RepositoryInstitutional repository is essential for any organization because of the following
reasons1. Technological changes.
2. Significant increase in the overall volume of research.
3. Increasing need of archival and access to unpublished information bearing
objects.
Page 2

4. Increasing demand to access knowledge objects from anywhere at any time.
5. Increase in uncertainty over who will handle the preservation archiving of
digital scholarly research materials.

1.1.3 Benefits of Institutional RepositoryKamila (2009)2 and Thorat & Patil (2011)3 have identified the benefits of
institutional repositories for the user, for the contributor who contributes his/her
documents to the repository, for the organization whose faculty members deposit
their research work and benefits from library, teaching and learning point of
views.
A) For the user


Easy access, best quality material in original digital format for the users.



Gray literature, material not easily found through conventional means, will
be actively recruited for the repository. This can include material such as
working papers, pre-prints, white papers, conference presentations.

B) For the contributor


Greater citation, digital platform to publish publications, preservation of
the publications in digital form, easy to reuse.

C) For the Organization


The scholarly material produced by the university is available in one place,
reflecting the intellectual achievements of the institution, and serving as a
valuable marketing tool.



Documents reflecting the institutional history of the university, both
scholarly and non-scholarly, are preserved for future use, much like a
traditional archive preserves paper material.



Material that is not traditionally published is included in the repository,
including drafts of unpublished articles or book chapters, unpublished
research, student works, learning objects, and creative works.

Page 3

D) Other Benefits


Increased visibility to the Library



Responsiveness to local user needs and preferences



Showcase and preserve scholarly output and historic documents



Support teaching and learning



Provide curatorial stewardship for disorganized and scattered digital
materials

An institutional repository contains various documents like books, journals,
conference proceedings, research reports, datasets, electronic theses and
dissertations, software, newspaper clippings etc. It is built using open source
digital repository software like DSpace, EPrints, Greenstone, Fedora etc.
Although, there are lot many benefits of depositing research reports/work to
repository but due to barriers like copyright infringement, lack of awareness,
absence of mandatory policies of deposition of documents in institutional
repositories, faculty members/students are still reluctant to contribute to the
repository. Repository Administrators face a difficult time in promoting the
benefits of repositories, how they help in increasing the citation count of the
individual researcher as well as the institution etc.
For implementation of a repository, the institution needs to perform pilot testing
of software to be used for building the repository and then finalize the most
suitable and user-friendly one depending on various parameters. Trained staff is
required for successful implementation and operation of the repository.
Along with other pre-requisites, the institutional repository must have well framed
preservation policy in order to preserve the digitized documents, withdrawal
policy including the rules for withdrawing items from the repository and copyright
policies that inform the researcher/author about his/ her rights after submitting the
documents to the repository.

1.2 Significance of the present study:
In the age of information explosion, information gets scattered and is available in
various forms. Theses and dissertations are a type of grey literature and the
research results produced, remain limited only to the researcher and the
department/ university to which the theses or dissertation is submitted. They are
one of the forms of primary sources of information which contain detailed,
sometimes unexplored information about a particular concept. When the thesis or
dissertation is submitted in print format, it becomes difficult for the information
contained in it to become accessible and disseminated to outsiders/users
throughout the world. In this way, the valuable information of the thesis or
dissertation mostly remains unnoticed or unused by anyone.
Many times the user remains unknown about the required information because of
lack of resources. Due to increasing rates of subscription of print and non-print
journals, escalating prices of books, databases etc. users are depending on quality
resources which are available through open access via World Wide Web.
The emergence of Institutional Repositories works as a boon for such users. Also,
for the individual institute/ university it becomes the best way in which institutes
can digitize the scholarly publication of their faculty members. These repositories
contain pre-prints/ post-prints of research articles, research reports, conference
papers, teaching materials, project reports, doctoral theses and dissertations,
datasets resulting from research projects, committee papers, computer software,
works of art, photographs, audio/ video recordings, patents, standards etc.
E-Theses & Dissertations provide a technologically advanced medium with
endless multimedia capabilities that far exceed the print and bound copies of
theses and dissertations housed traditionally in individual university libraries. A
worldwide repository of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) could provide
worldwide access to the most up-to-date research generated by masters and
doctoral students. E-theses repositories is one of the most important types since it
enables the user to know the variety of research topics in which research has been
Page 5

conducted all over the world. Till date (i.e.30.7.2014) 284 E-thesis repositories are
registered in Registry of Open Access Repository (ROAR)4 and 1477 E-thesis
Repositories in Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR)5. With the
presence of a huge collection like this, it becomes important to analyze these
repositories according to


country of origin and subject(s) covered



barriers faced while building the E-thesis repositories



documents covered other than ETDs



Software and hardware requirements, file formats included



Copyright and preservation issues



Metadata and interoperability standards



Budget and Human Resource required



accessibility issues



time period covered & currency of information



user opinion



language

The present research work is important and will be useful for users/information
seekers who want detailed information about various aspects of ETDs and Ethesis Repositories. With the help of the web questionnaire tool, researcher will
be able to get first-hand information from the repository administrators‟ right
from the initial stages of implementation of E-theses repository to the final stage
of self-evaluation of the functioning of repository.

1.3 Statement of Problem:
E-thesis or Electronic Theses and Dissertation (ETD) are digitized format of the
print theses or dissertation.Yiotis6 mentioned theses including dissertations as
„cherished academic genre‟ of literature for universities holding them. Digital
Access to Research Thesis-Europe (DART-Europe)7 defines Electronic theses and
dissertations mentioning the different forms that it may take-

Page 6



It may be an electronic version of a recently produced printed thesis. A typical
example would be a text-based piece of work produced in Word and converted
into PDF.



It may be a text-based thesis produced some time ago that has been scanned
and converted into PDF.



It may be a digital thesis that includes audio or visual material and it may not
even be designed to be read in a traditional linear format. A thesis of this type,
which incorporates multimedia as an integral part of the work, may not have a
paper equivalent.



It may be a publication-based thesis which includes only a limited amount of
text followed by the bibliographic details of the associated publications
(including links to electronic versions of the relevant journal articles etc).

While browsing the literature available on open access and institutional
repositories, the researcher found that not much research has been done on
electronic theses and dissertations. The literature discussed mostly about open
access journals or institutional repositories in general. The available literature on
ETDs is scattered and there is not an exhaustive source to provide information on
ETDs right from their initial stages of inception till the last stage of evaluation and
enhancing the ETD Program. Since, thesis and dissertation is one of the most
important types of grey literature and there was not a single doctoral research
work found exclusively on this theme, therefore the researcher was motivated to
undertake the study of ‘E-thesis Repositories in the World: A Critical
Analysis’ which will provide authentic information from repository administrators
of E-thesis Repositories across the world. Also, the work could result into a
comprehensive source of ETD and its related concepts.

1.4 Aims & Objectives of the present study:
The researcher aims to make the present research work a comprehensive source of
information covering various aspects of ETD. The research discusses the concept
of ETD right from its origin till present status at a global level. The aims and
objectives of the present study are divided into various sections according to the

1.5

Hypotheses:
1. The maximum number of E-theses repositories in the world is created by the
Institutes and Universities of developed countries due to presence of
information resources, finance, good infrastructure, research facilities,
Information Technology development etc. E.g. United States of America,
United Kingdom etc. (Proved in Chapter 5, Q.1d)
2. Maximum number of E-theses repositories is devoted to scientific disciplines
compared to social sciences because of majority of research conducted in the
stream. (Proved in Chapter 5, Q.1c)
3. Open Access Repositories are on a rise compared to Subscription based due to
popular demand of Open Access by research community. (Proved in Chapter
5, Q 21)

Page 9

4. DSpace is the most widely used open source software package for building
institutional repositories. (Proved in Chapter 5, Q 17)

1.6 Scope & Limitations:
The present study provides context to growth, development and management of Etheses repositories in the world covered by The Registry of Open Access
Repositories (ROAR) and Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR).
According to ROAR, the first e-theses repository was developed in 1993
(Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertacoes) and the most recent one, MyTO
Portal (Malaysian Theses Online) in 19th June 2014.
Both ROAR and OpenDOAR do not completely represent open access initiatives
as they depend on voluntary registration. ROAR also includes archives in testing
or development phase which may not be openly accessible. While ROAR can
provide a graphical representation of the cumulative growth of records in Indian
open access archives over the last few years, OpenDOAR has subject and content
type classification potentially useful to librarians.
Some of these were under development or in testing phase and not yet registered
with ROAR or OpenDOAR. Others are on intranets and not yet openly accessible.
Limitation of the present study:
The researcher will be considering only those E-thesis repositories whose
interface is in English Language and which contain E-theses in English language.
Other foreign language E-thesis repositories are not covered for the research
study.

Page 10

1.7 Research Methodology:
Research methodology consists of various procedural steps such as identification
of appropriate research method, tools and techniques for data collection and
analyzing the collected data.
For the present research, the list of E-thesis repositories available in the world was
prepared from Registry of Open Access Repository (ROAR) and Directory of
Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR). Search was also conducted in various
search engines especially Google using search statements like „E-thesis
repositories‟, „ETD repositories‟, „ETD Repository Directory‟. Some sites also
provided links to other E-thesis repositories in the same country as well as World
ETDs. Such URL were visited and checked by the researcher before inclusion in
the research study. Various print and non print-articles, conference proceedings,
books also helped the researcher to identify few E-theses repository.
The final list of repositories was prepared after checking and deleting the
duplicate entries of the e-theses repositories retrieved from various searches. Only
such repositories were included in the list whose website was active and which
had no broken links. Some of the repositories were found to have shifted from
their registered URL in ROAR or OpenDOAR.
The total number of e-theses repositories across the world retrieved till 1st
February 2013 is 584, out of which 258 were having their interface in English
language and consist of E-theses in English language. The final sample of E-thesis
repositories to be considered for present research was prepared using the „Table
for Determining Sample Size from a Given Population’ by Krejcie and Morgan8
(1970). With reference to the table, for the present Population of 258 repositories,
a sample size of 154 E-thesis repositories was selected. From each country, only
those E-thesis repositories were selected which had a collection of more than 1000
E-theses.

Page 11

Only regarding India (being the mother country), out of the 31 repositories which
were identified, 27 repositories were found in working condition and were considered
for the present research.

Descriptive research methodology was found to be the most appropriate one for
the present study. Since the population considered is vast in scope and nature,
therefore Survey Technique will be employed using Questionnaire tool. In order
to expedite the distribution of questionnaire and to get quick response in minimum
possible time, Web Survey Questionnaire was framed using the „SurveyMonkey
Web Survey Questionnaire Tool‟9. The researcher paid annual subscription of
„Gold Plan‟ for the SurveyMonkey Questionnaire in order to avail facilities like
unlimited questions, unlimited responses, question and answer piping, question
randomization or flipping, text analysis for open responses and SPSS integration.
The subscription period was from 15th March 2013 to 14th March 2014.
The e-mail ids of Repository Administrators were collected by individually
browsing all the 154 E-theses Repository websites. In case, direct e-mail ID of the
Repository Administrator was mentioned on the website, then the questionnaire
was mailed using the „Contact Us‟ option provided in the website. The First mail
was sent on 22nd March 2013, First reminder on 29th April 2013, second reminder
sent on 24th June 2013, third and last reminder was sent on 2nd August 2013. The
reminder mails were posted in the institutional mail ids of the Repository
Administrators as well as in the NDLTD listserv Mailing List. The researcher also
made calls to E-theses Repository Administrators in India but could not get a
positive response. The Research Guide also made calls to some of the Indian
repository administrators who then filled in the web questionnaire.
In due course of work, the researcher received lot of support and help from one of
the Board of Directors of NDLTD (Networked Digital Library of Theses and
Dissertations, USA), Ms.Iryna Kuchma (EIFL Open Access Program Manager)
who posted information regarding the research work and promoted the web
questionnaire link in the Social Networking Site of NDLTD (Facebook Page of
NDLTD). Ms.Kuchma also posted the questionnaire link to „NDLTD listserv‟
through which the questionnaire was sent to approximately 500+ NDLTD listserv
Page 12

members from across the world. Due to the promotion by NDLTD, the researcher
could receive response from 28 E-theses repositories. Ms. Kuchma also provided
explanation and additional information about some ETD concepts through e-mail.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE
2.1 Introduction:
Literature Search or Literature Review is an attempt to identify, locate and
synthesize completed research reports, articles, books, and other materials about
the specific problems of a research topic. It is a chronological presentation of
growth and development of literature in a particular field over a period of time. It
helps to narrow down the research problem, suggests new approaches to the
planning of investigations and assists investigators to develop firmer
understandings of theoretical implications. The researcher gets a guideline to
formulate and identify the objectives, hypothesis, methods for collection and
analysis of data.
The present literature review is grouped in the following manner:
2.2 Review of Literature at International Level
2.2.1

Electronic Theses and Dissertations

2.2

Review of Literature at International Level:

2.2.1

Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs)

McMillan, G (1996)1 mentioned the importance of electronic theses and
dissertations for graduate school libraries. The author suggests expanding current
theses cataloguing and taking advantage of online information prepared by
authors so that the bibliographic records provide OPACs with much more
valuable information than does traditional theses cataloguing.
McMillan, G (1999)2 presented findings at Virginia Tech as a case study of
shifting book-length works to electronic documents for the global digital library.
He explains how the new genre of Electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) are
emerging in part as a result of the work to build the Networked Digital Library of
Theses and Dissertations(NDLTD). Virginia Tech began requiring ETDs January
1, 1997 and has since received over 1450.
Sharretts, C., Shieh, J.& French, J (1999)3 described University of Virginia‘s
attempt of implementing Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD). The
researcher found that the uniqueness of the ETD lies in the fact that the whole
Page 23

process was assimilated through the technical skills and intellectual efforts of
faculty and students. It creates no extra network load and is fully automatic, from
the submission of data, to the conversion into MARC, and the subsequent loading
into the Library's online catalogue VIRGO.
Niederer, U., Weigel, U., Gillieron-Garber, M. & Bohler, K (2000)4 discussed
several projects focusing on the perspectives of Swiss university libraries of
electronic publishing of theses.
Ubogu, F (2001)5 overviewed existing African theses and dissertation projects,
including the Database of African Theses and Dissertations (DATAD) and the
African Universities Dissertations Abstracts (AFUDA) projects. The author also
discusses the status of the Rhodes University project and reports responses from
other institutions in the region, and makes suggestions for accelerated
involvement of tertiary institutions in Africa, especially Southern Africa, in the
international network of theses and dissertations.
MacColl, J (2002)6 explained the importance of Electronic Theses and
Dissertations (ETDs) in general and how the ETD movement in UK can be
initiated. UTOG, the UK Theses Online Group, which was established several
years ago, could not spread the awareness of importance of ETD. The author
proposed a plan in order to develop a strategy for the development of ETDs in the
UK. The researcher hopes that making submission of ETDs mandatory may be
fruitful for the project.
Reich, V (2002)7 described the LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) model
with respect to history behind its development, design and technology involved
and the present status of the model. The author requests Publishers and Librarians
to participate in the movement. The article provides detailed information about
LOCKSS.
Bakelli, Y and Benrahmoun, S (2003)8 explored the problem of the long-term
conservation and preservation of electronic theses in the Algerian context, and
Page 24

shows how international recognised standards and techniques for setting up and
organising the local ETD's archives may be applied.
Hahsler, M (2003)9 presented a report on the effort of the library of the Vienna
University of Economics and Business Administration to integrate a digital
library component for research documents authored at the university into the
existing library infrastructure. A project title ePub (electronic publications) was
started in June 2001 that aimed to collect and manage the university's researchrelated documents (PhD theses, working papers, and later on master‘s theses) in
electronic form and to make them available online.
Koulouris, A & Kapidakis, S (2003)10 examined the disposition policies of
Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) among three institutions: National
Documentation Centre of Greece (NDC), Virginia Tech (VT) and West Virginia
University (WVU) of USA. The researchers also compared the implemented
disposition policies by the three institutions and analysed their similarities and
differences. It was found that the ETDs are freely available to onsite and offsite
users. Since there was restricted usage of ETDs, they suggested alternative access
policies to make them more open and accessible to all.
Andrew, T (2004)11 discussed the Theses Alive! Project of the Edinburgh
University Library to investigate the technological and cultural issues involved
for Great Britain higher education institutions wishing to attain electronic theses
capability and to initiate a pilot national service through partner institutions as of
April 2004.
Beaven, J (2004)12 emphasized on the importance for U.S. University Libraries to
keep low-technology backups of their online thesis collection to prevent problems
when formats of books and documents change.
Jones, R (2004)13 evaluated two open source software packages to deliver Etheses functionality via a Web-based interface ETD-db by Virginia Tech, and
DSpace by Hewlett-Packard (HP) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Page 25

(MIT) and found that DSpace was much ahead of ETD-db. Jones carried out the
research in the backdrop of the Theses Alive!Project through which UK
institutions can implement their own E-theses or Electronic Theses and
Dissertations (ETD) online submission system and repository.
Fineman, Y (2004)14 stated that ETDs in music are not living up to their potential
since the students preparing musical ETDs face additional challenges and
problems with the integration of a variety of music formats and software into text
documents and with the appropriate use of copyrighted materials. The researcher
argues that the advantages of electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) in music
are far more than the disadvantages and it‘s very unfortunate that many people
are reluctant to use it.
Yi, J (2004)15 introduced the China Networked Digital Library of Theses and
Dissertations project initiated by the China Academic Library and Information
System and current research into related technologies, including metadata
standards, OAI metadata harvesting protocol, standard document format and
intellectual property protection.
Baty, P (2005)16 reported the online selling of dissertations that are openly
published on university Web sites to students to pass off their work in Great
Britain.
Bevan, S (2005)17 described the issues involved in the introduction of mandatory
submission of electronic theses at Cranfield University. The research concluded
that there are a number of issues that will need to be addressed from the points of
view of librarians, academic staff and registry staff and that one effective method
of managing the process is to set up a working group with all stakeholders in the
process.
Copeland, S., Penman, A. & Mime, C. (2005)18 described the key findings of the
UK JISC-funded Electronic Theses project that was led by The Robert Gordon
University, as well as the results of associated projects that formed part of the
Page 26

JISC-funded "FAIR" programme, and the way in which the recommendations
will be taken forward.
Grant, C (2005)19 reported the introduction of VALET for ETDs, that will be
available freely as open-source software, VALET is a Web submission solution
for managing electronic theses and dissertations.
Greig, M (2005)20 described the strategies that have been adopted by staff at
Glasgow University Library in trying to implement electronic theses and the
challenge that have been faced. The article also covers the external developments,
which may help speed up the transition to electronic theses.
Kushkowski, J (2005)21 reported on the Web citation behaviour of print and
electronic thesis authors at Iowa State and Virginia Tech from 1997 to 2003. It
examines the rates of Web citation in economics theses and dissertations between
1997 and 2003. The study suggested that students who are required to publish
their theses digitally exhibit citation behaviour that is no different from students
who produce their theses in print.
Orphan, S (2005)22 reported that the U.S. Networked Digital Library of Theses
and Dissertations (NDLTD) offer tutorial for graduate students and their faculty
advisors. NDLTD provides support for institutions to initiate and sustain their
electronic theses and dissertations programs.
Russell, J (2005)23 provided information on the Electronic Theses Online Service
(EThOS) Project in Great Britain. The aim of the project was to open up
repositories of theses in British libraries such as the British Library and the
National Library of Wales.
Susan, H., Lona, H. & Wolverton, J (2005)24 conducted survey of selected
academic institutions in the U.S. to identify these factors for consideration, and to
present an array of potential strategies for successful implementation of ETD
initiatives.
Page 27

Wojtas, O (2005)25 reported on a project by the Joint Information Systems
Committee (JISC), the Consortium of Research Libraries in the British Isles and
the British Library to preserve printed and electronic theses and academic
dissertations centrally and make them generally accessible.
Atkinson, L (2006)26 presented the results of a recent University of Calgary
Archives project to investigate the replacement of existing theses and
dissertations database which is developed using D Space. It was found open
source software, WebGenCat is a more sophisticated database than D-Space and
it more closely meets the needs of the University Archives in all aspects of its
functionality. Also, it provides more appealing display and is user-friendly than
D-Space.
Arabito, S. & Asnicar, F (2006)27 explained ‗OpenstarTs-a lean approach‘ to
Electronic Theses & Dissertation publishing included in the project "University
and work opportunities in Friuli Venezia Giulia‖, under a grant from the Italian
Department of Education and Higher Education. The OpenstarTs is an action
project of The University of Trieste which aims at overcoming the present
weaknesses of slow cataloguing, duplication of tasks, lack of space and unfit
deposits.
Hoover, L (2006)28studied the presence or absence of an abstract, keywords, fulltext availability, classification number, and subject headings for citations
obtained by the Web-based methods of access, compared the search options, the
description of types of information in ETD citations, and the appendix, a
webliography of the sites discussed and effective electronic retrieval of
agricultural and food information. He studied the Agriculture and Food Related
Theses and Dissertations Available on the Web.
Jewell, C., Oldfield, W., & Reeves, S (2006)29 discussed issues associated with
open access (OA) to electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) and to describe
the University of Waterloo E-thesis Project and its partnerships with Theses
Canada and the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. The
Page 28

researcher found that Author-created metadata forms the UW E-theses searchable
database of records link to theses in full text.
Lowry, C (2006)30 reflected on intellectual property issues about open access of
electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) in the Digital Repository at the
University of Maryland. The author believes that tackling disciplinary differences
entailed from repository posting or archiving is the right thing to do.
Russell, J (2006)31 assessed the impact of the new Electronic Theses Online
Service (EThOS) on the availability of British doctoral theses. At least 100
British Higher Education Institutions (HEI) were participating in EThOS. All
digitised or harvested theses are included in the digital preservation programme
of the British Library (BL).
Tonta, Y. & Al, U (2006)32analyzed the bibliometric features (the number of
pages, completion years, the fields of subject, the number of citations, and their
distribution by types of sources and years) of 100 theses and dissertations
completed at the Department of Librarianship of Hacettepe University, Turkey
between 1974 and 2002. They found that Journal articles get cited more often
than monographs and the percentage of citations to electronic publications is on
the rise. Findings suggested that there exist a correlation between the number of
citations a journal receives and its availability through the university library at the
time the dissertation was completed.
Caldwell, T (2007)33provided information on the EThOSnet project. The project
is intended at digitizing doctoral theses in order to prepare them for the Electronic
Theses Online Service in 2009. The prototype of the project was created by the
Joint Information Systems Committee and the Consortium of Research Libraries
in the British Isles.
Galimberti, P & Vignocchi, M (2007)34 presented the status of e-theses
collections in Italy, focusing on the major drivers for change that contributed to
create the basis of a national e-theses provision service able to collaborate with
Page 29

other international services. Finally, it illustrates the AMS Tesi di Dottorato
Bologna University project for open access doctoral e-theses as a case study of a
viable integrated system offering added value services.
Paillasard, P., Schopfel, J. & Stock, C. (2007)35 presented the former French
database for print theses ‗Téléthèses‘ that merged with the national academic
union catalogue ‗Sudoc‘ (Système Universitaire de DOCumentation), and gives
an overview on initiatives for open archives and repositories for electronic theses
and dissertations as well as the national program for these documents.
Park, E., Qing, Z. & McKnight, D (2007)36 explained the set-up of a protocol for
electronic thesis and dissertation (ETD) submission for the electronic thesis
initiative pilot project at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. It was found
that all theses experienced some degree of information loss during the
conversion. They found that the software used for ETD submission is DigiTool,
which was still being tested for storage, cataloguing, and dissemination
capability. For full implementation, three major issues need to be addressed
further: conversion; metadata; and file formats.
Park, E., Nam, Y. & Oh, S. (2007)37 focused on a survey by the National
Assembly Library of Korea on management of electronic theses at several
university libraries in Korea. The survey found that 91 percent of the libraries are
digitizing theses and dissertations, 73 percent had a copyright policy for
electronic dissertations, while 46 percent libraries provided access to full-text via
the Internet. The researchers recommend standardization of metadata scheme for
exchanging information between the member libraries and the implementation of
an Integrated Electronic Thesis Dissertation (IETD) system model.
Al Salmi, J (2008)38 tried to establish the framework for understanding the
positive and negative factors affecting the adoption and development of
electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) programs with particular reference to
the situation in the Arab Gulf States. The author found that technological factors,
legal issues and other administrative issues discourage the adoption of ETD
Page 30

programs. It was found that most issues influencing the adoption and
development of ETD programs can be resolved by undertaking appropriate
promotional and advocacy activities.
Asner, H & Polani, T (2008)39 focused on the electronic thesis and dissertation
project at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'erSheva in Israel. They
survey the status of the electronictheses and dissertation (ETD) movement in the
country as part of the worldwide spread of ETDs outside the U.S., particularly in
Europe, Latin America, Australasia, and Asia. The authors also explore the
percentages of academic publishers who consider ETD's existence as prior
publication of the book or article derived from that thesis.
Fyffe, R & Welburn, W (2008)40 discussed opportunities for academic libraries
concerning the development of repository programs for Electronic Theses and
Dissertations (ETDs). They explored benefits for students and universities,
including the expressive qualities of ETDs, increased visibility, operational
efficiency, and knowledge-sharing, issues for administrative discussion are
examined, with particular focus given to copyright management. The article also
provides a list of university ETD Web sites.
McCutcheon, S and others (2008)41 aimed to describe work at Kent State
University Libraries and Media Services to promote and devise electronic thesis
and dissertation (ETD) storage at OhioLINK's ETD Center, to find efficient
methods to represent these unique scholarly materials within the library's catalog,
and to foster the establishment of state-wide library catalog standards for ETDs.
The researchers devised a semi-automated process that extracts student-supplied
metadata already available in the OhioLINK ETD Center to provide almost
instantaneous access to unique resources through the library catalog.
Moyle, M (2008)42 gave an overview of DART-Europe (Digital Access to
Research Theses - Europe), its progress and its future plans, with particular
reference to the DART-Europe E-theses Portal.
Page 31

Richardson, W., Srinivasan, V & Fox, E (2008)43 proposed the design for a
scalable, Web Services based tool KDWebS (Knowledge Discovery System
based on Web Services), to facilitate automated knowledge discovery in NDLTD.
Suber, P (2008)44 argues for mandating open access (OA) to electronic theses and
dissertations (ETDs) since they are the most invisible form of useful literature
and the most useful form of invisible literature.
Stock, C (2008)45 described some tendencies concerning electronic theses and
dissertations in Europe as observed during explorations of institutional and other
repositories, with specific regard to the full text. In the first part the author
examined the changing landscape in repositories where access to the complete
full text of a thesis is no longer a unique offer, but partial access, temporary
embargoes and bibliographic citations is also found. In the second part, we take a
closer look at the language issue of ETDs.
Thomas, K (2008)46 described several web-based resources that aim to preserve
grey literature, which refers to booklets, research reports and PDF documents
published in-house by organisations. These include the Electronic Theses Online
Service (EThOS) where electronic theses and dissertations held by British
institutions can be accessed by users, OpenDOAR which offers a directory of
academic open access repositories and OAIster which catalogues digital
resources from 900 contributors.
Yiotis, K (2008)47 introduced the electronic theses and dissertation (ETD)
repository as a subset of local institutional digital repositories. The paper
discusses the originating institutions and organizations including Virginia Tech
Initiative, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, the United
Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and the United States
Department of Education.
Averkamp, S. & Lee, J. (2009)48 described the workflow used by the University
of Iowa Libraries to populate their institutional repository and their catalogue
with the data collected by ProQuest UMI Dissertation Publishing during the
Page 32

submission of students‘ theses and dissertations. Re-purposing the metadata from
ProQuest allowed the University of Iowa Libraries to streamline the process for
ingesting theses and dissertations into their institutional repository. The article
includes a discussion of the benefits and limitations of the workflow described.
Boock, M. & Kunda, S (2009)49 compared past processes and workflows for print
theses and dissertations of 2005 with the present workflow for electronic form in
Oregon State University Libraries followed in 2007. The authors provide the
rationale for changes and review the cost- and time-savings produced. They also
describe the changing roles of students, technicians, and librarians in the
metadata process as well as the value of students describing their own work.
Carbery, A (2009)50 discussed the electronic dissertations (ETDs) policy
implementation on the libraries of Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) in
Ireland. The paper cites that the benefits of having ETDs include better
accessibility, faster availability of present research, and searchability. It also
discussed the e-thesis mandatory submission, required ETD formats, and access
policies. The workflow in the integration of ETD to the collection of library is
also outlined.
Deng, S. & Reese, T. (2009)51 presented methods for customized mapping and
metadata transfer from DSpace to Online Computer Library Center (OCLC),
which aims to improve Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) work flow at
libraries using DSpace to store theses and dissertations by automating the process
of generating MARC records from Dublin Core (DC) metadata in DSpace and
exporting them to OCLC. The paper discusses how the Shocker Open Access
Repository (SOAR) at Wichita State University (WSU) Libraries and
ScholarsArchive at Oregon State University (OSU) Libraries harvest theses data
from the DSpace platform using the Metadata Harvester in MarcEdit developed
by Terry Reese at OSU Libraries. It analyses certain challenges in transformation
of harvested data including handling of authorized data, dealing with data
ambiguity and string processing.
Page 33

Fox, E., MacMillan, G. & Srinivasan, V (2009)52 presented a technique for
identifying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from a large
electronic theses and dissertations collection. The article introduces the highly
successful Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD)
project and demonstrates a semiautomatic approach to topic categorization using
the NDLTD's Union Catalog metadata.
Lubas, R (2009)53 reviewed practices for thesis and dissertation metadata creation
with a focus on DSpace instances, best practice recommendations for authorsubmitted metadata, recommendations for subject analysis, and training for
metadata practitioners. The article recommends processes for author submission,
metadata quality control and enhancement, and cross walking of the metadata to
the library's catalog to maximize discovery.
O‘Leary, K (2009)54 provided information on the Electronic Theses Online
Service (EThOS) funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC),
Research Libraries UK (RLUK) and project partners, which aims to make Great
Britain lead the international electronic theses provision. The article explores the
benefit of EThOS to library staff, institutions and researchers, which are
generally about managing and accessing theses at a decreased period of time.
Ribaric, T (2009)55 presented information on digitization services at the Internet
Archive and informs about the method to use software utilities developed by him
to automate scanned dissertations and associated Dublin Core XML files to create
an Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) Portal using the DSpace platform.
The author created an institutional repository at the library of Brock University.
DSpace has been used as software platform to create an ETD portal to ingest a
collection of dissertations created by the University. The digitization service
offered by the Internet Archive provides digital representations of theses.
Russell, J (2009)56 assessed the impact of the new Electronic Theses Online
Service (EThOS) on the availability of British doctoral theses. At least 100
British higher education institutions (HEI) are said to be participating in EThOS.
Page 34

It notes that the cost of digitising the thesis when it is ordered is shouldered by
the HEI that holds it.
Wong, I & Yiu-On, L (2009)57 discussed and analyzed the efforts of Hong Kong
Baptist University Library to create a virtual union catalogue for dissertations and
theses collections as a single search platform to retrieve the bibliographic records,
abstracts and full-texts of Hong Kong postgraduate students' theses and
dissertations from seven university library online public access catalogues
(OPACs).
Joint, N. (2009)58 presented an overview of ETD (electronic thesis and
dissertation) collection development trends to date, with an emphasis on the
comparative merits of different national models of digital thesis provision. The
paper finds that the case for the superior benefits of digital thesis services as
opposed to print-only thesis provision has undoubtedly been made.
Lippincott, J & Lynch, C (2010)59 discussed the electronic thesis and dissertation
(ETD) programs for graduate education in the U.S. A brief overview of the
history of the development and deployment of ETD programs in U.S. universities
and colleges is given, along with their important role in managing paper
dissertations.
Ramirez, M. & McMillan, G. (2010)60 shared several campus approaches to
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and electronic student
work.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and its

relevance to student work should be a consideration when widely distributing
scholarship like e-portfolios, ETDs, and senior capstone projects. They were
surprised to find that very little has been published about FERPA and online
student works such as ETDs.
Ratanya, F. (2010)61 discussed a project that focuses on digitization of theses and
dissertations by the Kenya Information Preservation Society (KIPS) and found
that KIPS has been compiling the database titled "The Union List of Theses and
Page 35

Dissertations Held in Universities and Research Institutions in Kenya" since
1999, and as of May 2010, KIPS has already produced three union lists.
Ardalan, R & Feyzbaksh, O (2011)62 examined the extent of Electronic Theses
and Dissertations (ETDs) in Iran. The paper notes that many theses and
dissertations submitted in the libraries remain without being referred even once.
Electronic publication can make these works accessible to students, researchers,
and others who perhaps lack time, search capabilities, or finances. The paper
looks at what universities are doing about the problem, and summarizes the
current position in Iran university libraries.
Park, E & Richard, M (2011)63 assessed the metadata element sets of electronic
theses and dissertations that are currently used at Canadian academic institutional
repositories, and discuss issues related to variations and inconsistencies in Dublin
Core data used by participating repositories. The formats and usage patterns of
metadata elements at ten participating institutional repositories are identified and
analyzed.
Wolverton, R., Hoover, L & Fowler, R (2011)64 conducted a survey on subject
analysis of theses/dissertations in print and electronic formats. Questionnaire was
sent to 280 academic libraries classified as Doctorate-granting Universities under
the 2007 Carnegie Classification. The survey results indicated that subject
analysis was done by a large majority of respondents, with a number of
comments expressed about challenges facing current subject-analysis practices.
McCutcheon, S. (2011)65 mentioned that thousands of theses and dissertations
(TDs) that produced each year, it is well worth disseminating them as widely as
possible. ETD are used considerably more than print TDs. ETD records created
automatically contain errors, omissions, and special characters. Name authority
control provides disambiguation of authors with the same name. ETDs with
Subject Headings (LCSH) are 30% more retrievable than with keywords alone.

Page 36

Howard, R.I., & Goldberg, T. (2011)66 described several stages in a university
library‘s approach to providing access to theses and dissertations, culminating in
a decision to use CONTENTdm and its Dublin Core-based metadata along with
our ability to provide even wider access in the future through OCLC. The
researchers found that electronic open access to theses and dissertations increases
their usage; a digital management software package streamlines their
management and presentation.
Ivanovic, L., Ivanovic, D., & Surla, D.(2012)67 discussed the extension of the
Current Research Information System (CRIS) at the University of Novi Sad,
Republic of Serbia, to incorporate electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). The
ETDs repository can exchange data with CRIS institutional repositories and
Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations members. In this way, the
international visibility of theses and dissertations created at the University of
Novi Sad is enhanced without duplicating data entry in various systems.
MacDonald, J.R.W., & Yule, D. (2012)68 created a tool named Jarrow for
collecting and disseminating theses and dissertations electronically. After
reviewing available open-source software for theses submission and open-source
institutional repository software, they discussed why and how Jarrow was created
and how it works.
Ashman, A.B. (2013)69 conducted an informal survey on the use of Resource
Description and Access (RDA) as a cataloguing method for new electronic theses
and dissertations (ETDs) in which the University of Louisville in Kentucky
recently adopted. Many academic libraries continue to modify their cataloguing
method due to the continuous changes in ETD cataloguing. It also presents
several studies in which the 2013 survey was referenced, including the one
conducted by Patterson, White, and Whittaker in 1977.
Clobridge, A (2013)70 presented an overview of the Open Access Theses and
Dissertations (OATD) project, an open access discovery tool led by Thomas
Dowling of for the Z. Smith Reynolds Library at Wake Forest University, which
Page 37

assists researchers in gaining access to open access electronic theses and
dissertations. A discussion of the mechanism by which OATD works, and of the
challenges which researchers often face when attempting to access electronic
open access theses and dissertations, is presented.
Ezema , I.J., & Ugwu, C.I. (2013)71 investigated the current status of electronic
theses and dissertation (ETD) projects in Nigerian university libraries. Only three
out of the eight universities surveyed have started ETD projects in their libraries.
The study also revealed that university libraries in Nigeria stand to benefit
immensely from ETD projects. The results of the study also revealed some
challenges of ETD in Nigeria. The findings identified strategies to mitigate these
challenges.
Hakimjavadi, H., & Masrek, M.N. (2013)72 evaluated the status of eight
interoperability protocols within repositories of electronic theses and dissertations
(ETDs) as an introduction to further studies on feasibility of deploying these
protocols in upcoming areas of interoperability. This study revealed that, despite
its drawbacks, Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (PMH) is still the most utilized
interoperability protocol within ETD providers, ETD software developers, and
implementers, followed by ATOM and Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE)
protocols.
Hawkins, A.R., Kimball, M. & Ives, M. (2013)73 argued against policies that
require students to submit theses and dissertations to electronic institutional
repositories. The article counters a variety of arguments often used to justify this
practice. It also reports on the results of an examination of electronic thesis and
dissertation policies at more than 150 university libraries and graduate schools,
offering a system of criteria and scoring for ranking these policies according to
their respect for student copyright and intellectual property.
Kravjar, J, & Duskova, M.(2013)74 analysed the creation and

two years'

operation of the national corpus of bachelor, master, diploma, dissertation and
habilitationtheses of Slovak higher education institutions and the follow-up
Page 38

plagiarism detection system. The national corpus is called The Central Repository
of Theses and Dissertations (CRTD). Each thesis has to be entered in CRTD
before defence and it is then checked for plagiarism.
Peponakis, M (2013)75 argued that metadata of library catalogues can stand
autonomously, providing valuable information detached from the resources they
point to and, therefore, could be used as data in the context of the Semantic Web.
Peponakis presented an analysis of this perception followed by an
implementation proposal for a Master's thesis and PhD dissertation repository.
The analysis builds on the flexibility of the Resource Description Framework
(RDF) and takes into account the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic
Records (FRBR) and Functional Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD) in
order to reveal the latent academic network by linking its entities to a meaningful
and computationally processable set.
Ramirez, M.L., Dalton, J.T., McMillan, G, Read, M & Seamans, N.H.(2013)76
investigated social sciences, arts, and humanities journal editors' and university
press directors' attitudes toward ETDs. The findings indicate that manuscripts that
are revisions of openly accessible ETDs are always welcome for submission or
are considered on a case-by-case basis by 82.8% of journal editors and 53.7% of
university press directors.
Schopfel, J (2013)77 described the ANRT, its purpose and activity in the French
national network for the dissemination and preservation of PhD theses. The
paper includes a historical study and an evaluation of current activities and future
perspectives. The ANRT has played a significant role in the back-office of the
French network for the dissemination and preservation of PhD theses for over 40
years. Its online catalogue contains more than 200,000 PhD theses that academic
or other research institutions can order in print format or on microfiche.
Schopfel, J. & Soukouya, M. (2013)78 presented a project for the digitizing of
Ph.D theses of two universities in Togo, and then discussed questions and
problems related to the specific conditions of the project, in order to contribute to
Page 39

the understanding of the dynamics and rich diversity of the open access
movement. Many librarians perceive ProQuest‘s Dissertations and Theses as the
key resource for searching dissertations and theses. However, the Online
Computer Library Center‘s (OCLC‘s) WorldCat also provides a means for
locating electronic dissertations and theses.
Procious, A (2014)79 compared ProQuest and WorldCat and found two key
observations. First, both databases provided access to a similar number of
citations. Second, WorldCat consistently had twice as many citations for which
ProQuest had no records. WorldCat provides an important means of locating
electronic theses and dissertations.
2.2.2 Institutional Repositories
Crow, R (2002)80 presented the SPARC (The Scholarly Publishing & Academic
Resources Coalition) Position Paper which examines the Institutional Repositories
(IRs) from complementary perspectives of being a central component in reforming
scholarly communication by stimulating innovation in a disaggregated publishing
structure and by serving as a tangible indicator of an institution‘s quality, thus
increasing its visibility, prestige, and public value. The paper also describes the
potential role of IR and explores their impact on major stakeholders in the
scholarly communication process.
Lynch, C (2003)81 described the development of institutional repositories in 2002
that emerged as a new strategy allowing universities to apply serious, systematic
leverage to accelerate changes taking place in scholarship and scholarly
communication, both moving beyond their historic relatively passive role of
supporting established publishers in modernizing scholarly publishing through the
licensing of digital content, and also scaling up beyond ad-hoc alliances,
partnerships, and support arrangements with a few select faculty pioneers
exploring more transformative new uses of the digital medium. The author
mentioned cautions to be taken and the future developments to take place for the
development of IR.
Page 40

Warner, S (2003)82 presented a brief survey of Open Access Initiative e-print
repositories and of services using metadata harvested from e-print repositories
using the OAI-PMH. The paper also discusses several situations where metadata
harvesting may be used to further improve the utility of e-print archives as a
component of the scholarly communication infrastructure.
Mackie, M (2004)83 described some strategies that can be used to help populate an
institutional repository. DAEDALUS

is a three-year project based at the

University of Glasgow funded under the JISC Focus on Access to Institutional
Resources (FAIR) Programme. The main focus of the project has been developing
institutional repositories to hold content ranging from peer-reviewed published
papers to theses and working papers. Separate repositories have been developed
for published material and other material.
Thomas, A & Rothery, A (2005)84 explored how online repositories are being
used to store and share e-learning content, and show how taking the user
perspective might challenge the emerging approaches to repository development.
They found that there is an increase in use of repositories to use and to share
online learning and teaching content within and between institutions.
Bayram, O., Atilgan, D. & Arslantekin, S (2006)85 discussed the issues concerning
metadata in Ankara University Open Access Program (AUO). The paper outlines
a method for creating a format using Dublin Core (DC) elements of an
institutional repository at Ankara University. The researchers discussed how
essential elements of metadata repository can be created to simplify the process of
submission and repository management of the program.
Herb, U (2006)86 described PsyDok repository of The Saarland University and
State Library, Germany. PsyDok acts as a supraregional, subject specific
repository for digital scientific documents and is the central point for free of
charge

psychological

full-text

publishing.

PsyDok

gives

scientists

an

infrastructure for self-archiving and facilitates their walk on the green road to
Open Access.
Page 41

Masako, S. & Shigeki, S (2006)87summarised the developments of Hokkaido
University Repository right from its launch in early 2004. It is named the
Hokkaido University Collection of Scholarly and Academic Papers (HUSCAP).
Feijen, M. and others (2007)88 presented an outline of the DRIVER (Digital
Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research) Project and its
achievements till 2007 in supporting and enhancing digital repository
development in Europe. The author concludes mentioning the success of DRIVER
I and commencement of DRIVER II by the end of 2007.
Groenewegen, D & Treloar, A (2007)89 described the work of the ARROW
Project to meet the requirements of the Research Quality Framework (RQF) to be
introduced in 2008. They proposed RQF Model which they aim would provide
easy online access to research outputs, as well as promoting an expanding use of
repositories within Australian institutions.
Kennan, M (2007)90 summarised the response to the exploratory survey that was
conducted to analyse the rapidly changing research evaluation and funding
landscape in Australian universities, specifically in relation to open access and
institutional repositories. Results of the survey proved that respondents highly
valued peer review.
Koulouris, A and others (2007, 2008)91, 92 described the challenge, development
and pilot implementation of the Institutional Repository (IR) at the National
Technical University of Athens (NTUA). They evaluated the IR service pilot
period, focusing on the ETD submission process; to refine and improve the above
mentioned process and, finally, to promote the concept of self-archiving and open
access. Data collection was done by implementing a web-based survey, targeting
on the users who submit ETD. A positive user attitude towards the procedure was
noted.
Abrizah, A (2009)93 reported the findings of web-based survey carried out on
academics of a research intensive university in Malaysia, investigating their use of
Page 42

open access repositories, advocacy undertaken, and reasons for contribution or
non-contribution to Institutional Repositories (IRs). The findings indicated that
faculty who planned to contribute to the IR in the future agreed with of the
concept of open access and had a greater altruism in making their work publicly
accessible.
Brownlee, R (2009)94 discussed metadata management and repository service
levels and sustainability in University of Sydney Library‘s Repository.
Melero, R and others (2009)95 analysed the current state of Spanish open-access
institutional repositories and to describe their characteristics. This is the first
detailed study of Spanish institutional repositories. The main inhibitors identified
were the absence of policies, the lack of integration with other national and
international systems and the lack of awareness efforts among academia.
Mondoux, J & Shiri, A (2009)96 tried to find out whether institutional repositories
where implemented in Canadian post-secondary institutions and if they were, then
what type of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) were incorporated in them.
28 IR in post-secondary institutions using DSpace platform were identified for the
research work. The findings suggested that very few IRs had incorporated
complex KOS. Also, browsing and searching options were available but user
interfaces were not modified to enhance information retrieval.
Koulouris, A. & Anagnostopoulos, A (2010)97 described theses e-submission tool
of National Technical University of Athens. It was found that the tool improved
the IR service, which can be certified by the continuing evaluation process.
Koumoutsos, K., Mitrelis, A. & Tsakonas, G (2010)98 evaluated University of
Patras‘ institutional repository, namely ‗Nemertes‘ which is operating on a
DSpace installation and theses and dissertations‘ collection and is placed at the
center of evaluation as the most important collection accommodated in the
service. The findings show that users found ‗Nemertes‘ a valuable service despite
of all deficiencies found.
Page 43

Kurtz, M (2010)99 provided an overview of Dublin Core (DC) and DSpace
together with an examination of the institutional repositories of three public
research universities. She examined the quality of records with reference to the
methods of educating repository users. The findings show that one repository used
librarians to oversee the archiving process, while the other two employed two
different strategies as part of the self-archiving process.
Mallery, M (2010)100 briefly summarised the construction and contents of The
Association for Library Collections and Technical Services (ALCTS) Institutional
Repository of the American Libraries Association.
Puplett, D (2010)101,102 summarized the proceedings of the Conference on the
‗Subject Repositories: European Collaboration in the International Context‘ held
at the British Library, London on 28-29 January 2010. The conference launched
Economists Online (EO), an innovative economics subject repository. The author
overviewed the existing subject repositories, along with an analysis of the
scholarly communications landscape in economics and how the new EO subject
repository fits into this environment.
Shoeb, Z (2010)103 discussed the current practices and issues of access
management for digital repositories including user authentications, user
authorization,

authentication,

and

the

technology

of

secured

digital

communication of digital materials. The paper also gives a basic idea about access
management practices in Bangladesh by the digital content providers.
Ezema, I.J. (2011)104 explored the potential of open access institutional
repositories (IR) in enhancing the global visibility and impact of Nigerian
scholarly publication. While the paper acknowledges several problems that
impede the building of open access IR, it equally highlights some necessary
requirements for the building of IR with a road map for the development of
functional IR in Nigeria.

Page 44

Fralinger, J. & Bull, J. (2013)105 identified factors that might affect the
international usage of US institutional repositories as part of assessment efforts to
determine an IR's return-on-investment. While many IRs reported various rates of
international usage, the largest group of respondents did not report an international
usage rate for both page hits and downloads, despite overwhelmingly expressing
an importance of international traffic to their IR and parent institution.
Armstrong, M (2014)106 explored management models that institutional
repositories can use for research dissemination. The article challenges the existing
ideology surrounding institutional repositories and helps frame these services as a
core component for fulfilling an important university mission.
Bonilla-Calero, A.W. (2014)107 analysed the advantages of using an Institutional
Repository as a complementary source to evaluate the research output produced
by a University. The paper is aimed at researchers and experts that use Web of
Knowledge and Scopus services to evaluate research output. It recommends that
they consider using Institutional Repositories as an additional, practical and
complementary tool to traditional databases.
2.2.3 Open Access
Budapest Open Access Initiative (2002)108 defined Open Access for the first time
and mentioned that removing access barriers to the scholarly literature will
accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor
and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the
foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest
for knowledge.
European Culture Heritage Online (ECHO) Charter (2002)109 aimed of an
electronic representation of the European cultural heritage on the web which will
make it more widely available than ever before in its history and thus strengthen
its function as a bond of the European community. The basic idea was to establish
Page 45

an open-source culture of the public and scholarly exploitation of cultural heritage
on the Internet.
Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing (2003)110 stimulated discussion
within the biomedical research community on how to proceed, as rapidly as
possible, to the widely held goal of providing open access to the primary scientific
literature.
Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities
(2003)111 was drafted to promote the Internet as a functional instrument for a
global scientific knowledge base and human reflection and to specify measures
which research policy makers, research institutions, funding agencies, libraries,
archives and museums need to consider.
Antelman, K (2004)112 conducted a research to find out whether open access
articles have a greater research impact. The research was conducted on
mathematics, electrical and electronic engineering, political science, and
philosophy which were chosen with the expectation that they would represent
different points on the continuum of open-access adoption. The researcher found
that, across all four disciplines, freely available articles had great research impact.
Suber, P (2004)113 provided detailed introduction to open access (OA) for those
who are new to the concept. He explains that, Open-access (OA) literature is
digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing
restrictions. He further explains two primary vehicles for delivering OA to
research articles - OA journals and OA archives or repositories.
De Robbio, A & Coll, I (2005)114 described technical and organisational
characteristics of E-LIS, the International open archive, its configuration and
customization, and discusses its policies, aims and mission. The paper also
emphasises that the promotion of E-LIS further enhances the OA movement in
general, so E-LIS can be regarded as a tool for the dissemination of the OA
philosophy.
Page 46

Bailey, C (2006)115 studied open access movement from its various aspects like
the importance of open access in today‘s world, initiatives taken for their
development, copyright practices and types of open access journal publishers.
Liu, Z. & Wan, G (2007)116analyzed the publication trends of scholarly journal
articles on open access in the library and information science literature from 2000
to 2005. The authors used the method of content analysis to systematically
analyze the selected scholarly articles. A total of 227 articles were selected from
the relevant databases and a comprehensive bibliography on open access. It was
found that general works, library science journals, viewpoint articles, library
professionals, and U.S. authors predominated in the categories under
investigation.
Wang, X & Su, C (2007)117 explained the concept of open access, various Open
Access (OA) operational models, and key stakeholders. They interviewed six
prominent Chinese scholars and analyzed their perspectives of OA development in
China and also evaluated the similarities and differences of OA development by
using the developed counties as best practice benchmark. The paper concludes
with suggestions and recommendation of improved research methods and
questions for future studies.
Bjork, B., Roos, A & Lauri, M (2009)118 conducted a research to find out the total
yearly volume of peer-reviewed scientific journal articles published world-wide as
well as the share of these articles available openly on the Web either directly or as
copies in e-print repositories.
Canada, D (2009)119 overviewed open access and its benefits to developing
countries for research and educational goals. Canada also discussed specific
examples of how the open access movement is making inroads toward greater
information access in India, Latin America, and Africa. Findings showed that
open access movement is making creating possibilities to provide equal access to
knowledge to all countries, regardless of economic status. Canada mentioned that
there should be a combined commitment by governments, education and research
Page 47

institutions, as well as private organizations to provide funding and increase
awareness of the open access movement and open access resources.
Stevenson, A (2009)120 presented a report on the four day Annual Open
Repositories Conference held at Georgia Tech in Atlanta over 18-21 May 2009
that addressed developments surrounding the Fedora, DSpace and EPrints systems
that occurred over 2008. The author also presented his work on the SWORD
(Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit) Project which is concerned
with lowering the barriers to deposit contributions.
Westra, B., Ramirez, M., Parham, S. & Scaramozzino, J (2010)121 presented a
webliography of materials primarily or solely devoted to medical informatics and
social sciences. The webliography covered documents from associations and
organizations, directories of data repositories, metadata standards, software and
middleware, assessment tools, open access journals and e-mail lists.
Zuccala, A (2010)122 examined how residents and citizens of The Netherlands
perceive open access to acquire preliminary insight into the role it might play in
cultivating civic scientific literacy. Open access refers to scientific or scholarly
research literature available on the Web to scholars and the general public in free
online journals and institutional repositories.
Swan, A (2012)123 presented the ‗Policy Guidelines for the Development and
Promotion of Open Access‘ issued by UNESCO, to demystify the concept of
Open Access (OA) and to provide concrete steps on putting relevant policies in
place. The overall objective of the Policy Guidelines is to promote Open Access in
Member States by facilitating understanding of all relevant issues related to Open
Access.
Mavodza, J. (2013)124 highlighted the open access (OA) initiatives initiated in
2013 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The paper finds that the UAE open
access initiatives may be the beginning of advances towards encouraging
contributing to OA peer-reviewed article publication for enabling knowledge
Page 48

creation. This paper reinforces many of the concepts being discussed regarding
OA initiatives both in the UAE and globally.

2.3

Review of Literature at National Level:

2.3.1

Electronic Theses and Dissertations

Urs, S & Raghavan, K (2001)125 focused on the Vidyanidhi project started at the
University of Mysore in India and sponsored by the National Information System
for Science and Technology (NISSAT), which is emerging as a national effort to
create, maintain and provide network access to digital library of Indian theses.
Vijayakumar, J & Murthy, T (2001)126 emphasized the importance of ETDs over
their traditional format as they can be easily located, readily accessible and
delivered over the web. They discussed the contributions of INFLIBNET towards
creating digital library ofETDs and also urged that UGC as the apex body dealing
with Indian Universities should release funds for launching ETD project.
Padmavathi, T., Lal, K & Mahakuteshwar, H (2005)127 discussed an initiative of
CFTRI to develop a digital library of theses and dissertations using open source
software — Greenstone Digital Library (GSDL). The article also mentions few
Digital Library of Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) projects in USA
and India and provides a brief background to the Central Food Technological
Research Institute (CFTRI), the objectives of digitization, and some statistics of
the digital resources available at the Institute.
Vijayakumar, J., Hosamani, H, & Murthy, T (2005)128 found that the nation lacks
proper implementation of integrated system to locate and access Ph.D theses.
‗University News‘ is the only available current printed listing of Ph.D theses.
Still, not all university libraries have collaborated with University News or
INFLIBNET to electronically deposit their Ph.D theses.

Page 49

Vijayakumar, J., Murthy, T., & Khan, M (2004 &2005)129,130,131,132 analyzed the
opinions of selected Ph.D researchers and guides from selected Indian
Universities funded under UGC, connected or getting connected to UGC
INFONET program on Copyright and IPR issues related to ETDs. On the basis of
the output, the papers suggest that Universities can start collecting e-format of
theses, creating a digital archive for easy access.
Vijayakumar, J., Murthy, T. & Khan, M (2006)133 proposed a model digital
library using DSpace for Indian universities in order to create their ETDs and
provide access either on their Intranet or the Internet.
Das, A., Sen, B & Dutta, C (2007)134 discussed the policy frameworks, strategic
dimensions and analyze SWOT of existing ETD initiatives in India. The
researchers explain valuable contribution of UGC Regulations 2005 and National
Knowledge Commission‘s Recommendations 2005 towards open access and
ETDs. The study indicates that national ETD initiatives are still in developmental
phase where more action plans are needed.
Vijayakumar, J., Murthy, T. & Khan, M (2007)135 conducted a study to examine
the opinion of librarians and research scholars regarding the use of electronic
information services to support the accessibility of doctoral theses in India.It was
detected through the study that majority of librarians were aware of the concept
of electronic theses and dissertations (ETD), but less than half of them supported
the concept of making electronic theses available online.
Francis, A., Devi, C & Razzak, C (2007)136 evaluated development and
digitization work of ETD in Kerala Agricultural University & Indian Institute of
Spices Research (IISR). The findings suggested that use of ETDs is popular
among scientists and researchers.
Ghosh, M (2007)137 presented a report of the ETD 2007 symposium based on the
main theme ―Added values to e-theses‖ and highlight major events of the
symposium held at Uppsala library, Sweden, during 13-16 June 2007. It provided
Page 50

unique opportunity to all the stakeholders of ETDs to explore the collaborative
agenda emerged due to the changes in scholarly communication, long-term
digital preservation, ETD repository development and open access movement.
Suber, P., Nair, R & Hussain, K (2009)138 discussed the importance of doctoral
dissertations, public fund utilized for their production and need for their open
access. They describe the development of Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU)
Open Access Digital Archive and how the MGU archives reveal the increasing
number of production of doctorates in science and technology.
University Grants Commission, India (2009)139 provided guidelines for
submission of electronic version of theses and dissertations by the researchers in
universities with an aim to facilitate open access to Indian theses and dissertation
to the academic community world-wide. As per the Regulation, the responsibility
of hosting, maintaining and making the digital repository of Indian Electronic
Theses and Dissertation (called 'Shodhganga'), accessible to all institutions and
universities, is assigned to the INFLIBNET Centre by UGC. Till date there are
4200+ theses submitted to the database.
Sarkar, P. & Mukhopadhyay, P (2010)140 presented a method of metadata
harvesting from different Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting (OAI-PMH) complaint institutional digital repositories containing
Electronic Thesis & Dissertations (ETDs). The researchers report designing of a
prototype union catalog of ETDs as a single-window search interface to facilitate
retrieval of ETDs on global scale.
Swain, D (2010)141 explored the issue of Electronic Thesis & Dissertation (ETD)
initiatives, adoption and subsequent implications from studies carried out in
different parts of the world. The researcher found that in spite of production of
some doctoral thesis electronically, there is no government initiative for storage
and dissemination of ETD, national policies are also lacking. He also mentions
that Librarians must take initiative to make progress in this crucial area.
Page 51

INFLIBNET (2012)142 introduced ―ShodhGangotri‖ wherein research scholars /
research supervisors in universities are requested to deposit electronic version of
approved synopsis submitted by research scholars to the universities for
registering themselves for the Ph.D programme. The repository reveals the trends
and directions of research being conducted in Indian universities; on the other
hand it would avoid duplication of research. Synopsis in ―ShodhGangotri‖ would
later be mapped to full-text theses in "ShodhGanga". As such, once the full-text
thesis is submitted for a synopsis, a link to the full-text theses would be provided
from ShodhGangotri to "ShodhGanga".
Lihitkar, S.R. & Lihitkar, R.S. (2014)143 attempted to find out the institutions that
are developing electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) in India, and to
compare the ETDs in India based on a predetermined parameter. In analysis and
findings, a detailed report of the analysis of data collection and its subsequent
interpretations are given.
2.3.2

Institutional Repositories

Anuradha, K (2005)144 presented the results of an effort to develop an
Institutional Repository of publications of Indian Institute of Science (IISc),
Bangalore. The researchers stated that the IR named ‗PRABHAVI‘ helps in
preserving and archiving IISc researchers locally and also provide wide
accessibility and visibility to the IISc research work. The paper reports only the
preliminary work which provides access to IISc research work as reported in
external sources. The IR creators plan to expand its scope to include internal
sources of information.
Alexander, M & Gautam, J (2006)145 highlighted the Indian initiatives in the field
of institutional repositories. Out of 273 universities and institutions of higher
learning in India, there are only 15 registered archives. All these archives are
registered in the Institutional Archives Registry. The authors conclude that IRs
are still in a formative stage in India and the government and funding agencies in
Page 52

India should insist that publicly funded research be available through institutional
repositories that are open to all.
Fernandez, L (2006)146 evaluated the growth and development of online research
repositories in India within the broader framework of open access. Based on
participant feedback a list of best practices is presented. The author expects that
the study will have definite implications for the role of Canadian librarians in the
promotion of Canadian research.
Patel, Y., Vijayakumar, J.& Murthy, T (2006)147 narrated the practical
experiences and provide an overview of INFLIBNET‘s institutional repository
and dArchive-India developed for Indian academic and research community to
archive their intellectual work.
Sahu, D. & Parmar, R (2006)148 discussed the status of open access in India
through open access journal publishing, open access archives, open access
repositories developed and open access projects going on in India.
Sutradhar, B (2006)149 described how an institutional repository (IR) was set up,
using open source software, at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in
Kharagpur. It provided evidence on how to set up an IR and how to create
different communities and, under each community, many collections, using the
DSpace software. It was found that setting up an IR is very simple but its
maintenance is very difficult.
Katariya, S (2007)150 discussed the concept of Intellectual Repository (IR), its
need, importance, benefits, critical issues, major problems in establishment and
maintenance of IR, role of librarians, intellectual society, academic and
government institutions. The researcher also gives an overview of IR initiative
taken in the institutions of higher learning in Indian Scenario.
Doctor, G & Ramachandran, S (2008)151 explored the creation of a pilot
institutional repository at the ICFAI Business School, Ahmedabad and discussed
Page 53

the results of a survey conducted to ascertain different considerations for
implementing an institutional repository and the future scope. The results
indicated a positive trend in usage of e-resources and Business Schools in India
need promotion about usage of Institutional Repositories which will help them in
digitizing research papers, conference papers for knowledge sharing and future
use.
Dhiman, A & Sharma, H (2008)152 described the concept of Institutional
Repositories by explaining definition and benefits of IR, most commonly used
open source software for IR and they also list 21 important Institutional
Repositories in India.
Mittal, R & Mahesh, G (2008)153 identified and evaluated collections within
digital libraries and repositories in India available in public domain. The
researchers found that DSpace is the most favorably used open source software
for creation of digital repositories. It was found that due to lack of awareness and
funds for creation of institutional repositories, their present situation in India is
still lagging behind.
Singh, S., Pandita, N. & Dash, S (2008)154 discussed key issues in establishing
and maintaining an open access repository by taking OpenMED@NIC as a case.
The researchers suggest that once the repository is established, it requires
spreading awareness among academic and scientific community about various
benefits of open access self-archiving.
Ghosh, M (2009)155 examined the developments in ETD repositories, in particular
PhD thesis repositories, in India. The purpose is to perform a preliminary study
and explore the possibilities for creating a national repository for the deposit,
discovery, use and long-term care of research theses in an open access
environment. The survey revealed that digital preservation of theses and
dissertations is already in progress, though some of them are still in a preliminary
stage.
Page 54

Lihitkar, S., Lihitkar, R & Agashe, A (2009)156 studied the Indian scenario in
developing the institutional repositories. Total 33 institutional repositories were
identified which were analyzed on criteria like software used, size of the items,
contents included, languages, description and country. Findings suggested that
DSpace and EPrints are commonly used open source software for institutional
repositories. IGNOU posted the maximum number of items and Science and
Technology items are maximum in India.
Sawant, S (2009)157 studied the Indian efforts towards open access movement
with special reference to institutional repositories. She examined institutional
repositories developed in India from two perspectives: IR Development and
Management and Users of institutions having IR.
Wani, Z., Gul, S & Rah, J (2009)158 overviewed the development of open access
repositories registered with OpenDOAR database. The researchers study the

and institutional repositories have brought in the scholarly publishing scenario at
the international level and their impact on libraries and librarianship.
Gutam, S., Mishra, A., Pandey, P. & Hariharan, C (2010)160 discussed the growth
of open access repositories in the country. The data collected from the Registry of
Open Access Repositories (ROAR) and Internet suggests that there is a
remarkable growth of open access repositories since 2004 after taking call from
Budapest Open Access Initiative and Berlin declaration. They identified 68 open
access repositories from India, out of which 11, were listed in the top 800
repositories of the web of world repositories. The researchers concluded that even
in the absence of any national open access policy, the institutions, academies and
scholars have contributed to the open access movement in India.
Page 55

Kumar, V and Chitra, S (2010)161 discussed Open Content Licences (OCL) in the
digital content distribution. Some popular OCL are also mentioned. The paper
concludes mentioning that more business models should be introduced for open
content distribution to attract more content development.
Thaker, U & Oza, N (2010)162 described Institutional Repository as an
indispensable tool for knowledge management process. The researchers reestablished

Dr.S.R.Ranganathan‘s

philosophy

mechanisms in contemporary digital arena.
Beena, C & Archana, N (2011)163 described the real time experience of managing
and sharing of intellectual wealth of academia of Cochin University of Science
&Technology (CUSAT) by using open source platforms. The researchers explore
different intellectual information resources in the current era and also aim to
suggest cost effective strategy of implementing new open access tools and
technology for effective managing of intellectual informatics.
Mukherjee, B and Nazim, M (2011)164 analyzed the present trend of institutional
archives worldwide. The factual data of each individual repository was collected
from various Directories of Institutional Repositories using survey method. Data
was analyzed in terms of quantity of institutional archives increased during 2006
to 2010, country-wise contents of institutional archives, host domains, and policy
of institutional archives. The results of the study suggest health growth in terms
of quantity of institutional archives‘ increase worldwide. The researcher also
found that the development is more prevalent in developed countries than in
developing countries.
Krishnamurthy, M & Kemparaju, T (2011)165 studied the Institutional
Repositories (IRs) in use in Indian Universities and research institutes. The
twenty repositories studied covered collections of diverse types. The researchers
found that in spite of presence of various elite institutions in India, the growth of
Page 56

institutional repositories in Indian Universities has not been of the desired level,
the institutions lack expertise and resources required to set up IRs.
Kumar, S, Singh, S & Karisiddappa, C.R. (2011)166 identified two major roles of
institutional repositories. The first role is of ‗a catalyst‘ since it helps in reforming
scholarly communication and second one is ‗enhancing visibility of research and
prestige of the organization by preserving the intellectual resources of the
institutes.‘ The authors have an attempt to explore institutional repositories from
these two major perspectives and to study the various roles played by the stake
holders in reforming scholarly communication process.
Sawant, S (2011)167 studied various issues concerning the institutional repository
software involved in development of IRs in India. The research findings showed
that 79% of IRs used DSpace Software. End-user interface was found to be the
top ranking IR system feature. She also found that in India many institutions
conduct workshops to train library professionals and non-professionals to develop
IR using DSpace.
Bhat, M.H. (2014)168 explored various types of research materials in Indian
institutional repositories. The study revealed that barring a few repositories the
collections of most of the repositories are very low. The percentage of archived
materials is high for journal papers, and moderate for conference papers/thesis.
However findings also show that percentage of archiving is very low for
preprints/working papers, teaching resources and patents.

development base in both the governmental and private sectors in all areas of
science and technology with a special focus on Indian Universities. The
researcher found that in India there is a wide gap in urban and rural attitude. Also,
efforts of open archives and open access initiatives have to be consolidated and
have a long way to go.
Ghosh, S & Das, A (2006)174 provided information about the present state of
open access literature by various Indian institutions. The study is conducted by
bifurcating the open access initiative according to Institutional Repositories,
Open access journals, Metadata Harvesting Services and Open Courseware. The
results indicated that providing global access to local research is a challenge in
India. Also, the usage statistics of some repositories show that the researchers of
developed nations are accessing the Indian literature available in the open access
journals and archives.

maximizing the visibility, and thus the uptake and use, of Indian research outputs.
The mechanisms to provide open access to scholarly communications,
impediments to Open Access in India, and how self-archiving can provide a boost
to open access movement has been highlighted in this document. The author
argues that it is important to emphasize that only mandatory policies work well.
Sawant, S (2009)183 gathered data related to open access journal initiatives in
India with respect to its type, funding agency/host organization, full text
availability, article charges etc. Results show that all 178 open access journals
were peer reviewed, indexed and abstracted in various indexing and abstracting
services, listed with DOAR and Open J-Gate.
Senthilkumar, R & Krishnamoorthy, E (2009)184 mentioned open access system
as one of the best practices to be implemented in library and information centre
especially in college and university libraries. The authors believe that

CHAPTER 3
OPEN ACCESS REPOSITORIES: A HISTORICAL REVIEW
3.1 Introduction:
Internet with the help of harvesting techniques and search engines makes it
possible for the user to discover publications of relevance if they are deposited in
Open Access Repositories. Open access pattern was mainly developed in order to
remove the barrier between information produced and the clientele of
information. Open Access (OA) means that electronic scholarly articles can be
accessed anywhere, anytime, by anyone without the limitations of time and space.
OA facilitates increase in citations and flow of ideas by widespread dissemination
of electronic documents that was not possible so easily with the print formats. It
helps in international intellectual collaboration of ideas, knowledge and
information.

3.2 History of Open Access (OA):
Simeon Warner1in his presentation during symposium on ―Free Culture and the
Digital Library‖ in October 2005 traced back the history of open access to the
beginning of arXiv, the first major pre-print archive in 1990s. This archive
initially aimed to facilitate the sharing of pre-print articles between scholars in the
high-energy theoretical physics community, expanded to subjects including
mathematics, computer science and quantitative biology, as well as many other
branches of physics. Email was the most common technique used to distribute
pre-prints of articles between interested scholars and research groups, but arXiv
provided a place where these pre-prints could be deposited, organised and
subsequently disclosed to the wider community. Originally both deposit and
distribution was also by email, though this was quickly followed by ftp and not
long after by Web interfaced to support this interaction. arXiv proved that

Page 92

Internet and the Web can be used to disseminate scholarly communication in
various ways.
As mentioned by Chris Awre2, ―the success of arXiv stimulated similar activity in
other subject fields like CogPrints, covering psychology, linguistics, neuroscience
and computer science; RePEc, focused on economics; and the NDLTD,
addressing the disclosure of theses and dissertations. The increasing number
proved that it would be valuable for open access archives to cooperate to enable
easier access across them by researchers and others wishing to access their
contents. In October 1999 a meeting in Santa Fe, USA led to the Santa Fe
Convention of the Open Archives Initiative, subsequently renamed the Open
Archives Initiative (OAI) and its Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH),
now at version 2.0. The Initiative is a series of organisational principles and
technical specifications to facilitate a level of interoperability between e-print
archives. The underlying mechanism to enable interoperability is metadata
harvesting, where metadata from different e-print archives can be harvested into a
central service or services that can then be searched independently.‖

3.3 What is Open Access (OA):
a) Stevan Harnad, world‘s most famous Open Access Advocates states that
―Open Access(OA) is free, immediate, permanent online access to the full text
of research articles for anyone, webwide.‖3
b) The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) further
extended Harnad‘s definition as ―Open Access means free, immediate,
availability on the public internet of those works which scholars give to the
world without expectation of payment-permitting any user to read, download,
copy, distribute, print, search or link to the full text of these articles, crawl
them for indexing, pass them as data to software or use them for any other
lawful purpose.‖4 The definition of Open Access by SPARC explains the
meaning of OA by covering various aspects of OA.
Page 93

3.4 Types of Open Access:
According to Keith Jeffery5, OA can be delivered in two ways:
 'green': the author can self-archive at the time of submission of the publication
(the 'green' route) whether the publication is grey literature (usually internal
non-peer-reviewed), a peer-reviewed journal publication, a peer-reviewed
conference proceedings paper or a monograph
 'gold': the author or author institution can pay a fee to the publisher at
publication time, the publisher thereafter making the material available 'free' at
the point of access (the 'gold' route). The two are not, of course, incompatible
and can co-exist.
The 'green' route makes publications available freely in parallel with any
publication system but is not, itself, publishing. The 'gold' route is one example of
electronic publishing. At present it is much more common to have non-OA
electronic access to publications in a publisher's database for a subscription fee.
The second dimension to be distinguished is the timing and quality aspect:
preprints are pre-peer-review articles, post-prints are post-peer-review and postpublication articles while eprints can be either but in electronic form.
A third dimension is white/grey literature. White literature is peer-reviewed,
published articles while grey is preprints or internal 'know-how' material.

3.5 Benefits of Open Access:
According to Budapest Open Access Initiative6 (2001) ―removing access barriers
will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the
poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay
the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and
quest for knowledge.‖

Page 94

The benefits of open access can be studied according to the various components
which will be beneficial by opting for Open Access regarding the documents. The
major components of an Open Access System are Researchers (whose articles,
ETDs, pre-prints, post-prints etc. are disseminated through open access),
Educational Institutions (Institutions who opt for putting their organisational
resources for open access), Business (organisations who work in the process of
providing open access), Public and Research Funders (Institutions/ organisations
who fund research work).
3.5.1 SPARC explained the benefits of Open Access including all the five
beneficiaries of Open Access7a) Researchers

3.5.2 Benefits of Open Access-SPARC Europe
SPARC Europe8 which is a membership organization for European research
libraries and research organizations also mentioned the benefits of Open Access
or No Restricted Access to research and data by discussing it from the point of
view of various stakeholders in the system of scholarly communication.
1) Researchers as authors: immediate visibility for research output and thus
increased visibility and usage of their results. Open Access may even lead
to an increase of impact.
2) Researchers looking for information: access to literature everywhere, not
only from a campus but also from any site with Wi-Fi access.
3) Funding agencies: increased return on investment (ROI), increased
visibility.
4) Universities & research institutes: greater visibility, clearer
management information.
5) Libraries: increased access for target audience, financially a more
attractive model than the current subscription model.
6) Teachers & students: unrestricted access to material, enriched education,
allowing equality of learning in poor as well as in rich nations.
7) Science: enhanced and accelerated research cycle.
8) Citizens & society: access to knowledge / access to the results of publicly
funded research.
9) Enterprises: access to critical information.
10) Publishers: transparent business model, ultimate online article distribution,
ultimate visibility for articles.

3.5.3 UNESCO’s Policy Guidelines for the Development and Promotion of Open
Access (2012)
UNESCO‘s Policy Guidelines provides basic explanation of Open Access and
related policies. It mentioned the following benefits of Open Access 9 :


Open Access improves the speed, efficiency and efficacy of research



Open Access is an enabling factor in interdisciplinary research



Open Access enables computation upon the research literature



Open Access increases the visibility, usage and impact of research



Open Access allows the professional, practitioner and business communities,
and the interested public, to benefit from research

3.5.4 The National Open Access Policy for Developing Countries- Bangalore,
India
The Policy discusses the benefits of open access from the Researcher and
Country‘s point of view whose researchers submit their documents for open
access.10
A) Benefits of Open Access to (Country‘s Name):
 [Country-name's] research will be more accessible to global researchers,
hence better known and more widely used and cited. The prestige of
[country-name] researchers will increase significantly.
 All [country-name] research will be open to all [country-name]
entrepreneurs and the general public with Internet access. This will be
beneficial both commercially and culturally.
 Access, usage and citation data on this research will increasingly become
available for analysis to help shape researchers', institutions' and nations'
strategies and policies.
B) Benefits of Open Access to Researcher:
 As authors, researchers benefit because their research papers are given a
much wider dissemination and can be read without restriction by anyone
with Internet access. This increases the impact of their research. Indeed,
Page 97

evidence is accumulating to show that open access articles are cited 25250% more than non-open access articles from the same journal and year.
 As readers, researchers benefit because they will increasingly be able to
access and use the full text of all the research published in their area, not
just the research available to them via the subscriptions their institution can
afford. This is particularly important where neighbouring countries share
common problems and need to collaborate in their research effort.
3.5.5 Benefits of Open Access by Alma Swan
Alma Swan11 identified the advantages of Open Access based on the results
obtained from tests being conducted to identify the Open Access Citation
Advantage for increasing the visibility, findability, accessibility of research
articles in the following ways:
a) A General OA advantage: The advantage that comes from citable articles
becoming available to audiences that had not had access to them before, and
who would find them citable.
b) An Early Advantage: the earlier an article is put before its worldwide
potential audience may affect subsequent citation patterns
c) A Selection Bias: authors make their better articles Open Access more readily
than their poorer articles.
d) A Quality Advantage: better articles gain more from the General OA
Advantage because they are by definition more citable than poorer articles.

3.6 Barriers to Open Access:
In spite of various benefits experienced by the researchers and institutions from
open access, there are many researchers and institutions that are reluctant to
deposit their documents for open access. Advocates of open access have studied
the barriers that create unwillingness of researchers/ institutions to submit their
research work and other documents for open access.
Keith Jeffery12 identified two major barriers to open access-

Page 98



Loss of publisher income: The major objection to 'green' self-archiving comes
from publishers and learned societies (many of which depend on subscriptions
to their publications) who fear that 'green' OA threatens their business
viability. To date there is no evidence that 'green' archiving harms the business
model of publishing. There is evidence that 'green' archiving increases
utilisation, citation and impact of a publication. Whilst the major commercial
publishers provide additional value-added services that could offset the impact
of OA on current business models, the impact on learned societies may require
new business models to be developed.



Copyright: Copyright agreements between authors and publishers may inhibit
the 'green' route. However, to date, between 80 and 90% of publication
channels (the variability depends on exactly what is counted) allow 'green'
author deposit although some insist on an embargo period before the
publication is available for OA. In contrast some publishers of journals - of
which 'Nature' is the most well-known - do not demand copyright from the
author but merely a licence to publish, leaving copyright with the author or
their institution.

Mathias Klang13 (2009) conducted action research in Lund University, Sweden to
explore the barriers to open access to scientific research output in Sweden. The
action research was conducted by interviewing Librarians of nine University
Librarians of Sweden. The interviews reflected different areas of concern which
can be divided into the following groups:
1) Copyright Concerns
2) Research Culture
3) Administrative Concerns
4) University Context
5) Legal Culture
6) Information Needs

Page 99

1) Copyright Concerns:
All the interviewees identified copyright as a major source of concernin their
everyday work. The main source of trouble was the lack of information about
the copyright and copyright licenses and their interpretation in everyday
working of library. The concern with copyright was more serious among the
libraries that had a larger amount of researchers and a well-functioning selfarchiving system. However, even the smaller universities expressed concern
with the complexities of copyright in relation to their everyday work.
Some of the universities also expressed concerns that they did not have access
to sources of legal advice. Libraries without access to university legal
departments felt that the lack of such a function was an important flaw in the
organisation in relation to copyright. Libraries with access to university legal
departments felt that these departments tended not to resolve the issues at
hand and felt a need for a more specialized legal position dedicated towards
copyright.
2) Research Culture:
The interviewees also informed about the preference of researchers to publish
their research work in traditional journals rather than opting for open access.
The interviewees also mentioned that the researchers used to get convinced
after all the benefits of open access were explained to them. But it was
difficult to reach out to the researchers since information sent via e-mail was
highly ignored. Personal meetings or group meetings were much useful to
make understand the benefits of open access.
3) Administrative Concerns:
Major administrative concerns identified were to motivate researchers to
deposit their research work in open access system. Also, it was found that
wherever data was not input my librarian, lot of errors used to take place in
the metadata stage. The final administrative concern was with archiving the
publications that contained copyrighted material.

Page 100

4) University Context:
The differences in size, age, organization, and culture of the universities all
affected the way in which the adoption of open access was proceeding at the
different universities. All these factors affect the way in which the university
can demand action from its researchers and the way in which the researchers
will react towards the demands.
5) Legal Culture:
Universities without access to legal departments felt that they had no one to
understand their needs however universities with legal departments said that
no one could ever understand the library need and importance of copyright
from the point of view of library. In most cases, the universities have a
reliance on the copyright licenses entered into between the university and the
researcher guaranteeing that the researcher has the right to archive and that all
copyrightable material in the publication is there with permission. However in
some cases the legal administration of these licenses is carried to such
extremes that open access is possible in theory but in practice it is difficult to
implement
6) Information Needs:
Many of the interviewees felt that the resources allocated towards open access
were adequate. What was missing was reaching researchers and
administrators with more information. It was felt that this information in itself
would convince the readers that open access was a worthwhile activity.
These informational needs could be broken down into different types of
information. Many interviewees felt that a copyright helpdesk was necessary;
others felt that additional documentation was required to educate both
librarians and researchers. Many pointed to the lack of courses and seminars
that needed to be held in this area.
From the above mentioned barriers as figured out and explained by Jeffery and
Klang, it can be seen that Copyright Issue is one of the major and most important
factor causing barrier in depositing and disseminating scholarly information
through open access. Researchers and institutions are very concerned about the
Page 101

copyright infringement that takes place when the document is distributed through
open access. Also, researchers especially in social sciences prefer publications in
traditional print journals rather than opting for open access electronic journal. In
order to prevent the infringement, plagiarism software can be deployed which will
detect the unauthorized usage of research work.

3.7 Efforts towards Open Access Initiative (OAI):
3.7.1

International Efforts

A) Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI)-14th February 2002, Budapest,
Hungary14, 15
The Budapest Open Access Initiative defined Open Access for the first time.
By Open Access to literature, they meant ‗free availability on the public
internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search,
or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as
data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial,
legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to
the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and
the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control
over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and
cited‘.
The initiative mentioned that removing access barriers to the scholarly
literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the
rich with the poor and the poor with the rich make this literature as useful as it
can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual
conversation and quest for knowledge.
The Open Society Institute, the foundation network founded by philanthropist
George Soros, is committed to providing initial help and funding to realize this
goal. It will use its resources and influence to extend and promote institutional
self-archiving, to launch new open-access journals, and to help an open-access
Page 102

journal system become economically self-sustaining. While the Open Society
Institute's commitment and resources are substantial, this initiative is very
much in need of other organizations to lend their effort and resources.
BOAI invited governments, universities, libraries, journal editors, publishers,
foundations, learned societies, professional associations, and individual
scholars who share our vision to join us in the task of removing the barriers to
open access and building a future in which research and education in every
part of the world are that much freer to flourish.
B) ECHO (European Cultural Heritage Online) Charter- 200216
The ECHO initiative has been motivated by the observation that, at present,
information relevant to cultural heritage still plays only a marginal role in the
Internet: the number one medium for current and future scientific work,
communication and general archiving. The basic idea of the ECHO-initiative
therefore is to establish an open-source culture of the public and scholarly
exploitation of cultural heritage on the Internet. This idea comprises the
promotion of content-driven technology in information management.
The long-term vision of ECHO is that of an electronic representation of the
European cultural heritage on the web which will make it more widely
available than ever before in its history and thus strengthen its function as a
bond of the European community. In addition, this vision also includes a new
perspective on the ways in which electronically represented sources of cultural
heritage can be explored from a scholarly point of view, eventually
overcoming traditional, medium-based boundaries between disciplines in
favour of an overarching study of the underlying cultural worlds. The longterm vision of ECHO finally comprises the expectation that a content-driven
innovation of information technology will provide a new driving force for
technological development in Europe.

C) Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing- Released on 20th June
200317
The following statements of principle were drafted during a one-day meeting
held on April 11, 2003 at the headquarters of the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The purpose of the document is to
stimulate discussion within the biomedical research community on how to
proceed, as rapidly as possible, to the widely held goal of providing open
access to the primary scientific literature. Their main aim was to agree on
significant, concrete steps that all relevant parties —the organizations that
foster and support scientific research, the scientists that generate the research
results, the publishers who facilitate the peer-review and distribution of results
of the research, and the scientists, librarians and other who depend on access
to this knowledge— can take to promote the rapid and efficient transition to
open access publishing.
The document is divided into four sections:
1) Definition of Open Access PublicationAn Open Access Publication is one that meets the following two
conditions:
i)

The author(s) and copyright holder(s) grant(s) to all users a free,
irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual right of access to, and a license to
copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the work publicly and to
make and distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any
responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship, as well
as the right to make small numbers of printed copies for their personal
use.

ii)

A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials,
including a copy of the permission as stated above, in a suitable
standard electronic format is deposited immediately upon initial
publication in at least one online repository that is supported by an
academic institution, scholarly society, government agency, or other
well-established organization that seeks to enable open access,
unrestricted distribution, interoperability, and long-term archiving (for
the biomedical sciences, PubMed Central is such a repository).

3) Statement of the Libraries & Publishers Working Group
4) Statement of Scientists and Scientific Societies Working Group
D) Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and
Humanities- October 200318
In accordance with the spirit of the Declaration of the Budapest Open Access
Initiative, the ECHO Charter and the Bethesda Statement on Open Access
Publishing, Berlin Declaration was drafted to promote the Internet as a
functional instrument for a global scientific knowledge base and human
reflection and to specify measures which research policy makers, research
institutions, funding agencies, libraries, archives and museums need to
consider.
In order to realize the vision of a global and accessible representation of
knowledge, the future Web has to be sustainable, interactive, and transparent.
Content and software tools must be openly accessible and compatible.
Open access contributions must satisfy two conditions:
1. The author(s) and right holder(s) of such contributions grant(s) to all users
a free, irrevocable, worldwide, right of access to, and a license to copy,
use, distribute, transmit and display the work publicly and to make and
distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any responsible
purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship (community standards,
will continue to provide the mechanism for enforcement of proper
attribution and responsible use of the published work, as they do now), as
well as the right to make small numbers of printed copies for their personal
use.
2. A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials, including a
copy of the permission as stated above, in an appropriate standard
electronic format is deposited (and thus published) in at least one online
repository using suitable technical standards (such as the Open Archive
definitions)that is supported and maintained by an academic institution,
Page 105

scholarly society, government agency,or other well established organization
that seeks to enable open access, unrestricted distribution, inter-operability,
and long-term archiving.
E) Salvador Declaration on Open Access: The Developing Perspective,
Brazil-September 200519
Participants of the International Seminar on Open Access for Developing
Countries, Salvador, Brazil in September 2005 discussed various benefits of
open access especially for developing countries and planned to work together
to ensure that scientific information is openly accessible and freely available
to all. They mentioned that,
1) Scientific and technological research is essential for social and economic
development.
2) Scientific communication is a crucial and inherent part of the activities of
research and development. Science advances more effectively when there
is unrestricted access to scientific information.
3) More broadly, open access enables education and use of scientific
information by the public.
4) In a world that is increasingly globalized, with science claiming to be
universal, exclusion from access to information is not acceptable. It is
important that access be considered as a universal right, independent of
any region.
5) Open Access must facilitate developing countries' active participation in
the worldwide exchange of scientific information, including free access to
the heritage of scientific knowledge, effective participation in the process
of generation and dissemination of knowledge, and strengthening the
coverage of topics of direct relevance to developing countries.
6) Developing countries already have pioneering initiatives that promote
Open Access and therefore they should play an important role in shaping
Open Access worldwide.
The international community members urged governments to make Open
Access a high priority in science policies including:

Page 106



requiring that publicly funded research is made available through Open
Access;



considering the cost of publication as part of the cost of research;



strengthening the local OA journals, repositories and other relevant
initiatives;



promoting integration of developing countries scientific information in the
worldwide body of knowledge.

F) UNESCO’s Policy Guidelines for the Development and Promotion of
Open Access-201220
The Constitution of UNESCO in Article I, Clause 2 mentions that ―UNESCO
maintains increases and diffuses knowledge; encourages cooperation among
the nations in all branches of intellectual activity and initiates methods of
international cooperation.‖ The overall objective of the Policy Guidelines is to
promote Open Access in Member States by facilitating understanding of all
relevant issues related to Open Access. Specifically, it is expected that the
document shall:


Enable Member State institutions to review their position on access to
scientific information in the light of the Policy Guidelines;



Assist in the choice of appropriate OA policy in the specific contexts of
Member States; and



Facilitate adoption of OA policy in research funding bodies and
institutions by integrating relevant issues in the national research systems.

UNESCO supported the development and distribution of Micro CDS/ISIS
(Information Storage and Retrieval Software) and Greenstone Digital Library
Software.

3.7.2

National Efforts:

A) National Open Access Policy for Developing Countries21
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (India) organised two days‘ Workshop
on Electronic Publishing and Open Access from 2-3 November 2006. It was
supported by the Open Society Institute.
The Bangalore workshop was convened to bring together policy makers and
research scientists from major developing countries to agree a path forward
towards adopting full Open Access to publicly-funded research publications.
The importance of access to the world‘s research information for the
development of a strong economy and a vibrant research capability is widely
acknowledged, yet financial barriers limit access by developing countries to
the research information they need. Equally, the unique research carried out in
countries representing 80% of the world‘s population is largely ‗invisible‘ to
international science because of economic or other constraints. The resolution
of many of the world‘s problems, such as emerging infectious diseases,
environmental disasters, HIV/AIDS or climate change, cannot be achieved
without incorporation of the research from developing countries into the
global knowledge pool.
Building on the Budapest Open Access Initiative recommendations, and past
Declarations of commitments to the strategy of Open Access, particularly the
Salvador International Declaration on Open Access for Developing Countries,
and recognising the benefits that Open Access will bring to the strengthening
of science, participants to the Workshop agreed the following model National
Open Access Policy for Developing Countries.
According to the National Open Access Policy for Developing Countries,
―The [country-name] Government/Government Department expects the
authors of papers reporting publicly-funded research to maximise the
accessibility, usage and applications of their findings.‖

Page 108

To this end:
As a condition for research funding, the [country-name] Government:
a) requires electronic copies of any research papers that have been accepted
for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and are supported in whole or
in part by Government funding, to be deposited in an institutional digital
repository [IR] immediately upon acceptance for publication;
b) encourages Government Grant Holders to provide Open Access to their
deposited papers immediately upon deposit;
c) encourages Government Grant Holders to publish in a suitable Open
Access Journal where one exists.
The National Policy also discussed benefits of open access to scientific
research, research institutes, universities, authors and readers (previously
covered in 3.5). Also, methods to implement the policies are mentioned in
form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
B) National Knowledge Commission’s Report of the Working Group on
Open Access and Open Educational Resources-200522
As the world of information is relentlessly growing, India has opportunity to
participate as one of the forerunners in development of knowledge and
economy. This development cannot be achieved without improvement in the
higher education system. To serve this purpose, the National Knowledge
Commission (NKC) made few recommendations to the then Prime Minister of
India. This report can serve as valuable tool to improve the access to and
quality of our higher education system.
One of the many steps NKC recommends to address these pressing problems
is to increase the amount of Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open
Access (OA).Indian students will have access to previously inaccessible
information as well as the knowledge on how to access global educational
resources.

Page 109

Open Educational Resources (OER):
Open Educational Resources can be defined as free and open digital
publications of high quality materials organized as courses that include
lectures, related reading materials, snapshots of discussions, assignments,
evaluations, etc. Access to these resources radically breaks down the barriers
to quality education and allows everyone to access course material that is
prepared and evaluated by experts. OER material has been prepared in an open
standard format and is interactive in nature.
Several universities in the United States are involved in Open Educational
Resources generation. These include MIT, Utah State University, Carnegie
Mellon, Yale, Johns Hopkins University, etc. Australian and Chinese
universities are also participating in the development of open educational
resources.
In India, the major initiatives for creating open educational tools and resources
are National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) carried out
by seven IITs, the Indian Institute of Science, and other premier institutions
around the country and being funded by the Human Resource Ministry.
 Eklavya Project Launched by IIT Bombay
 E-Grid supported by Human Resource Ministry at IIIT, Kerala.
The working group suggests the creation of the Institute for Virtual
Knowledge Resources and Management (VIKRAM) to monitor and support
the implementation, adoption and sustainability of the network-based
education resources. The activity and approach recommended here engages
multiple areas (IT, education, research, innovation etc.). Therefore, it is
imperative that VIKRAM while having linkages to existing educational and IT
organizations remain independent.
Open Access Resources:
Open Access is a term used to describe published academic papers, books,
reports, and other periodicals that are electronically available to readers
without financial or technological barriers. The importance of open access for
fundamental as well as applied research and education cannot be over
Page 110

emphasized. India has done fairly well in the Open Access area by making 81
scientific journals accessible under OA. The Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore, is coordinating the Digital Library of India project along with
Carnegie Mellon University. In this project, 21 other Indian institutions are
also participating and have digitized more than450,000 books, out of which
220,000 books are now web-accessible.
The working group, after taking into consideration the current status of Open
Access in India and worldwide, has the following recommendations to
increase Open Access content from India, increase the public awareness and
utilization of OA material.
1) On a policy level, all research articles published by Indian authors receiving
any government or public funding must be made available under Open Access
and should be archived in the standard OA format on his/her website. Further,
as a national academic OA portal is developed, these same research articles
should be made available through this portal.
2) The government should allocate specific funding to increase the current
digitization efforts of books and periodicals which are outside copyright
protection.
3) Separate funding should be allocated to develop a new higher quality OCR
software package so that new and old fonts in many different Indian languages
can be converted into ASCII code.
4) A training program needs to be developed to take the materials available under
Open Access to remote towns and villages. One possible mechanism for this is
to outfit a vehicle with mobile internet connectivity and a high speed printer
and binder. With these resources, the ―OA‖ vehicle could travel to rural
locations, print and bind the book or material requisitioned by the users at the
location, and charge the users only the cost necessary for printing and binding.
5) On a systemic level, our nation‘s universities and various academic
institutions need high bandwidth connections and a national backbone which
will provide advanced networking capabilities. There is an urgent need to
develop Indian Research and Education Network/ Knowledge Network where
each connected institution will have at least 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps connectivity.

Page 111

6) This level of connectivity will not only advance the OA activities nationally,
but provide global connectivity as well.
The above mentioned recommendations of various national and international
Working Groups and Declarations prove that Open Access movement has gained
its momentum in the scholarly world. Developing countries too have stepped into
the movement and are trying hard to set up a system and create awareness about
the benefits of open access. Institutions across the world have joined the Open
Access Revolution and the researcher hopes that very soon all the research work
done will be available through open access without any embargo.

3.8 Open Access Institutional Repositories:
Alma Swan23 mentions that ―Institutional repositories are digital collections of the
outputs created within a university or research institution. Whilst the purposes of
repositories may vary (for example, some universities have teaching/learning
repositories for educational materials), in most cases they are established to
provide Open Access to the institution‘s research output and this is the focus
here.‖
According to Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR)24 and Directory of
Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR)25 there are currently more than 3790
institutional repositories across the world.
3.8.1 Advantages of Institutional Repositories:
In briefing paper on Open Access Institutional Repositories, Alma Swan26
mentioned the following purposes and benefits for an institution1) Opens up the outputs of the university to the world
2) Maximises the visibility and impact of these outputs as a result
3) Showcases the university to interested constituencies – prospective staff,
prospective students and otherstakeholders
4) Collects and curates digital outputs
5) Manages and measures research and teaching activities

Page 112

6) Provides a workspace for work-in-progress, and for collaborative or largescale projects
7) Enables and encourages interdisciplinary approaches to research
8) Facilitates the development and sharing of digital teaching materials and aids
9) Supports student endeavours, providing access to theses and dissertations and
a location for the development of e-portfolios
3.8.2 What do Institutional Repositories Contain?
ROAR and OpenDOAR have classified the Institutional repositories according
to the following types of documents Articles
 Journals
 Books & Monographs
 Conference Proceedings
 Datasets
 Learning & Teaching Objects
 Multimedia
 Patents
 References
 Software
 Theses
 Unpublished
 Demonstration
 Web Observatory
3.8.3

Open Source Software (OSS) Packages Used for a Repository:

3.8.3.1

Concept of Open Source Software
OSS can be defined from different point of views to reflect string of ideas
in the field. According to Chudnov27,

a.

An OSS is typically created and maintained by developers crossing
constitutional and national boundaries, collaborating by using internet
based communication and development tools.

Page 113

b.

Output is generally a certain kind of ‗free‘, often through a license that
specifies that applications and source code are free to use, modify and
redistribute it as long as all user modifications are similarly licensed.

c.

Quality, not profit drives open source developers who take personal pride
in seeing their working solution adopted

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) identified ten criteria for a software product
to be called open source. They are:
1) Free distribution
2) Source Code
3) Derived Works
4) Integrity of the Author‘s Source Code
5) No discrimination against persons or groups
6) No discrimination against fields of endeavour
7) Distribution of license
8) License must not be specific to a product
9) The license must not restrict other software
10) The license must be technology neutral
3.8.3.2 Various OSS Packages:
There are several open source software packages used for developing
institutional repositories. There are 153 open source software listed in
OpenDOAR, of which some of them are explained below:
1) DSpace28, 29
In March 2000, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) awarded $1.8 million to
the MIT Libraries for an18-month collaboration to build DSpace™, a
dynamic repository for the intellectual output in digital formats of multidisciplinary research organizations. HP Labs and MIT Libraries released
the system worldwide on November 4, 2002, under the terms of open
source license. As faculty and other researchers develop research materials
and scholarly publications in increasingly complex digital formats, there is
a need to collect, preserve, index and distribute them: a time-consuming
Page 114

and expensive chore for individual faculty and their departments, labs, and
centres to manage themselves. The DSpace system provides a way to
manage these research materials and publications in a professionally
maintained repository to give them greater visibility and accessibility over
time.
DSpace uses a qualified Dublin Core metadata standard for describing
items intellectually (specifically, the Libraries Working Group Application
Profile). Only three fields are required: title, language, and submission date,
all other fields are optional. There are additional fields for document
abstracts, keywords, technical metadata and rights metadata, among others.
According to the ROAR and OpenDOAR, 1472 institutional repositories
(as on 26th July 2014) are developed using DSpace Platform. It is the most
preferred open source software package for institutional repositories.
2) EPrints 30, 31
EPrints is the first free and open source software package for building open
access repositories that are compliant with the Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. It shares many of the features commonly
seen in document management systems, but is primarily used for
institutional repositories and scientific journals. EPrints has been developed
at the University of Southampton School of Electronics and Computer
Science and released under a GPL License.
EPrints was created in 2000 as a direct outcome of the 1999 Santa Fe
meeting. Version 3 of the software was officially released in during the
Open Repositories Conference in San Antonio, Texas on the 24th of
January 2007.
Other than DSPace it is the most widely used open source software used for
institutional repository. According to the ROAR and OpenDOAR, 532
institutional repositories (as on 26th July 2014) are developed using DSpace
Platform.
Page 115

3) Bepress (Berkeley Electronic Press)32
Bepress was developed in 1999 by UC Berkeley Professors Robert Cooter,
Aaron Edlin, and Ben Hermalin. Bepress began by developing an
innovative online editorial management system specifically designed to
make peer-review workflow as quick and easy as possible. The statistics
available in ROAR shows that all over the world 326 Institutional
Repositories (as on 26th July 2014) are developed Bepress Platform.
To address the broader crisis in scholarly communications, Bepress then set
out to provide authors and universities with a solution for them to share
their research openly and widely. Thus Bepress pioneered Digital
Commons, a software service that is now the leading hosted institutional
repository (IR).
4) Digital Commons33
Digital Commons is the leading hosted institutional repository (IR)
software platform. It offers the features of a traditional IR as well as
professional-grade publishing software, management tools, and individual
faculty and researcher pages to promote and disseminate scholarship and
serve academia.Institutional repositories, regardless of platform, require
lots of customizations. Digital Commons repositories can be customized
and tailored to users‘ diverse needs. In addition, users are fully supported
during the entire repository lifecycle: development, implementation,
maintenance, and upgrades. According to OpenDOAR, 126 institutional
repositories (as on 26th July 2014) are developed on Digital Commons
platform.
5) Fedora34
Fedora digital object repository management system is based on the
Flexible Extensible Digital Object and Repository Architecture (Fedora). It
is a Linux-based operating system. One can use Fedora in addition to, or
instead of, other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows™ or Mac
Page 116

OS X™. Fedora is sponsored by Red Hat, the world's most trusted provider
of open source technology. Red Hat invests in Fedora to encourage
collaboration and incubate innovative new free software technologies.
Fedora software development began in 1997 as a DARPA and NSF funded
research project at Cornell University. The University of Virginia and
Cornell University jointly developed Fedora with funding provided by a
grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The software is flexible
enough for serving variety of digital documents with different
functionalities such as digital asset management, institutional repositories,
digital archives, content management systems, scholarly publishing
enterprises, digital libraries etc.
First version of Fedora was released in November 2003. Recently in April
2014, Fedora Version 21 was released. According to ROAR, 43
institutional repositories (as on 27th July 2014) are built using Fedora Open
Source Software.
6) Greenstone35
Greenstone is produced by the New Zealand Digital Library Project at the
University of Waikato. It is developed and distributed in cooperation
with UNESCO and

the Human

Info

NGO.

It

is open-

source, multilingual software, issued under the terms of the GNU General
Public License. The first version of Greenstone was made available during
1997. The use of Greenstone is very popular in developing countries as it is
very easy to create collections in Greenstone as well as it has one of the
important features of exporting collections on CD-ROM, this feature is
found very useful since in many places there is poor Internet connectivity.
It has helped libraries to carry whole collection on CD-ROM and CD-ROM
collections can run on standard PC. ROAR and OpenDOAR include 53
institutional repositories (as on 27th July 2014) developed on Greenstone
Software.

Page 117

7) DoKS (Document and Knowledge Sharing)36
DoKS is an open source project initiated by the library of the Katholieke
Hogeschool Kempen (KHK) during 2003 for organising electronic theses
and curricular vitae of Graduating students at Flemish University Colleges,
Belgium. The Project was funded by the Institute for the Promotion of
Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders, private industry
partners and non-profit organisations. DoKS software model is basically to
organise electronic thesis collection for the students passing from any
university. The software has an in-built unique feature of creating
curriculum vitae of all graduating students depending on the data of student
administration files.According to ROAR and OpenDOAR, 5 institutional
repositories (as on 29th July 2014) are built using DoKS Open Source
Software.
8) MyCoRe37, 38, 39
MyCoRe (MILESS Community Content Repository) is an open source
project which provides a system for creating digital libraries and content
repositories. It is developed at Essen University, Germany. The first official
version was launched during 2004. In the MyCoRe Project a group of
universities from Germany are working on the development of MyCoRe.
The technical base of the system is formed of Java class libraries, XML
technology and different database backend. ROAR &OpenDOAR have 8
institutional repositories(as on 29th July 2014) listed in their directories
which are developed using MyCoRe software.

9) ETD-db40
ETD-db has been developed by one or two developers at Virginia Tech,
and endorsed by the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations
(NDLTD). The development of the official release of this package paused

submission, archive and search tool. During 2000-2005, it was the most
widespread E-theses package in use, in part due to the support it has from
the NDLTD. ETD-db depends upon the Perl programming language and
the MySQL open source database system. ROAR & OpenDOAR have 14
institutional repositories (as on 29th July 2014) listed in their directories
which are developed using ETD-db software.
10) Drupal 41, 42
Drupal is a free and open-source content management framework written
in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is used as
a back-end framework for at least 2.1% of all websites worldwide ranging
from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites. It was
developed by Dries Buytaert as a message board and became an opensource project in 2001. According to ROAR and OpenDOAR, 15
institutional repositories (as on 29th July 2014) are built using Drupal Open
Source Software.

3.9 Open Access and Copyright:
The Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI)43 states that open access is
completely compatible with copyright. Copyright law gives the copyright holder
the right to make access open or restricted, and the BOAI seeks to put copyright in
the hands of authors or institutions that will consent to make access
open. Compatibility of open access and copyright is explained in more detailed
way by BOAI by discussing the issue with reference to self-archiving and open
access journals.
1. Self-archiving:
Authors of preprints hold the copyright to them and may post them to open
access archives with no copyright problems whatever. If the preprint is later
accepted for publication in a journal that requires authors to transfer copyright
to the publisher, then the journal may or may not give permission for the
Page 119

refereed post-print to be posted to an open access archive. If permission is
granted, then again there is no copyright problem. If permission is denied, then
the preprint may remain in the open access archive because it is a different
work from the post-print and the author never transferred the copyright on the
preprint. Moreover, the author may post to the archive a list of corrigenda, or
differences between the preprint and post-print. This is not quite as convenient
for readers as seeing the whole post-print online, but it provides them with the
equivalent of the full text of the post-print and is infinitely more useful than no
free access at all. For more details, see the section on self-archiving.
2. Journals:
Open access journals will either let authors retain copyright or ask authors to
transfer copyright to the publisher. In either case, the copyright holder will
consent to open access for the published work. When the publisher holds the
copyright, it will consent to open access directly. When authors hold the
copyright, they will insure open access by signing a license to the publisher
authorizing open access. Publishers of open-access journals will have such
licenses already prepared for authors. There are many ways to write such a
license.
The BOAI does not advocate open access for copyrighted literature against the
will of the copyright holder or in violation of copyright law. Nor does it advocate
any change in copyright law. It seeks to maximize open access within existing
copyright law, in accordance with the wishes of the copyright holders.

3.10 Summary:
The present chapter details the concept of ‗Open Access (OA)‘ by giving an
overview about history of open access, defining it, types of OA, explaining its
needs and barriers to open access . The needs and barriers are explained as
mentioned by SPARC Open access document.

Page 120

The development of open access roots back to various International Open Access
Policies like BOAI in 2002, ECHO Charter 2002, Bethesda Statement on Open
Access Publishing (2003), Berlin Declaration (2003) and Salvador Open Access
Policy for Developing Countries (2005). Depending on these international
policies, some national policies were also developed which promoted the open
access movement in the respective countries. For example in India, open access
got major encouragement due to National Open Access Policy for Developing
Countries-2006 (India) and National Knowledge Commission‘s Report on Open
Access-2005 (India).
The next section discusses the Open Access Institutional Repositories, its
advantages and the various popularly used open source software packages used
for building an institutional repository.
The concluding part of the chapter presented the issue of open access and
copyright based on the BOAI statement on Copyright, self-archiving and open
access journals.
The next chapter expounds the concept of one of the most important type of
content included in Open Access Repositories i.e. Electronic Thesis and
Dissertation (ETD) and will discuss various concepts related to ETD.

CHAPTER 4
E-THESIS REPOSITORIES: AN OVERVIEW
4.1 Introduction:
An ETD or Electronic Thesis & Dissertation is similar to traditional theses but
more appropriate for worldwide access and retrieval with the help of computer,
laptop, tablet, mobile phone etc. Depending on the nature of accessibility
provided, an ETD can be accessed anytime, anywhere. It helps in increasing the
visibility of the individual researcher as well as the institution involved in the
research work. The Networked Digital Library of Theses & Dissertations
(NDLTD) which is an international organization promotes the adoption, creation,
use, dissemination and preservation of electronic theses and dissertations in
various subjects and languages accessible through its union catalog. Since its
inception, ETD activities have always been associated with enhancing the quality
of education.

4.2 History of Electronic Thesis & Dissertation (ETD):
As mentioned by Edward Fox, Gail McMillan & V.Srinivasan1, the history of
ETDdates back to a Workshop in 1987 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, led by Nick
Altair of University Microfilms International (UMI), who was involved in the
Electronic Manuscript Project. The idea of marking up dissertations according to
Standard Generalized Mark-up Language Document Type Definition (SGML
DTD) was pursued by Virginia Tech working with SoftQuad, and led to perhaps
the first ETD in 1988. Virginia Tech‟s demonstration effort was initially
fundedby Gary Hooper of the Research Division. Still, making ETDs a common
practice had to wait for improved technology support, among other things.
The project could not be developed for few years, until 1991, when Virginia
Tech‟s Dean Gary Hooper financed further critical development. Before the
Page 127

release of the first version of PDF in 1992 and Adobe‟s Acrobat tool in 1993, a
Virginia Tech team comprising of John Eaton (Graduate School), Edward Fox
(Computer Science, Computing Center), and Gail McMillan (University
Libraries) began discussionsabout ETDs with Adobe and worked with a
pre‐release version of their software. The Coalition for Networked Information
(CNI) launched a discovery project guided by the Council of Graduate Schools,
UMI, and Virginia Tech to explore ETDs. Ten universities inthe United States
and Canada sent representatives from their graduate programs, libraries, and
computing/IT groups to an October 11, 1992, Design Meeting in Washington,
D.C.

This

group

agreed

that

working

toward

ETDs

would

be

a

reasonableinitiative, so discussions continued at sessions of the CNI 1993 Spring
Meeting held the following March in San Francisco. At the July 1993 meeting of
the Monticello Electronic Library Project in Atlanta, participants from the Southeastern United States alsodiscussed the role of ETDs in education and libraries.
Subsequently, the Virginia Tech library drafted a workflow description,
developed andtested ETD submission scripts, and prepared a demonstration
website in 1995. Followingthe faculty‟s recommendation from the Degree
Requirements, Standards, Criteria, and Academic Policies Committee in 1996,
graduate students were given the option tosubmit their theses and dissertations
online. The library added incentives by waiving the Archiving Fee (previously
the Binding Fee) for all who would submit ETDs in 1996. On January 1, 1997,
ETDs became a requirement at Virginia Tech; West Virginia University followed
in 1998 with its own requirement.
ETD initiatives have benefited from several funding sources. When the SoutheasternUniversity Research Association (SURA) sold SURAnet, some of the
funds went to support a 1996-1997 project led by Eaton, Fox, and McMillan to
launch ETD activitiesthroughout the South-eastern United States (SURA 1997).
Then the US Department of Education funded a 1996-1999 project led by these
investigators to extend ETD efforts more broadly. The resulting National Digital
Library of Theses and Dissertations quickly expanded into an international
initiative, and was renamed the Networked Digital Library of Thesesand
Dissertations (NDLTD).
Page 128

In 1998, the first ever ETD Conference was organised in Tennessee. Virginia
Tech organised the second ETD Conference in 1999. The trend is still continued
every year by different institutions hosting the conferences and focussing on a
particular theme of ETD. The series of these conferences help in disseminating
ideas and best practices in ETD.

4.3 Definition of Electronic Thesis & Dissertation (ETD):
ETD has been defined in various ways by national and international
organisations, universities, institutions etc. explaining its characteristics, features,
benefits and use.
1) Networked Digital Library of Theses & Dissertations (NDLTD) define ETD
as:
“Electronic theses and dissertation (ETD) can be accessed on the web
in full or partial-text.”2
2) According to The George Washington University (Washington DC),
“An ETD is a thesis/ dissertation created as an electronic document (or
set of electronic documents). The electronic documents that make up an ETD
can be created using any popular word processing software program. One can
also use advanced software programs to produce multimedia animations and
sounds for use in an electronic version of a thesis/dissertation.”3
3) Harrod‟s Librarians‟ Glossary and Reference Books defines ETD as,
“the digital version of a thesis or dissertation whose initiation is
generally credited to Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) who
started creating ETDs in 1994.”4
4) The most comprehensive definition of ETD is given by Virginia Tech Digital
Library and Archives where they define ETD by explaining its content,
importance in candidate‟s academic career, benefit of getting transformed
from print to electronic format and it also highlights the aim of Virginia Tech
Page 129

to make all the research work produced in the institute openly accessible to the
public all over the world via Internet. According to Virginia Tech,
“A dissertation or thesis is a work submitted in support of candidature
for a doctorate or master‟s degree, respectively which presents the author‟s
research and findings. Electronic versions of theses and dissertations are called
ETDs. An ETD documents the author‟s years of academic commitment. It
describes why the work was done, how the research relates to previous work
as recorded in the literature, research methods used, the results, interpretation
and discussion of the results, and a summary with conclusions. It provides a
technologically advanced medium to express author‟s ideas. They are prepared
using almost any word processor or document preparation system.”5
By taking into consideration various benefits of ETD, the researcher defines
ETD as“ETD is electronic version of print thesis or dissertation that may
include various file formats and can be produced using any popular word
processing software. It facilitates dissemination of research through World
Wide Web in an effective, expeditious and economic manner.”

4.4 Benefits of ETD:
A thesis or dissertation is the document submitted by a candidate for an
academic degree and it presents the research work performed by the
researcher. Submitting thesis or dissertation in electronic format has further
enhanced the usability of the document since it becomes readily available for
dissemination through Internet. Some of the specific benefits of ETD6, 7 are:
1) Improved presentation of work:
ETD can be created using any popular word processing software and it also
enables the inclusion of audio-video files, images, spreadsheets, graphs,
animations etc. This helps the researcher to express his/her ideas in a better
way. Such facilities are not available with the print version.

Page 130

2) Improved Accessibility and Increase in Citation Index:
ETD facilitates prompt dissemination of research work across the world
through World Wide Web without the limitations of time and space. This
helps in increasing the citation count of the researcher/ author and increases
prestige of the institution.
3) Increase control:
After submitting the ETD, the researcher can control the availability of his/her
thesis or dissertation by choosing:
a) To embargo(restriction in access for a specific period of time)
b) To make it accessible full-text under open access.
4) Improves library services:
ETDs provide an economical solution for archiving and preservation of theses
and dissertations which are one of the most important types of grey literature.
Being in electronic format, it reduces the cost involved in the process of
preservation, reduces need of library storage space thereby improving library
services.
5) Lower Printing Costs:
Researcher can save a huge amount required for printing purposes if thesis or
dissertations have to be submitted in electronic format.

4.5 Risks of ETD:
Jordan Lee and Brian Yandell (1999)8 of University of Wisconsin-Madison
composed a „Working Draft on Risks and Benefits of Electronic Dissertations‟.
The risks of electronically submitting thesis or dissertations are1) This is a new system, and issues related to this are yet to be resolved regarding
formats. Changes as standards are settled may affect submission and future
access.
2) Immediate access can give competitive colleagues an edge. This can be
overcome to some degree by delayed access.
Page 131

3) Intellectual property rights: Electronic publishing might interfere with
publication of chapters in some journals. This varies from journal to journal
and discipline to discipline, and is in a great state of flux at this time. We
believe this will not be an issue for electronic dissertations in the long run, but
at present this is uncertain.
4) Electronic publishing can interfere with publication of a whole thesis as a
book. Some publishing houses will not consider works that have appeared in
any form on the web, even if it might undergo substantial revision before book
publication.
5) Copyright issues about web-published material are not well understood.
6) Plagiarism on the Internet is a growing concern. Under widely accepted "fair
use" principles, anyone can copy part of your dissertation as long as it is for
noncommercial purposes. Ethically it is important to properly cite such work.
However, it is possible with cut-and-paste technology to repackage large
chunks of work as "new".
The apex body of higher education in India, University Grants Commission
(UGC), in “Electronic Thesis Online (India) UGC (Submission of Metadata
and Full-text of Doctoral Theses in Electronic Format) Regulations 2005”9
mention risk of plagiarism as one of the most important concerns for students
and faculty. The regulations also mention how the electronic format of theses
and dissertations has made plagiarism an easy task. The regulations also
explain the working of plagiarism detecting software and how the use of such
software packages is useful in detecting plagiarism in submitted ETDs.

4.6 ETD-MS: Interoperability Metadata Standard for Electronic
Theses and Dissertations:
Metadata is the term used to describe data about data. According to NDLTD, for
items in open access repositories, metadata usually consists of a full
bibliographic reference, abstract, keywords and similar information about the
related digital object(s) i.e. ETDs. UGC-ETD Guidelines10 mention that the
following three types of metadata are associated with the digital objects:
Page 132



Descriptive Metadata: Include content or bibliographic description consisting
of keywords and subject descriptors.



Administrative or technical Metadata: Incorporates details on original source,
date of creation, version of digital object, file format used, compression
technology used, object relationship, etc. Administrative data may reside
within or outside the digital object and is required for long-term collection
management to ensure longevity of digital collection.



Structural Metadata: Elements within digital objects that facilitate navigation,
e.g. table of contents, index at issue level or volume level, page turning in an
electronic book, etc.

Institutions dealing with electronic theses and dissertations have developed their
own standards or adapted the existing metadata standards. NDLTD, the world‟s
largest consortium of ETD Universities and which maintains an international
union catalogue of ETDs from around the world has defined a „Standard Set of
Metadata Elements‟

11

used to describe an electronic thesis or dissertation which

is not a replacement for metadata scheme already in use for any university but
should be used as a guideline to develop a cross-walk between local metadata
standards and a single standard used for sharing information about ETDs. The set
is based on the work of Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and the proposed set of
qualifiers put forward by the DC Date Working Group.

4.7 Standards for Metadata Harvesting:
Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)Harrod‟s Librarian‟s Glossary & Reference Books mentions, “OAI-PMH is the
protocol which provides an application-independent interoperability framework
for the Open Archives Initiative to enable the automatic gathering of metadata
across multiple repositories.”12
The OAI-PMH is a protocol devised to make machine-readable metadata widely
available for use. The development of the OAI-PMH protocol took root in a
Page 133

meeting that was convened in late 1999 at Santa Fe, New Mexico to address
problems of the e-print world. As disciplinary e-print servers became more
common, it was difficult to support searching across multiple repositories.
Repositories needed greater capabilities to automatically identify and access
papers that had been deposited in other repositories.
The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting13 provides an
application-independent

interoperability

framework

based

on metadata

harvesting. There are twoclasses of participants in the OAI-PMH framework:


Data Providers administer systems that support the OAI-PMH as a means of
exposing metadata; and



Service Providers use metadata harvested via the OAI-PMH as a basis for
building value-added services.
The metadata stored in the data providers‟ database is transferred in bulk to
the metadata database of the service providers. The transfer of metadata is
done in a series of requests and responses between the data provider and the
service provider/harvester. The OAI-PMH Protocol depends upon the HTTPtransaction framework for communication between a harvester and a
repository. Requests may be made using either the HTTP GET or POST
methods. All successful replies are encoded in XML, and all exception and
flow-control replies are indicated by HTTP status codes.

4.8 File Formats for ETDs:
Virginia Tech14, the first University to create ETDs have recommended a list of
file formats for electronic theses and dissertations are Full-text of ETDs
1) PDF(.pdf)PDF is an acronym of Portable Document Format and is most commonly used
format for submitting full-text of ETDs. PDF is used to present documents in
a manner independent of application software, hardware and operating
Page 134

systems. PDF is best used to store vector-based graphics (i.e. graphics drawn
using lines and curves rather than pixels).
 Additional texts/notices
2) PPT(.ppt)PPT or Power-Point Presentation may also be included in ETDs.
3) JPEG(.jpeg or .jpg)JPEG or Joint Photographic Experts Group is a commonly used method for
glossy compression for digital images particularly produced by digital
photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted taking into
consideration the storage size and image quality.
 Images
4) GIF(.gif)Graphics Interchange Format or GIF is a bitmap image format that was
introduced by CompuServ in 1987, has since come into widespread use on the
WWW due to its wide support and portability. Itis best used to store screenquality images that do not contain many colours. GIF files are typically very
small, but cannot reproduce the range of colours necessary to reproduce
photographic images which JPEG can do.
5) TIFF(.tif)TIFF, an acronym for Tagged Information File Format is an archival format,
meaning that is does not sacrifice image quality in order to reduce file sizes.
The TIFF format is widely supported by image-manipulation applications, by
publishing and page layout applications, and byscanning, faxing, word
processing, optical character recognition and other applications.TIFF images
are excellent for storing detailed, high quality images.
6) PNG(.png)Portable Network Graphics (PNG) is a bitmap file format that supports loss
less data compression. It was created as an improved, non-patented
replacement for GIF and is the most used loss less image compression format
on the internet. Since it can store high color images, it can also be used for
storing photographic content.

Page 135

7) MPEG(.mpeg)Moving Picture Experts Group or MPEG is the oldest and most widely used
supported format for movies. The MPEG format is most commonly used as
an output format from UNIX utilities that generate video content.
8) QuickTime(.mov .qt)QuickTime is an extensible multimedia framework developed by Apple Inc.,
capable

of

handling

various

formats

of digital

video,

picture,

sound, panoramic images, and interactivity. Support for QuickTime is good
on Macintosh and Windows but not much on Unix.
 Video
9) AVI(.avi)Audio Video Interleave (AVI) files contain both audio and video data in a file
container that allows synchronous audio-with-video playback.It is more of a
Windows supported format and is not as well supported on other formats.
10) WAV(.wav)Waveform Audio File Format or WAVE is a default standard for Windows
Sound Files. It is also supported by other platforms. It is mainly used for raw
and uncompressed audio files.
11) AIFF(.aif)Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) is an audio file format standard used
for storing sound data for personal computers and other electronic audio
devices. The AIFF format is a Macintosh-specific equivalent of the WAV
format. It is not as well supported on all platforms as the WAV format.
 Audio
12) MPEG-3 (.mp3)MPEG-3 (or MP3) format eliminates sound data which is not as strongly
perceived by the human ear and brain, and as such creates files of reasonable
quality that are as much as 10 times smaller than the raw data itself. MP3 files
are good for storing long passages of sound content where high quality is not
required.

Page 136

 Other file formats
13) Zip FilesIt is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A .zip file
may contain one or more files or folders.
14) HTMLHyper Text Mark-up language (HTML) is the language with which Web pages
are designed. This standard has been defined by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C). HTML allows web documents to be created with ease.
HTML is a plain text file and any text editor as simple as Notepad can be used to
create HTML documents.
15) XML-

eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML) provides a structured representation of
data that can be implemented broadly and is easy to deploy. XML is a subset of
SGML (Standard Generalized Mark-up Language), modified and optimized for
delivery over the Web. This standard has been defined by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C). XML can be used to format and transfer data in an easy and
consistent way. XML is also a plain text format.

4.9

Digital Preservation Strategies of ETDs:
A digital preservation strategy is a well-considered and documented approach
to the preservation of digital objects.

Preservation as “method of keeping digital materials „alive‟ so that they
remain usable as technological advances render original hardware and
software specifications obsolete.”15

b)

The Working Group on Defining Digital Preservation- Association of
Library Collections & Technical Services (a Division of ALA) states
“Digital preservation combines policies, strategies and actions to ensure the
accurate rendering of authenticated contentover time, regardless of the
challenges of media failure and technological change. Digital preservation
applies to bothborn digital and reformatted content.”16
Page 137

4.9.2 Need of Digital Preservation:
Digital Preservation Europe Project17 mentioned the reasons for taking care
of digital objects and need for digital preservationa)

Storage media/data carrier problem:
Digital objects are much more 'fragile' than traditional analogue documents
such as books or other hard copy mediums.They are also much more
venerable to physical damage. Digital objects require pro-active
intervention to remain accessible.

b)

Hardware obsolescence:
After five years if a digital object and the disk are in perfect condition, also
we have the software that can open the file, but if that file is on a disc your
computer doesn't have a drive for, you will not be able to access it.

c)

Software and format obsolescence problem:
The software or file format can become obsolete for a number of reasons.
Without the intervention of digital preservation techniques the information
contained will no longer be accessible.

4.9.3 What does ‘Long-Term’ Digital Preservation mean?
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS, 2002)18 explain
the meaning of „Long-term‟ in digital preservation as “a period of time long
enough for there to be concern about the impacts of changing technologies,
including support for new media and data formats, and of a changing user
community, on the information being held in a repository. This period
extends into the indefinite future.”
4.9.4 Criteria for Selecting a Digital Preservation Strategy:
Various theories have been developed to preserve digital material which
range from preserving the original technology on which the archival object
Page 138

runs to preserving only significant properties of the object which are
defined independently of any hardware or software platform.
Thibodeau19 suggests that a digital archive should take the following four
criteria into consideration when selecting a preservation strategy:
a) Feasibility: possession of hardware and software capable of
implementing the chosen method.
b) Sustainability: the method should be capable of being applied
indefinitely into the future; or there should be another path which will
offer a sequel to the method if it ceases being sustainable.
c) Practicality: implementation should be within reasonable limits of
difficulty and expense.
d) Appropriateness: The chosen approach should be appropriate for the
particular types of digital objects to be preserved and the objectives of
their preservation.

4.9.5 Digital Preservation Strategies:
Many digital preservation technologies have been proposed but a single
technology is not suitable for all data types and institutions.
Tristram (2002)20 discussed following digital preservation techniques1)

Bitstream Copying:
It is more commonly known as "backing up your data" and refers to the
process of making an exact duplicate of a digital object. It is often
combined with remote storage so that the original and the copy are not
subject to the same disastrous event. Bitstream copying should be
considered the minimum maintenance strategy for even the most lightly
valued, ephemeral data.

Page 139

2)

Refreshing:
Refreshing is the process of copying digital information from one long-term
storage medium to another of the same type, with no change in the
bitstream (e.g. from an older CD-RW to a new CD-RW). Refreshing is a
necessary component of any successful digital preservation program, but is
not itself a complete program.

3)

Durable/Persistent Media:
Durable media has no impact on any other potential source of loss,
including catastrophic physical loss, media obsolescence, as well as
obsolescence of encoding and formatting schemes. It has the potential for
endangering content by providing a false sense of security.

4)

Technology Preservation:
This type of preservation is based on preserving the technical environment
that runs the system, including operating systems, original application
software, media drives, and the like. It is sometimes called the "computer
museum" solution. This is not a strategy that an individual institution can
implement. Maintaining obsolete technology in usable form requires a
considerable investment in equipment and personnel.

5)

Digital Archaeology:
Digital Archaeology includes methods and procedures to rescue content
from damaged media or from obsolete or damaged hardware and software
environments. It is explicitly an emergency recovery strategy and usually
involves specialized techniques to recover bitstreams from media that has
been rendered unreadable, either due to physical damage or hardware
failure such as head crashes or magnetic tape crinkling.

6)

Analog Backups:
It combines the conversion of digital objects into analog form with the use
of durable analog media. An analog copy of a digital object can, in some
respects, preserve its content and protect it from obsolescence, while

Page 140

sacrificing any digital qualities, including sharability and lossless
transferability.
7)

Migration:
Migration is to copy data, or convert data, from one technology to another,
whether hardware or software, preserving the essential characteristics of the
data. Migration includes refreshing as a means of digital preservation but
differs from it in the sense that it is not always possible to make an exact
digital copy or replica of a data base or other information object as
hardware and software change and still maintain the compatibility of the
object with the new generation of technology.

8)

Replication:
Replication is a term used to mean multiple things. Bitstream copying is a
form of replication. Open Archival Information System (OAIS) considers
replication to be a form of migration. LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff
Safe) is a consortial form of replication, while peer-to-peer data trading is
an open, free-market form of replication.

9)

Reliance on Standards:
It seeks a way to "harden" the encoding and formatting of digital objects by
adhering to well-recognized standards and favouring such standards over
more hard and less well-supported ones. It assumes in part that such
standards will endure and that problems of compatibility resulting from the
evolution of the computing environment (applications software, operating
systems) will be handled by the continuing need to accommodate the
standard within the new environment.

10)

Normalization:
It is a formalized implementation of reliance on standards. Within an
archival repository, all digital objects of a particular type (e.g., colour
images, structured text) are converted into a single chosen file format that is
thought to embody the best overall compromise amongst characteristics

Page 141

such as functionality, longevity, and preservability. The advantages and
disadvantages of reliance on standards also apply to normalization.
11)

Canonicalization:
It is a technique designed to allow determination of whether the essential
characteristics of a document have remained intact through a conversion
from one format to another. Once created, this form could be used to
algorithmically verify that a converted file has not lost any of its essence.
Canonicalization has been postulated as an aid to integrity testing of file
migration, but it has not been implemented.

12)

Emulation:
It combines software and hardware to reproduce in all essential
characteristics the performance of another computer of a different design,
allowing programs or media designed for a particular environment to
operate in a different, usually newer environment. Emulation requires the
creation of emulators, programs that translate code and instructions from
one computing environment so it can be properly executed in another.

13)

Encapsulation:
It may be seen as a technique of grouping together a digital object and
metadata necessary to provide access to that object. Appropriate types of
metadata to encapsulate with a digital object include reference,
representation, provenance, fixity and context information. Encapsulation is
considered a key element of emulation.

14)

Universal Virtual Computer:
It is a form of emulation. It requires the development of a computer
program independent of any existing hardware or software that could
simulate the basic architecture of every computer since the beginning,
including memory, a sequence of registers, and rules for how to move
information among them. Users could create and save digital files using the
application software of their choice, but all files would also be backed up in
a way that could be read by the universal computer.

4.10 Copyright & ETDs:
Copyright is one of the most important factors of ETD. Infringement of
Copyright Act is one of the major barriers in submission of ETDs in
repository. In spite of the benefits of ETD, due to the fear of getting their
intellectual work plagiarised, researchers hesitate to submit their ETDs and
contribute in the scholarly output of the institution through open access.
Harrod‟s Librarian‟s Glossary & Reference Book explains Copyright as “a
procedure whereby the originator of a piece of intellectual property (book,
article, piece of music etc.) acquires a series of rights over the work created,
including copying, publishing, performing, broadcasting and adaptation.”21
Ramaiah22 mentioned that1) The author of the ETD automatically holds the copyright. There is no need
to transfer copyright.
2) Registering of Copyright is optional. It can be done yourself or through
ProQuest (a fee is required in both cases)
3) The author gets cultural and legal benefits.
4) Use of a copyright statement in your ETD is not required, but is highly
recommended.
According to the Office of Graduate & Professional Studies, Theses Office,
Texas A&M University23, any submitted thesis or dissertation is automatically
copyrighted under U.S. Federal Law (United States Code, Title 17) as soon as
the respective student saves a draft of it on paper or computer.
Stanford University Libraries & Academic Information Resources24 mention
that “in copyright law, copying is known as „reproduction‟, and it‟s one of the
exclusive rights of copyright owner. The right to publicly display a work is an
exclusive right of copyright owner. While there is no general exemption for
preservation activities in copyright law, there are exemptions that can help
individuals and especially libraries and archives legally preserve expressive
Page 143

works for the future. Furthermore, in the absence of a specific exemption, one
can always consider fair use as a defense when making a preservation copy.”
For the present research study, the researcher became member of NDLTD
Listserv member in order to get information and participate in discussions
related to various topics of ETD. In order to get the authentic information
regarding copyright policies for ETDs, the researcher posted the following
query to the ETD mailing group (etd@ndltd.org) on 29th May 2014Dear Professionals,
Once a student submits a Doctoral Thesis or Master's Thesis, with whom does
the copyright of the thesis remain and why?
a) with the researcher?
b) with the University?

Fig. 4.1: Researcher posted query to NDLTD Mailing Group
Three Repository administrators replied to the query.
i) Max Read (Associate Director, Student Academic Services, Office of the
Dean and Vice-Provost, Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, The University
of British Columbia, Vancouver Campus) informed of researchers retaining
the Copyright after submitting the ETD.
(Max Read, personal communication, May 29, 2014)
Page 144

Fig. 4.2: Response to researcher’s query by Max Read
ii) Rhonda Marker (Head, Scholarly Communication Center, Repository
Collection Librarian, Rutgers University Libraries, Rutgers, The State
University of New Jersey) mentioned that “university's copyright policy says
that the author holds copyright in his/her thesis or dissertation.”
Marker also provided the Rutgers University Copyright Policy25 which
reaffirms the faculty‟s rights to retain copyright ownership to the scholarly
and artisticworks they create, such as books, monographs, journal articles,
musical compositions, and artwork, in whatever format they are created,
print or electronic, without regard to the extent of university resources
involved in the creation of these works. Students typically will own the
copyright to works created as a requirement of their coursework, degree, or
certificate program. The university, however, retains the right to use student
works forpedagogical, scholarly, and administrative purposes.
(Rhonda Marker, personal communication, May 29, 2014)

Page 145

Fig. 4.3: Response to researcher’s query by Rhonda Marker &
Mohammed Butt
iii) Mohammed Butt (American University Library) mentions that “as soon a
person creates a thing, in our case as soon as student creates a document, by law
they have the copyright to that thing/doc. The copyright trademark symbol is not
needed, though it is certainly helpful. ProQuest simply distributes the
documents. It might be worth registering with the copyright office
(copyright.gov) for legal benefits.
The responses received from the repository administrators clarify that once the
ETD is submitted to the repository, the author of the ETD retains the copyright.
(Mohammed Butt, personal communication, June 6, 2014)

4.11 Types of Access Provided for ETDs:
Theses and dissertations are one of the most important forms of grey literature
that provide access to the intellectual thoughts of the researcher. It is one of the
major sources of scholarly communication. Print formats of theses and
Page 146

dissertations are kept in closed access in the respective institution/ university‟s
library due to which the research done by the researcher remains locked and
unavailable for use. Submission of theses and dissertations in electronic format
has made the dissemination of information possible outside the boundaries of
institution/university libraries with the help of World Wide Web. However, in
order to keep a check in the purpose and amount of use of ETDs,
researchers/institutions/universities have developed different types of access
categories of ETDs.The types of access as mentioned by UGC, India for ETD
are as follows26:
1) Worldwide Access: This access level allows immediate worldwide access to
all ETDs, as soon as they are submitted. Onsite and offsite users can read and
download the ETDs.
2) Campus-only Access: The access in this category is restricted only to a
particular group of users‟ on-campus. The access is controlled either by IP
addresses, a valid ID, or through a proxy server.
3) Temporary Restricted Access: The ETD could be restricted for one, two or
three years and then it is released for worldwide access, unless the University /
Department authorities give an approval for delayed release.
4) Mixed Access: The student has the opportunity to release parts of the ETD but
not the entire thesis or to publish two versions of a chapter, each with different
access levels.
Peter Suber27, one of the most famous supporters of open access mentions that
„ETDs are the most invisible form of useful literature and the most useful form
of invisible literature.‟ Suber identified nine major reasons for providing
mandatory open access to ETDs1. Nowadays most theses and dissertations are born digital. They are already
ETDs even if the university only wants to deal with printouts.
2. ETDs are Phase One, royalty-free works of research literature. Their authors
lose no revenue by consenting to OA.
Page 147

3. ETDs are not formally published. Hence there are no publishers in the picture
to resist or oppose OA. There are no publisher fears of lost revenue to answer.
There are no publisher permissions to seek. There are no publisher
negotiations to delay or deter OA archiving.
4. Mandates work and exhortations do not. This is the universal lesson from OA
mandates to date, whether at funding agencies or universities.
5. OA solves the invisibility problem for ETDs. Without OA, there is almost no
access, visibility, or indexing for dissertations. They are hard to retrieve even
if discovered, and they are hard to discover. When they are OA, ETDs are not
only searchable by cross archive search tools that index the ETDrepositories;
they are also indexed (in growing numbers but jerky stages) by Google,
Yahoo, and Microsoft. Scirus already indexes the ETDs held by the
Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD).
6. Universities are in a good position to mandate OA. They can make it a simple
condition of submission and acceptance.
7. Mandating OA for ETDs will educate the next generation of scholars about
OA, when they do not already know about it.
8. An OA mandate will elicit better work.
9. Finally, an OA mandate shows that the university takes the dissertation
seriously.
Suber strongly believed that OA for ETDs is one of the best ways to increase
visibility and impact. He knew about the students fears that OA for ETDs will
prevent future publication are understandable but groundless. According to Suber
“there are easy work-arounds for ETDs describing patentable discoveries or
containing chapters for which copyright has already been transferred to
publishers.”

4.12 ETD Initiatives at International Level:
4.12.1 Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (www.ndltd.org)28
The Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) is an
international organization dedicated to promoting the adoption, creation, use,
dissemination, and preservation of electronic theses and dissertations
(ETDs). They support electronic publishing and open access to scholarship
in order to enhance the sharing of knowledge worldwide. The website
includes resources for university administrators, librarians, faculty, students,
and the general public and include topics like how to find, create, and
preserve ETDs; how to set up an ETD program; legal and technical
questions; and the latest news and research in the ETD community.
The National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations was established in
1996, directed by an informal steering committee. As its scope became
international, the organization kept the acronym NDLTD, but changed its
name to the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations.

4.12.2 DART-Europe E-theses Portal (http://www.dart-europe.eu/)29
DART-Europe is a partnership of research libraries and library consortia
who are working together to improve global access to European research
theses. DART-Europe is endorsed by LIBER (Ligue des Bibliothèques
Européennes de Recherche), and it is the European Working Group of
the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD).
The DART-Europe partners help to provide researchers with a single
European Portal for the discovery of Electronic Theses and Dissertations
(ETDs), and they participate in advocacy to influence future European etheses developments. DART-Europe offers partners a European networking
forum on ETD issues, and may provide the opportunity to submit
collaborative funding applications to achieve DART-Europe's vision for
ETDs.

dissertations in PDFformat.

4.13 ETD Initiatives: Country Specific
4.13.1 EThOS-Electronic Theses Online Service (http://ethos.bl.uk/)32
EThOS is the United Kingdom‟s national thesis service which aims to
maximise the visibility and availability of the UK‟s doctoral research theses.
It demonstrates the quality of UK research, and supports the UK
Government‟s open access principle that publications resulting from
publicly-funded research should be made freely available for all researchers,
providing opportunities for further research. EThOS helps institutions to
meet the expectation of the UK Research Councils according to whom, PhDs
supported by a Research Council Training Grant should be made freely
available in an open access repository. There are approximately 350,000
records relating to theses awarded by over 120 institutions. Around 120,000
Page 150

of these also provide access to the full text thesis, either via download from
the EThOS database or via links to the institution‟s own repository. Of the
remaining 250,000 records dating back to at least 1800, three quarters are
available to be ordered for scanning through the EThOS digitisation-ondemand facility.
4.13.2 Theses Canada (http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/)33
Canadian universities participate in the program voluntarily by submitting
approved theses and dissertation to Theses Canada. Library and Archives
Canada (LAC) staff provide advice to Canadian universities that are
establishing electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) programs and welcome
new electronic participants. Library & Archives Canada (LAC) collection
includes two formats, electronic theses and theses on microfiches. The
electronic theses and dissertations on this site are for the personal use of
students, scholars and the public. Any commercial use, publication or
lending of them in libraries is strictly prohibited.

4.13.3 ADT-Australasian Digital Theses Program (http://www.caul.edu.au/)34
This program began in 1998 as a project funded by the ARC, transferred to
Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) in July, 2001, became
fully supported by CAUL members in 2003 and CONZUL members from
2006. The ADT officially became the Australasian Digital Theses Program
in September, 2005, when CAUL adopted the revised business plan which
includes the New Zealand Universities as full members.The Australasian
Digital Theses (ADT) Program ceased operation on 28 March, 2011. The
database server has been decommissioned, and the content of that database is
accessible from the National Library of Australia‟s Trove service. Each
participating university will continue to host their own digital theses and
house their own print and other non-digital theses.

4.13.4 DissOnline & Online Dissertations at the German National Library
(http://www.dnb.de/EN/Wir/Kooperation/dissonline/dissonline_node.html)35
The German National Library has the largest national collection of online
dissertations in Europe. Since 1998, it holds the German National
Library online dissertations and post-doctoral theses; the stock has since
grown to more than 120,000 documents.
4.13.5 NARCIS (http://www.narcis.nl/)36
National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System
(NARCIS) is the main national portal for those looking for information about
researchers and their work. Besides researchers, NARCIS is also used by
students, journalists and people working in educational and government
institutions as well as the business sector.NARCIS provides access to
scientific information, including (open access) publications from the
repositories of all the Dutch universities, KNAW, NWO and a number of
research institutes, datasets from some data archives as well as descriptions
of research projects, researchers and research institutes.
4.13.6 National ETD Portal-South African theses and dissertations
(http://www.netd.ac.za/)37
This site is run by the University of Cape Town UCT-CS Digital Libraries
Laboratory on behalf of the NDLTD. Metadata for all theses and
dissertations produced internationally are collected and made accessible, as
well as disseminated further, from this site.
4.13.7 China Doctoral/Master Dissertation Database (http://www.cnki.net/)38
The database has collected dissertations covering basic science, engineering
technologies, agriculture, medical science, philosophy, humanity, social
sciences, and so on. By June 2011, the database had collected more than
1,50,000 excellent domestic doctoral dissertations from 397 institutions and
11,50,000 excellent domestic master dissertations from 598 institutions.

Page 152

4.13.8 DATAD- Database of African Theses & Dissertations (www.aau.org)39
African research results are rarely indexed in major international databases, a
problem that is further exacerbated by the inaccessibility of theses and
dissertations completed in the region, many of which contain local empirical
data that is not available in international literature. The Association of
African Universities (AAU) found it necessary to initiate and support efforts
towards putting Africa‟s research output onto the mainstream of world
knowledge. The ideaof DATAD was born out of a project in 2000 as a result
of a positive recommendation of a feasibility study carried out for a pilot
project to index, abstract, and distributes theses and dissertations completed
in African universities. The Database of African Theses and Dissertations
(DATAD) is a programme to improve management and access to African
scholarly work. Theses and dissertations represent a significant proportion of
Africa‟s research activity.

information about 2700 repositories from the world in 12 types of content. It
provides information about 1474 repositories containing ETDs.
4.15.3 OAIster (www.oaister.org)49
OAIster began at the University of Michigan in 2002 funded by a grant from
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and with the purpose of establishing a
retrieval service for publicly available digital library resources provided by
the research library community. During its tenure at the University of
Michigan, OAIster grew to become one of the largest aggregations of records
pointing to open access collections in the world.
In 2009, OCLC formed a partnership with the University of Michigan to
provide continued access to open access collections aggregated in OAIster.
Since OCLC began managing OAIster, it has grown to include over 30
million records contributed by over 1,500 organizations. OCLC is evolving
OAIster to a model of self-service contribution for all open access digital
repositories to ensure the long-term sustainability of this rich collection of
open access materials. OAIster data is harvested from Open Archives
Initiative (OAI)-compliant digital libraries, institutional repositories and

millions of OAIster records alone.
4.15.4 BASE-Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (http://www.base-search.net/)50
BASE is one of the world's most voluminous search engines especially for
academic open access web resources. BASE is operated by Bielefeld
University Library.As the open access movement grows and prospers, more
and more repository servers come into being which use the "Open Archives
Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting" (OAI-PMH) for providing their
contents. BASE collects, normalises, and indexes these data. BASE provides
more than 60 million documents from more than 3,000 sources. It provides
access to the full texts of about 70% of the indexed documents. The index
Page 157

is continuously enhanced by integrating further OAI sources as well as local
sources.

Our OAI-PMH

Blog communicates

information

related

to

harvesting and aggregating activities performed for BASE.BASE is a
registered OAI service provider and contributed to the European project
"Digital

Repository

Infrastructure

Vision

for

European

Research"

(DRIVER). Database managers can integrate the BASE index into your own
local infrastructure (e.g. meta search engines, library catalogues) via
an interface.
4.15.5 ScientificCommons (http://en.scientificcommons.org/)51
ScientificCommons is a project of the University of St. Gallen Institute for
Media and Communications Management. The major aim of the project is to
develop the world‟s largest archive of scientific knowledge with full-texts
freely accessible to the public. It includes a search engine for publications
and author profiles. It also allows the user to turn searches into customized
RSS Feeds of new publications. ScientificCommons also provides a fulltextcaching service for researchers. Since the beginning of 2013,
ScientificCommons has been inaccessible.

UNESCO’s Contribution towards ETD:
The UNESCO Guide to Electronic Theses and Dissertation52 promotes the
sharing of knowledge available in universities across the world. The Guide is
specifically designed by academic researchers. The Guide is an international,
"living" document, written by ETD scholars throughout the world. It is
published and mainly funded by UNESCO. It was prepared by an
international team of faculty and staff; coordinated by Shalini Urs and edited
by Joseph Moxley. This work is a living document that will continue to be
updated in connection with the work of the Networked Digital Library of
Theses and Dissertations; It was born as a result of the support provided by
UNESCO in grants given to Virginia Tech, USA and the University of
Montreal.
Page 158

Participants in the project are from the Australian Digital Theses Project, the
Humboldt-University Berlin,

Germany,

the

Ibero-American Science

Technology Education Consortium (ISTEC), the National Library of
Portugal, the Digital Library of Indian Electronic Theses (VIDYANIDHI),
the Virginia Tech University, USA; the University of Chile, the University of
Lyon, France, and the University of Montreal, Canada. At present it is
available in English and Spanish. French, Russian and German versions are
under preparation due to presence of various translators funded in part by
UNESCO, and others volunteering their assistance.
The UNESCO ETDs Guide aims to help all those interested in projects and
programmes involving ETDs. Its goal is of aiding students of every
university in creating electronic documents and using digital libraries. It has
particular focus on the emerging genre of ETDs, which should enhance the
quality, content, form, and impact of scholarly communication that involves
students engaged in research. The guidelines given intend to help universities
to develop their local infrastructure, especially regarding electronic
publishing and digital libraries, which in turn build upon networking,
computing,

multimedia,

and

related

technologies.

The various sections of the Guides are aimed to address the needs of
universities (including administrators and faculty), students (including those
who wish to create ETDs as well as those who wish to make use of alreadycreated works), and those involved in training or setting up ETD projects or
programmes.

4.17 How to Set Up an ETD Program
NDLTD has provided the most comprehensive and Model Guidelines to Set
up an ETD Program. 53
Step 1: Assemble the team
Set up a project team with representatives from the library, the IT
department, the Faculty of Graduate Studies, senior administrators from

Page 159

the university, and the Graduate Student Association. It is important to
have cross-institutional representation in order to develop a balanced
initiative.
Step 2: Prepare the Proposal
Prepare a pilot project proposal for consideration by the appropriate
university administrators. This is the stage during which you should work
out policies specific to your university.
You may want to include information about ETDs providing increased
exposure to the university and graduate students‟ research and scholarship,
publication potential, intellectual property and rights management,
plagiarism, orientation and training, standards, costs, restrictions on access,
archiving and preservation.
Step 3: Decide on Software and Metadata
This is also the time to decide which technical infrastructure you plan to
use. These days most universities are implementing institutional
repositories (IRs), which include ETD collections. There are any number
of choices of institutional repository software available, both open source
and proprietary. Some examples of open source systems include:
Archimede, DSpace, Eprints, Fedora,

and ETD-db.

The

latter

is

specifically designed for theses. Examples of proprietary systems
include: Digital Commons, CONTENTdm, DigiTool, Open Repository,
and Vital. Smaller institutions that have no IR may choose a remote-host
option, such as Open Repository through BioMed Central. Digital
Commons provides a total beginning-to-end submission package. Other
non-IR options include: the ETD Administrator from ProQuest/UMI
and VALET for ETDs from VTLS. The NDLTD highly recommends use
of ETD-MS, the metadata standard specifically for electronic theses and
dissertations. This standard includes minimal basic descriptive information
related to an ETD. Other popular metadata schemes include Dublin Core

Page 160

and MARC.
Step 4: Create an ETD Website
Once the project is approved, set up a website for ETDs. This can be done
by the IT staff at your university or by the university library or graduate
school. Information on the websiteshould include an overview of your
ETD program, submission guidelines, ETD procedures, policies,
information

on

tutorials

etc.

Step 5: Train Graduate Students
Implement an orientation and training program for graduate students. They
may need training on all aspects of ETDs, including creating the word
document, application of styles, use of templates, conversion to PDF, and
submitting online to the institutional repository. Some universities offer inperson training sessions and/or online training resources. Ohio State
University has a tutorial on Creating a PDF. West Virginia University also
has a Convert to PDF tutorial. The University of Victoria, Canada, has
developed the online tutorial How to Submit an ETD.
Step 6: Set Up the ETD Workflow
Establish the ETD workflow, deciding who is responsible for the various
stages of the process from submission to approval, preservation, and
access. In the most common scenario students upload their ETD files to the
Graduate School office where they are reviewed, approved, and released to
the Library for preservation and access. The metadata is then made
available for harvesting by other organizations, such as Google Scholar or
the NDLTD.
Step 7: Establish a Pilot Project
Run a pilot project either with a limited number of students or with one or
two specific departments for a semester or another limited time period.
This will allow you to fine-tune your procedures and workflow. As few as

Page 161

20 or 30 ETDs are sufficient to run a pilot project.At the end of their pilot
projects some universities adopt a voluntary e-theses submission model for
a set time period before moving to mandatory submission of electronic
theses and dissertations. If possible, the best practice is to recommend
mandating ETDs at your institution as soon as you begin your ETD
submission program (by decree by the Provost or Graduate School Dean,
on recommendation of faculty governance).
Step 8: Prepare for OAI Harvesting
Once your ETD submission program is established, have your IT staff
prepare your ETD collection for Open Access Initiative (OAI) harvesting.
The IT staff should read the Technical Requirements in order to implement
the IR as an OAI data repository. Some systems have a built-in OAI
interface. An open source version called OAIcat from OCLC is available
online.
Step 9: Evaluate and Enhance the Program
Like any program, your institution‟s ETD submission program should be
periodically evaluated and enhanced.


Software should be upgraded.



Graduate School staff should always be aware of policy changes
and how copyright impacts the program.



IT staff must monitor appropriate listservs in order to become
aware of upgrades, enhancements, and security issues.



Library staff can implement enhancements to the program, such as
creating catalogue records automatically from the ETD-MS
metadata.



Administrators should be aware of changing standards (e.g.,
PDF/A) and legislation (e.g., copyright, privacy issues, etc.).



To stay informed about ETDs, your institution may want to become
a member of NDLTD, subscribe to the ETD-L and network with
NDLTD in Facebook.

4.18 ETD Terms and Definitions:
Some of the most commonly used terms and their definitions related to
electronic thesis and dissertations are given below:54
1) Access Type:
The manner in which an ETD is made available (or not) to the university
community and/or public.
2) Archiving:
The application of processes, techniques and protocols to preserve the
scholarly record over time.
3) Availability:
Level of access to which an ETD is available to the general public or in
the institutional repository.
4) Born Digital:
An item is born–digital if it has been generated entirely electronically by
using a word-processor and/or electronic composition software. For
electronic files which have been produced by scanning.
5) Copyright:
A form of protection grounded in the U.S. Constitution and granted by
law for original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of
expression. Copyright covers both published and unpublished works. As
intellectual property law, copyright protects original works of authorship
including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry,
novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture.
6) Closed Access:
The full text and sometimes the metadata of closed access ETDs are only
available to authorized members of University staff and external
examiners for administrative purposes. This is also known as an

Page 163

„embargoed‟ or „No Access‟ETD.
7) Creative Commons:
A non-profit corporation dedicated to making it easier for people to
share and build upon the work of others, consistent with the rules of
copyright. They provide free licenses and other legal tools to mark
creative work with the freedom the creator wants it to carry, so others
can share, remix, use commercially, or any combination there of.
8) Digital Library:
A managed collection of information, with associated services, where
the information is stored in digital formats and accessible over a
network.
9) Digital Preservation:
The management process of ensuring digital objects and information are
accessible over the long term. Development of standards, format
compatibility, format migration and systems interoperability are
important aspect of this process. Digital preservation systems are under
development to provide appropriate digital preservation techniques.
10) Dissertation:
A research document written by a post-Master, Doctoral-level student.
The term „dissertation‟ may be used in some countries or universities to
mean a post-baccalaureate, Master-level research project.
11) Dissemination:
Methods of distributing electronic documents on the Web.
12) Embargo:
Restricting access to an electronic document for a specific period of
time. Also, called Publication Delay.

Page 164

13) EPrint:
Any version of a work available online which has been either submitted
for formal publication or has been accepted after formal review. The
term encompasses both preprint and post-print.
14) Fair Use:
One of the more important copyright limitations is the doctrine of „fair
use.‟ The doctrine of fair use has developed through a substantial
number of court decisions over the years and has been codified in section
107 of the copyright law. Section 107 contains a list of the various
purposes for which the reproduction of a particular work may be
considered fair, such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
scholarship, and research. Section 107 also sets out four factors to be
considered in determining whether or not a particular use is fair:
1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
of commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes
2. The nature of the copyrighted work
3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole
4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the
copyrighted work
The distinction between fair use and infringement may be unclear and
not easily defined. There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes
that may safely be taken without permission. Acknowledging the source
of the copyrighted material does not substitute for obtaining
permission.
15) Infringement:
Misuse of copyrighted material.
16) Institutional Repository:
An online database that provides access to digital collections such as

Page 165

theses and dissertations for online viewing and provides the
associated metadata regarding the documents (e.g. student and university
name, year of graduation, document title, abstract, keywords). A type of
digital repository designed to collect the work of a particular institution.
17) Intellectual Property Rights:
Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind: inventions,
literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs
used in commerce. IP is divided into two categories: Industrial property,
which includes inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs, and
geographic indications of source; and Copyright, which includes literary
and artistic works such as novels, poems and plays, films, musical
works, artistic works such as drawings, paintings, photographs and
sculptures, and architectural designs. Rights related to copyright include
those of performing artists in their performances, producers of
phonograms in their recordings, and those of broadcasters in their radio
and television programs.
18) Keywords:
Search terms or phrases relating to the item/body of work. Keywords are
often words or phrases from the document title and/or abstract, are
discipline-specific and which provide topic/subject search terms for
online discovery.
19) LOCKSS:
Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe. Originally developed the Stanford
University Libraries, this digital preservation methodology allows interinstitutional sharing of archival collections. The NDLTD participates in
the MetaArchive cooperative, a consortium of LOCKSS institutional
partners.

Page 166

20) Mandate:
Required ETD submission policy. Often the University President,
Provost, or Graduate School Dean may implement such a policy to
launch an ETD program at their institution.
21) Metadata:
Data that describes other data. For items in open access repositories, this
usually consists of a full bibliographic reference, abstract, keywords, and
similar information about the related digital object(s) (i.e. ETDs).
22) Open Access:
Information readily available on the Web at no cost and without access
restrictions.
23) Open Access Initiative:
The OAI develops and promotes interoperability standards that aim to
facilitate the efficient dissemination of content. Its major contribution is
the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), a set of
guidelines that enable repositories to expose the metadata describing
their content to service providers who harvest the metadata into large
aggregations.
24) OAI-PMH:
Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).
Standards for metadata harvesting.
25) OpenDOAR:
The Directory of Open Access Repositories. Allows users to search for
specific repositories, or search within the contents of all the repositories
in the directory.

Page 167

26) Plagiarism:
The use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author
and the representation of them as one‟s own original work.
Within academia, plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is
considered academic dishonesty or academic fraud, and offenders are
subject to academic censure, up to and including expulsion. The
development of the Internet, where articles appear as electronic text, has
made the physical act of copying the work of others as well as the
detection of plagiarism much easier.
27) Preservation:
The management process of ensuring printed and digital objects and
information are accessible over the long term.
28) Print-only Access:
Theses and dissertations are in paper and are placed on library shelves.
Secure method to assure few people will ever view theses and
dissertations. ETD is accessible only from library shelves or Interlibrary
Loan. May also apply to some ETD programs where an indefinite
campus restriction is allowed. Although ETD submission may be
required, access may be limited to login for authorized university
community or by interlibrary loan request by print distribution.
29) Restricted Access:
For ETDs this generally signifies that the complete work or aspects of
the work will not be accessible to the public for a specific period of time.
During this time the ETD may or may not be available to the university
community, although the metadata is generally available to the public.
This term may used to refer to ETDs that are available to a limited
population as well as ETDs where access is embargoed.

Page 168

30) RoMEO Project:
A project that defined the archiving policies of publishers. Now part of
SHERPA. You will see publishers defined as having a Romeo color of
white, yellow, blue, and green, which mean:


White: archiving not formally supported



Yellow: can archive preprint (i.e., re–refereeing)



Blue: can archive post–print (i.e., final draft post–refereeing)



Green: can archive preprint and post-print

31) Scholarly Communications:
The creation, transformation, dissemination and preservation of
knowledge related to teaching, research and scholarly endeavours.
Among the many scholarly communications issues include author rights,
the economics of scholarly resources, new models of publishing
including open access, institutional repositories, rights and access to
federally funded research, and preservation of intellectual assets.
32) Self-archiving:
Placing a copy of your work in a digital/institutional repository or
professional or departmental website.
33) Sequestered:
The act of removing, separating or seizing anything from the possession
of its owner under process of law for the benefit of creditors or the state.
For ETDs, this is usually an „embargoed‟ or „No Access‟ condition,
typically requested for security purposes.
34) SPARC:
The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition is an
international alliance of academic and research libraries working to
correct imbalances in the scholarly publishing system.

Page 169

35) SWORD:
A repository deposit protocol; in other words, a way to get items into the
repository. Funded and supported by the Joint Information Systems
Committee (JISC), SWORD allows you deposit resources (like
electronic theses and dissertations) into repositories powered by
platforms such as DSpace, Eprints, Fedora, IntraLibrary, and Zentity.
36) University-only Access:
The full text of university-only ETDs are only available to authorized
members of University students, faculty and staff, or in some situations
access may be restricted within a State or consortium arrangement of
member schools via login or IP restriction. Many universities allow
interlibrary loan service to provide print and/or electronic versions as
requested from other academic libraries.
37) Withheld:
Theses and dissertations are withheld from the public for a certain period
of time or indefinitely.

4.19 Summary:
The present chapter gives the overview of Electronic theses and Dissertations
by explaining various concepts related to ETDs.
The chapter starts with the sneak preview of historical events which led to the
production of first E-thesis in 1992 by Virginia Tech. The researcher discussed
various definitions of ETDs given by various international organizations and
reference source. A comprehensive definition of ETD is also stated by the
researcher.
The chapter then proceeds to benefits and risks involved in submitting theses
or dissertation in electronic format. The researcher mentions NDLTDs

Page 170

„Standard Set of Metadata Elements‟ which can be used as a standard for
sharing information about ETDs by the institutions.
Various file formats included in electronic format of theses and dissertations is
also discussed. PDF is the exclusively used format for submitting full-text of
ETDs. But there are various other formats used for submitting additional files.
The next section explains very important concept for ETDs related to
Preservation and Copyright of ETDs. The researcher discussed definition of
digital preservation, need, concept of long term preservation, criteria for
selecting most appropriate digital preservation strategy for an institution,
benefits and various traditional and modern strategies of preservation used for
archiving and preserving the ETDs. Views of other authors and Copyright Act
are presented in this section.
The discussion now proceeds towards brief introduction of some fully
operational ETD Projects at International Level, Specific Country related
ETDs, Full-text ETD Projects in India and various Directories/Registries
which provide list of E-theses Repositories.
The concluding section presents NDLTDs Guide to Set up ETD Program in an
Institution. Also, there are numerous technical terms involved in ETD
Program. The researcher listed some of the most commonly used terms and
provided definitions. The terms are selected from USETDA and NDLTDs
ETD Terms and Definitions. Being pioneering international organization,
NDLTD explained ETD from various angles.
The next chapter analyses the data collected with the help of responses
received to the web survey questionnaire sent through e-mail to various Etheses repositories across the globe.

CHAPTER 5
DATA ANALYSIS & INTERPRETATION
5.1 E-Theses Repository Development & Management
The present chapter analyses and interprets the responses received from the web
survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was prepared through SurveyMonkey
which is an online questionnaire tool. The survey questionnaire web-link was emailed

along

with

a

letter

to

the

E-theses

repository

developers/managers.
Out of the 154 E-thesis repositories to whom the e-mail was sent, 96 responded,
making the response rate to 62.33%. After closing the survey, the researcher
exported the data collected into Microsoft Excel with the help of the Export
facility available in SurveyMonkey. The collected data is even represented in
graphs and charts which facilitated better analysis of results.
The questionnaire contained forty-nine questions which were divided into
following eleven sections:


Personal & Institutional Information



Background Information



Repository Materials



Hardware & Software



Accessibility Issues



Budget Considerations



Human Resource



Metadata Standards and Interoperability



Preservation Policy



Copyright/IPR Issues



Additional Information
Page 178

The sections can be briefed as follows,
1) Personal & Institutional Information:
The present section covered eight questions related to basic the institute and the Etheses repository manager.
2) Background Information:
This section contained ten questions for collecting background information to
understand issues regarding implementation, pre-requisites and factors that acts as
barriers for setting up of an E-theses repository.
3) Repository Materials:
The present section had five questions which aimed to find out the type of
documents covered in the E-theses repository and the various file formats
supported by the repository.
4) Hardware and Software:
Proper selection of hardware and software is an important part of setting-up a
repository. The four questions included in this section will help to understand the
type of software chosen and the reasons behind selecting it.
5) Accessibility Issues:
The purpose of the six questions of this section is to collect information regarding
issues related to accessibility, contributors of ETDs, and techniques applied by the
repositories to monitor usage.
6) Budget Considerations:
Financial support is very important factor for the set-up of a repository. The two
questions of this section will provide information regarding the source of funding
for implementation of ETD Program and will also inform about the percentage of
fund allocated for overall maintenance and staff of the repository.

Page 179

7) Human Resource:
Human Resource is the main component for the development of a Repository. The
three questions of this section will provide information regarding the people who
developed the E-theses Repository, whether the Repository Management is an
individual person's work or is it a team work and staff employed for the
development and maintenance of the repository.
8) Metadata Standards & Interoperability:
This section contains two questions related to Metadata standards ot the E-theses
Repository.
9) Preservation Policy:
Preservation of documents is of major concern in the world of electronic
documents. The present set of five questions will help the researcher to collect
information about the various digital preservation policies that are applied for
preserving ETDs. This section also deals with the issues related to withdrawing
policy of the ETD from the repository.
10) Copyright/Intellectual Property Right Issues:
Copyright and IPR issues is of great concern in the electronic era. The following
section deals with four questions related to provision of Copyright
Information,Copyright Owner of the ETD after submission and measures taken by
the repository to protect ETDs from getting plagiarized.
11) Additional Information:
The concluding section of the questionnaire contains eight questions and deal with
various issues related to E-theses Repository Manager's own experience during
the set-up of the repository, indexing of the repository in search engines and
directories, languages covered and links provided by the repository to other ETD
Projects.

Table 5.1.3: Subject Coverage of the Institution/University &
E-thesesRepository
The Subject Coverage of the Institution as well as the E-theses Repository was
found to be similar.

The results obtained regarding the subject coverage of

the institution/E-theses repository is tabulated in Table 5.1.3. It was found that
the repositories contained e-theses belonging to 38 different subjects.
The data received shows that of the participating institutions, 25% of the
institutions contain E-theses submitted in various areas of ‘Engineering’,
followed by 18.75% institutions which contain E-theses in Medical Sciences,
Chemistry (14.58%) and so on.

Page 185

The above data also indicates that 80% of E-theses Repositories are dedicated to
Scientific Subjects, which is much higher compared to the Arts, Humanities
&Social Sciences. This proves that major amount of research is done in scientific
subjects and ETDs have made a major impact in scientific subjects compared to
their social science counterparts.

Table 5.1.4: Country-wise Distribution of E-thesis Repositories
The above table details the country wise distribution of e-thesis repositories. Out of
the 43 countries which have e-thesis repositories in English language, 32 countries
responded. Web Survey questionnaire was e-mailed to the E-theses Repository
Managers of selected repositories from 43 countries out of which 32 countries
responded. The data collection received a major support from NDLTD, who promoted
the web survey questionnaire through their Social Networking Webpage.
USA contains the highest number of E-thesis Repositories i.e. 23.95% followed by
United Kingdom 8.33%. India occupies the second rank by having a share of 12.5%
repositories. Being the mother country, the researcher considered all the 27 active Ethesis Repositories in India, but only 12 provided data for the present research work.
Countries like Sweden, Canada, Ireland, South Africa, Italy, Netherlands, Bulgaria,
Ghana, Hungary, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Senegal, Spain,
Tunisia, Zimbabwe and Republic of Korea gave 100% response.
The data collection shows that developed countries like USA, UK, Australia etc. have
large number of E-thesis Repositories which means that Open Access Movement and
Page 187

ETD culture is well accepted in these countries. In developing countries like India,
Africa etc. the trend is in developing phase. The range of countries having
institutional repositories also show that almost all the countries in the world have
started including e-theses into their repositories considering its various benefits or
mandatory policies which are discussed later in this chapter.

Table 5.2: Time required for planning and implementation of
E-theses repository
Table 5.2 shows that 23(24%) institutions required 12 months for implementation of
E-theses Repository. This period included planning and pilot testing of software to be
used for developing E-theses repository. 12 (12.5%) institutions required 06 months
for implementation of E-theses Repository followed by 09 (9.4%) which required
24months. Two repositories (2.1%) required 48months, the highest in this category
Page 189

for planning and implementation of software for the repository. The researcher found
that in some cases, software used for pilot testing was different from the one finalized
for implementation of the repository.
According to the researcher the results obtained from pilot testing of particular
software where not satisfactory due to which the institutes opted for other software
during final implementation. Out of the 96 responses received, 14 E-theses Repository
skipped the question. It was also found that 02 institutions (2.1%) directly launched
the E-theses Repository without having any pilot testing.

Table 5.3: Year-wise distribution of E-theses Repository
Table 5.3 proves that although the first step towards E-thesis Repositories was taken
in 1988 but the increase in number of implementation of E-thesis Repositories can be
Page 190

seen in the beginning of 21st Century. The years 2007 and 2008 show the maximum
set up of E-theses repositories. The second-half of the first decade of 21st Century i.e.
from 2005 to 2010, several institutions across the world joined the Open Access
movement and established ETD Repositories.
The major reasons for the organisations/institutions supporting the Open Archives
Initiative are the declarations made by the Budapest Open Access Initiative (2002),
European Culture Heritage Online (ECHO) Charter (2002), Bethesda Statement on
Open Access Publishing (2003) and Berlin Declaration on Open Access to
Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities (2003) which emphasized on removing
access barriers to the scholarly literature to promote research, share it globally and to
make the literature useful to its maximum extent. Other than these several reports
were presented by individual universities and/or researchers which discussed
thebenefits of Open Access and ETDs in particular.University of North Texas
mentioned that, although the institution started mandatory ETD as early as 1999, the
ETDs were located somewhere in theinstitution central IT system and they were not
migrated to the current fully functional digital library system until 2007.
The number of repositories is showing an increasing trend in the second decade also
due to various projects being taken on National and/or International level for the
promotion of E-thesis Repositories.

Table 5.5: Results of exploratory activities before setting up E-theses repository
The above table shows that 30.9% respondents feel that it is Very Important to
analyze the literature review of Electronic theses and Dissertations in order to
influence institution’s decision for the implementation of E-theses Repository. Studies
done by McMillan (1996 & 1999)1,2, Sharretts et.al. (1999)3, Mac Coll (2002)4,
Vijayakumar (2001)5 and Ghosh (2011)6show that for setting up of institutional or etheses repository, it is very important to study the literature available worldwide on
Institutional Repositories, ETD Projects, Open Access Initiatives etc. since literature
reviews usually discuss the research proposals and results of particular research.
Markey et.al. (2007)7 conducted MIRACLE (Making Institutional Repositories a

Collaborative Learning Environment) Project to understand the implementation of
institutional repositories in academic institutions. The project findings emphasized on
the importance of analyzing literature reviews. According to Boote&Beile (2005)8, ‘a
thorough and sophisticated literature review is the foundation and inspiration for
substantial and useful research’.
34.8% respondents feel that Attending Open Source Software Implementation training
& workshops is Important whereas 25% people feel that it is Very Important because
workshops and seminars provide platform through which institutions/ individual get
updated information on key issues related to concerned topics, to interact with other
people who may be experiencing similar issues and problems, to tackle issues
together etc. Organisers of some workshops/seminars sometimes also invite Expert
Speakers who have the necessary subject expertise and practical implementation
experience which will be beneficial for the participants of the workshops.
38.7% people feel that Learning about available expertise and assistance is Important.
In the research conducted by Krishnamurthy & Kemparaju (2011)9, it was found that
in spite of presence of elite institutions in India, due to lack of expertise and resources
available, the growth of institutional repositories in India has not been of the desired
level. Checking out the available expertise is important for hassle free continuity in
the working of repository.
According to 44.6% respondents, learning about successful implementation at other
institutions is Very Important factor for influencing institutions. Susan et.al.(2005)10,
Carbery (2009)11 in their research papers have focused on the point of knowledge of
successful implementation of ETD repositories in various institutions.
35.2% respondents say that demonstrating operational E-theses repositories to
institutions decision makers is ‘Important’.Andrew (2004)12 discussed about the
Theses Alive! Project of Edinburgh University in order to initiate a pilot national
service of ETDs through partner institutions in Great Britain in 2004.Fox et.al.
(2009)13 introduced and demonstrated the highly successful NDLTD, which explained
the complete working of NDLTD as the largest collection of ETDs in the world.
Demonstration of operational repositories help to get the institutional decision makers
Page 194

interested in the benefits that the institution will get after adopting open access. It is
also an effective way to clarify product related concerns.
There were a negligible percentage of respondents who did not know or never thought
of the above mentioned activities which might influence the institution’s decision
makers about implementing E-theses Repository.

Table 5.6: Objectives for the set-up of E-theses Repository
Table 5.6 rates the relevance of various objectives in setting up of E-theses repository.
The most relevant statement, according to repository objectives, was using them as a
mode ofenhancing exposure to ETDs with 74.5% considering this highly relevant.
Promoting datasharing was also considered highly relevant by 70.2% and relevant by
24.5%. Thepreservation of digital resources was also voted as highly relevant by
66.7% respondents. However, compared to other objectives, using therepository as a
Page 195

means of promoting new modes of publication received a low response with 51.6%
considering it highlyrelevant or 31.2% relevant.
The findings from the literature review indicated that the main objectives for E-theses
Repository development is enhanced exposure to ETDs and to promote data sharing
and knowledge through open access. Studies conducted by Russell (2006)14, Ghosh
(2007)15, Ratanya (2010)16, Bhat (2010)17 mention preservation of digital resources as
one of the important reasons for implementing E-theses repository. The same factor
gains important in the present study too as the third most highly relevant reasons.
Some repositories, along with performing the function of dissemination of resources,
also work as publishing systems. However, the number is lowest compared to others.
Russell, I.G. (2009)18 in her doctoral research work had similar findings which show
that enhanced exposure to ETDs is the main reason why Institutions want to set up Etheses repository.

Table 5.7: Reasons for contribution in E-thesis repositories
Question No. 7 asked for possible reasons for which contributors of the institution
will submit their theses and dissertations in the E-theses Repository. The question was
a mix of close ended list with 10 options from which respondents were allowed to
choose all the probable reasons and they were also given freedom to specify other
reasons not mentioned in the list.
The above table shows that 75.5% respondents feel that the major reason for
contributing ETDs in the repository is ‘to provide maximal access to the research
results’. Similar results were received by Sawant (2009)19 in her doctoral research
wherein a varied group of respondents comprising of Under-Graduate & PostGraduate students, M.Phil/Ph.D researchers, Teachers, Scientists from various
scientific institutions of India, were asked the main reason for contributing their
research work in Institutional Repositories.
The second important reason is the ‘Mandatory Policy of the institute’. Studies done
by Bevan (2005)20 and Swan (2008)21discussed the e-thesis mandatory submission
policies and how it helps to increase the number of contributors in the repository. 56.4
% respondents feel that contributors of their institutions will contribute E-thesis in
their repository ‘to encourage open access.’

Page 197

Reasons for contributions from ‘Others’
Reasons for contribution
Persistent URLs will always remain valid
In Spain we have a national law which requires that the thesis be
deposited in an institutional repository
Primary reason is that submission electronically is much easier
than submitting print. Students do not deposit direct into our
repository. Our process begins with their submission to Graduate
College and ends with auto-publishing into the repository.
All other reasons are positive benefits, which we use to promote
IR services for other types of collections
Contribution to the tenure track of the researcher
We have a mandatory policy for registering publications, but it is
not mandatory to archive full-text

Other reasons specified by the respondents for contributing in the E-theses Repository
are mentioned in the above table. Totally 07 reasons were specified.
eRepositoryManager of Stellenbosch University (South Africa) considers submitting
e-thesis to the repository as a persistent thing since it will be forever available on the
Internet for access. Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) mentioned the
presence of Mandatory National Law for submitting e-thesis in their institutional
repository. Such initiatives at National Level have not been come across so far.
Submission of e-thesis is considered a much easier option compared to submitting
print. Dalarna University (Sweden) has a mandatory policy for registering
publications, but full-text submission is not compulsory. Head of Digital Production
Centre, Wageningen University (Netherlands)mentionsdepositing e-thesis in the
repository as a good medium through which an individual researcher’s contribution
can be tracked. Oklahoma State University (USA) Digital Initiatives Head mentioned
publicity as one of the reasons since people like to have their ‘name’ and ‘research’
readily available on the Internet.

Table 5.8: Barriers in implementing E-theses Repository
The above question deals with the factors that acted as barriers in implementing ETD
Program. List of 14 factors were given and the respondents were given a choice to
Page 199

choose all that applied during the implementation of their institutional e-theses
repository. Also, they were given the option to specify barriers other than the ones
mentioned.
The major barrier identified by 64(71.9%) respondents for implementation of an etheses repository is ‘Concern about Copyright/IPR issues of ETDs’. Park, Nam & Oh
(2007)22 discussed the survey conducted by National Assembly Library of Korea on
management of electronic theses at several university libraries in Korea. The survey
found that 91% of the libraries are digitizing theses and dissertations and 73% had a
copyright policy for electronic dissertations.
Fyffe & Welburn (2008)23 discussed opportunities for academic libraries concerning
the development of repository programs for Electronic Theses and Dissertations
(ETDs) with particular focus given to copyright management.Vijayakumaret.al.
(2004& 2005)24, 25 analysed the opinions of selected Ph.D researchers and guides from
selected Indian Universities funded under UGC on Copyright and IPR issues related
to ETDs and alsodescribed a framework for Indian Universities to go about with
creating their own Institutional Repositories of Theses and Dissertations and also
highlighted the Formats, Software and copyright issues related to ETD archiving. All
these studies show that Copyright issues are very important to be addressed properly
before implementing E-theses Repository.
Davis & Connolly (2007)26 analysed the reasons for non-use of Cornell’s Institutional
Repository and found that the major reasons mentioned by the academics for not
depositing in the IR was redundancy with other modes of disseminating information,
confusion with copyright, fear of plagiarism and inconsistent quality. The respondents
for the present research also identified ‘Plagiarism Issues’ as second most important
reason that acts as barrier along with ‘Lack of faculty knowledge about ETD and their
benefits’. Both the reasons received 44 responses. ‘Absence of stringent rules
regarding mandatory contribution of ETDs’ scored 3rd Rank with 40.4% respondents
choosing it as one of the main barriers that hinders contribution of ETDs in
repository.

Page 200

Melero (2009)27 analysed the current state of Spanish open-access institutional
repositories and the main inhibitors identified were the absence of stringent policies,
the lack of integration with other national and international systems and the lack of
awareness among faculty.Evaluationof collection of digital libraries and institutional
repositories in India conducted by Mittal & Mahesh (2008)28 also mention lack of
faculty awareness as one of the major reasons for weak status of Institutional
Repositories in India.
‘Inability of contributors to formulate quality data’ and ‘Equipment Availability’
share the lowest rank as they are identified by only 7.9% respondents as barriers for
contributing in E-theses repository.
‘Other’ barriers specified are:
Barriers
We had no barriers
Student's concern regarding fees in 2005. Now it is
free.
We still also produce print copies!
Fear of losing subsequent publishing and
commercialization opportunities because the IP was
exposed in the open access manuscript
Implementing ETD worked very fine, based on a wellestablished pilot study
Those checked the most obvious but to a degree some
others with lesser impediments.

The ‘Other’ reasons specified by 10 respondents bring into consideration some
interesting facts. Four respondents’ namely Georgetown University (USA), University
of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA), Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) and
CQUniversity Australia did not face any problems while implementing ETD Program.
During the initial days of ProQuest (USA) in 2005, students were concerned
regarding fees that will be charged for accessing the E-theses repository. Later, they
had no problem, since access was made free of cost. Chalmers University of
Page 201

Technology (Sweden) mentioned that they accept thesis in both print and electronic
format. Uppsala University Library (Sweden) could solve all the problems by doing a
pilot study before final implementation. Monash University Research Repository
(Australia) users had the fear of losing subsequent publishing and commercialisation
opportunities since IP address was exposed in the open access manuscript.

The above table mentions the ‘Other’ promotional activities specified by respondents.
Totally fourteen respondents have specified promotional activities practised by them
other than the one listed in the web-questionnaire. Majority of the respondents
specified use of social media like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Blogs etc. for creating
awareness about the benefits of E-theses Repository.
Rutgers University (USA) & Boston University (USA) mention framing of mandatory
policies for students to submit E-theses in repositories. Stellenbosch University
(South Africa) & Oklahama State University (USA) promote advantages of E-theses
Repository with the help of presentations to faculty, researchers, and students during
seminars, in classes etc.
Along with London School of Economics & Political Science (UK), Rutgers
University (USA) conducts workshops, information literacy programmes for students.
A special class is conducted by London School of Economics & Political Science
entitled ‘your research and building a network’that talks about LSE Thesis Online and
shares research findings using social media.
Brandeis University (USA) mentioned providing ‘Outreach to faculty in various
departments for undergraduate theses.’ The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
already has a mandate in place for Master's students. California Institute of
Technology (USA) conducts classes for students, faculty and staff to make them
aware about the institution’s repository, its benefits, copyright and intellectual issues,
and procedure to deposit theses. Yale University (USA) promotes E-theses repository
by writing articles about its benefits and presenting them at the ETD meetings.

Page 206

Creating awareness about E-theses repository is a mandatory part of promotion
procedure for Leiden University (Netherlands). Ounongo University (Namibia)
practices word of mouth publicity process during informal meetings, through phone
calls and e-mails briefing about the advantages of E-theses repository.
All the above mentioned activities prove that all over the world, institutions/repository
managers etc. are trying various ways to promote E-theses repository with available
manpower and budget.
Fernandez (2006)30 in her research evaluated growth and development of online
research repositories in India. Based on participant’s feedback a list of best practices
is also prepared. She found that respondents organised seminars, workshops, sent emails to faculty members in order to promote open access. Sawant (2009) presented
the status report of institutional repository initiatives in India. She also found that
‘Links from library website’ is the second most popular promotional activity practised
after ‘Personal Contact’ with faculty members.

Table 5.13 shows the response received from ninety-six respondents. ‘Journal Articles
(78 i.e. 82.1%)’ as the most favourable digital document included other than ETDs in
the E-theses Repository followed by ‘Conference/Seminar Papers (66i.e 69.5%),
Books (58 i.e. 61%), Conference Proceedings (55 i.e.57.9%) and Technical Reports
(52 i.e. 54.73%). The web questionnaire provided list of twenty two types of digital
documents most commonly included in the institutional repositories, divided into
categories of peer-reviewed, non peer-reviewed and don’t know (repository manager
not sure about the reviewing status of the document).
With the literature review done for the present research, a new type of digital
document came to notice i.e. ‘Habilitation’ which is a Professional thesis submitted
by the candidate after pursuing Ph.D and is regarded as the highest Academic
Qualification in European Countries. Seventeen respondents out of 95 i.e 17.89%
selected ‘Habilitation’ as one of the types of digital documents submitted other than
ETD. The data received shows higher number of paper based digital equivalents like
Journal Articles, Books, Conference papers, Technical Reports etc. included in the
repositories. An interesting result is that Books are the third most popular document to
be digitised in the repository.

Twenty-two respondents mentioned sixteen types of documents included in the
repository. Five respondents namely Cranfield University (UK), University of
Birmingham (UK), Robert Gordon University (UK), Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de
Lausanne (Switzerland) and University of Agder (Norway) include digitised ‘Book
Chapters’ in their repository. University of Zimbabwe Library (Zimbabwe),
University of Agder (Norway) & Stellenbosch University (South Africa) permit the
submission of digitised ‘Working Papers’ which are preliminary scientific or technical
papers.
CFTRI (India) and California Institute of Technology (USA) allow the submission of
‘Unpublished papers’ since these works are sometimes widely cited, circulated by
informal means.
The other thirteen repositories contain digitised monographs, dictionaries, lithograph,
artefacts, designs, images, exam papers etc.

Table 5.14: Peer-review or Non Peer-review Status of ETDs
Q. 13 and Q. 14 are related to each other in the way that in the responses received for
the former, the type of document accepted i.e. whether peer-reviewed or non-peerreviewed is also mentioned. The third category is included because for some of the
materials accepted, the repository managers don’t know whether they are reviewed or
not.
For the present research, the data collected shows that, 59.4% i.e. 57 repositories
deposit Peer-reviewed material, 28.1% mentioned that they include Non Peerreviewed material and 12.5% ‘Don’t know’ whether the materials deposited are
reviewed or not.
Using Peer-review documents provides authenticity to the materials included in the
Repository. It is a form of quality assurance. Tenopir & King (2001)32 mention that
publishers in order to promote the dissemination of the publication collect
manuscripts according to the interests of particular readership and ensure quality of
the material provided.
The responses received for the present research show that 75.8% repositories include
Peer-reviewed Journal articles followed by 52.6% repositories which contain Peerreviewed Conference/Seminar Papers. Some of the repositories clearly notify peerreviewed or non-peer-reviewed document using symbols. These conditions of peerreviewed and non-peer-reviewed directly affect the range of types of materials to be
included in the repository. Solomon (2007)33 mentions peer reviewing process as one
of the most important mechanisms for validating the information contained in
scholarly journals.
Page 212

On the other hand, twenty five repositories i.e. 26.3% respondents stated that they
include Non peer-reviewed Photographs followed by twenty four repositories i.e.
25.2% repositories include non-peer-reviewed Technical Reports.
Q 15. Mention the number of digital documents that your repository contains.
Sr.No.

Table 5.15: Number of Digital Documents in the repository
Q. no. 15 was close ended and the respondents were required to mention the number
of digital documents under each category. The Institution wise distribution of digital
documents in Table 5.15.1 provides a detailed report of the collection of each
Page 213

repository as mentioned by the Repository Manager in the Web questionnaire
response. The total number of digital documents as obtained from the data collection
is 24, 35, 078.

Some of the repositories could not mention the statistical information for all the digital
documents included by them since there was no system adopted for counting all the

types of documents or till now they have never counted their collection. Not all the
repositories contain all types of digital documents.
As mentioned in Q.12 about 10 repositories containing only ETDs, such repositories
have clearly mentioned ‘NA (Not Applicable)’ for digital documents other than
ETD.The category of ETD is classified into Doctoral Theses, Master’s Theses &
Bachelor Theses. The total number of ETDs available from the collected data is
4,70,368. British Library’s EThOS with 70000+ ETDs ranked first in the list followed

38000+ ETDs.
According to the data provided, Jawaharlal Nehru University (India) has the highest
number of digital documents with a total collection of 8,18,000 followed by
University of North Texas (USA) having 3,75,156 digital documents and Ecole
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) having 1,17,384 digital
documents.
JNU (India, 2013) is having 18000+ ETDs and huge collection of Newspaper
Clippings (8 Lakhs). Newspaper Clippings (8,39,671), Newspaper Articles
(3,77,983), ETDs (3,35,762) and Journal Articles (3,18,665) were the top-ranked
digital documents included in IR. Software (4) is the least included digital document.
Sawant (2009) in her study about institutional repositories in India found that there is
a correlation between number of digital documents and age of IR. She found that IISc
(Bangalore, India) being the oldest Indian IR set up in 2002 contains highest number
of digital documents (6305). The present research also noticed the same trend in the
IRs established after 2000 due to massive awareness drive of Open Access and its
benefits conducted since 2000. The oldest established IR of Orebro University
(Sweden, 1988) has a collection of 11,293.
Fifteen respondents did not mention the number of digital documents included in their
IR.

Three institutions namely Stellenbosch University (South Africa), Virginia tech
(USA), Rice University (USA) and University of South Florida (USA) support all file
formats. Rice University clarified that although all files are acceptable as simple
bitstreams, but text, images and moving images have enhanced support. California
Institute of Technology (USA) mentioned „Maps‟ as a file format supported by their
repository. University of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA) most likely supported all file
formats but was not sure of using them.
Study conducted by Park et.al. (2007)34explain the set-up of a protocol for electronic
thesis and dissertation (ETD) submission for the electronic thesis initiative pilot
project at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. The study mentioned that for full
implementation, three major issues must be taken into strong consideration i.e.
conversion; metadata; and file formats.

Fig. 5.5: Software Package used for building a repository
The Open Society Institute, New York has published „A Guide to Institutional
Repository Software v 3.0‟35 in order to help organisations in selecting a software
system that best satisfies an institution‟s needs. Directory of Open Access
Repositories (OpenDOAR)36 provides a list of 144+ IR Software packages.

Page 224

The present question asked the respondents to choose the IR software used for pilot
testing (if done before implementation of IR) and finally implemented for IR. The
questionnaire listed seven options and the respondents could also mention some other
software used by them.
Seventy-four respondents answered the question. It was observed that 36 respondents
implemented DSpace for their institutional repository. Out of these 36 Institutional
Repositories, 18 first pilot tested with DSpace and then implemented it. EPrints used
by 19 institutions, Digital Commons by 6, ETD-db by 3 and Greenstone by 2 were the
other IR software implemented. DoKS and OPUS were not used by any of the
institutional repositories who participated in the present research.There were some
institutions which usedmore than one software for pilot testing and later finalised one
or two softwarefor e.g. Stellenbosch University (South Africa) did pilot testing with
DSpace, EPrints and ETD-db and finally implemented DSpace. Virginia Tech (USA)
implemented DSpace and ETD-db for their institutional repository.
DSpace37 is found to be the most favorable repository software used worldwide. The
same is evident from the literature review done for the present research. Jones
(2004)38evaluated two open source software packages to deliver E-theses
functionality via a Web-based interface: ETD-db by Virginia Tech, and DSpace by
Hewlett-Packard (HP) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Jones
found that DSpace was much ahead of ETD-db.
Mondoux & Shiri (2009)39 found that 28 Canadian Post-Secondary Institutions use
DSpacefor their repositories. Vijayakumar & Murthy (2004)40suggested DSpace
software for Indian Universities to go about with creating their own Institutional
Repositories of Theses and Dissertations and also highlighted the Formats, Software
and copyright issues related to ETD archiving. Sutradhar (2006)41 mentioned the
selection of DSpace as the most suitable institutional repository software by IIT
Kharagpur. Lihitkar et.al. (2009)42studied the Indian scenario in developing the
institutional repositories and suggested that DSpace and Eprints are commonly used
open source software for institutional repositories. Sawant (2011)43 studied various
issues concerning the institutional repository software involved in development of IRs
in India. The research findings showed that 79% of IRs used DSpace Software.
Page 225

Sawant also found that in India many institutions conduct workshops to train library
professionals and non-professionals to develop IR using DSpace. ETD Preservation
Survey conducted by McMillan (2008)44 also proves that DSpace is the most
preferred platform for collecting, disseminating and storing ETDs.
In order to find out reasons for „Why DSpace is the most preferred Open Source
Software used worldwide for building Institutional Repositories?‟, the researcher
posted the question to NDLTD Listserv through which Repository Administrators
from across the world will be able to give their justification for choosing DSpace.
Two Repository Administrators responded to the query in the following manner:
a) Carl Grant, Associate Dean, Knowledge Services & Chief Technology Officer
University of Oklahoma Libraries.
“DSpace is typically preferred because:
1. It has the largest active user base. When adopting open source solutions,
looking at the community behind the product is a strong (although not
conclusive) indicator of how many people and/or organizations are
contributing into the code base (committers) and helping to sustain the product
in other ways (documentation, conferences, answering support questions,
etc). A sustainable product, over time, is a key part of the decision making.
2. It's a complete solution that allows people to quickly and easily download the
product and get it up and running. Other OSS repository solutions can require
people to select an interface to use with the backend, acquire those separately,
ensure versions selected between the various products will work together and
install. DSpace makes this much easier.
3. DSpace is quite functionally capable of doing the majority of tasks that many
people dealing with digital content need to do. Other products offer superior
capabilities in other facets of operations, but when balanced against the most
common needs of most institutions and the items listed above, DSpace
becomes an easy choice for many.”
(Carl Grant, personal communication, August 5, 2014)

Page 226

b) Thomas Dowling, Director of Technologies, Z. Smith Reynolds Library Wake
Forest University Vice President, Library and Information Technology
Association.
“We use DSpace because it,
i) does what we need;
ii) is free, open source software; and
iii) has an active developer community. Other schools may tell you their
criteria are ease of administration, an attractive UI, analytics, ability to
handle massive collections; integration with the library's ILS, etc.”

Twenty-eight respondents specified 13 different institutional repository software
package used by them. Rutgers University (USA), University of Hull (UK), London
School of Economics & Political Science (UK), Northeastern University (USA), Delft
University of Technology (Netherlands) and CQ University Australia use Fedora for
their institutional repository. DiVA developed by Uppsala University Library is used
by Swedish Institutions namely Orebro University, KTH Royal Institute of
Technology, Uppsala University, Swedish School of Sports & Health Sciences and
Dalarna University. CNUDST (Tunisia), Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
Page 227

(Switzerland) and CERN (Switzerland) implemented Invenio software for their
repository. There are some institutions like Georgetown University (USA),
Humboldt-Universitaetzu Berlin (Germany) and University of North Texas (USA)
which have locally developed software for their institutional repository. Other
institutions used Repository Software Packages like CONTENTdm, Digitool, Scigloo,
PDF, Hydra, VITAL and LUNA Insight.

Q.18 asked the respondents the reasons for choosing particular Institutional
Repository Software (Q.17). The question had six options and the respondents could
also mention other features. They were given the freedom to select all the features that
applied. The feature of being „Open Source‟ is the most important for choosing any
software. 78.9% respondents chose „Open Source‟ as the most important feature for
IR software. It is followed by „Greater functionality of the software‟ and „Adequate
support available‟ from the software developers. Features like „Easy installation and
maintenance‟, „User friendliness‟ and „Release of frequent updates‟ scored 4th, 5th&
6th rank respectively.

Eleven respondents mentioned 11 different features for choosing particular software
for their institutional repository. Stellenbosch University (South Africa) after pilot
testing with DSPace, Eprints & ETD-db, finally implemented DSpace because of the
„Active Community of Developers and Scalable‟ features. Rice University (USA) also
feels that DSpace has „Large Community Support‟ compared to other software.
Chadragupt Institute of Management (Patna, India) repository is a „Prototype‟ and for
pilot testing, they are using DSpace since it supports the common „Interoperability‟
standards used in the Institutional repository domain, such as Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, SWORD, OpenSearch, and RSS. More recent
versions of DSpace also support faceted search and browse functionality using
ApacheSolr.
Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) implemented „Scigloo‟ repository
software because they believe that developing their own system will enable to adapt

Page 229

to new requirements quickly, and interoperate with campus systems such as personal
database and Content Management System (CMS).
University of Hull (UK) chose Fedora/Hydra as the repository software because of its
„flexible‟ nature due to which it can change easily in response to different user and
system requirements.
The Institute for Christian Studies (Canada) implemented DSpace because they have
chosen to use the services of Open Repository based in the UK. Texas State
University (USA) decided on DSpace in order to get benefit of membership in the
Texas Digital Library.
Orebro University (Sweden) uses DiVA since it‟s developed by Swedish consortia
and using it will help them in „developing close cooperation with user community‟.
Monash University (Australia) used EPrints for pilot testing purpose by finally
administered VITAL because it has „flexible storage of a wide range of content mime
types and metadata schemas.‟
Virginia Tech (USA) uses DSpace and ETD-db as their repository software because
of their „Active user communities‟. CORA Repository (Norway) uses DSpace but
have no special reason for using it. The Repository Manager informed of buying the
solution from BIBSYS Brage which is a supplier for library and information systems
for all Norwegian Libraries.

Table 5.19: Server connectivity of the E-theses repository
The present question deals with server connectivity issues i.e. the respondents were
asked whether their repository is accessible throughout the world via Internet or is it
only campus accessible i.e. on Intranet. The response received was not unexpected as
majority of institutions (91.7%) are having their repositories accessible on Internet.
This proves that majority of the institutions want to share their institutional research
work with the world.

Table 5.20: Type of E-theses repository server
Q.20 asked the respondents the type of server which is hosting their E-thesis
Repository. Respondents were given two options listed in the questionnaire and were
also given the option to specify some other server that is hosting their repository.
84.3% (75) respondents have their repository on institution‟s server. 15.7% (14) opted
for cloud computing server. Cloud computing provides infrastructure flexibility, faster
deployment of applications and data, cost control, adaptation of cloud resources to
real needs, improved productivity, etc.45Although it is gaining momentum but there
are many institutions that prefer continuing with Institution‟s server.
GNU Project initiator Richard Stallman46 and Oracle founder Larry Ellison warned
that „the whole concept of cloud computing is rife with privacy and ownership
concerns and constitute merely a fad. There are several discouraging issues related to
cloud computing like: reliability, legal issues, lack of standards, security, privacy
issues etc.‟

Table 5.21: Accessibility provided
The above question provides information regarding the ways in which access is
provided to the ETDs in the E-thesis Repositories across the world. It was a closed
ended question with seven options. Respondents could select all the options
applicable to them. 93 respondents answered the question. It was observed that 76
institutions (81.7%) provided „Full text access to anyone accessing the E-theses
Repository‟. The reason for providing full-text access to anyone can be related to the
results obtained in Q.7 of the present research wherein 75.5% respondents feel that
the major reason for contributing ETDs in the repository is „to provide maximal
access to the research results‟ and 56.4 % respondents feel that contributors of their
institutions will contribute E-thesis in their repository „to encourage open access.‟
Antelman (2004)47 conducted a research to find out whether open access articles have
a greater research impact. The research was conducted on mathematics, electrical and
electronic engineering, political science, and philosophy. Antelman found that, across
all four disciplines, freely available articles had great research impact. The same
results can even be applied for ETDs since users prefer getting free full-text rather

Page 234

than paying something for the information. More citation to institution‟s research
work helps in raising the profile of the institution.
Twenty-one institutions (22.6%) provide „full-text access only to Institution
Members‟. Such repositories provide Username and Password to their faculty
members through which they can access the full-text ETD. Reasons for such restricted
access can be related to Q.8 of the present study in which large number of contributor
have expressed concern over Copyright/ IPR issues and plagiarism issues in open
access. Equal number of institutions (11.8%) provides „Access to metadata access or
abstract only access to non-institutional users.‟
None of the institutions who responded to the question provide „Paid access to fulltext of ETDs‟ or „Full text access only to subscribers of the database.‟

Table 5.22: Period covered of the ETDs
Q.22 provides information regarding the period since which ETDs are available in the
repository. Three options were listed in the questionnaire and respondents could also
specify some other answer not mentioned in the list. 56.7% institutions provide access
to „ETDs right from the inception of the institution‟. Providing access since the first
thesis or dissertation submitted to the institute helps in increasing citation count of the
faculty members of the institute. 35.1% institutions include „ETDs submitted during

since January 2011. MIT (USA) provides access to ETDs since inception of the
institution and also mentioned that it includes theses since 1920. Georgetown
University (USA) executed it‟s repository in 2009 and provides access to ETDs
submitted since 2005. ETDs submitted prior to 2005 are accessible through ProQuest
ETD. Rutger‟s University (USA) established it‟s repository in 2007 and since then

it‟s repository in 2008 and since then includes all the digitised MA theses whereas
Senior Honors Theses (Bachelor‟s Theses) is included since 2013.
Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) executed it‟s repository in 2004 and
regarding the coverage period of ETDs commented that „Most content from most
recent years, but it varies since e-publishing is voluntary, and older theses are scanned
and added afterwards.‟
University of Hull (UK) implemented repository in 2008 and since then has included
ETDs. They have also mentioned that the repository contains very few ETDs that
were submitted before 2008 to the institute. The periodicity is irregular.
LSE Thesis Online (UK) was set up in 2010 and includes all ETDs from 2011.
Historical print theses are digitised and added intermittently. It is not a continuous
process. Northeastern University (USA) implemented institutional repository in 2008.
The ETD Program was also started in 2008 and since then all the ETDs are accessible
in the repository. Texas State University (USA) provides access to ETDs submitted
since 2010 in their institutional repository. Theses and dissertations submitted prior to
2010 are not made available. Boston University (USA) started repository services in
2013 and presently includes only ETDs submitted in 2013. They are digitizing theses
from the inception of the institution and will soon make them accessible.
St.John Fisher College (USA) established repository in 2012 and presently are in
process of scanning the archival theses and dissertations and posting them in their
repository. University of Glasgow (Scotland, UK) implemented repository in 2008
and students have been required to submit e-theses from session 2007-08 onwards.
Archival theses and dissertations will also be scanned and added. The institute
subscribes to EThOS.
Page 237

KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) executed its repository in 2000 and
include ETDs since 1998. Uppsala University (Sweden) set up the repository in 2000
and provides access to the digitised forms of different publications from different
years. However, doctoral theses are accessible since 2003.
Claremont University Consortium (USA) started it‟s repository in 2006 and since then
all ETDs are included. Earlier theses and dissertations are scanned and made available
on demand. Virginia Tech (USA) implemented its repository in 1997 and since
thenall has been submitting theses and dissertations electronically. The repository also
contains less than 10,000 scanned Theses and Dissertations.
Swedish School of Sports & Health Sciences (Sweden) executed their repository in
2007 and provide access to Student's theses 2005 onwards and Completed research
publications 2010 onwards. North-West University (South Africa) implemented their
repository in 2009 and provides access to ETDs from 2007. Theses and Dissertations
prior to 2007 are made available on demand.
Observing the trend, it can be concluded that E-thesis Repositories prefer including
ETDs since the inception of the institution or repository thereby maximising the
extent to which the research work of the institution reaches to the community. The
institutions which are not providing access to archival theses and dissertations are
soon planning to do so.

Table 5.23: Authorised contributors of the ETDs
Q 23 asked the respondents to choose the authorised contributors to their institution‟s
E-theses repository. The question listed eleven options and the institutions could
select more than one mention. They were also given the opportunity to mention other
contributors.
The top most authorised contributors of ETDs are Post Graduate Students (64.4%),
Librarians (63.3%), Faculty (57.8%) and Research Scientists (47.8%). External
Contributors (6.7%), Archivists (8.9%) and Computer Service Staff (13.3%) are less
likely authorised contributors of ETDs.
During literature search for the present research no reference was found directly
related to authorised contributors of ETDs only in E-thesis Repositories. However, the
researcher got reference of studies done on contributors of institutional repositories.
Markey et.al.(2007) in „Census of Institutional Repositories in the United States‟
found that the top most authorised contributors are Librarians (79.2%), faculty
(77.1%), graduate students (56.3%), research scientists (56.3%) and archivists
(54.2%). Less likely authorised contributors were Academic Support Staff (37.5%),
Institution‟s News Service (12.5%), Press (16.7%), Central Computer Services Staff
(16.7%) and External Contributors (16.7%). Out of 2147 academic library directors
and senior library administrators, 446 participated in the Census.
Markey‟s research results match the present research findings to some extent since for
both Post Graduate Students and Librarians score 1st and 2nd ranks.
Sawant (2009) in her study of „Institutional Repositories in India‟ found that the 1 st
ranked authorised contributors are Faculty Members (71.43%), followed by Research
Scientists (64.29%0 and Library Staff (57.14%). In the present research Faculty
members and Research Scientists score 3rd& 4th rank.

one of the contributors.
Orebro University (Sweden) mentions that the archive contains all students‟ theses
and all research produced in all institutions/departments. It does not specify any
particular category of authorised contributor. Ounongo University (Nigeria)
mentioned faculty, Post Graduate students, Librarians, Computer Service Staff,
Academic Support Staff and Administrative Staff as the authorised contributors to Etheses Repository and also informed of starting a student repository for undergraduate items to be available only on the intranet.

Table 5.24: Major contributors of ETDs
The above question asked the respondents to select the category of major contributors
to their E-theses Repository. It was found that Post Graduate Students (50%) were the
major contributors in the E-thesis Repositories throughout the world followed by
Research Scientists (16.3%), Faculty (12.8%) and Librarians (15.1%). Only one
institution mentioned „Doctoral Students‟ as the major contributor of ETDs in the
repository.
Categories of „Computer Service Staff‟, „Academic Support Staff‟, „External
Contributors‟ and „Archivists‟ were not the major contributors for any institute. This
response was not unexpected considering the information received in Q.23 wherein

Page 241

few institutions have mentioned having these four categories as their authorised
contributors.
As mentioned in previous question about unavailability of survey results of E-theses
Repository, for the present question we can consider the institutional repository
survey results.
Markey et.al. (2007) in their study found that faculty (33.3%), graduate students
(20.5%) and Librarians (10.3%) are the major contributors in their institutional
repositories. On the same lines, Sawant (2009) in her study found faculty (64.29%),
Research Scientists (50%) and Library Staff (42.86%) as the major contributors in the
institutional repositories.
Although the results of the present research do not completely match the previous
studies done but it can be stated that Research Scientists, Faculty and Librarians
constitute the categories of major contributors in Institutional/E-thesis Repositories.

questionnaire.
Institute of Christian Studies (Canada) chose „Post Graduate Students‟ as the major
contributor of ETD but also mentioned that this category might change in future as
they will keep adding more and more types of collection in their E-theses Repository.
Yale University (USA) mentioned „Medical Students‟ as the major contributors.
Boston University (USA) informs about the largest number of contributions being

Library (UK) have „Librarians‟ as the major contributors but also specified that
University Library is the major contributor „for paper (print) information‟ whereas
Repository Staff is the major contributor for „digital information‟. Health Service
Executive Ireland acknowledged „Public Health Doctors & Psychologists‟ as the
major contributor of ETDs in the E-theses repository.

Table 5.25: Ways of monitoring the usage of ETDs
Q.25 investigated about the usage monitoring techniques used by the repositories. The
questionnaire listed nine options and the respondents could select more than one
option applied by them. Also, some other monitoring technique could also be
mentioned.
It was found that 57.3% i.e. 51 respondents monitored the E-theses Repository usage
by „Statistical count of number of views (Abstract+PDF/HTML)‟ followed by 53.9%
Page 243

taking into consideration the „Statistical count of number of full-text downloads
(country wise)‟and 46.1% opting for „Statistical count of number of views (country
wise)‟. Thirteen E-thesis repositories (14.6%) have not employed any monitoring
method till date.
The present research result has similarity with Sawant‟s (2009) study wherein she also
found highest number of respondents (57.14%) using „Tracking number of views
(Abstract +PDF/HTML)‟ for assessment of IR usage. However, she noticed „Tracking
number of views (Abstract only)‟ and „Tracking number of users‟ as second most
commonly implemented IR assessment system. The present research found „Country
wise full-text downloads‟ as second most important assessment technique.

Four institutions have mentioned some additional monitoring techniques other than
the ones listed in the questionnaire.
California Institute of Technology (USA) does the assessment of E-theses repository
usage by „Statistical count of number of views (Abstract Only)‟ and „Statistical count
of number of full-text downloads (Country wise)‟. Other than these usage analysis
methods, the institute has developed advanced monitoring system to keep track of
hourly, daily, weekly and monthly visits. Also keeps track of duration for which the
pages are visited, search engines used, web browsers, navigation tools, keywords
used.

Page 244

Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) evaluates the E-theses repository usage
by „Tracking number of contributions‟. However, they have also mentioned of testing
other measuring methods (our developer can see frequency of use/download etc.) But,
the institute does not publish user statistics on the web.
Orebro University (Sweden) applies all the eight methods mentioned in the
questionnaire for monitoring the usage of E-theses repository. They have mentioned
of getting all the usage statistics data from AWStats (http://awstats.sourceforge.net/)
which is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web, streaming,
ftp or mail server statistics, graphically.
University of Glasgow (UK) is presently not using any usage assessment method.
They have recently upgraded to EPrints 3.10 and will be using IRStats which is a
flexible statistics package which allows easy processing of accesses to full-text
documents of eprints. It can be downloaded from the EPrints File repository
The above mentioned monitoring techniques shows that the institutions are in need of
such statistics in order to see the popularity of their E-theses repository and to
understand the extent of usage of the ETDs submitted in the repository by global
users. These monitoring techniques also help the institutions to understand the various
search terms used to retrieve information regarding the ETDs.

Table 5.26: Frequency of use of ETDs
Q 26 deals with the perception of usageof the E-theses repository. As expected, 79.1%
i.e. 72 institutions mentioned that ETDs found within their repository are used
„Frequently‟. 20.9% i.e 19 institutions mention „Occasional‟ usage of ETDs submitted
in their repository. Ninety one institutions responded to the question, out of which
Page 245

none of the institutions have the opinion that their E-theses repository is used „Rarely‟
or is „Never‟ used.
The findings of the present research are similar to Russell‟s (2009) findings regarding
usage of electronic resources and institutional repositories. She found that 53%
respondents considered that their materials within the repository are used frequently,
25% stated occasional usage and 4% said rarely or never.
It is interesting to note that users across the world understand the importance and
benefits of ETDs and are frequently using them.

Table 5.27: Source of funding of E-theses repository
Q 27 asked the respondents about the source of funding provided by their institution
for implementation of ETD program. The questionnaire provided a list of four sources
of funding and the respondents were also requested to mention some other funding
source.
Table 5.27 reports that 67.9% institutions had the opinion that „Costs covered in
routing operating costs of institution‟s library‟ is the major source of funding for
implementation of ETD program.

24.7% stated „Provision of special grant by

institution‟s administration‟. 16% respondents feel that the major source of funding is
„Costs covered in routing operating costs of your institution‟s computer services‟ and
7.4% say that „Grant is awarded by an external agency‟. Sawant (2009) in her study
also found 57.14% respondents agreed that the main source of funding for
institutional repositories came from routing operating costs of your institution‟s
library. However, unlike the present study wherein 24.7% institutions said that
„Special grant is provided by institution‟s administration‟ and 7.4% had an opinion

Page 247

that „External agency awards grant for implementation of ETD Program‟, in Sawant‟s
study, none of the participating institutions selected these as the funding sources.
Bailey (2006) also found that out of the 87 respondents, majority did not have a
dedicated budget for repositories. Markey et. al. (2007) also found that top ranked
funding source for implementation of institutional repositories came from library.

questionnaire. CNUDST (Tunisia) receives funding for implementation of E-theses
repository through International co-operation under the European Project- TEMPUS
IV. Brandeis University (USA) e-theses repository manager is not aware of funding
source for repository implementation. Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden)
believes that the main source of funding for implementation of E-theses Repository
comes from institution‟s library and more staff has been allotted by the institution for
the successful implementation of ETD Program. Repository Manager of London
School of Economics and Political Science (UK) mentions of being unaware of source
of funding since it was set up by the previous staff. Dublin Institute of Technology
(Ireland) receives the funding as annual subscription from the Institute. British
Library (UK) receives funding from the UK Government for the E-theses repository
since it is regarded as a core service required for higher education and research.
University of Waterloo (Canada) receives funding from multiple sources namely
Page 248

institution‟s library, computer services and Graduate Studies Office. Central
Queensland University (Australia) receives external funds for implementation of full
institutional repository and not specifically ETD Repository. However, the institute
did not mention the sources from where external funds are received. SzentIstvan
University (Hungary) receives special grant from Chamber of Veterinary Medicine
for implementation of E-theses Repository. KNUSTSpace (Ghana) does not have any
special funding for ETD Program.
The responses received for the present question shows that majority of the institutions
receive funding from the institution‟s library or from external sources. Hence, it can
be said that funding is very important for proper implementation and functioning of
ETD Program.

The above question asked the institutions to provide percentage wise details of the
allocation of funds under various categories during 2012-13. The respondents were
asked to mention the percentage of the fund utilised of the total fund available. The
question was close ended and provided seven options.
Out of the 33% i.e.32 institutions who responded for the question, it was found that
84.4% institutions mentioned that major percentage of grant is utilised for Staff.
Page 249

Dublin City University (Ireland) utilises 100% of the special grant provided by the
institution‟s administration for Staff. Rutgers University (USA) utilises highest
percentage of allocated fund for staff i.e.95%, followed by Monash University
(Australia) and CQUniversity (Australia) who utilise 90% fund for staff.
„Software maintenance and updates‟ is the second category for which higher
percentage of funds are utilised. Auckland University of Technology (New Zealand)
mentioned utilising 100% grants for software maintenance. Hardware Acquisition,
Software Acquisition and System Backup share the third rank, followed by Hardware
Maintenance. Only 46.9% i.e. 15 institutions mention that they utilise some
percentage of the allotted grants for „Consultancy‟. Norwegian Prison and Probation
Staff Academy (Norway) is the only institute which uses 50% for Consultancy.
Remaining 50% amount is utilised for Staff by the institute.
Sawant (2009) for her research found that none of the institutions responded for the
question on allocation of funds available for institutional repository. However, the
analysis of the comments provided by some of the institutions show the absence of
special allocation of funds for institutional repository under specific categories of
staff, hardware and software maintenance etc. Markey et.al. (2007) found that 75% of
the available grant is used for staff and vendor fees, followed by 10% for Hardware
acquisition and 7% for Software acquisition.
The responses received for the present research approximately matches with Markey‟s
research findings.

Table 5.29: Head of the E-theses Repository
Q. 29 required the respondents to inform about the designation who is heading the Etheses repository. The question had 14 designations listed and the respondents were
requested to select only one option that is applicable to their repository. In case, some
other designation was heading the repository then the respondents could specify the
designation in the answer box provided.
43.4% i.e. 33 institutions have „Librarians‟ as the Head of the E-theses repository
followed by 13.2% E-theses repository headed by a „Library Staff Member‟ and 6.6%
headed by „Assistant Librarian‟. None of the E-theses repository had any staff
Page 251

member of information centre or information division as the Head of the E-theses
repository.
Kamraninia & Abrizah (2010)48 conducted a study to find out the role of librarians in
deployment and recruitment of institutional repositories in eight universities in
Malaysia. They found that Librarians were heading most of the institutional
repositories since they have professional training of creating metadata, content
organisation, preservation of digital materials and self-archiving techniques.Burns
et.al. (2013)49 argued that academic librarians add value to the scholarly
communication process when they establish institutional repository by creating proper
metadata and providing permanent URI for the work. Librarians also have a better
understanding of staffing needs and cost required for the complete project. Sawant
(2009) in her study also found similar results wherein 42.86% institutions had
„Librarians‟ heading the institutional repository.

Page 252

Instead of having an individual person heading the E-theses repository, CNUDST
(Tunisia) & Social Science Baha (Nepal) has a „Team‟ involved in maintaining the
repository. University of Nairobi (Kenya) and Health Service Executive (Ireland) are
maintained by „Systems Librarian‟. National Metallurgical Laboratory‟s (NML, India)
E-theses repository is maintained by Technical Officer. MIT (USA), Uppsala
University Library (Sweden) and British Library (UK) are maintained by the E-theses
Repository Program/Project Manager. Georgetown University (USA) and Auckland
University of Technology (New Zealand) are under the leadership of Digital Services
Librarian.
Rutgers University (USA) informed of having „Repository Collection Librarian‟ for
managing the E-theses repository. Two institutes of USA namely California Institute
of Technology and University of Nebraska-Lincoln have Digital Repositories Coordinating Librarian for maintaining the repository. The Executive Director of Digital
Scholarship Services who is a part of the Library manages the E-theses repository.
KNUSTSpace (Ghana) repository is under the leadership of Institutional Repository
Librarian.
Ounongo University (Nigeria) have two individuals maintaining the E-theses
repository namely Librarian and Head of Subject & Research Services (Library).
Virginia Tech (USA) E-theses repository is presently maintained by Librarian but
during 1995-1999, Dean of the Graduate School was heading the implementation of
the repository. University of Jyväskylä (Finland) repository is managed by the Head
of Publishing Unit.
The answers received for the above question brings into notice different designations
that maintain the E-theses repository worldwide.

Seventeen institutions have mentioned that they have other institutional members in
the E-theses repository implementation committee. University of Nairobi (Kenya) has
System Librarian for managing E-theses repository. University of Arts London (UK)
has Director of the Research Management Office along with Librarian, Library Staff
Member, Library Director and Computer Service Staff Member as one of the
Page 255

committee members. Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) has Librarian as
the Head of the committee for implementation of E-theses repository and few
librarians with special skills and developers/programmers. University of North Texas
(USA) E-theses repository is managed by Librarian and the Graduate Reader
Collaborate.
Librarian and Graduate School Manager maintain the E-theses repository of
University of Hull (UK). Institute for Christian Studies (Canada) has Graduate
Student Assistant as one of their E-theses Repository Team Members. North Eastern
University (USA) has diverse members in the repository team since Support staff of
all academic divisions constitutes the Team members. Texas State University (USA)
mentions of having Graduate College Staff as their repository team members. Rice
University (USA) & University of Waterloo (Canada) have Graduate Studies
Personnel as Team members. Boston University (USA) has theses coordinators in the
library and graduate schools. These theses coordinators are part of the team for
maintaining the E-theses repository.
KNUSTSpace (Ghana) is headed by Assistant Librarian but IR Librarian is one of the
members in the team which manages the repository. Ounongo University (Namibia)
E-theses repository is managed by the Librarian and Representatives from all faculties
constitute the Repository implementation team. Virginia Tech (USA) has Librarian,
Faculty member and Dean of the Graduate School as the Committee members for
repository implementation.
The British Library (UK) has an External Board that takes into account all issues
related to implementation and maintenance of E-theses repository. The University of
British Columbia (Canada) also takes help of External Technical Consultant along
with institutional staff for proper functioning of E-theses Repository. Lenus (Ireland)
informed of havingtwo teams, a project team made up of librarians and library staff &
a working group made up of contributors - librarians, researchers from contributing
organisations. The Systems Librarian of Lenus is setting up a 3rd group in 2013,
which will be an advisory group of managers.

Page 256

The detailed review of members involved in the team or committee of managing the
E-theses repository shows that, not only Librarians and Library Staff, but institutes
also depend on External Support, Faculty Members, and Head of the Institutions etc.
for the proper functioning of the repository. Librarian or Library Staff members are
not the sole responsible members for repository management.

Table 5.31: Appointment of Special Staff
Q.31 was framed to know whether special staff was appointed for implementation of
E-theses repository. The question was close ended and respondents were allowed to
select more than one option. Sixty eight institutions responded the question, out of
which 61.8% (42) institutions appointed Full time staff, 47.1% (32) institutions
appointed Part Time Staff and 26.5% (18) institutions appointed Contractual Staff for
implementation of E-theses Repository. 35.3% (24) institutions said that No special
staff was appointed for implementation purpose, regular institutional staff carriers out
the implementation work along with their day-to-day duty.
Universiti Putra Malaysia (Malaysia) appointed 15, the highest number of Full Time
Staff for E-theses repository implementation followed by Cranfield University (UK)
and Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka (Nigeria) who have appointed 8 Full Time
staff. Rest of the institutions had range of one to six new appointments.
University of Minho (Portugal) appointed 6, the highest number of Part Time staff.
Rest of the institutions had appointed three or one Part-time appointments. Saurashtra
University (India) appointed 3 staff on Contractual Basis.
Page 257

Sawant (2009) studied the institutional repositories in India and on enquiring about
the special staff being appointed for implementation of institutional repository found
that, none of the fourteen institutions which responded to her questionnaire, had
appointed any Special Staff. All the work related to the successful implementation,
development and management of the repository was carried out by the regular staff of
the institution or the library.
The responses received for the above question suggest that maximum E-thesis
repositories in foreign countries believe in more systematic implementation and
development of the repository by appointing extra full-time or part-time or contractual
staff as per the requirement. Regular institutional or library staff is not given extra
workload. However, repositories in India are mostly set-up by the institutional/library
staff and very rarely staff on contract-basis is appointed for development of the
repository.

Table 5.32: Creator of metadata for ETD
The above question deals with creation of metadata. The question had three options
and the respondents were allowed to mention any other metadata creator‟s designation
in the answer box provided.
Metadata

plays

an

important

role

in

information

management.

It

is

structured information describing information resources/objects for a variety of
purposes. Nicols et.al. (2008)50submitted a Working Paper on „Metadata Tools for
Institutional Repositories‟ wherein they have mentioned that creation of metadata
needs to consider issues of completeness, accuracy, provenance, conformance to
expectations, logical consistency and coherence, timeliness, and accessibility. This
proves that creation of metadata is one of the most important things for setting up
repository.
Table 5.32 shows that 49.5% i.e. 45 institutions said that the Metadata is created by
ETD contributor and verified by the repository administrator. 37.4% i.e. 34
institutions mention creation of metadata by the Repository Administrator whereas
13.2% (12 institutions) said that the ETD contributor creates the Metadata.
The findings prove that the Creation of Metadata is finalised by the Repository
Administrator. If we relate the findings of the present question with that of Q.29 then
we can claim that Robertson‟s statement stands true wherein he states that
Page 259

development of quality metadata is an important role of LIS professionals. Q.29
proves that LIS Professionals like Librarian/ Assistant Librarian head the E-thesis

Nine institutions mentioned different metadata creators for the items deposited in their
repository. Colorado State University (USA) mentioned that the metadata is created
by the Item Contributor, Librarian and library staff members.
Rutgers University‟s (USA) metadata is created by the item depositor and verified by
repository administrator but it is also sometimes created by the cataloguer. HumboldtUniversitaetzu Berlin (Germany) informs that although the metadata is verified by the
repository administrator but some information is added by the Repository Server
Service Grouped Librarian.
University of North Texas (USA) notifies the involvement of many metadata creators
for ETDs deposited in the repository like authors, metadata librarians and cataloguers.
St.John Fisher College (USA) mentions that metadata creator is finalised depending
on the type of submission (however, further clarification is not given regarding the
„type of submission‟).
The British Library (UK) informs that both the ETD contributor as well as the
Repository Administrator creates the metadata. Some of the EThOS metadata is
Page 260

created by the institution itself and some by the British Library staff. University of
Nebraska-Lincoln (USA) notifies that the ETD contributor and the repository
administrator are the same person i.e. the Co-ordinator of the Scholarly
Communication.
Dalarna University (Sweden) mentions that all the options listed in the above question
are applicable for their E-theses repository. The University of British Columbia
(Canada) informs that the metadata is created by the item depositors and library‟s
metadata staff.

Table 5.33: Compliance of E-theses repository with OAI-PMH
Interoperability aims to provide effective and efficient exchange between computer
systems. The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
is a protocol developed by the Open Archives Initiative to facilitate efficient
dissemination of repository metadata. It is used to harvest (or collect)
the metadata descriptions of the records in an archive so that services can be built
using metadata from many archives. It is a set of rules and standards that standardize
the access to the content of repositories.Under this model, metadata is harvested
(extracted) from Data Providers (Repositories) by Service Providers (Search Engines)
(Singh, Pandita, & Dash, 2008)51 .The immediate benefit to an institution of providing
an interoperable standard compliant IR lies in visibility and impact.
Sawant (2009) mentions „adoption of an interoperable standard/protocol is necessary
to expose metadata associated with repository‟s collection to external systems and
search engines.‟

Page 261

The above question deals with the interoperability standards of the E-theses
repository. The question was close ended with only two options. It was found that
95.6% (86) E-theses repository is OAI-PMH compliant. Only 4.4% (4) institutions
said that there repositories were not having OAI-PMH standards.
Similar findings were witnessed by Bailey et.al. (2006) where out of 37 respondents,
94% indicated that their institutional repository supports OAI-PMH. Sawant (2009)
also received similar response where out of 14 respondents, 92.86% ensured that their
IR supports OAI-PMH.
Apart from OAI-PMH there are other interoperability standards such as Resource
Description

Framework

(RDF),

SPARQL

(SPARQL Protocol and RDF

Query Language),Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) and
OpenURL.

Table 5.34: Presence of Digital Preservation Policy
Q 34 asked the respondents about the presence of digital preservation policy.
McMillan (2008) mentions „Digital preservation is the systematic management of
computerised information over an indefinite period of time. Effective preservation
succeeds by replicating copies of digital content in secure, distributed locations over
time because security reduces the likelihood that any single cache will be
compromised and distribution reduces the likelihood that the loss of any single cache
will lead to a loss of the preserved content.‟91 institutions responded to the above
question. Keeping into consideration the importance of ETDs, in order to make long
time access possible, 60.4% i.e. 55 institutions informed of having digital preservation
policy.

Table 5.35: Long term preservation strategy employed by the
E-theses repository
The above question is an extension of Q.34 since it provides information about the
long term digital preservation strategy employed by the institutions.The question
provided eight options and respondents were allowed to provide multiple answers. In
case the institution employs some other strategy, then they could mention it in the
Answer box provided.
68.3% (28) institutions ensured of employing „Bitstream Copying‟ digital
preservation strategy followed by 51.2% (21) institutions which employed
„Migration‟ method and 26.8% (11) institutions using „Refreshing‟ technique.
„Bitstream Copying‟52is more commonly regarded as „backing up your data‟ and
refers to the process of making an exact duplicate of a digital object. Preserving the
bitstream in original state means that the archive is able to maintain one version of the
object which has not been subject to data loss.

Page 264

Sawant (2009) in her study also found that majority of respondents opted for
„Bitstream Copying‟ followed by Persistent Media. In her research, none of the
institutional repositories in India employed „Emulation‟ strategy.
Policies regarding preservation of items from repository are mentioned in the „FAQ‟

Seven institutions mentioned their views regarding the Digital Preservation Policies
employed for the E-theses repository. University of South Florida (USA) mentions of
using Bepress platform. University of Arts (London) informed that the preservation
policies and strategies are taken care by the IT department of the university due to
which the Repository Administrator is not having any knowledge about the
preservation strategy employed. Virginia Tech (USA) mentioned of having distributed
digital preservation network for ETD preservation. The British Library (UK) is in the
finalisation process of a proper digital preservation strategy.University of NebraskaLincoln (USA) mentions of adopting the digital preservation strategy built into the
Digital Commons System. Dalarna University (Sweden) confirmed of having digital
preservation policy but is not sure of the strategy used since it is taken care by the
DiVA administration. University of British Columbia (Canada) mentioned that the Etheses repository is a part of the Library due to which it comes under library‟s overall
digital preservation strategy.

Table 5.36: Withdrawal of items from the E-theses repository
The above question asked the respondents about the reservation policy. Sometimes
the institution or the depositor feels that the ETD should not have been submitted in
the repository, in such cases the ETD status is set to be „Withdrawn‟. Setting an ETD
to „Withdrawn‟ does not delete the ETD. It is simply another status that the ETD can
exist in.
It can be seen in Table 36 that out of the 90 institutions who responded to the
question, 83.3% (75) institutions informed that they allow withdrawal of items
deposited in the repository. 16.7% (15) institutions do not allow withdrawal of ETDs
once deposited in the repository.

London School of Economics and Political Science (UK) mention that the authority to
remove item from the repository remains with the researcher but he/she does it in
consultation with Research Degrees Sub-committee Chair. St.John Fisher‟s College
Page 267

(USA) informs that the withdrawal of items from repository is a joint effort where the
researcher requests for withdrawal of ETD and the Repository Administrator removes
it. Central Queensland University‟s (Australia) E-theses repository is managed by the

the self-archiving of research under the OAI-PMH. The project aimed at providing
and maintaining a web accessible database that records a selection of publishers'
copyright transfer agreements.
Every institution sets its own Copyright issues which is mentioned in the Repository
website. Various researches are done globally to study the Copyright issues of
Electronic theses and dissertations.
Vijayakumar et.al.(2005)53analysed the opinions of selected Ph.D researchers and
guides from Indian universities on Copyright and IPR issues related to ETDs. They
found that although electronic format of theses and dissertations was favoured but
very few people opted for open accessibility to ETDs due to chances of plagiarism,
copyright issues and poor quality of research.

The above question discusses about the persons responsible for managing IPR of
ETDs submitted in the repository. 50% i.e. 42 repositories stated that IPR is managed
by the E-theses repository staff, 41.7% i.e. 35 repositories informed that the
„Contributors‟ manage IPR of ETDs and 29.8% i.e. 25 institutions said that the
„Library Staff‟ takes care of the IPR issues.
Almost similar results were received by Sawant (2009) in her study of institutional
repositories in India found that 64.28% of Contributors and Library Staff manage the
IPR issues of institutional repositories and only 35.71% stated that IR Staff is
responsible for managing the IPR issues of items deposited in the repository.

University of North Texas (USA) E-theses repository‟s IPR issues are also managed
by Graduate School along with the two categories mentioned in the questionnaire.
KTH Royal Institute of technology (Sweden) mentioned that Contributors as well as
the Administrators & supervisors at the departments manage IPR issues of ETDs. The
British Library (UK) has both the Contributors as well as the University contributing
the theses, managing the IPR of ETDs submitted in the EThOS repository. NCCR
(India) informs that staff takes care of IPR issues. University of British Columbia‟s
(Canada) IPR issues are managed by One chosen academic unit of the institution and
has recommended that students must get permission for any copyrighted material
included in their ETDs.

Q 41 can be considered as an extension to Q 40 as it required the participating
institutions to provide information about the Copyright owner of the E-theses after
submission of E-theses in the repository. The respondents were requested to select
only one option. With reference to the findings received in Q 40, it is proved that
institutions/E-thesis repositories don‟t prefer retaining the copyright of the submitted
document with them. It was found that, 75.9% (66) repositories informed of
Researcher having the copyright of E-thesis post submission to the repository. 21.8%
(19) institutions mentioned of retaining the copyright of the items deposited in the
repository. Only two institutions have not decided anything about copyright
ownership.

techniques, through which full-text of the ETD cannot be copied, edited, save or
printed. Such ETDs can only be viewed on screen. 17.7% (11) repositories took a
precautionary measure by providing access only to metadata of E-theses. Only 9.7%
(6) institutions employed digital watermarking technique for protecting copyright of
E-thesis deposited in the repository. A digital watermark is a kind of marker
embedded in a noise-tolerant signal such as audio or image dataand is prominently
used for tracing copyright infringement.
While analysing the data received from the 11 Indian institutions who responded the
web questionnaire, it was found that Saurashtra University, JNU, IIA, IIT Delhi and
NCCR have not framed any measures to protect the copyright of the ETD submitted.
CFTRI and Chandragupt Institute of Management informed of implementing two
measures for copyright protection i.e. Full-text of ETD cannot be copied, edited,
saved or printed and Access is provided only to Metadata. NAL and TISS prefer not
providing the options of copying, editing, saving or printing to the Full-text of ETD
available in Open Access. Two institutions under the aegis of CSIR namely NML and
URDIP provide access only to metadata of the ETD submitted in order to protect
copyright.
Responses received in Q 41 and Q 42 proves that Copyright protection/ IPR are one
of the key issues and a major hindrance for all the institutions involved in ETD
projects. Ghosh (2005)54 mentioned that with the growing diversity of media and
technologies for the production of ETDs, wide range of copyright and licensing issues
need to be taken care of. Vijayakumar (2005) conducted a survey on Ph.D research
scholars, Research Guides and Librarians of selected Indian Universities funded under
UGC and found that although majority of participants expressed interest towards
submission of ETDs and to provide them global access through internet but equal
number of participants had expressed concern towards copyright issues, digital rights
issue, preservation, metadata, access and distribution etc.
The researcher feels that Copyright protection is a major issue of concern regarding
ETDs but individual institutions, Universities or national bodies like UGC should
evolve stringent mechanisms for maintaining standards in publication, access and
distribution of ETDs. All over the world and especially in India, each and every
Page 274

institution tries to adopt some measure to protect the rights.Still dependence on
Universities, especially national organisations like UGC are there. Techniques like
Digital watermarking which was first coined in 199255 still show fewer acceptancesby
the institutions for protecting the copyright. National policies should be framed in
order to protect the rights of the authors and also to provide open access to the
scholarly content without infringement of the rights.

ETD is the intellectual property of the author. Humboldt-Universitaetzu Berlin
(Germany) and Rice University (USA) did not employ any measure to protect
copyright and provide open access to all the ETDs deposited in the repository.
University of Arts (UK) employs Creative Commons License for protecting copyright
of deposited ETD. University of North Texas (USA) informs that more than 80% of
the ETDs are openly accessible and less than 20% are having restricted access.
Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) did not frame any measure for
copyright protection because all the theses produced at their institute are checked for
not being plagiarised before exam.
Institute for Christian Studies (Canada) provides access only to metadata and provide
copyright information declaration. Texas State University (USA) provides access to
metadata of ETD and the bitstreams contain the deposit license. Orebro University
(Sweden) informs that the PDF of E-thesis are copyright protected but may be printed.
Monash University (Australia) protects the copyright of submitted E-theses by
providing rights statement in the metadata.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA) mentioned that copyright is automatically
implied on the E-theses submitted in the repository. The University of British
Columbia (Canada) informs of having copyright protection employed only for theses
submitted during 1919-2007. Lenus (Ireland) provides copyright disclaimer in order
to prevent copyright infringement of the E-theses deposited in the repository.
The responses received prove that all the institutions employ some or the other way to
protect copyright of the ETD deposited in the repository and to prevent the content of
ETD from getting plagiarised to some extent.

Table 5.43: Ratings of chosen system of E-theses repository based on
individual experiences
The above question attempts to summarise the overall experience of the repository
administrators regarding the implementation, management and development of Etheses repository. The questionnaire identified twelve categories and the respondents
Page 277

were also allowed to mention their views in the answer box provided. The
respondents were required to select the most suitable answer from Very adequate,
Adequate, Somewhat Adequate, Least Adequate and Don‟t Know.
a) Out of 91 respondents who answered the question, 53.84% (49) repositories feel
that the Browsing and searching of E-theses in their repository is very adequate
and users could easily retrieve the digital content from the repository website.
35.16% (32) repositories informed that they have adequate browsing, searching
and retrieving facility for E-theses deposited in their repository. The response
received shows that majority of institutions are satisfied with the browsing
facilities provided by their repositories and the users can easily search and retrieve
information from the repository website using criteria.
b) 89 respondents provided their views about the second category of „End-user
interface‟. 43.82% (39) institutions said that they have very adequate End-user
interface whereas 40.44% (36) institutions informed of having adequate end-user
interface through which user can very easily interact with the computer. End-user
interface mainly determines the way in which information is displayed on the
screen. From the responses received for this category, it can be conveyed that on
an average, 84.26% institutions have proper organisation of information on their
repository website through which users can easily access information.
c) Proper digital preservation ensures that the digital information stored in the
repository will remain accessible and usable over time. It involves planning,
resource allocation, and application of preservation methods and technologies, and
combines policies, strategies and actions to ensure access to reformatted and
"born-digital" content, regardless of the any technological change.Considering the
importance of digital preservation, majority of the E-thesis repositories have
employed one or more than one digital preservation techniques (discussed in Q 34
& Q 35). 38.82% (33) and 25.88% (22) institutions informed of having „Very
Adequate‟ and „Adequate‟ digital preservation techniques respectively.
d) The fourth category asked about the multilingual support provided by the
repositories. As evident in Q 48 and 49, most of the E-thesis repositories contain
Page 278

E-theses in English language. However, some also contain regional language Etheses. Out of the 81 respondents who answered for the question, 22.22% (18)
institutions informed of providing Very Adequate multilingual support system and
19.75% (16) institutions have adequate multilingual support system. While
browsing the E-theses repository websites, it was found that irrespective of the
language of which maximum E-theses are found in the repository, most of the
repository interface were available in English, Spanish, Portuguese and German
languages.
e) Supporting various file formats is very important for any type of repository. It can
be seen in the responses received for Q 16, where repositories mentioned of
supporting variety of formats like textual, images, audio, video, datasets,
computer programs etc. Out of the 90 respondents who answered this category,
50% (45) institutions mentioned of very adequate file formats. 41.11% (37)
mentioned of supporting adequate types of files.
f) In present times, providing open access to ETDs is becoming a trend and is even
made mandatory in various places of the world. Q 33 shows that 95.6%
respondents adhere to OAI-PMH. These responses are proved in the present
question wherein 65.93% (60) repositories ensure of adhering to open access
standards very adequately. 26.37% (24) repositories also follow the standards
adequately.
g) Metadata formulation is one of the most important tasks during setting up of Etheses repository. Findings of Q 32 prove that they are mostly supervised by the
Repository Administrator since they help to retrieve information about ETDs in
the Internet. 51.76% (44) repositories ensure of having very adequate metadata.
40% (34) repositories have adequate metadata.
h) Kappus56 mentions „Controlled vocabulary is a set of terms used by a database to
categorize articles based on the content. It helps to improve search results‟.
Controlled vocabularies provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent
retrieval. The responses received for this category are not satisfactory since equal
number of institutions said that they have very adequate or adequate controlled
Page 279

vocabulary searching mechanism. Out of 84 respondents, 25% (21) institutions
inform of having somewhat adequate controlled vocabulary searching mechanism.
Considering the responses received it can be concluded that the E-thesis
repositories must build up good mechanism for controlled vocabulary searching.
i) User authentication is a means of identifying the user and verifying that the user is
allowed to access some restricted service. It is very important to identify the
student or the faculty member who wants to deposit ETD in the repository. Also,
it is important for the System Administrator to manage the repository. 83
institutions responded to the category. 42.16% (35) repositories ensured of having
Very adequate User authentication mechanism. 38.55% (32) repositories
mentioned of having adequate measures for authenticating the user who wants to
access the ETDs available in their repository.
j) Authority control57 is a process that organises bibliographic information by using
a single, distinct name for each item. It helps researcher retrieve maximum useful
information with less wasted effort. A well designed digital database enables a
researcher to query a few words of an entry to display the already established term
or phrases thereby improving accuracy and saving time. It also helps in reducing
waste of time while searching information by catching the errors caused by typing
or spelling mistakes. A customary way of enforcing authority control in a
bibliographic catalogue is to set up a separate index of authority records, which
relates to and governs the headings used in the main catalogue. This separate
index is often referred to as an “authority file”. ALCTS CCS Cataloging Norms
Interest Group (2010)58 stated that “digital repository is not a cataloguing tool and
it doesn‟t provide authority control. So, when a change is made to a record in the
Integrated Library System (ILS), the ILS gets updated but the record in the digital
repository remains unchanged. In such cases, the locally developed editors like
Archivists‟ Toolkit, VRA Core, ContentDM etc. provide some form of authority
control and controlled vocabulary. These editors can send information regarding
any changed record to the repository with the help of updated authority file
registers.”

Page 280

In the present research, out of the 87 repositories who attempted the question,
36.78% (32) repositories informed of having very adequate authority control
system. 24.13% (21) repositories have adequate authority control mechanism.
k) 43.33% (39) repositories informed of receiving very adequate technical support
for managing the E-theses repository. 37.77% (34) repositories have adequate
technical support system. The responses received prove that majority of the
repositories have proper technical support system in their institution or from
external agency since it is very important for problem free functioning of the
repository.
l) Maintaining proper technical documentation of matters related to E-theses
repository is very important. They cover concepts like submission policies,
preservation policies, copyright issues etc. 36.78% (32) repositories ensure of
having adequate technical documentation system whereas 31.03% (27) institutions
mention of having very adequate technical documentation system.
None of the respondents mentioned any other category. The overall responses
received for the above question shows that majority of the institutions are satisfied
with the mechanisms or systems undertaken by them for implementation and
development of E-theses repository.

Table 5.44: Indexing of E-theses repository
Q 44 asked the respondents whether their E-theses repository is indexed or not. It is
very important for any repository or website in general to get indexed in order to get
maximum visibility or accessibility. The questionnaire provided five options like
getting indexed by Search engines, Online database, Registry of Open Access
Repositories (ROAR), Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) and
Scirus. Respondents were allowed to choose more than one option and were also
requested to provide information about other mechanisms/ ways through which they
are indexed.
92.3% (84) repositories informed of getting indexed by Search engines which ensure
maximum exposure. Equal number of respondents (69.2% i.e. 63 institutions) are
indexed by ROAR &OpenDOAR which are authoritative directory of academic open
access repositories. 35.2% (32) repositories are indexed by Online databases. 20.9%
(19) repositories are indexed by Scirus (now known as ScienceDirect) which is a

Along with the options mentioned in the questionnaire, respondents identified sixteen
other inventories which index the repositories. Three institutions namely University of
Zimbabwe, National Metallurgical Laboratory (India) and Indian Institute of
Astrophysics (India) informed of getting indexed by OAIster which is a union
catalogue of millions of records representing open access resources that was built by
harvesting from open access collections worldwide using the Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).Two institutions viz. University of
Zimbabwe and North Eastern University (USA) are listed by NDLTD (Networked
Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations) which is an international organization
that, through leadership and innovation, promotes the adoption, creation, use,
dissemination and preservation of electronic theses and dissertations.National
Metallurgical Laboratory (India) and University of Hull (UK) are included in the
directory of BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine). BASE is one of the world's
most voluminous search engines especially for academic open access web resources.
BASE is operated by Bielefeld University Library (Germany).
Rest of the search engines identified where Google Scholar, DOAJ, SciELO, NORA,

E-theses repository website. 82.2% (74) institutions mentioned that no such facility is
provided. Only 17.8% (16) institutions provide web-links to other international Etheses repositories/directories. Such linkages provide more exposure to the E-thesis
repositories of general or specific subject and also user gets more information about
other repositories of his/her subject interest or in general.

Table 5.48: Language of ETDs included in the repository
English being a universal language for scholarly communication is most commonly
used by the research community for expressing their views and writing the research
report. Using English language for research work maximizes the number of
interested people who can understand our research work.
The above question deals with the language content of the E-thesis repositories.
Respondents were requested to inform about the other languages in which ETDs are
included in their repository. They were allowed to choose as many languages as they
contain in the repositories.
The responses received are tabulated in Table 5.48 which reveal that 26.04% (25)
institutions contain E-theses in French and 16.84% (16) repositories include higher
percentage of E-theses in Portuguese& Spanish languages other than English
language E-theses.

From the 'Other' languages identified by the respondents in which E-theses is
included in the repository, it was found that the language 'Afrikaans' was
commonly used by the researchers in South Africa and along with English
language, Afrikaans was the widely used language for ETDs. Swedish and
Norwegian were the two languages used by institutions in Norway and
Sweden. Three institutions namely Ounongo University (Namibia), Virginia
University (United States) and The British Library (UK) informed of having no
limitation on the language content of the scholarly communication. Two
institutions mentioned containing ETDs in Indonesian Language.
Thirteen other languages were also mentioned like Hungarian, Bulgarian, Nepali,
Korean etc. It was found that the E-thesis repositories also contained ETDs in
regional languages like Sepedi (South Africa), Moari (New Zealand), Gaelic
(Scotland), Castilian (Spain), Western Frisian (Netherlands), Gujarati& Marathi
(India).

Table 5.49:Frequency of adding new ETDs in the repository
Q 49 asked the respondents regarding the frequency of updating the contents of the
E-theses repository. The question was close ended with four options. Respondents
were requested to select only one option. Eighty three institutes responded the
question out of which 73.5% (61) repositories mentioned of updating information about
newly deposited ETD on monthly manner. Ten different institutions mentioned of
updating the information Half-yearly and annually. Only two institutions informed of not
updating the E-theses repository ever.

5.2 Summary:
The responses received from the data collected from the Online Survey received
from 43countries are presented and discussed in this chapter.
The analysis of the questionnaire has been divided into eleven sections similar
to the online questionnaire dealing with personal information of the repository
administrator, background information of the implementation of the repository,
repository materials, budget, copyright issues etc.
The analysis of the data received show that the set-up of institutional
repositories increased, after 2005 due to various national and international open
access policies being framed during that period. Majority of the E-theses belong to
scientific subjects and are set-up by institutions in developed countries like USA
and UK. However, trend of implementing repositories can be seen in various
developing countries due to the benefits of open access scholarly communication.
Institutions implement E-theses repository for increasing access to ETDs.
Although concern about copyright issues of ETDs will keep on hindering the
submission of ETDs in the repository but contributors tend to submit them in order
to provide maximal access to their research results.
The researcher found that there were very few institutions which contained only
ETDs in their repositories. Majority of the institutions have ETDs as one of the
digital documents in their repository. Journals were the most favored digital
documents available in majority of the repositories. It was found that DSpace is
the most preferred repository software package.
Post graduate students are the major contributors of ETDs and it is mostly seen
that Librarians are the head of the E-theses repository due to their expertise and
knowledge about the concept. The budgetary provisions for implementation and
development of E-theses repository were made from routing library budget.

Page 289

A large number of repositories have framed digital preservation policy in order
to preserve the ETDs for longer period of time. However, it was seen that
repositories were yet to frame stringent measures to protect the copyright of the
ETDs submitted.
The repositories are indexed by one or more than one search engines or
repository directories. Being a universal language, English was proved to be
the most preferred language of research by having the highest percentage of
ETDs in the participating institutions followed by languages like French and
Portuguese.
The next chapter presents the findings, conclusions of the study.
Recommendations are also provided.

CHAPTER 6
FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS & SUGGESTIONS
The present research on ‘E-thesis Repositories in the world: a critical analysis’
brought in front various unexplored and interesting concepts related to the planning,
development, implementation, pre-requisites, collection development, software,
metadata issues, language compatibility, budget factor, staff required, contributors,
usage statistics, copyright and preservation issues of electronic theses and
dissertations.
In this chapter the research objectives will be verified with the findings of the data
collection, conclusions will be drawn and appropriate suggestions will be given.The
web survey questionnaire was designed according to the research objectives and
divided into eleven sections. The findings and conclusions are also discussed in
section wise and in some cases the sections are combined.
The chapter concludes with suggestions on future research topics that can be
conducted in the field of E-theses repositories.

6.1 FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS & SUGGESTIONS
Section A: Background Information of E-Theses Repository
1) Objective 1: To identify time required for planning, pilot testing, final
implementation of E-theses repository and to perform other pre-requisites
prior to implementation of E-theses repository.
1.1)

Findings & Conclusions:
Out of the 96institutions, who participated in the present research, 81
institutions attempted the question and it was found that 84.4% institutions
had done pilot testing before final implementation of the repository. The
Page 300

period required for planning, pilot testing and final implementation varied
from 0 to 48 months. Central Food Technology & Research Institute (India)
and Dublin City University (Ireland) required zero months i.e. less than 30
days for planning, pilot testing of the repository before its final launch.
Whereas two institutes from Netherlands i.e. Delft University of
Technology and Wageningen University took maximum period of 48
months for final implementation of the repository. Majority of the
institutions i.e. 24.21% required 12 months for the complete process. This
proves that pilot testing is a very important stage for successful
implementation of E-theses repository.
The E-theses repository of SISSA Digital Library (Italy) was found to be
the oldest one to start submission and searching of digital content by its
authorized users in January, 1988. The year-wise distribution of the launch
of E-thesis repositories also shows that out of the 95 participating
institutions, 70.52% were launched in from 2000 to 2010. The credit in the
increase of number of E-thesis repositories goes to Open Access Initiatives
like BOAI, ECHO, Berlin Declaration and several national and
international open access policies and movements.
Majority of the participating institutions (86.4%) were fully operational. To
study the importance of results of exploratory activities, Likert Scale
method was used. It was found that knowledge of successful
implementation of e-theses repository at some other institution and studying
the available literature on ETDs was Very Important for the respondents.
Analyzing the available literature on ETDs definitely provide in-depth
knowledge about all the underlying concepts in ETD, problems
encountered and probable solutions which help the repository administrator
and his/her team to understand various concepts. Attending workshops,
learning about availability of expertise and demonstrating e-thesis
repositories ranked second in the order of importance.

Page 301

1.2) Suggestions:
a) Any institution must go for pilot testing stage before final
implementation in order to understand and rectify any problems related
to uploadingof data, software related problems and choice of most
appropriate user friendly repository software.
b) National and International Policies need to be framed for promotion of
digitization of grey literature like theses and dissertations.

2) Objective 2: To find out the reasons of contributing to E-thesis
repositoriesand identify factors that act as barrier in setting up E-theses
Repository.
2.1) Findings & Conclusions:
75.5% respondents hold an opinion that contributing ETDs to e-thesis
repositories provide maximum access to research results. 74.5% contribute
their research since it is a mandatory policy of the institute. The overall
response received shows the willingness of acceptance of open access by the
research community due to its various benefits of improving the citation count,
magnifying institutes prestige and appropriate solution of preserving institutes
academic output.
It was found that 71.9% respondents feel that concern about copyright issues is
one of the major barriers in implementation of ETD program. Plagiarism
issues and illiteracy about benefits of ETD are equally responsible for creating
hindrance in ETD contribution. 40.4% respondents believe that absence of
stringent rules acts as barrier in setting up E-theses repository. It can therefore
be concluded that although research scholars are willing to disseminate their
research work through repositories but presence of such barriers slows down
the growth of E-theses repository development.

Page 302

2.2) Suggestions:
a) All research institutes must motivate their employees and research scholars
to submit their research work in the repository.
b) Along with making it a mandatory policy, some reward should be given to
the contributor so that he/she will definitely submit the ETD in the
repository.
c) Special lectures may be organized through which subject experts will
explain the various benefits of open access to researcher and the institute.
Repository administrators of fully operational and successful E-theses
repositories may be invited in order to share their experiences and success
stories in order to encourage the research scholars to contribute their
research work through repositories and through open access.
d) In every country, organizations of national importance must frame
standards and mandatory policies for institutions to submit the theses and
dissertations in electronic format. Also, precise rules should be framed in
order to prevent plagiarism and protect copyright. If such measures are
taken, it will definitely help in increasing the number of ETDs deposited in
the repositories as well as increase number of E-thesis repositories.
3)

Objective 3: To determine the subject coverage and country wise
distribution of E-theses repository.

3.1) Findings & Conclusions:
Out of the participating institutions in the present research, majority of the
repositories (25%) were found to have E-theses deposited in the field of
Engineering. 18.75% mentioned having E-theses repositories in Medical
Sciences followed by Chemistry with 14.58%. Arts and Social Sciences had
coverage of 11.45% among the participating E-theses repositories. Data
received indicates that major amount of research is done in scientific areas
and social science research needs a massive boost up to increase the research

Page 303

output. The poor scenario of social science research is same in developed and
developing countries.
Repositories whose web interface was not in English and which does not
contain E-theses in English were not considered for the present research. The
sample for data collection was finalised using ‘Krejcie & Morgan Table for
Determining Sample Size’ and out of the total number of E-thesis
repositories present in a country, only those were selected for the present
research study which had a collection of >1000 ETDs.The web survey
questionnaire was sent by e-mail to the repository administrators. USA gave
an excellent response with 23 out of 27 responded the questionnaire. UK also
gave positive response with 08 institutions replying to the web survey
questionnaire out of 14.
Although many Indian E-thesis repositories were listed from repository
directories, search engines, articles etc. only 27 Indian E-thesis repositories
were found to be functional during sample selection stage and being the
mother country the researcher mailed questionnaire to all. But the response
received was not up to the mark with only 12 institutions responding to the
questionnaire after sending three reminders through mail, personally calling
up the repository administrators and sending e-mail to the personal mail
addresses of the repository administrators. The results obtained shows that all
over the world there is a growth of repositories containing ETDs in English
language and all over the world the awareness of ETD benefits and growth of
E-theses repositories have started. Developed countries show higher number
of E-theses repositories compared to developing countries.
3.2) Suggestions:
a) There should be an increase in Social Science, Arts & Humanities
research.
b) Like developed countries, the developing countries should also establish
more number of E-thesis repositories. Open access movements should be
carried out in more effective manner in order to motivate people to do the
research and submit their research work in electronic format.
Page 304

4)

Objective 4: To study the objectives for setting up an E-theses repository
and ways of creating awareness amongst institutional members about Etheses repository.
4.1) Findings & Conclusions:
74.5 % respondents feel that setting up e-theses repository is the best way to
increase exposure to the institutes ETD since it helps in providing
maximum access to research results followed by 70.2% who feel that it is
one of the best ways of promoting data sharing and knowledge.
Preservation of digital resources was chosen by 66.7% respondents as a
highly relevant objective of setting up repository. 51.6% feel that setting up
E-theses repository is one of the ways of promoting new modes of
publication. This shows that institutions have variety of reasons for setting
up E-theses repository out of which the most common objective is to
maximize exposure to institutes research output.
80.4% respondents provide Links from Library website/Institutional
website in order to create awareness about E-theses repository to the
institution members. 60.9% created awareness by organising open access
seminars/symposia. Three institutions mentioned use of social media
(Facebook, blogs, twitter, mailing lists, LinkedIn) for promoting the
benefits of ETDs and E-theses repository. This shows that institutes
advertise their E-theses repository through variety of means in order to
increase the usage as well as make the user community aware of the
benefits of open access.
4.2) Suggestions:
a) A lot of research carried out across the world gets unnoticed since they
are published and submitted only in print format which gets submitted
only in the respective institute. In this way, very useful research
outcome remains in the library shelves only. If the institute or any
national organization E-theses repository then such researches will
have global access which in a way will help the researcher to increase
his/her citation index.
Page 305

b) Social networking sites should be used as one of the most powerful way
of creating awareness about E-theses repository.

Section B: Repository Materials
5) Objective 5:Toidentify type of documents (other than ETDs) included in Etheses repository and discover the number of E-theses and other documents (if
any) in the repository.
5.1) Findings &Conclusions:
The data collected shows that 89.6% repositories contain documents other
than ETDs. Only 10.4% respondents informed of containing only ETDs in
their repositories. The researcher provided list of 22 types of documents in the
web questionnaire from which the respondent was to select the type of
document included in their repository. Since the question was open-ended the
participants specified 16 more different types of documents which are
available in their repository. ‘Journal Articles’ ranked first amongst the type of
documents other than ETD to be included in the repository. 60% respondents
informed of including peer-reviewed documents in their repository. This
proves that although number of institutional repositories shows a positive
growth but there is still a dearth of ETD only repositories. This category of
grey literature is mostly included in the institutional repository as one of the
scholarly document.
The collection details obtained from 84.4% respondents show a good number
of ETDs and other documents in the E-theses repository. The findings show
the presence of 4,70,368 ETDs (Doctoral Theses+ Master’s Theses +
Bachelor’s Theses). ‘Newspaper Clippings’ topped the list with 8,39,671
clippings. This shows that institutes throughout the world believe in preserving
and archiving documents through repositories and they include not only
Journal articles, ETDs, Conference Proceedings etc. but also documents like
Newspaper Clippings.
Page 306

5.2) Suggestions:
a) Benefits of ETD submission should be promoted in order to encourage the
institutes in setting up ETD only repository.
b) The number of ETDs should increase in the future years. Theses database
like INFLIBNET’s Shodhganga (India) shows having MoU with various
Indian Universities, Research Institutes, Colleges but the submission
status of ETDs shows that various institutes are in MoU with INFLIBNET
but have still not submitted a single ETD. University Grants Commission
(UGC)1, India has made it mandatory for every University to submit soft
copy of M.Phil/Ph.D theses for hosting the same in INFLIBNET.Such
initiatives will definitely help in improving the collection of ETDs in the
repositories.

6) Objective 6:To know which file formats are supported by the repository.
6.1) Findings & Conclusions:
100% respondents supported PDF. Images and Audio-Video were second most
supported file formats. The results obtained determine that all institutions
across the globe prefer Text format for presenting and disseminating their
research work.
6.2) Suggestion:
a) Text format is the most easily accessible format globally. Research
organisations must set-up a protocol mentioning that ETDs must be submitted
in Text format and other file formats can be submitted as additional files, if
required.

Page 307

Section C: Hardware & Software
7)Objective 7: To find out the software used for setting up E-theses repository,
factors influencing the choice of repository software and server connectivity
issues of E-theses repositories.
7.1) Findings &Conclusions:
Choice of software is one the most important part in successful implementation of
repository. Directory of Open Access Repositories lists more than 144
Institutional Repository software packages. DSpace (83.7%) was found to be
the most preferable software followed by EPrints (79.2%).
Features such as open source, greater functionality, adequate support and
regular updating are the most important ones that influence the selection of
particular software.
Results obtained prove that institute’s prefer selecting the best IR software
for hassle free implementation of repository due to which pilot testing
becomes very important. Software used during pilot testing if not found
suitable, is changed before final implementation.
91.7% institutions have their repositories accessible on Internet in order to
maximise the access of the ETDs and 84.3% host their repositories on
Institution’s server rather than going for Cloud Computing server due to
issues related to privacy, reliability and security.
7.2) Suggestions:
a) Institutions should analyse the successful implementation of fully
operational E-thesis repositories, read the available literature regarding IR
software packages, check out the support available and keep a track of the
updates released before selection of software for the E-theses repository.

Page 308

b) All institutions should have their repositories accessible on Internet for the
benefit of the researchers as well as for the institute.

Section D: Ways of Providing Access to ETDs
8) Objective 8: To identify ways providing access to E-theses deposited in the
repository and to find out the information regarding authorised contributors
to the repository.
8.1) Findings & Conclusions:
81.7% respondents informed of providing full-text access to anyone
referring the E-theses repository. 22.6% mentioned of providing full-text
access only to members of the institution. None of the participating
institution provides paid access to full-text of ETDs. This proves that the
institutions holding the E-theses repositories believe in promotion of open
access and the various benefits it provides to the researcher and the
institution like increase in citation count, increase in prestige of the
institution etc.
56.7% institutions provide access to ETDs right from the inception of the
Institution (i.e. the first Thesis or Dissertation submitted to the institute).
35.1% mentioned of providing access to ETDs produced during last ten years
only. Some institutions were found to provide varying access period to ETDs
depending upon the category of Doctoral theses, Master’s theses and
Bachelors theses. By providing access to the archival thesis and dissertations
right from the establishment of the institution, the repository administrators
help in increase the citation index of the institution and researchers affiliated
to it.
Out of the 11 categories of contributors listed by the researcher, ‘Post
Graduate Students’ were found to be the topmost contributor of ETD with
64.4% institutions opting for them. ‘Librarians’ (63.3%) and ‘Faculty’
Page 309

(57.8%) rank second and third respectively. Only six institutions mentioned
of submission of ETDs by ‘External Contributors’.
It can be concluded that due to the inclusion of Project component in
Master’s level across all the disciplines throughout the world the quantity of
research has increased and since majority of students opt for Post-Graduate
courses, the number of Project reports submitted is on a rise.
8.2) Suggestions:
a) All the institutions should try to provide access to ETDs right from the
establishment since it helps in improving the citation index of the author
and institution.
b) Getting the old printed thesis and dissertation transformed into electronic
format will also make them accessible for a longer period and will solve
the issues related to preservation techniques to a greater extent.

9) Objective 9: To investigate the various monitoring techniques of use of ETDs
and check the usage frequency of ETDs.
9.1) Findings & Conclusions:
57.3% institutions monitor the use of ETDs by taking into account
the‘Statistical count of number of views (Abstract + PDF/HTML)’. 46.1%
respondents depend on ‘Statistical count of number of views (Country
wise)’. Only 14.6% E-theses repositories have not employed any monitoring
technique to measure the usage statistics of ETDs. The most advanced usage
monitoring technique is found to be implemented by California Institute of
Technology (USA) since they keep track of hourly,daily,weekly and monthly
visits. They also maintain record of the duration for which the pages are
visited, search engines used, web browsers,navigationtools,keywords used.
This interprets that institutions depend on some or the other method of
monitoring the use of ETD present in their repository since it helps them to
understand the popularity of their repository and even makes them
Page 310

understand the ways(use of keywords) in which the ETDs submitted in their
repository is searched.
79.1% respondents informed of frequent use of ETDs submitted in their
repository. 20.9% informed of occasional use of ETDs. None of the
institutions mentioned that their E-theses repository is rarely or never used.
This shows that users understand the importance of the content of ETDs and
the authenticity of the research carried out.

9.2) Suggestion:
a) All E-theses repositories must employ at least basic method of monitoring
usage of items deposited in the repository.

Section E: Budget Consideration & Human Resource
10) Objective 10: To explore issues related to budget considerations and human
resource management of the E-theses repository.
10.1) Findings & Conclusions:
From the data obtained it can be interpreted that very few institutions allot
special grant to the institute for setting up E-theses repository. Majority of
the institutions (67.9%) set-up the repository from the annual budget
allottedto the library. In spite of being an important initiative, not many
external agencies provide grant to institutes for implementing e-theses
repository. Developed countries like UK, USA, and Europe have provided
government funds for development of ETD Projects. However the grants
are not provided to all institutions and are very rarely seen in developing
countries. This clearly proves the poor status of open access movement and
lack of governmental initiatives to encourage open access to scholarly
literature.

Page 311

Only 33% institutions replied regarding the percentage of funds allocated
under various heads of staff, hardware, software and consultancy. It was
found that major share of the fund received is utilized for staff followed by
software maintenance and updates. Dublin City University (Ireland)
informed of spending 100% grant received for staff. 61.8% respondents
informed of appointing special full-time staff for developing and
maintaining e-theses repository. The response received for the question
shows that, of all the components of an e-theses repository, staff holds the
most important place since they are the main persons responsible for
successful functioning of the E-theses repository.
Librarian was found to be the most preferable person to head the repository
since he/she has professional training and special skills of managing,
developing and archiving the digital materials.
10.2) Suggestions:
a) Development of the status of E-theses repository depends on the
Government of respective state or country which should devise special
schemes and provide grants to research institutes of national and
international repute.
b) Universities should make budgetary provision in their annual budget to
fund the institutes having research centres in order to help them in setting
up their own repository.
c) Central

pool

of

research

work

should

be

established

at

university/state/national level in order to promote submission of ETDs in
controlled budget expenditure.

Page 312

Section F: Metadata & Interoperability Standards
11) Objective 11: To find out the metadata and interoperability standards of the
repository.
11.1) Findings & Conclusions:
49.5% respondents inform of getting the metadata created byETD
contributor (researcher) and it is verified by the repository administrator
which is mostly Librarian of the institution. 37.4% institutions opted for
metadata creation by Repository administrator. Only 13.2% said that
metadata is created by item distributors and there is no role of repository
administrator in that. 95.6% institutions were OAI-PMH compliant. The
overall response received proves that creation of metadata is an integral part
of submission of ETD in repository which is mostly performed by Librarian
or library staff in general. Almost all the institutions follow standards
required for providing global access to the contents of the repositories.

11.2) Suggestions:
a) Metadata being the most important part of submission of research work in
repository must be prepared by Librarian or at least library staff members
since metadata creation needs accuracy, completeness and should be
accessible easily.
b) Considering the importance all the repositories must be OAI-PMH
compliant.

Page 313

Section G: Preservation Policy
12) Objective 12: To enquire about the long term preservation policy and
withdrawal policies employed by the E-theses repository.
12.1) Findings & Conclusions:
60.4% respondents informed of having employed long term preservation
policy for their E-theses repository. Bitstream copying (making an exact
duplicate of a digital object)was the most commonly used preservation
technique with 68.3% opting for it.Considering the importance of the
scholarly content in ETDs, repositories make use of some or the other
popular techniques for long term preservation. However, it was also found
that 39.6% E-thesis repositories did not make use of any preservation
technique.
83.3% institutions have withdrawal policy of ETDs and 75.3% said that the
ETDs under withdrawal are removed from public view. Only 24.7% mention
of permanently deleting such ETDs. 97.3% informed that only Repository
administrator have the authority of withdrawing items from the repository. It
can be interpreted that institutions have well-defined withdrawal policy and
the act is performed mostly by the Repository administrator who has all the
authorities of adding or removing items from the repository.
12.2) Suggestions:
a) Information contained in ETDs is of scholarly nature and can prove to be
very important for long time access. Therefore, institutes must apply
preservation technique to make the ETD accessible for long.
b) Withdrawal of items must be carried out under the supervision of the
Repository Administrator and they should be removed only from public
view. Proper reasons should be submitted by the researcher requesting for
removal of items from the repository.

Page 314

Section H: Copyright/IPR Issues of E-Theses
13) Objective 13: To explore issues related to Copyright protection/ IPR of Etheses.
13.1) Findings & Conclusions:
50% participating institutions inform that the E-theses repository staff is
responsible for managing IPR. 41.7% mention about Contributors managing
the IPR of E-theses. The researcher listed three commonly used features for
copyright management. 75.3% mentioned of declaringthat the work is the
intellectual property of the author. 64.7% clearly mention the details of
copyright ownership and 49.4% mention disclaimer regarding the content of
the document.
75.9% institutes confirmed that the Researchers retain the copyright of the
ETD post submission. Very few (21.8%) institutes retain the copyright after
submission in repository.
However, when it came to identify the measures adopted by the institute for
copyright protection of the submitted E-thesis, the results were shocking as
64.5% stated absence of measures for copyright protection. Handful of
institutions opted for restricting access to full-text of ETD or copying,
saving, printing options were not available for the full-text. Digital
watermarking technique had a very poor response from the community of
repository administrators. Various institutions mentioned different measures
applied by them for copyright protection like Open access without
restriction, full-text access was given to ETDs submitted during specific
period.
Thus we can arrive at a conclusion that institutions are aware about the
importance of copyright protection of ETDs and make use of some or the
other feature for copyright management but hesitate in deploying a particular
Page 315

copyright protection measure. Lack of initiative has been taken in national
level to discuss copyright issues of documents in open access. Due to this
problem researchers all over the world are worried about their work being
plagiarised thereby resulting in decreasing submission of research work.
13.2) Suggestions:
a) Standards and mandatory rules should be framed by the institutes at local
level or by organisations of national importance like UGC (in India) to
protect copyright of authors thereby promoting submission of research
work and stopping plagiarism.
b) Instead of providing access only to metadata and limiting full-text access
only to authorised institutional members, the repositories must use
modern techniques of copyright protection and if necessary may charge
nominal fees for the full-text access of the ETD. Proper reasons should be
mentioned by a person who seeks permission to access some restricted
ETD.
c) If required the institutions may fix an embargo period after which full-text
access should be provided to the ETD.
d) Strict action should be taken if plagiarism takes place. Stringent acts
should be framed at national level to discourage plagiarism.

Section I: Language Compatibility & Currency of Information
14) Objective 14: To find out language compatibility and frequency of
updating the E-theses repository.
14.1) Findings & Conclusions:
English being a universal language is the most preferred language for
ETDs and 81.1% institutions have mentioned of having major percentage of
English language ETDs in their repositories. Other language ETDs which
Page 316

cover a good share are French and Portuguese. The researcher could
discover various national and regional languages in which ETDs are
submitted across the world.
73.5% institutes informed of updating the collection of ETDs in their
repository frequently as and when it is submitted to the institute. 12%
mentioned half-yearly and annual updating and only 2.4% stated that they
have never updated the E-theses repository. This shows that majority of
institutes are willing to provide global access to the ETDs as soon as they
are submitted to the repository.
14.2) Suggestion:
a) Considering the importance of knowledge content in an ETD, special
efforts must be taken to update the E-theses repository frequently in order
to maintain the currency of information disseminated.

6.2 Prospective Areas of Research:
1) Explore reasons of slow growth of E-thesis repositories.
2) In-depth study of repository software package most suitable for ETD.
3) Criteria for evaluation of E-theses repository.
4) Role of Librarian in each stage of development of E-theses repository.
5) Copyright Protection techniques of ETDs.
6) Impact of ETDs on the research community.
7) Case study of any particular E-theses (only) repository to discover various
concepts involved in the development and management of the repository.
8) Comparative study of E-thesis repositories in a particular country.
9) Preservation strategies of ETDs.

Conclusion:
The overall conclusion that can be derived from the present research work is that
setting up only E-theses repositories is not a common practice in institutions across
Page 317

the world. E-thesis is one of the types of various other types of documents included in
the Institutional Repository. Various organizations and advocates of open access are
working hard in spreading awareness about the importance and benefits of E-theses
repositories and submission of their research work in electronic format. The progress
has still a long way to go.
Government must take efforts to promote dissemination of scholarly communication
through open access. They should also frame standards and stringent rules in order to
prevent plagiarism.
In India, National Knowledge Commission (NKC) has plans to promote open access
and digitize doctoral theses. NKC in its ‘Report of the Working Group on Open
Access and Open Educational Resources-2007’2 mentioned that research conducted
in third world countries representing 80% of world’s population is largely invisible to
the research community due to financial and governmental restraints’ .INFLIBNET’s
Shodhganga introduced ShodhGangotri which is a database of research in progress.3
With the efforts being taken all over the world it can be said that in the coming years
the benefits of open access will definitely spread its umbrella to majority of
institutions and more and more E-theses Repositories will be successfully set up by
organizations in various countries providing full-text access to Electronic theses and
dissertations.

Appendix-I
Sub: Request to fill up E-thesis Repository web survey questionnaire
Dear Sir/ Madam,
I, Ms. ShantashreeSengupta, doctoral student of Department of Library & Information
Science, University of Pune (India), am currently doing research on ‘E-thesis
Repositories in the World : A Critical Analysis’, under the guidance of Dr. S.K.Patil.
As part of the research study, we are conducting a survey of E-thesis Repositories in
the world.
Repository is a network accessible server used to store digital content. Institutional
repositories are the best way through which institutes store scholarly publication of
their faculty members in digitized form. These repositories contain pre-prints/ postprints of research articles, research reports, conference papers, teaching materials,
project reports, doctoral theses and dissertations, datasets resulting from research
projects, committee papers, computer software, works of art, photographs, audio/
video recordings, patents, standards etc.
E-theses repositories is one of the most important types since it enables the user to
know the variety of research topics in which research has been conducted all over the
world. These repositories are now being developed throughout the world by
institutions/ universities in order to provide worldwide access to the most up-to-date
research generated by masters and doctoral students.
Therefore, I request you to spare some time from your busy schedule to answer the
questions related to your Institute’s E-theses Repository in the web survey
questionnaire. The answers provided by you will remain completely confidential and
will be used only for research purpose. They will help me in my research work.
I would like to express my gratitude in anticipation for providing me valuable
information required for the research work. If you have any questions about the
survey, please contact me at shantashrees@gmail.com.
Thanking you,
ShantashreeSengupta.
