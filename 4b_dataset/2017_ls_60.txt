Abstract
The purpose of this design-based research study was to design, integrate and
study library instruction in a required undergraduate writing course collaboratively with
professors with the goal of influencing students’ understanding of the research and
writing process. Three professors of an undergraduate general education writing course
participated in this study, along with thirteen students. The initial study design called for
one iteration of instruction, which included three different designs (which were primarily
designed by the professors): the ‘one-shot session’ approach, a ‘partially embedded
librarian’ approach and a ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach. The ‘fully embedded
librarian’ approach evolved throughout the research study as the librarian and professor
actively collaborated. Through this collaboration, a second iteration of the study emerged
which involved a complete redesign of the curriculum for the ‘fully embedded librarian
approach’ section.
Data collection methods included collaborative design team meetings, faculty
and student questionnaires, student research summaries, student interviews, and a
researcher diary. Themes that emerged from the data using the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework were: exploration, integration, resolution, open communication,
building understanding, and direct instruction. Themes that emerged from the data for
library instruction were an increase in student confidence, the value of relationship
building, and the role of the librarian.
The value of collaboration between professors and a librarian in design-based
research was a key finding of this study, and relates both to the use of the Community
of Inquiry theoretical framework and to the design, delivery and evaluation of library

iii

instruction. The understanding of the librarian’s role by professors regarding teaching
research and writing was key to the design and delivery of library instruction in a writing
course. Library instruction can best influence student learning when students understand
the role of a librarian in the classroom, as well as when they have time and opportunity to
develop some comfort level in interacting with the librarian. This dissertation presents an
argument for the use of design-based research and the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework to inform and study the design of library instruction in a face-to-face learning
environment enhanced with technology that includes both group and individual learning
activities. This dissertation also discusses implications for further research and practice.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Academic librarians face the challenge of keeping up with ever-changing
information and technology systems and higher education environments (Association of
College and Research Libraries (ACRL), 2016; Mays, 2017). Contemporary higher
education environments require more of students in that the students need to know how to
create and share new knowledge in a wide variety of mediums and formats of information
(ACRL, 2016), and the contemporary higher education environment also requires more
of professors and librarians. Professors need to design their curriculum and assignments
to allow students to understand this latest information ecosystem (ACRL, 2016).
Librarians need to collaborate more closely with professors to ensure that a
comprehensive curriculum for information literacy is developed that will influence
student learning (ACRL, 2016; Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016).
On June 25, 2016 at the American Librarian Association Annual Conference in
Orlando Florida, the ACRL Board of Directors rescinded the Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (referred to as the Standards from this point
on) (in use since 2000) (ACRL, 2016; Hurley & Potter, 2017). The ACRL Board of
Directors first passed the ACRL Framework for Information literacy in Higher Education
(referred to as the Framework from this point on) in January of 2015 (Mays, 2017). There
has been much controversy over the use of the Framework. Diverse opinions on the
Framework can be found in writings by librarians in the form of blogs as well as in
published articles (Baer, 2015; Beilin, 2015; Bombaro, 2016; Cahoy & Witek, 2014;
Clark, 2016; Dalal, 2015; Farkas, 2015; Fister, 2015; Foasberg, 2015; Rinne, 2017;
Wilkinson, 2016). The ACRL Board of Directors suggests that this curriculum for

2

information literacy be developed using the Framework (Mikkelsen & McMunnTetangco, 2016). The Framework consists of the concepts of metaliteracy,
metacognition and threshold concepts (ACRL, 2016; Mays, 2017). ACRL (2016)
contends, “metaliteracy demands behavioral, affective, cognitive, and metacognitive
engagement with the information ecosystem” (para. 4). Metacognition is an individual
thinking about their own thinking (Garrison, 2013). The ACRL Board of Directors
defines threshold concepts as “those ideas in any discipline that are passageways or
portals to enlarged understanding or ways of thinking and practicing within that
discipline” (ACRL, 2016, para. 2).
Librarians often work with professors who teach writing to integrate information
literacy skills into course content (Barratt, Nielsen, Desment, & Balthazor, 2009;
Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Elmborg, 2003; Hearn, 2005; Jacobs & Jacobs, 2009;
Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Peary & Ernick, 2004; Rapchak & Cipri, 2015;
Yohannes & Johnson, 2004). Typically, librarians are asked to teach one-shot sessions or
a series of one-shot sessions within the whole course that focus on information literacy
skills (Hurley & Potter, 2017; Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016). However, due to
the length of class time (usually between 15-75 minutes) librarians usually do not have
enough time to cover content or develop the in-depth knowledge students need to be
successful as information literate individuals (Hurley & Potter, 2017; Mikkelsen &
McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Tumbleson & Burke, 2010; Walker & Pearce, 2014). Further
in-depth instruction can occur through reference services, specifically the one-on-one
research consultation (Tumbleson & Burke, 2010; Yohannes & Johnson, 2004).
However, research consultations typically are a supplement to library instruction (Gale &

3

Evans, 2007; Rogers & Carrier, 2017; Yi, 2003). Although research consultations are not
typically part of an information literacy curriculum, research shows that professors will
use this as an option for students who need in-depth help from librarians (Gale & Evans,
2007; Reinsfelder, 2012; Swoger & Hoffman, 2015; Watts & Mahfood, 2015; Yohannes
& Johnson, 2004).
1.1 Problem
The problem that this research study sought to address is multifaceted. Firstly, a
single in-class instruction session does not give librarians enough time to teach library
instruction with any depth for students in a course (Tumbleson & Burke, 2010; Walker &
Pearce, 2014). Secondly, it is hard to provide individualized instruction to a student
within an in-class instructional session (Bash, 2015; Yi, 2003).
1.2 Purpose of Study
The purpose of this study was to integrate library instruction into a
required undergraduate course collaboratively with professors to enhance the
students’ understanding of the research and writing process.
1.3 Rationale for Design of Instruction
A social constructivist epistemological lens was used to inform the development
and design of the library instruction in this study. Constructivism is “a learning theory
which addresses the idea that learners gain understanding through an active process of
applying the latest information within a set knowledge structure” (Francis, 2012, p. 22;
Lenters, 2013). Social constructivism is a social approach to learning where interactions
between others help one to create meaning (Chelliah & Clark, 2011; Dewey, 1929;

4

Francis, 2012; Lenters, 2013). The creation of library instruction focused on influencing
the students’ understanding of the research and writing process using an interactive and
social approach to learning (Moniz, Fine, & Bliss, 2008).
The use of information and communication technology (ICT) in academic
libraries to support student learning is a concept and practice that has been around for
some decades (Husain & Nazim, 2015; Tripathi & Kumar, 2010). The inclusion of ICT
into academic libraries created opportunities for online, face-to-face, and blended
learning environments (Bielema, Crocker, Miller, Reynolds-Moehrle, & Shaw, 2005;
Hess, 2015; McCarthy, 2001; Nelson, Morrison, & Whitson, 2015; Upadhyay, 2015).
Librarians have begun to explore the use of the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework in their instruction sessions.
The original intent of the use of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework
was to guide the research and practice of library instruction in my study. However, the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework evolved to becoming a guide in my analysis
of data and in the design of the second iteration of the study, which I explain further in
chapters three and four. According to Garrison (2013), “the focus in a Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework is on the individual constructing meaning and
collaboratively confirming understanding through critical thinking and discourse” (p. 5). I
had hoped that the community in my study would include the professor(s) of the
section(s) of ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’, the librarian (myself), and the students.
The three elements of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework are
cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence (Garrison, Anderson, &
Archer, 2000; Garrison, 2013). It is within the Community of Inquiry where the

5

individual can grow “in terms of the depth and breadth of their understanding” (Garrison,
2013, p. 5). Garrison (2013) suggests that this growth occurs through “sustained
communication” which can be “enhanced in online and blended learning contexts
through combinations of verbal, textual, and visual communication (blended discourse)”
(Garrison, 2013, p. 5). Swartz (2017) suggests that “the prevalence of technology entails
the need for its integration into education (Lavin, Korte, Davies, 2010; Oh & Reeves,
2014), leading to the potential for technology-enhanced learning environments in
supporting student learning” (p. 31). A technology-enhanced learning environment is an
environment that includes technology to “support and improve the quality of the learning
experience” (Swartz, 2017, p. 31). The Community of Inquiry theoretical framework
informed the creation of a learning environment for library instruction within my research
study to promote reflective thinking in a writing course.
1.4 Research Questions
1. How can the delivery of library instruction influence students’
scholarly writing in higher education?
2. How can the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework inform the
design of library instruction?
1.5 Overview of Methodology
Barab (2014) argues that the design-based research approach is “used to study
learning in environments that are designed and systematically changed by the researcher”
(p. 151). Design-based research is the “iterative development of solutions” that inform
theory and practice (Barab, 2014; McKenney & Reeves, 2012, p. 8). Jacobsen (2014)

6

indicates that a key element of design-based research is the collaboration between
researchers and practitioners on creating solutions to complex problems. Furthermore,
Barab and Squire (2004) argue that a design-based research approach is well suited to
studying complex problems in natural settings.
According to the Design-Based Research Collective (2003) the following is a list of
characteristics used to describe design-based research:
•

Central goals of designing learning environments and developing theories or
“proto-theories” of learning are intertwined.

•

Development and research take place through continuous cycles of design,
enactment, analysis and redesign.

•

Research on designs must lead to sharable theories that help communicate
relevant implications to practitioners and other educational designers.

•

Research must account for how designs function in authentic settings.

•

Development of such accounts relies on methods that can document and connect
processes of enactment to outcomes of interest. (p.5)

The central goal for my study was to develop library instruction through the lens of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and to focus on improving students’
understanding of the research and writing process. The design-based research approach
used in my research study has three phases: a) analysis and exploration b) design and
construction and c) evaluation and reflection (McKenney & Reeves, 2012). Designbased research can involve more than one cycle of these phases (Barab, 2014; Jacobsen,

7

2014; McKenney & Reeves, 2012). My study initially included one complete cycle of
design, enactment, and analysis of the intervention. Chapter three further explains how
my study emerged into more than one cycle of these phases. The intervention, which was
the design of library instruction, delivered in a real-world context, which resulted in local
impact to the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course. A goal of my design-based
research study was to provide other institutions with design principles and sharable
theoretical insights that informed the implementation of library instruction into
undergraduate writing courses, as well as implications for further research. A primarily
qualitative approach to data collection was used to conduction my research study to
provide more insights on the use of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework for
the design and delivery of library instruction.
1.6 Research context
The research site for my study was a private 4-year baccalaureate liberal arts and
science college in the mid-west region of the United States. The college offers bachelor’s
(four-year) and associate’s (two-year) degrees as well as a Master of Physician Assistant
Studies. The school consists of approximately 800 Full time equivalent (FTE) students
and there are sixty-eight teaching faculty at this college. The majority of the students are
undergraduates. All undergraduate students are required to take the ‘Writing for
Scholarly Audiences’ course as part of their general education requirements. The number
of sections of the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course varies each semester. During
the fall semester of 2016 there were three courses taught by three different teachers. In
the spring semester of 2017 there were three courses taught by two different teachers.

8

Since this writing course is one that all students are required to take, I chose to
focus solely on this course in my study.
1.7 Participants and practitioners
The design of library instruction was to be a team effort among the librarian
(myself), an undergraduate student and the professor(s) of the course. The instructor for
each section of the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course was invited to participate in
my study and, in the fall of 2016, there were three sections of this course offered with a
cap of twenty students for each section. If all the sections were full, sixty students would
have the opportunity to participate in the research. I hoped for a 50% acceptance rate
from each section, which would result in thirty participants in the study. This would
allow for ten more students than the average class size. This buffer would allow for
students who could potentially not finish all aspects of the study. There was no
exclusionary requirement for this study. Refusal of students to participate in the study did
not influence the ability of the student to take part in any portion of library instruction
during the course.
1.8 Data gathering and analysis
Data collection involved primarily qualitative approaches to provide a broad range
of data to answer the research questions. The following is a list of data collection
methods used during the study:
•

There was one collaborative design team meeting during this design-based
research study used to discuss the design of the library instruction. Meeting
members consisted of myself, the professors of the writing course, and an

9

undergraduate student. The collaborative design team meeting met after the study
was over to debrief about the fall semester. The undergraduate student did not
attend the meeting there was no further involvement after the first meeting.
•

At the end of the semester, the professors and students completed a
questionnaire that provided feedback on their experience in the research study. I
used this survey data to analyze the connection between the design and delivery
of library instruction and the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework.

•

Students wrote a research summary at the end of the semester in which they
answered specific questions. This research summary was used to analyze how the
delivery of library instruction influenced student learning of how the processes of
research and writing are connected. Copies of the research summary were
collected and analyzed to understand the delivery and influence of the library
instruction on the students.

•

Students participated in an interview at the end of the semester to provide
feedback on the instructional intervention, their experience of the instruction,
and what improvements they would suggest for subsequent semesters.

•

The researcher diary consisted of emails and my observations during classes.

1.9 Researcher Assumptions
My central assumption was that constructivism and the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework can be useful theoretical lenses to inform the design and study of
learning that occurs within a community (in this case the professor of each section of the
course, myself, and the undergraduate students enrolled in each section of the ‘Writing
for Scholarly Audiences’ course). The learning in this case was the knowledge that

10

students gained on the understanding that the processes of research and writing are
connected. The second assumption that I made was that professors were ready to work
collaboratively with a librarian to design integrated library instruction in a writing course
to allow students to understand that the processes of research and writing are connected.
The third assumption that I made was that professors were ready to move away from the
Standards to the Framework. The fourth assumption of my study is that embedded
librarianship describes today’s academic librarian. The fifth assumption that I made was
I would be able to gain insights of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework
through original data collection methods. The final assumption I made was that
professors understood the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and the
Framework.
1.10 Rationale and Significance of Study
The digital age has increased the amount of information available and the way
individuals access information (Scott, 2016; Yi, 2003). Additionally, librarians must change
their ways of teaching information literacy through the addition of concepts such as
metaliteracy and metacognition that are components of the Framework (Scott, 2016).

Information literacy is typically taught through in-class instruction sessions
(Hurley & Potter, 2017), however, Yi (2003) suggested that research consultations
should be included as part of library instruction for a course. To date there is a dearth of
research reflecting this idea (Hearn, 2005; Watts & Mahfood, 2015). One gap that my
study sought to address is teaching information literacy through the Framework, using
the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework to inform the design in an
undergraduate writing course. To date there are no empirical research studies that

connect teaching information literacy through the Framework using the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework to inform the design in an undergraduate writing course.
1.11 Limitations and Delimitations
1.11.1 Limitations. Mainly two items limited my study: the time and effort
required of the professors who were involved in the study and the willingness of students
to participate. At times, it was a challenge to gain the full investment of the professors in
learning and implementing the theory behind the research study. Many faculty members
do not fully understand the role of the librarian and the expertise that librarians can offer
with regards to instruction. In addition, given the many demands on their time, there was
a limited amount of time that each professor could give to participation in the
collaborative design team and overall intervention, which affected the research study.
The lack of previous relationships with students may have reduced their motivation to
participate in the interviews and assignments outside of normal course requirements.
1.11.2 Delimitations. I chose to limit the research study to one semester, as
there was no guarantee that I would have faculty members willing to participate for two
semesters in a row. Additionally, there are typically fewer sections of this course taught
during the second semester. For my doctoral research, I planned to limit my exploratory
study to only one semester anticipating that further iterations would be implemented as
part of my professional practice. Finally, I chose to focus solely on the ‘Writing for
Scholarly Audiences’ course at the college, which limited the potential pool of professor
and student participants.

1.12 Conclusion
My study sought to address the problem of librarians not having enough time in
one-shot, in-class library instruction sessions to help students to understand that the
research and writing process are connected through a collaborative redesign of library
instruction for the required course. This study also sought to address the need for
individualized one-on-one, face-to-face instruction through the inclusion of research
consultations as part of the library instruction component for an undergraduate writing
course.
1.13 Definitions and Terminology
The definitions and terminology listed here are central to the study. In this
chapter, a brief explanation is given, and a more detailed exploration is provided
in chapter two.
1.13.1 Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. “This framework
represents a collaborative approach to inquiry that fuses personal reflection and shared
discourse for a deep and meaningful learning experience” (Garrison, 2016, p. 53). The
focus of this theoretical framework is on the educational experience and not on what
technology is used (Garrison, 2016).
1.13.2 Research Consultation. A research consultation can be described as an
in depth one-on-one meeting on a specific topic between a librarian and a student (Kani,
2017; Yi, 2003).

1.14 Organization of Dissertation
The purpose of chapter one of this dissertation was to present an overview of the
research study. The second chapter is a literature review that discusses key concepts
pertaining to the research study: metaliteracy, embedded librarianship, one-shot sessions,
the flipped classroom approach, research consultations, and the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework. Chapter two concludes with an argument for the use of designbased research as the methodology for the research study.
Chapter three discusses the philosophical stance taken in the research study, the
rationale for the methodology, the conceptual framework, and my dual role as a
researcher and librarian in the study. The rest of this chapter focuses on the study itself:
the setting, participants, recruitment, and the design of library instruction. I revisit the
purpose and research question of my study in this chapter, as well giving an explanation
of how the purpose and research question emerged from the design and construction
phase of the study. Also, included in this chapter is a revised conceptual framework.
The chapter concludes with a discussion of a second iteration that emerged at the end of
data collection during the first iteration of the study.
Chapter four explains the process of analysis during this research study and I also
provide an explanation of the issue of trustworthiness of data. I then present the findings
as they relate to the theory and practice of this research study: 1) Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework and 2) library instruction. Themes discussed for the Community
of Inquiry theoretical framework: exploration, integration, resolution, open
communication, building understanding, and direct instruction. Themes discussed for

14

library instruction: increase in confidence, relationship building and the role of the
librarian.
Chapter five analyzes the themes that were presented in chapter four. I then
discuss the findings as they relate to the literature and the theoretical framework.
Collaboration between the professor and a librarian was a key finding of this study
relating both to the use of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and the
design and delivery of library instruction. The understanding a professor had on the role
of the librarian regarding teaching research and writing was key to the design and
delivery of library instruction in a writing course. Library instruction can only influence
a student if they understand the role of a librarian in the classroom as well as their
comfort level with the librarian. The chapter also provides design principles for library
instruction and a theoretical understanding of the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework. The chapter concludes with implications for research and practice both
globally and locally.

Chapter 2: Literature Review
The aim of this study was to understand how to integrate library instruction into
an undergraduate writing course, designed in the context of the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework. The study also sought to learn how library instruction influences
the understanding that the processes of research and writing are connected. My study
was conducted using design-based research methodology and emerged into two
iterations. The library instruction of the first iteration was designed by the professors of
the course and analyzed using the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. The
professor and I, using the Framework for information literacy and the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework collaboratively, designed the library instruction of the
second iteration. Subsequent chapters explain this idea further.
The Community of Inquiry as the theoretical framework for my study is the lens
in which I discuss library literature related to teaching information literacy for my study
including a description of the three presences, social, cognitive, and teaching. Although I
used these concepts for analysis only in the research study itself, a broad discussion of
library concepts is included in this chapter. This chapter concludes with a discussion of
the original conceptual framework for this study.
2.1 Community of Inquiry as a Theoretical Framework
Garrison (2000) argues that “the confluence of the need for continuous learning
and unprecedented technological innovation in communications have pushed distance
education approaches to the forefront of educational practice” (p. 1). I argue that this
statement could hold true for academic libraries as well. Garrison (2000) suggests, “theory
is also invaluable in guiding the complex practice of a rational process such as

16

teaching and learning at a distance” (p. 3). In this section, I first introduce the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and then describe how I believe it fits as a
theoretical framework for teaching using the Framework in library instruction.
Garrison et al. (2000) developed the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework to “provide conceptual order and a tool for the use of computer mediated
communication and computer conferencing in supporting an educational experience”
(p.87). In their seminal article, the authors suggest that
A worthwhile educational experience is embedded within a Community of
Inquiry that is composed of teachers and students the key participants in the
educational process. The model of this Community of Inquiry assumes that
learning occurs within the community through the interaction of three core
elements. Fig. 2.1 shows the three essential elements: cognitive presence, social
presence and teaching presence. (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 87)

Figure 2.1: Community of Inquiry Theoretical Framework (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 88)

17

The Community of Inquiry theoretical framework was originally used to study
text-based communication as the authors argue that “written communication may actually
be preferable to oral communication when the objective is higher-order cognitive
learning” (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 91). As a result, learning that involves the use of
asynchronous educational technologies are the primary tool for using the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework to research and practice in online education (Garrison &
Arbaugh, 2007). Researchers suggest that the use of the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework to create a technology-enhanced learning environment within a
classroom can provide a way for professors to create an environment that allows for
knowledge creation, discussion, and reflection (Garrison, 2011; Naber & Wyatt, 2014;
Swartz, 2017). Swartz (2017) suggests that the creation of a face-to-face technologyenhanced learning environment “facilitates ‘quick learning’ and classroom discussion,
[while] the online technology-enhanced learning environment promotes more ‘reflective
thinking’” (p. 32). Swartz (2017) used the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework
in a course that taught nursing students about critical thinking. The study conducted by
Swartz used the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework to frame “the learning
environment for developing the in-class and online [technology-enhanced learning
environments, initiating open and approachable communication to welcome and engage
students to participate in their learning” (Swartz, 2017, p. 34). Similarly, academic
librarians aim to teach students problem solving, critical thinking, self-directed learning,
communication, collaboration, and knowledge construction through acquiring, producing,
and sharing information (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014; Murphy, 2014). Thus, it is
suggested that the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework be used to inform the

18

learning environment of library instruction within writing courses. Rapchak (2016)
suggests that there has been a dearth of research on the use of the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework with library distance instruction. Rapchak (2016) contends,
“creating an online learning environment that generates these three presences, according
to the model, will allow learners to become engaged in the process of critical inquiry”
(p.2). Using the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework, Rapchak (2016) argues,
“instructors must instead focus on the full learning experience for students that allows
them to employ higher-order thinking, to interact with their peers, and to receive
guidance from the instructor” (p. 7). I argue that face-to-face library instruction also
needs to focus on the full learning experience of the student. According to Warner
(2016), traditional classroom settings are set up for individualized learning. In addition,
the traditional format of conducting library instruction does not allow for deep and
meaningful learning to occur as the traditional way to teach is through demonstration
(Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016). For the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework to work in a face-to-face classroom setting, instructors will need to restructure
the curriculum to “support collaboration and deep learning” (Akyol & Garrison, 2011a;
Warner, 2016, p. 434).
The Community of Inquiry theoretical framework has received several critiques
(Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007; Jezegou, 2010; Morgan, 2011; Rourke & Kanuka, 2009;
Xin, 2012). Each author suggests a way to improve the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework. Garrison and Arbaugh (2007) propose three areas for improvement of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework:

19

•

The need for enhanced methodological and analytical rigor in
future studies

•

The need for conceptual refinement of the relationships and interactions
between/among the elements both particularly and collectively; and

•

The need for testing the framework in disciplines other than education.
(p. 166)

Jezegou (2010) proposes a definition of the terms community and self-direction. Jezegou
(2010) defines a Community of Inquiry as a “group of people, who are voluntary
members with various expertise of equal value, who are jointly involved in a problemsolving process based on the general principles of the scientific method and collaborative
learning process; these combined processes facilitate the individual and collective
construction of knowledge” (p. 4). Jezegou’s (2010) self-direction involves motivation
and self-regulation and this is a criticism as the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework typically known for deep learning that occurs within a group-learning
environment. Rourke and Kanuka (2009) disagree with Garrison et al.’s (2000) theory
that “students should be acquiring the types of knowledge and higher order skills
associated with a university education-critical thinking, epistemic development, deep and
meaningful learning and they should be acquiring these through sustained critical
discourse” (p.33-34). Rourke and Kanuka (2009) suggest that although the Community
of Inquiry theoretical framework focuses on deep and meaningful learning there has not
been a “substantive attempt to investigate learning in the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework” (p.34). Rourke and Kanuka (2009) contend that if one is truly
looking at deep and meaningful learning in the Community of Inquiry theoretical

20

framework the survey instrument is not the way to test for leaning. The authors offer
three different methods: Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO)
(hierarchically ordered categories of student learning), concept-mapping (graphs that
represent the structure of student’s declarative knowledge), test blueprinting (matrix that
represents the topics presented in a course of instruction and the level at which they are
learned) (Rourke & Kanuka, 2009, p. 37-38). Rourke and Kanuka (2009) argue that there
are three ways to support deep and meaningful learning: “assessment, reduce content,
confront students’ misconceptions” (p.41). Xin (2012) recommends further work to
understand how individuals of a community communicate in online forums and how this
communication interacts with the three presences. Morgan (2011) proposes that it is
important to look at the “whys” regarding the teaching presence as opposed to just
“describing individual interactions” (para. 3).
Garrison and Arbaugh (2007) suggest that further research be conducted on the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework in other disciplines. Rapchak (2016)
discusses using the Framework as a means to create a Community of Inquiry in library
instruction and my study sought to design library instruction through the Framework and
the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. In the following sections, I connect the
three presences of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework to practices in library
science. Typically, literature presents the three presences in the following order:
cognitive, social, and teaching presence. I argue that teaching presence should be
discussed first as it has a direct connection to the cognitive and social presences.

21

2.2 Teaching Presence
Without the element of teaching presence in the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework, social presence and cognitive presence would not be “sufficient to ensure
effective online learning” (Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007, p. 163; Garrison et al., 2010).
Teaching presence is comprised of the following elements: a) instructional design b)
facilitation of learning and c) direct instruction (Anderson, Rourke, Garrison & Archer,
2001; Garrison et al., 2000; Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007, p. 163). I connect library
instruction to each element of the teaching presence.
2.2.1 Instructional Design. Rapchak (2016) suggests that “instructional design
includes setting deadlines, setting up the curriculum and learning outcomes, and using
the technology in a productive way” (p.3). This section discusses the Standards and the
Framework as these have an influence on the curriculum and learning outcomes of
library instruction. In addition, this section also discusses collaboration between
librarians and professors of a writing course on content related to library instruction.
2.2.1.1 Information Literacy Competency Standards. Until recently, librarians
developed their information literacy curriculum based on the Standards. Information
literacy is: “set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of
information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued and the use of
information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of
learning” (ACRL, 2016, p. 3). There were five standards and each standard included
performance indicators and outcomes (See http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards
/informationliteracycompetency).

22

•

Standard One: The information literate student determines the nature and extent
of the information needed.

•

Standard Two: The information literate student accesses needed
information effectively and efficiently.

•

Standard Three: The information literate student evaluates information and its
sources critically and incorporates selected information into his or her
knowledge base and value system.

•

Standard Four: The information literate student, individually or as a member
of a group, uses information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose.

•

Standard Five: The information literate student understands many of the
economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and
accesses and uses information ethically and legally. (ACRL, 2000)

2.2.1.2 Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. As mentioned in
chapter one, in 2015, the Association for Colleges and Research Libraries (ACRL) passed
the Framework (ACRL, 2016; Mays, 2017). The Framework allows librarians to have
more flexibility when collaborating with professors to teach information literacy (ACRL,
2016; Mays 2017). The revised definition of information literacy is: “Information literacy
is the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the
understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in
creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning (ACRL,
2016, p.3). The Framework consists of six groups (or frames) that relate to information,
research, and scholarship (ACRL, 2016; Christensen, 2015; Mays 2017). These frames
are threshold concepts, each concept has a set of knowledge

23

practices, and dispositions (see http://www.ala.org/acrl/sites/ala.org.acrl
/files/content/issues/infolit/Framework_ILHE.pdf). The next section describes threshold
concepts further.
● Authority is constructed and contextual: Information resources reflect their
creators’ expertise and credibility and are evaluated based on the information
need and the context in which the information will be used. Authority is
constructed in that various communities may recognize different types of
authority. It is contextual in that the information need may help to determine the
level of authority required.
● Information creation as a process: Information in any format is produced to
convey a message and is shared via a selected delivery method. The iterative
process of researching, creating, revising, and disseminating information vary,
and the resulting product reflects these differences.
● Information has value: Information possesses several dimensions of value,
including as a commodity, as a means of education to influence, and as a
means of negotiating and understanding the world. Legal and socioeconomic
interests influence information production and dissemination.
● Research as inquiry: Research is iterative and depends upon asking increasingly
complex or new questions whose answers in turn develop additional questions or
lines of inquiry in any field.

24

● Scholarship as conversation: Communities of scholars, researchers, or
professionals engage in sustained discourse with new insights and discoveries
occurring over time as a result of varied perspectives and interpretations.
● Searching as strategic exploration: Searching for information is often
nonlinear and iterative, requiring the evaluating of a range of information sources
and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate avenues as a new understanding
develops. (ACRL, 2016, p. 4-9)
2.2.2 Facilitation of learning. Rapchak (2016) suggests “to facilitate learning,
instructors should encourage participation in course discussion, enable consensusreaching, and identify where students may disagree to encourage a continued discussion
(p. 3). Metaliteracy and threshold concepts informed the development of the Framework
(Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016).
2.2.2.1 Metaliteracy. Metaliteracy can be defined as determining, accessing,
finding, evaluating, producing, collaborating, and sharing in the online environment
(Mackey & Jacobson, 2014). Critics contend that metaliteracy has faded just as quickly
as it appeared (Stephens, 2015; Stordy, 2015). However, since the Framework includes
metaliteracy (ACRL, 2016) it suggests metaliteracy is still important. Mackey and
Jacobson (2011) contend that metaliteracy is more accurate to teach today as it
provides “higher ordered thinking required to engage with multiple document types
through various media formations in collaborative environments” (p. 70).
Additionally, Mackey and Jacobson (2014) suggest that according to the
description of metaliteracy, the main goal of an information session is now to reflect and
interact with information while learning the skills necessary to determine, access,

25

understand, and evaluate information (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; Jacobson & Mackey,
2016). It is important to note that there are several unusual types of literacy: critical
literacy, media literacy, visual literacy, information influence, digital literacy,
cyberliteracy, and information communication and technology (ICT) literacy (Mackey &
Jacobson, 2014). Mackey and Jacobson (2014) argue that their approach to metaliteracy
challenges the notion that any one literacy type, independent of all others, is the only
way to address such radical changes in dynamic information settings. Metaliteracy has
seven learning objectives:
•

Understand format type and delivery mode

•

Evaluate user feedback as active researcher

•

Create a context for user-generated information

•

Evaluate dynamic content critically

•

Produce original content in multiple media formats

•

Understand personal privacy, information ethics and intellectual property issues

•

Share information in participatory environments. (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011, p.
70-76)

The following are the four main goals of metaliteracy:
•

Goal 1: Evaluate content critically, including dynamic, online content
that changes and evolves, such as article preprints, blogs, and wikis.

•

Goal 2: Understand personal privacy, information ethics, and intellectual property
issues in changing technology environments.

•

Goal 3: Share information and collaborate in a variety of participatory
environments.

26

•

Goal 4: Demonstrate ability to connect learning and research strategies
with lifelong learning processes and personal, academic, and professional
goals. (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014, p. 87-90)

The following figure 2.2 describes a metaliterate learner. The inner circle shows each
domain: metacognitive, cognitive, behavioral, and affective (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014).
The authors describe the domains as being “fluid, representing a comprehensive and
interrelated set of goals and learning objectives that lead to empowering roles” (Mackey
& Jacobson, 2014, p. 91). The outer circle represents the distinct roles a learner plays
while carrying out the learning objectives and goals (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014).

Figure 2.2 Metaliterate Learner (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014)
2.2.1.2 Metaliteracy in practice. In their book Metaliteracy in Practice Jacobson
and Mackey (2016) provide examples of how librarians have revised their information
literacy courses to include metaliteracy. The following courses are examples of where

27

metaliteracy has been successfully taught: Information Use and Student Success (IUSS),
Rhetoric and Social Media, Politics of Information, Writing for Healthcare Management,
Critical Multiliteracies, Renaissance Drama, Information Use and Student Success, and
Digital Identity and Participatory Culture (Jacobson & Mackey, 2016).
The course that most closely relates to my study is the semester-long (sixteen-week),
face-to-face, one-credit undergraduate course of Information Use and Student Success
(IUSS) (Stewart & Broussard, 2016). Stewart and Broussard (2016) describe the goals of
IUSS as:
•

Teach students research skills using library and online resources;

•

Teach students search strategies and evaluation techniques to improve academic
performance; and

•

Prepare students for college-level research demands that require students have
the ability to frame meaningful questions, understand the structure and content of
information resources, evaluate available information and information sources,
and use information resources as genuine learning tools. (p. 140-141)

The following two tables (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2) describe the assignments required by
the students of IUSS and the timeline of the course.

The library instruction developed in my design-based research study did not reflect this
example of metaliteracy identically in practice given that the writing course had its own
course assignments and due dates and that metaliteracy was not the focus yet the
outcomes were similar.
2.2.2.2 Threshold Concepts. The learning theory of threshold concepts includes the
“core ideas and processes in a discipline that students need to grasp to progress in their
learning, but that are often unspoken or unrecognized by expert practitioners” (Meyer &
Land, 2003; Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011; Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, & Brunetti,
2016, p.24). According to Meyer and Land (2003), there are five threshold concepts:

29

•

Transformative: cause the learner to experience a shift in perspective;

•

Integrative: bring together separate concepts (often identified as
learning objectives or competencies) into a unified whole;

•

Irreversible: once grasped, cannot be un-grasped;

•

Bounded: may help define the boundaries of a particular discipline, are
perhaps unique to the discipline;

•

Troublesome: usually difficult or counterintuitive ideas that can cause students to
hit a roadblock in their learning. (Townsend et al., 2011)

Threshold concepts are discussed in the literature among many different disciplines
(Meyer & Land, 2006; Land, Meyer, & Smith, 2008; Meyer, Land & Baille, 2010).
However, for my literature review, the discussion of threshold concepts relates to
information literacy. There are some who disagree with using Threshold Concepts
despite the fact that the Framework includes the concept, as they believe that there are
no exact criteria for the determination of a threshold concept (Oakleaf, 2014;
Rowbottom, 2007; Saracevic, 2014).
According to Oakleaf, (2014), “for many librarians, threshold concepts are unfamiliar
constructs, represent a distinct way of thinking about instruction and assessment, and
require a concerted effort to integrate into practice” (p. 510). Townsend et al. (2011)
were the first in library science literature to create threshold concepts for information
literacy. They developed seven threshold concepts:
•

Metadata = findability

•

Good searches use database structure

•

Format is process

30

•

Authority is constructed and contextual

•

“Primary source” is an exact and conditional category

•

Information as a commodity

•

Research solves problems (Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016, p. 9;
Oakleaf, 2014; Townsend et al., 2011)

The use of threshold concepts as part of the Framework allows librarians to move away
from the “how-to” demonstrations to teaching of the content (Mays, 2017; Mikkelsen &
McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Oakleaf, 2014; Townsend et al., 2016). Before Townsend, et
al.’s first article in 2011, library science literature provides three examples of the use of
threshold concepts related to information literacy (Blackmore, 2010; Rodrigues & Sedo,
2008; Yorke-Barber, Atkinson, Possin, & Woodhall, 2008). Two studies were concerned
with identifying threshold concepts (Blackmore, 2010; Yorke-Barber et al., 2008) and the
third used threshold concepts to inform their study on student use of Second Life. After
2011, library literature discusses the use of Threshold Concepts as it relates to the
Framework (Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Oakleaf, 2014; Townsend et al.,
2016).
2.2.2.3 Collaboration between professors and librarians on course content.
Extensive research suggests that successful facilitation of library instruction depends on
the collaboration between professors and librarians (Barratt et al., 2009; Deitering &
Jameson, 2008; Elmborg, 2003; Hearn, 2005; Gardner & White-Farnham, 2013; Jacobs
& Jacobs, 2009; Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Peary & Ernick, 2004; Rapchak
& Cipri, 2015; Shields, 2014; Yohannes & Johnson, 2004). Librarians and professors
have recently begun to work together to create student learning outcomes for writing

31

courses (Rapchak & Cipri, 2015). Librarians and professors also collaborate to create
assignments that are connected between course content and information literacy
(Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Hearn, 2005; Gilman, Sagas, Camper, & Norton, 2017;
Jacobs & Jacobs; 2009; Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Peary & Ernick,
2004). A few librarian and writing professor collaborations reported on in the literature
have taken the collaboration to the extent of allowing a librarian to grade course content
(Hearn, 2005; Peary & Ernick, 2004).
One of the ways librarians collaborate with professors on content is through the
concept of embedded librarianship. Librarians in the health field have been embedding
themselves into the medical field since the early 1970s (Cimpl, 1985; Knoieczny, 2010),
however, according to Drewes and Hoffman (2010), embedded librarianship has been
very popular in the library profession since 2005. Literature shows that the concept of
embedded librarianship came from journalism where a journalist places themselves in a
specific group, such as the military, to write from an “insider’s vantage point” (Hamilton,
2012, p. 76). However, there is also the belief that the idea of embedded librarianship
came from the concept of branch libraries (Clyde & Lee, 2011; Drewes & Hoffman,
2010). Drewes and Hoffman (2010) describe early branch libraries as being “focused on
collaborating with professors regarding library resources rather than on instruction or
services” and the focus of modern branch libraries are “collaborations to advance services
for faculty and student education” (p. 78).
Shumaker, Talley and Miveraldis (2009) contend that embedded librarianship
“involves shifting the basis of library services from the traditional, transactional,
question-and-answer model of reference services to one in which there is high trust, close

32

collaboration and shared responsibility for outcomes” (p. 9). My study uses this
definition. Hamilton (2012) argues that embedded librarianship “focuses on the human
element of library and the use of technology to honor and privilege the relationships that
libraries can nurture” (p. 27). As I mentioned in the introduction, relationships are key
for librarians to build trust with professors and with students.
2.2.3 Direct instruction. According to Rapchak (2016) “direct instruction means
delivering content, providing information from a variety of resources, summarizing salient
points in a discussion, and providing assessment and feedback” (p. 3). Current debates in
library literature in relation to writing courses focus on how to best incorporate library
instruction into course content (Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Elmborg, 2003; Jacobs &
Jacobs, 2009; Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Oakleaf, 2014; Rapchak

& Cipri, 2015; Townsend et al., 2016; Yohannes & Johnson, 2004). Research suggests
that a better alternative to the one-shot instruction session is to develop a stand-alone
credit-based information literacy session (Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016).
Librarians argue that a semester long course will eliminate two issues:
1) No time to emphasize that research is an iterative process, likely giving
students the false impression that finding information for their research
assignments is like a shopping trip to a grocery story. (Mikkelsen & McMunnTetangco, 2016, p. 4)
2) Because these sessions can end up as data dumps, with librarians trying
valiantly—possibly desperately—to impart everything students will need to
know in an hour or two students may end up buried in an avalanche of new
information, leaving them confused, overwhelmed, and more stressed than

33

when they first arrived in the library for instruction. (Mikkelsen & McMunnTetangco, 2016, p. 4)
However, I only discussed literature related to course-integrated library instruction
for my study.
2.2.3.1 One-shot sessions. Research indicates that professors ask librarians to
conduct library instruction in one class period, which typically occurs in a computer lab
or classroom (Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Tumbleson & Burke, 2010;
Walker & Pearce, 2014). The authors suggest that there are several advantages to
instructing the class: a) creating a personal connection between a librarian and a student;
b) personalized assistance according to the assignment, c) students build competence as
well as confidence in a librarian’s skill set in relation to the acquiring of information
(Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Tumbleson & Burke, 2010).
One of the major complaints of librarians regarding one-shot instruction sessions
is the issue of timing (Hurley & Potter, 2017; Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco, 2016;
Scott; 2016). Professors often do not schedule these sessions at the right time during the
semester (Hurley & Potter, 2017; Tumbleson & Burke, 2010). Typically, what happens
is either the session is too early in the semester before students have an idea of what they
will be writing about for the paper or so close to the due date that students no longer feel
that they have time to change their ways of searching (Tumbleson & Burke, 2010).
Another disadvantage is that librarians are commonly only given one session with
students during a semester (Hurley & Potter, 2017; Mikkelsen & McMunn-Tetangco,
2016; Scott; 2016; Tumbleson & Burke, 2010; Walker & Pearce, 2014). However, one
session, no matter the length, is not enough time to cover in-depth the information

34

seeking process topics which range from: citations, preventing plagiarism, evaluating
sources, primary sources, literature reviews, annotated bibliographies, search techniques,
keyword versus subject searching, and subject specific research databases (Mikkelsen &
McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Tumbleson & Burke, 2010; Walker & Pearce, 2014). Due to
the lack of time and the issue of timing, librarians realize that it is important for
collaboration to occur with professors while developing one-shot sessions to ensure that
students are given the most essential information for their assignments (Mikkelsen &
McMunn-Tetangco, 2016; Scott; 2016; Watson et al., 2013). Researchers are beginning
to study how the Framework can be used to inform what happens during a one-shot
session (Scott 2016; Hurley & Potter, 2017). Scott (2016) conducted a database
demonstration while including asking students questions throughout the demonstration
ranging from “theoretical to applied [and] easily-answered to more complex” (p. 137).
Scott (2016) suggests that “by demonstrating question-posing and making our [librarians]
own metacognitive process more transparent to students, librarians can help learners
comprehend and see beyond the constructs of platform and format” (p. 139). Hurley and
Potter (2017) redesigned their one-shot library session to allow for the use of the
Framework by using the flipped classroom approach (described further in a later section
of this literature review) and Cephalonia approach (Hurley & Potter, 2017). The
Cephalonia approach allows student engagement through giving students ahead of time
questions to ask during the class session to help facilitate the discussion (Hurley & Potter,
2017). The use of this approach increased conversations in a one-shot session while still
including hands-on activities (Hurley & Potter, 2017).

35

Librarians have begun to research whether one-shot sessions are influencing
student learning (Howard, Nicholas, & Hayes, 2014; Spievak & Hayes-Bohanan, 2013).
A common choice for librarians to evaluate the effectiveness of one-shot sessions is using
citation analysis (Howard et al., 2014). There are studies that show a positive correlation
between one-shot instruction and the influence of that instruction on citation usage
(Barratt et al., 2009; Hovde, 2000; Hurst & Leonard, 2007) while other studies showed
that instruction did not have any effect on citation usage (Mohler, 2005; Silfen & Zgoda,
2008). I argue that citation analysis is not the ideal way to assess the influence of library
instruction on student learning of research and writing as a process when writing
scholarly material. I believe that a student can increase citation usage but not understand
how to research. Howard et al. (2014) argue that collaboration between professors and
librarians to develop the instructional plan for a one-shot instruction session is what
really influences student learning (Barratt et al., 2009).
2.2.3.2 Research Consultations. Research consultations can be described as indepth or complex reference transactions between a librarian and student (Kani, 2017;
Magi & Mardeusz, 2013a), and in the case of my study, undergraduate students. A
reference transaction, as defined by the Association of Research Libraries, “is an
information contact that involves the knowledge use, recommendations, interpretation,
or instruction in the use of one or more information sources by a member of the library
staff” (Reference and User Services Association, 2008, para. 3). This is the definition
used in my study. Magi and Mardeusz (2013a) argue that individual research
consultations may be one of the most rewarding aspects of an academic librarian’s job.
Magi and Mardeusz (2013a) go on to note that since consultations provide students and

36

librarians with more “time and space” to grapple with “difficult and complex research
questions” it likely becomes a more “intellectually interesting and rewarding
collaboration” (p. 290-291). Magi and Mardeusz (2013a) recommend further research on
“skills and knowledge that librarians employ in providing individual research
consultations” (p. 288). Magi and Mardeusz’s (2013a) study suggest that there are eight
categories to describe the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to conduct
individual research consultations:
● Knowledge about reference sources and their effective use.
● Knowledge about library procedures and resources.
● Deep and broad knowledge about subjects and terminology.
● Experience in topic development.
● Experience in doing research projects.
● Knowledge about people on campus.
● Ability to use synthesis to arrive at an answer.
● Skills in active listening and providing affective support. (p. 288-290)
While some researchers may suggest that this type of interaction can happen at the
reference desk, Magi and Mardeusz (2013a) argue that complex reference questions at
the reference desk are “stressful and often frustrating” (p. 291). For this reason, in-depth
one-on-one research consultations that take place at locations outside of the reference
desk will be the focus of my literature review.

37

Literature suggests that research consultations influence student learning through
increased “librarian/student facetime” and “tailor[ed] research assistance to the individual
needs of the students” (Magi & Mardeusz, 2013b; Savage, 2015; Swoger & Hoffman,
2015; Watts & Mahfood, 2015, p. 71). Some may see the increased amount of face-time
as a disadvantage as it may take librarians away from other duties (Watts & Mahfood,
2015). Magi and Mardeusz (2013b) suggest that some students still prefer face-to-face
contact with a librarian during a research consultation. Magi and Mardeusz (2013b)
contend that the benefits to face-to-face interaction during a research consultation
include:
Interaction with a librarian helps students frame their questions and provides
additional perspectives, subject knowledge and problem-solving skills. It allows
for the exchange of verbal and visual cues and provides students the opportunity
to observe good research process and seek first-hand the value of taking time to
think about an assignment before searching. It allows librarians to transmit
interpersonal, relational messages of empathy and interest found to be important
to students and builds rapport between librarians and students. (p. 606)
Literature indicates that research consultations may not be the best fit for some
undergraduate students (Faix, MacDonald, & Taxakis, 2014). Faix et al. (2014) suggest
that upper classmen are more ready than freshmen to interact with librarians during an indepth one-on-one consultation. However, I argue that all undergraduate students should
be given the opportunity for one-on-one research consultations, as each person may need
additional help outside of the in-class instruction. There is a dearth of studies that

38

connect the use of research consultations to teaching information literacy in the
classroom (Yohannes & Johnson, 2004).
Providing research consultations outside of the librarian’s office but within the
academic departments is a unique approach to the one-on-one research consultation
described in the literature as today’s students do not use the physical library as much as
students did in the past (Avery, Hahn, & Zilic, 2008; Blake et al., 2014; Handler, Lackey,
& Vaughen, 2009). There are records of librarians embedding themselves into academic
departments as far back as 1991 with office hours (Avery et al., 2008). Several other
articles referencing office hours in academic departments come out of the health sciences
field (Blake et al., 2014; Handler et al., 2009; Lee, Hayden, & MacMillan, 2004;
MacEachern, Conte, Townsend, & Woody, 2011; Prusin, 2012). Despite low statistics of
office hour visits, all librarians who participated in an off-site office hour service suggest
that the benefits outweigh the low attendance (Handler et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2004;
MacEachern et al., 2011; Prusin, 2012). Librarians recognized that undergraduate
students might not use the physical reference desk at the academic library due to fear or
discomfort (Handler et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2004; MacEachern et al., 2011; Prusin, 2012).
Through each of these studies, librarians found that a different population of students was
reached, and new opportunities were developed that could be incorporated directly into
the learning community of that department (Blake et al., 2014; Handler et al., 2009; Lee
et al., 2004; MacEachern et al., 2011; Prusin, 2012). Increased visibility has also led to
more research consultations (Blake et al., 2014; Clyde & Lee, 2011; Lee et al., 2004;
MacEachern et al., 2011). However, for my study the research consultations were

39

conducted in the librarian’s office. The reason for this choice is that there are no
distractions and the resources are readily available.
Given these findings presented above, it is necessary to assess the influence that
research consultations may have on student learning to “ensure that the time commitment
required is counterbalanced by the benefits to student learning” (Faix et al., 2014; Magi

& Mardeusz, 2013b; Reinsfelder, 2012; Watts & Mahfood, 2015, p. 71). Several recent
studies have begun to look at how research consultations influence student learning
(Reinsfelder 2012; Swoger & Hoffman, 2015; Watts & Mahfood, 2015). Swoger and
Hoffman (2015) conducted a quantitative research study on reference transactions at the
reference desk and during research consultations. The authors specifically looked at what
students learned during the reference transaction (Swoger & Hoffman, 2015). Results of
the survey showed that students learned: new databases, how to narrow searches, how to
brainstorm keywords and other search mechanics such as the importance of the use of
quotation marks around phrases to keep them together (Swoger & Hoffman, 2015).
Similarly, Kani (2017) conducted a study on research consultations looking at the
feasibility of using Evernote as a means of taking notes during a research consultation.
The results indicate that students had a positive experience with the use of Evernote
during a research consultation (Kani, 2017).
Reinsfelder (2012) conducted a study of research consultations using citation
analysis to assess if the quality of sources used by undergraduate students in a
research paper increased after a research consultation with a librarian. Results of the
study showed that students who had research consultations with librarians had higher
quality citations in their second draft of the paper (Reinsfelder, 2012).

40

Watts and Mahfood (2015) published a study where they appear to be the first to
link research consultation services to a graduate level research-intensive course. The
librarian was embedded directly into the course for the whole semester and students were
required to meet with the librarian for a research consultation during the first and fourth
week of the course (Watts & Mahfood, 2015). Students were required to write research
scenarios during each week of their course to “reinforce what students learned in the
research consultations” (Watts & Mahfood, 2015, p. 75). Students were also required to
write up a research journal throughout the process of writing up a research paper (Watts
& Mahfood, 2015). Before attending a research consultation, students were to attempt
one search on their own and write it up in their journal (Watts & Mahfood, 2015). The
study findings showed that students appreciated the feedback that they received from the
librarian as well as the individualized instruction (Watts & Mahfood, 2015). Students
could advance in their research skills and noted, “that this improvement was most
apparent in how their literature searches evolved to become more focused, efficient, and
strategic” (Watts & Mahfood, 2015, p. 79).
2.2.4 Summary. The Framework facilitates the incorporation of elements of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework within library instruction. The teaching
presence element of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework can help professor
and librarians redesign the use of one-shot sessions and research consultations. For
instance, using a combination of the one-shot session approach and research consultations
as multiple iterations of library instruction within the course may allow for students to
experience a deeper learning of the concept of research and writing. The social presence

41

created during the teaching of library instruction was connected to the success of the
teaching presence in a Community of Inquiry theoretical framework.
2.3 Social Presence
Social presence is defined as “the ability of participants in the Community of
Inquiry to project their personal characteristics into the community, thereby presenting
themselves to other participants as real people” (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 89). Garrison et
al. (2000) go on to argue that social presence supports cognitive presence in that it
“indirectly facilitat[es] the process of critical thinking carried on by the community of
learners” (p. 89). However, Garrison et al. (2000) note that social presence becomes a
direct facilitator when interactions are satisfying which then directly influences a
learner’s willingness to stay within the group. In 2009, the definition of social presence
was redefined to include “the academic purpose of the group” (Garrison, 2016 p. 72).
The new definition is “the ability of participants to identify with the community (e.g.
course of study), communicate purposefully in a trusting environment, and develop interpersonal relationships by way of projecting their individual personalities” (Garrison,
2009, p. 352). Social presence in both online and face-to-face learning situations has
been the element that is most studied in educational research (Annand, 2011; Garrison,
Cleveland-Innes, & Fung, 2010; Giesbers, Rienties, Tempelaar, & Gijselaers, 2014).
Participation and collaboration are key elements of the Framework and, as such,
librarians should instruct in ways that allow for more participation and collaboration
within instruction (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; Mackey & Jacobson, 2014). It is through
this participation and collaboration that the social presence of a Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework can be seen. The following two approaches embedded

42

librarianship and the flipped classroom, are two ways that librarians can incorporate the
social presence element of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework.
2.3.1 Embedded Librarianship. Research indicates that librarians strive to
collaborate with professors to connect course content with teaching library instruction
(Howard et al., 2014; Jumonville, 2014; Sullivan & Porter, 2014; Tumbleson & Burke,
2010; Watson et al., 2013). Sullivan and Porter (2014) contend it is through this
collaboration with professors that librarians become fully embedded into the course. A
solution to the issue of the one-shot library session not allowing for enough time for
instruction on information literacy, is to embed a librarian into the course. There are only
a few studies that discuss librarians becoming embedded in writing courses for a
semester. Since my study focuses on library instruction in a writing course, this literature
review is also restricted to the information on librarian embedding in writing courses. The
length of the embedded librarian varies: 8 sessions (Hearn, 2005), research consultations
(Peary & Ernick, 2004) and a four-week unit (Deitering & Jameson, 2008). None of these
studies states that the librarian would attend all classes. Only two of these studies (Hearn,
2005; Peary & Ernick, 2004) suggest that the writing course was a team-teaching
collaboration.
2.3.2 Flipped Classroom Approach. In today’s social and technology enhanced
environment, students appear to prefer to work collaboratively in groups as well as
learning information online (Herreid & Schiller, 2013). Although a flipped classroom
approach is commonly used in higher education teaching today, it only recently has been
introduced in information literacy sessions (Arnold-Garza, 2014; Datig & Ruswick, 2013;
Fawley, 2014; Gibes & James, 2015; Hersey & Belcher, 2013-2014; Obradovich, Canuel,

43

& Duffy, 2015). The flipped classroom approach allows for more social interactions, than
in the traditional demonstration lecture approach, between the students and the librarian
during in-class activities, which allows for relationships to be built (Arnold-Garza, 2014;
Becker, 2013; Datig & Ruswick, 2013; Fawley, 2014; Hersey & Belcher, 2013-2014;
Obradovich, et al., 2015). Research suggests that requesting students to view interactive
videos or tutorials on course content ahead of a scheduled class is the first step to flipping
a classroom (Arnold-Garza, 2014; Becker, 2013; Datig & Ruswick, 2013; Fawley, 2014;
Hersey & Belcher, 2013-2014; Obradovich et al., 2015). The next step to flipping a
classroom is to provide activities that allow students to engage in the core concepts with
each other and with the librarian and/or professor of the class (Arnold-Garza, 2014;
Becker, 2013; Datig & Ruswick, 2013; Fawley, 2014; Hersey & Belcher, 2013-2014;
Obradovich et al., 2015).
One of the problems addressed through my study is the limited amount of time
given to librarians to teach information literacy; a solution may be to include the flipped
classroom approach within the library instruction for a course (Arnold-Garza, 2014;
Enfield, 2013). The flipped classroom approach can allow a librarian to create learningcentered activities that can lead to group discussions and problem-based learning
(Arnold-Garza, 2014; Becker, 2013; Obradovich et al., 2015; Semple, 2013). These
activities can connect students with the content that they engaged in before coming to
class (Obradovich et al., 2015). While it is true that learning-centered activities can be
used during a traditional library instruction session, the flipped classroom approach
allows more time to engage in such active activities (Arnold-Garza, 2014; Obradovich
et al., 2015). A benefit to the flipped classroom approach is providing students with

44

activities that allow them to use the course content in specific learning situations (Albert
& Beatty, 2014; Arnold-Garza, 2014; Becker, 2013; Enfield, 2013; Gilboy, Heinerichs, &
Pazzaglia, 2015; Lemmer, 2013; Obradovich et al., 2015; Sams & Bergmann, 2013;
Schlairet, Green & Benton, 2014).
Although there are many advantages to the flipped classroom approach, there are
those that criticize the use of the flipped classroom approach for information literacy
(Becker, 2013; Fulton, 2012; Lemmer, 2013; Sankey & Hunt, 2014). Some critics are
concerned that using the flipped classroom approach may not connect to the curriculum
requirements (Fulton, 2012) and curriculum pedagogical goals (Lemmer, 2013). Other
critics suggest that merely transferring traditional lecture content to online video
tutorials does not correct issues inherent to the actual content (Becker, 2013; Sankey &
Hunt, 2014).
Some researchers indicate that students are resistant to the extreme change in
classroom structure (Garver & Roberts, 2013; Gilboy et al., 2015; Sankey & Hunt, 2014).
The resistance may be due to some students believing that the instructor is no longer
instructing when the content is provided online (Sankey & Hunt, 2014). Finally, students
must be made aware of the reasoning behind the use of the flipped classroom approach to
gain their support for the use of the approach (Garver & Roberts, 2013). Collaboration
between the professor of the course and librarians on library instruction and course
content may eliminate the resistance cited above.
Research indicates that student knowledge of information literacy skills can
increase when librarians use the flipped classroom approach (Albert & Beatty, 2014;
Obradovich et al., 2015; Rivera, 2015). Self-assessment of student experiences with the

45

flipped classroom is one way that researchers evaluate the flipped classroom approach
during library instruction (Enfield, 2013; Gilboy et al., 2015; Lemmer, 2013). What may
be more valuable than student perceptions of the flipped classroom approach, are whether
the flipped classroom approach results in measurable influences on student learning.
Researchers have begun to study this through comparing the traditional classroom to the
flipped classroom (Albert & Beatty, 2014; Fulton, 2012; Garver & Roberts, 2013).
Obradovich et al. (2015) argue that the current gap in research is in looking at student
performance after instruction with the flipped classroom approach rather than student
perception of the flipped classroom approach. One researcher has attempted to do this
with a pre-and post-test during the flipped classroom approach (Rivera, 2015). Rivera
(2015) found that library competence exam scores were higher at the end of a flipped
classroom teaching approach in a one-credit information literacy course as opposed to a
non-flipped classroom. The use of the flipped classroom approach allows librarians who
are given limited time in the classroom, a way to create a community of learners, which
will then allow for the teaching of the Framework and ultimately the teaching of
metaliteracy (ACRL, 2016; Foasberg, 2015; Mackey & Jacobson, 2014). The final
element that has a direct connection on the social presence as well as the teaching
presence in the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework is the cognitive presence.
2.4 Cognitive Presence
The cognitive presence is the “extent to which learners are able to construct meaning
through sustained communication” (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 89). Cognitive presence is
connected to both practical inquiry (triggering event, exploration, integration, and
resolution) and critical thinking (Garrison et al., 2000; Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007).

46

Akyol and Garrison (2011a) contend that several studies have connected cognitive
presence to studying deep approaches to learning. Emphasis on metacognition only in
this section is due to the importance it played in the development of the Framework
and its vital role in helping students become self-directed learners (ACRL, 2016).
2.4.1 Metacognition. The metacognition element of metaliteracy aligns with the
cognitive presence within a Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. Metacognition
is thinking about thinking (Jacobson & Mackey, 2014; Jacobson & O’Keeffe, 2014). As a
part of the Framework,
[they] are interested in identifying relationships among cognate literacies while
foregrounding a reinvention of information literacy as primary…metaliteracy is a
metacognitive approach to information literacy that expands the original term and
recasts it as an overarching structure for related literacies (Mackey & Jacobson,
2014, p. 66).
The following figure provides a graphic representation of how metaliteracy is integrated
into information literacy (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014).

47

Figure 2.3 Metaliteracy Model (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014)
Since metaliteracy is a redefinition of information literacy, the four core elements
of information literacy are included within this model: determine, access, evaluate, and
understand (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014). These elements are increased with the four
elements of “collaborate, participate, produce, and share” to address the “interactive and
participatory nature” of “today’s social media environment” (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014,
p. 22). Learners must now “engage with information as producers, collaborators, and
distributors of original digital content in various forms” (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014, p.
22). Garrison, Anderson, Archer, (2001) suggest that cognitive presence is “the extent to
which leaners are able to construct and confirm meaning through sustained reflection and
discourse in a critical Community of Inquiry” (p. 11). Whereas, metacognition plays a
significant role in “how we communicate information, contribute to oral and written
discourse, collaborate with one another, understand concepts, and solve problems. It also

48

describes an interdisciplinary set of concerns for thinking about cognition” (Jacobson &
O’Keeffe, 2014; Jacobson & Mackey, 2014, p. 12). Several studies suggest that the
development of a Community of Inquiry theoretical framework allows for strategies and
activities to be introduced into a course to provide the opportunity for students to develop
their metacognition (Akyol, 2013; Akyol & Garrison, 2011b; Garrison & Akyol, 2013;
Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007).
To allow metacognitive knowledge to develop within a Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework, librarians should then provide students with the opportunity to
think about their own thinking. Examples of how this can be done is using journaling,
blogging, tweeting, and annotated bibliographies within library instruction (Jacobson &
Mackey, 2016; Mackey & Jacobson, 2014). Mackey and Jacobson (2014) also suggest
that students can advance their knowledge of metaliteracy through sharing their own
experiences of research with their peers (Jacobson & O’Keeffe, 2014). Peer sharing can
be done within a class session or online via a blog, forum, or even using Facebook or
Twitter (Jacobson & O’Keeffe, 2014; Jacobson & Mackey, 2014). The metacognitive
approach pushes a librarian to go beyond the typical demonstration of how to search the
databases to providing a way for students to “dig deeper and assess their own learning”
(Burgess, 2015; Jacobson & O’Keeffe, 2014; Mackey & Jacobson, 2014, p. 13);
therefore, allowing the student to also become a teacher (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014).
Data collection throughout most of the cited studies in this literature review
were quantitative in nature. However, I have used a primarily qualitative approach to
data collection as it provides a rich set of data needed to learn how library instruction
influences student learning as it relates to the research and writing process. I chose to

49

conduct a design-based research study because of “the commitment of researchers to
develop solutions to educational problems in collaboration with practitioners”
(Jacobsen, 2014, para. 6).
Developing the design of library instruction with the professors and then testing
the theory in the real-work context of the undergraduate writing course allowed for the
contribution to theory and practice at the private college.
2.5 Summary
After examining the literature, I suggest that there is a need for further research
related to embedding a librarian into a writing course. Online library instruction has
connected the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and library science. Further
research is necessary to explore using the theoretical framework in face-to-face library
instruction. Finally, with the rescinding of the Standards, more research is necessary to
explore the influence of the new Framework. The following chapter discusses the creation
of a conceptual framework for my study and the use of design-based research.

50

Chapter 3: Methodology
This chapter first describes the philosophical stance taken in the research study,
the rationale for the methodology, the conceptual framework and my dual role as a
researcher and librarian in the study. The rest of this chapter focuses on the study itself:
the setting, participants, recruitment, and the design of library instruction. I drew upon
McKenney and Reeves’ (2012) general model for design-based research to describe the
design of library instruction in detail that was developed for this study. This detailed
description of the design of library instruction also explains how the purpose and research
questions emerged through the first two micro cycles of the study. Also, included in this
chapter is a revised conceptual framework. The chapter concludes with a discussion of a
second iteration that emerged at the end of data collection during the first iteration of the
study.
3.1 Philosophical Stance of Study
The central philosophical stance that guided my study is constructivism and
constructivist beliefs about knowledge. Constructivism is “a theory about knowledge and
learning; it describes both what “knowing” is and how one “comes to know” (Fosnot,
1996, ix). Prominent theorists of constructivism are Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, Jerome
Bruner, Howard Gardner and Nelson Goodman (Fosnot, 1996). Both Vygotsky and
Piaget suggest that learning is developmental (Fosnot, 1996). However, these theorists
differ in how the learning is developed (Fosnot, 1996). Piaget’s (1952) work focused on
individual learning through interactions with the environment in which the learning
occurs whereas Vygotsky’s work focused on individuals learning through social
interactions and culture (Fosnot, 1996). Dewey (1933) suggested individuals learn best

51

through experiences developed to have individuals solve problems for every day issues.
According to Bruner (1990), learning happens through an individual’s deep thinking. Of
these theoretical perspectives, it is Vygotsky’s social constructivism view that is key to
my research study.
Social constructivism is a social approach to learning whereby interactions
between individuals help to create meaning (Chelliah & Clark, 2011; Critten &
Stanfield, 2016; Francis, 2012; Lenters, 2013; Vygotsky, 1962). Cooperstein and
Kocevar-Weidinger (2004) argue that there are three principles that librarians should
follow when adopting a social constructivist stance in practice:
1) “Learning often happens as students collaborate to solve problems” (Critten &
Stanfield, 2016 p. 87).
2) “Learning scenarios that mirror real-life situations are most meaningful to
students and can help them do the work of understanding why a concept is
important or how it relates to another concept” (Critten & Stanfield, 2016,
p. 88).
3) “Students should work to make their own meaning” (Critten & Stanfield,
2016, p. 89).
Critten and Stanfield (2016) note that many critique social constructivism as “the onus
of learning is completely on the student and the instructor is only facilitating” (p. 89).
However, Critten and Stanfield (2016) argue that learning happens when instructors and
students discuss concepts together. The goal of my research study is to create library
instruction informed by the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework, which is

52

premised on social constructivism principles. The outcome of my study is to develop a
design for library instruction that provides time for interaction between the librarian
and students to allow for discussion.
3.2 Rationale for Research Methodology
According to the Design-Based Research Collective (2003), the following is a list of
characteristics used to describe design-based research:
● Central goals of designing learning environments and developing theories or
“proto-theories” of learning are intertwined.
● Development and research take place through continuous cycles of design,
enactment, analysis and redesign.
● Research on designs must lead to sharable theories that help communicate
relevant implications to practitioners and other educational designers.
● Research must account for how designs function in authentic settings.
● Development of such accounts relies on methods that can document and connect
processes of enactment to outcomes of interest. (p.5)
The central goal for my study was to develop library instruction through the lens of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework, and with the Framework. The following
section describes the development of the conceptual framework of library instruction for
an undergraduate writing course.
3.2.1 Conceptual Framework. At the beginning of my research study, I started
with one research question: In what ways does the design and delivery of the library

53

component of an undergraduate writing course influence student learning of the tasks of
acquisition, production, and sharing of information? The original solution planned for
my study was to create a community of learners in an undergraduate writing course
comprised of professors, the undergraduate students, and myself (librarian-researcher).
Figure 3.1 is a textual and pictorial representation of the proposed influence of the
Community of Inquiry on the design of library instruction.

54

Writing Course (adapted from Garrison et al., 2000)

55

The design-based research approach used in carrying out the study involved three phases:
1) analysis and exploration, 2) design and construction, and 3) evaluation and reflection
(McKenney & Reeves, 2012). Barab (2014) argues that the design-based research
approach is “used to study learning in environments that are designed and systematically
changed by the researcher” (p. 151). Design-based research is the “iterative development
of solutions” that inform theory and practice (Barab, 2014; McKenney & Reeves, 2012,
p. 8). Jacobsen (2014) indicates that a key element of design-based research is the
collaboration between researchers and practitioners on the design of solutions to complex
problems. Furthermore, Barab and Squire (2004) argue that a design-based research
approach is well suited to studying complex problems in natural settings. Barab (2014)
states that “it is not simply that design-based research happens in naturalistic settings but
rather, such research transacts with these settings such that the design, the problem, and
even the theory is fused with these settings in ways that are not easy to disentangle” (p.
156). Given the goals of the study, design-based research is the appropriate
methodology to address the research question.
3.3 Researcher Perspective and Role
Role. I have been a librarian for seven years and I hold a bachelor’s degree in
graphic design and a master’s degree in library and information science. While working
on both degrees, I also worked as a student assistant at the circulation desk of an
academic library, eventually accruing a total of five and a half years of student worker
experience. For four years, I worked in the education department as an administrative
assistant for graduate students of the Curriculum and Instruction program at a private US
based university. My first three years as a librarian were served as a technical

56

services/systems librarian in a private Canadian based university. For four years, I
worked as a reference and instruction librarian at a private US based university. In May
of 2016, I joined the faculty as one of the librarians of the private 4-year baccalaureate
liberal arts and science college where my study took place. In January of 2017 I was
promoted to the library director position.
Researcher Perspective. My personal observations and experiences as a librarian
have greatly influenced my desire to conduct this study. Most of my interactions with
students have been at the undergraduate level. At the college, most reference interactions
occur as in-depth research consultations. As a researcher and a librarian in the library
where the study took place, I was part of the team that designed the library instruction.
This was my first independent research study and I carried it out in the context of a new
appointment at this institution. In the beginning, I was not as confident in my role as a
leader in the study. Given that I was new in my role and I experienced some lack of
confidence as a researcher at the beginning of my study, these may have been deciding
factors in how the design of the library instruction developed into three different
approaches. I was the librarian who delivered the library instruction for each section of
the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course. As I was a new librarian to the college, I
took on an exploratory role versus a leadership role in the instruction. I allowed the
professors at the beginning of the study to design the instruction. I became more
confident in my leadership role as a librarian and as a researcher as I began to build a
relationship with individuals on campus and as I carried out my study. My role as a
researcher and librarian in regard to the writing course at this college is further discussed
in chapter five.

57

Since I was a part of the study and I influenced the design and implementation of
library instruction, I had to be aware of the concern for researcher bias. Barab (2014)
argues that there are “hidden assumptions that are bound up in the design decisions,
underlying theories, and research interpretations” (p. 166). Barab (2014) suggests that
reflecting on these assumptions can provide insight into researcher biases that “we had
not realized were affecting our work” (p. 166). Because of Barab’s (2014)
recommendation, I kept a researcher diary through all phases of the design-based
research study to reflect upon my role in design decisions and interpretations to better
understand and interpret my role, and to increase the trustworthiness and credibility of
any claims that were made during the study by being mindful of bias (Barab & Squire,
2004).
3.4 Setting
The study was conducted at a four-year baccalaureate college with myself, three
professors and thirteen undergraduate students who were taking a ‘Writing for Scholarly
Audiences’ course agreed to participate in my study. This writing course is the second in
a series of required writing courses and focuses on writing for the scholarly audience.
Table 3.1 is a summary description of the current practice, which is a scaffolded, library
instruction curriculum.

The library also runs a Research Assistance Program (RAP) as a supplement to the
library instruction program. The Research Assistance Program is the library’s version of
research consultations where students meet one-on-one with librarians.
3.5 Participation and Recruitment
On the first day of class in each section, I was introduced to the students as the new
librarian and I was allowed time to introduce the study to them. In total, there were 58
students enrolled in the three sections of the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course.

Originally, I anticipated that thirty students would be a suitable number for
participation (approximately 50%). My initial view of data collection had the students as
the primary source for this study. As a result, I set the anticipated number to thirty which

59

was ten more than the average class size at the study site. This buffer of ten would allow
for those participants who may not choose to finish the study to drop out. Student
participation from each of the three sections of the course was achieved, however, at
varying levels of participation. From one section, seven out of nineteen students agreed
to participate in the study. Out of those seven students only three completed the
requirements for the study. Three students out of the nineteen students in the next section
agreed to participate in the study and only two out of those three completed the
requirements. Three students out of nineteen students in the last section agreed to
participate in the study and only two fully completed the requirements while only one
participant completed the questionnaire.
After further reflection, the low student participation rate of this study did not
have a negative effect on the results of the study. One of the goals of this study was to
evaluate the design and delivery of library instruction and how it influenced student
learning; therefore, I determined that it was just as important to have insights from the
professors as it was from the students. The data collection methods that were chosen and
used with both the students and professors provided richness and diversity of data. The
study was also designed to allow for detailed observations to be included in the analysis
of the study. Initially, I hoped for one specific design of library instruction that could
then be further developed through the suggestions for improvement and design principles
that emerged from the study, however, that is not what happened. I ended up having
three distinctive designs which will be explained in detail later in this chapter. As a
result, I have had the opportunity to suggest to the study site which of these designs

60

might be better suited for further development, and for inclusion in the ‘Writing for
Scholarly Audiences’ curriculum.
In many design-based research studies, the researcher carries multiple roles, from
designer, to collaborator, to evaluator and to expert practitioner. In my research study, I
acted as both the collaborator (researcher) and the librarian (practitioner) in the first
iteration of the study. As explained further in this chapter a second iteration was
implemented in which I was an equal designer of the curriculum for the course. Since I
am a part of the study, this section is written in first person to help tell the narrative of the
study. Because of my dual role, it was important that student participants and faculty
participants were offered confidentiality if not full anonymity in the research study. Total
anonymity of the professors was not guaranteed due to the collaborative nature of the
design-based research study. I only had a pre-existing relationship with one student from
each section (totaling three students) as the student worked for the library; all other
students met me on the first day of class. Because of a pre-existing relationship with
student workers I informed them that participating in this research study would have no
effect on their employment and that the chance of identification, though small, was
greater than a student who was not employed by the library. Students were informed of
the risks to confidentiality and anonymity before they signed the informed consent form.
Pseudonyms have been assigned to each participant. Participants from the ‘oneshot session’ have been given names that start with the letter O (Professor Oliver;
Students: Odessa, Olga, Ophelia). Participants from the ‘partially embedded librarian’
section were given names that start with the letter P (Professor Paulette; Students: Peter,
Paige). The names of the participants in the ‘fully embedded librarian’ section was given

61

names that start with the letter F (Professor Fiora; Students: Freddy, Faith, Frank).
Faculty questionnaires, student responses of the research summary and student
questionnaires were completed via Survey Planet which records data entry by participant
number. Therefore, each participant number was given one name. The student workers
ended up identifying themselves as student workers in their responses to the questions.
The professors also ended up identifying themselves through the responses that they gave
to questions in the questionnaire. The next section describes the design and
implementation of the library instruction into the three sections of the ‘Writing for
Scholarly Audiences’ course.
3.6 Design and Implementation of Library Instruction
“Design research is conducted with two main goals: creating an intervention that
solves problems in practice, and producing theoretical understanding” (McKenney &
Reeves, 2012, p. 201). The following sections explain the initial graphic representation
(figure 3.2) of the intervention which is the design and implementation of library
instruction based on the generic model developed by McKenney and Reeves (2012).
This initial representation was the plan developed through a review of the research and
previous practice I had as a librarian at other institutions. The arrows in the figure
represent the iterative and flexibility of a design-based research process (McKenney &
Reeves, 2012). The outputs of the three phases affect both the design principles and
theoretical framework (McKenney & Reeves, 2012). The implementation and spread
represented in the figure shows “that interaction with practice is present from the start,
and that the scope increases over time” (McKenney & Reeves, 2012, p. 77). Each phase
in the figure lists activities and data collection methods that were initially planned

62

for my research study. As the study developed so did the activities and data collection
methods.

Figure 3.2: Graphic Representation of the research study phases (adapted from
McKenney & Reeves, 2012)
My study includes the macro, meso, and micro cycles normally seen in design-based
research. The macro cycle reflects the entire process of the study (McKenney & Reeves,
2012). The micro cycle consists of one of the three main phases in design-based
research, which include analysis/exploration, design/construction, and
evaluation/reflection (McKenney & Reeves, 2012). A meso cycle contains multiple

63

phases of the design-based research cycle but does not encompass the complete macro
cycle (McKenney & Reeves, 2012).
The first iteration of this study followed two meso cycles of the analysis and
exploration and design and construction phases. The evaluation of the first iteration
began at the end of the semester and as the micro cycle of evaluation and reflection
continued a second iteration emerged, which created a third meso cycle. The following
figure is a pictorial representation of the macro, meso and micro cycles of my research
study.

Figure 3.3: Macro, meso, and micro cycles of research study
3.7 Phase One: Analyze Problem
I conducted my study using design-based research which was based on theory and
practice and was supposed to be collaboratively designed and conducted in a realworld setting (Design-Based Research Collective, 2003).
3.7.1 Meso Cycle: Information Gathering. This first meso cycle of the designbased research study was used to gather information for the design of library instruction
during the second phase of the research study.

64

3.7.2 Micro Cycle: Exploration and Analysis. Ethics approval took longer than
expected which had the study starting right when all faculty had to attend beginning of
the year meetings. Thus, it made it difficult to find a common time when all team
members could come together for a meeting. There was only one time available for an
hour that all parties could attend the meeting the week before school was to start.
3.7.2.1 Theoretical literature. Literature connected to the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework, the Framework, and library instruction are constantly
reviewed throughout the course of my study.
3.7.2.2 Stakeholder information session. The study was originally supposed to
start with a stakeholders’ session that was to be comprised of the library director, myself,
and the professor(s) of each section of the college writing. The library director opted not
to take part in the study and an undergraduate student was added to the team. This
session was to be used to present the research that informed the creation of the proposed
study. Because of limited availability of the participants I opted to spend the hour with
the collaborative design team members discussing the design of library instruction rather
than presenting the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and the Framework.
Instead an email was sent out to the participants that made up the collaborative design
team (undergraduate student, and the professors of the course, as well as myself as the
librarian) providing material that gave background information to the study. I assumed
that all participants read and understood the information presented.
3.7.3 Micro Cycle: Design and Construction. The initial goal for the
collaborative design-team meeting was for the team to explore solutions for library

65

instruction through idea generation, idea consideration, and idea checking. The original
goal was to come up with a design that could be used in all three sections.
3.7.3.1 Collaborative Design Team Meeting. On the day of the collaborative
design team meeting I was given short notice that Professor Oliver would not be able to
attend the planned meeting. Since the semester was already under way and we were an
hour away from the meeting time I chose to go ahead and have the planned meeting.
Being unfamiliar with the practice of library instruction at the college and with the
professors of the study site, I opted to listen and let the participants do most of the
talking. I did not have an agenda of what was to be discussed. However, I had stated that
the goal of the meeting was to design the library instruction for each section. It was at this
time as a researcher that I took more of an observer role rather than a leadership role.
Professor Paulette who oversaw the college writing program did most of the
talking during this meeting. Very little involvement came from the student. Due to time
running out at the meeting and after listening to what both professors were saying, it
was decided that there would be no set design. This decision was based on the
professors different styles of teaching. Each professor would be given the opportunity to
plan how the semester would go with me. Both professors said they were open to
collaborating with me and having me sit in the class throughout the semester.
A separate meeting was carried out with Professor Oliver. In this meeting, I
shared with Professor Oliver the outcome of the collaborative design team meeting.
During the meeting, it became clear that he may not have understood the different role
that I might play in the classroom. As an outcome of the meeting with Professor Oliver, I
was not granted access to attending class during the semester. His decision, along with

66

my decision to collaborate individually with the other two professors, led to the design of
my study evolving to include three distinctive designs (‘one-shot session’, ‘partially
embedded librarian’ session, and ‘fully embedded librarian’ session). Upon reflection on
this outcome, I decided this was a good outcome as it allowed for the design, delivery and
evaluation of both conventional and innovative ways of library instruction in my designbased research study.
3.8 Phase Two: Design and Data Collection
The second part of this design-based research study consisted of designing the
library instruction and data collection methods.
3.8.1 Meso Cycle: Iteration 1. Once the information was gathered from the
collaborative design team meeting and the individual meeting with Professor Oliver, a
return to the exploration and analysis phase of the research study was necessary to be
conducted before the design of library instruction was completed for each section.
3.8.2 Micro Cycle: Exploration and Analysis. During the initial design meeting
with Professors Paulette and Fiora, the idea of presenting research and writing as
processes that are connected was introduced. I was interested in working with the
professors to make this connection clearer with the students. As a result, I suggested that
the embedded librarian approach be used for providing library instruction. Research on
the embedded librarian approach indicates that through this approach to library
instruction, students can understand that the processes of research and scholarly writing
are connected (Hamilton, 2012; Muir & Heller-Ross, 2010; Shumaker et al., 2009). It
was during this second cycle of analysis and exploration phase that I revisited my initial
research question. The initial question did not clearly specify the role of the Community

67

of Inquiry theoretical framework to the design and delivery of library instruction. As a
result, I chose to split the original research question into two. The following questions
emerged from the conversations held with the professors during the first design and
construction phase of the research study:
1. How can the delivery of library instruction influence students’
scholarly writing in higher education?
2. How can the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework inform the
design of library instruction?
With new questions emerging I had to reflect on the methods that I chose for data
collection. This meant a revisit to the design and construction phases of my design-based
research study.
3.8.3 Micro Cycle: Design and Construction. The actual implementation of the
design of library instruction changed a great deal after discussing with each of the
professors during the collaborative design team meetings.
3.8.3.1 Intervention: Three distinctive designs for library instruction. The initial
intent of my study was to have the design of library instruction be informed by the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and the Framework. However, this was not
the case as the three professors had already planned the course along with the library
instruction that was going to be included. Professors Paulette and Fiora were open to the
concept of embedded librarianship and I was, therefore, granted access to attending nonlibrary session class periods. Professor Oliver opted to use the familiar ‘one-shot session’
approach to library instruction. For the ‘one-shot session’ approach, I had a total of 50
minutes of instructional time with the students, 25 minutes of which was used for an in-

68

class research workshop and Professor Oliver did not participate in the instructional
conversation. For the ‘partially embedded librarian’ session, I had a total of 150 minutes
of instructional time with the students, 100 minutes of which was used for an in-class
research workshop and Professor Paulette was involved in the instructional conversation.
I attended a total of 10 class periods for the partially embedded librarian session. As with
the ‘partially embedded librarian’ session, I had a total of 100 minutes of instructional
time with the students for the ‘fully embedded librarian’ session. Of that time, 50 minutes
was used for an in-class research workshop. The major differences between the ‘fully
embedded librarian’ session and the other two approaches was my involvement in course
assignments. For the ‘fully embedded librarian’ session, I provided feedback on all
written assignments and communicated with Professor Fiora on the course content and
student performance. Professor Fiora also participated in the instructional conversation.
A typical day in each three sections is described using a narrative format in subsequent
sections of this chapter. The following table describes the design of library instruction for
each of the three sections of the course and highlights the similarities and differences of
each design.

In the next section, I provide a narrative to illustrate the design and delivery of the
research study over the course of the academic year which represents two iterations of
this study.
3.9 Research Design Context
What follows in this section is narrative based on my experience leading my
study, and insights and comments I documented in my research journal. Each section of
the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course is discussed separately. The second
iteration emerged as I was evaluating and reflecting on the first iteration of my research
study. Design principals of the first iteration were incorporated into the second iteration
design. As a result, observational data from the second iteration has been included in the
evaluation and reflection of the first iteration as I have observed promise in the design
principals implemented.
3.9.1 First Iteration. The academic year at this college runs on semesters. The
first iteration of this research study occurred during August 2016 to December 2016.
3.9.1.1 ‘One-shot session’ section. My first interaction with the students from this
section was on the first day of the semester. I was given five minutes at the beginning of
the class period to introduce myself and then to introduce the study. After those five
minutes, I left the lecture room and did not interact with either Professor Oliver or the
students from this section until it was close to the time for the students to come to the
library for the library session.
During the first 20 minutes of the class period I spent time demonstrating the
databases, interlibrary loan services, and Zotero (citation manager). These topics were
requested specifically by Professor Oliver even though I discerned from his email that he

71

had already discussed these items in class with the students prior to coming to the library.
I encouraged participation from the students by asking them what keywords I should
search; however, student responses were minimal. As I continued the presentation, I
could tell by the lack of response that the students were not engaged. As a result, I
decided it was best to let the students use the last twenty-five minutes of the class period
to continue researching their topics while I circulated to help. Unfortunately, not all
students had access to a computer or a tablet in the library classroom so some left to go
upstairs to use the library’s computers. I walked around the room to see if anyone
required assistance but unless I made the effort to engage with a student, no one asked
any questions. Odessa sought help from Professor Oliver and Professor Oliver brought
me into the conversation as it was about the library’s interlibrary loan service.
At the end of the one-shot session, I made sure I reminded the students that if they
needed further assistance with their research they could sign up for a Research Assistance
Program appointment with me. I showed them where on the library website they could go
to fill out the form. The form is not a fillable form online, so students have to print out
the form and either email it to the librarian or hand deliver it. Only one student from the
‘one-shot session’ section of the course took advantage of the Research Assistance
Program and she was a part of the research study. Odessa was having issues finding
resources for both sides of the argument. During the half an hour appointment I shared
with her different subject specific databases and explained to her why these databases
would work for her subject. I also talked to her about developing keywords and using
Boolean operators in her search strategies. Odessa was also struggling with developing a
work cited page and in-text citations. As a result, I shared with her resources such as the

72

MLA Handbook and Purdue Owl which is a website were students can go to for
help on citations.
3.9.1.2 ‘Partially embedded librarian’ section. In this section, I started attending
classes during the third week of the semester. Professor Paulette did not want me to start
attending class until she made the last call for the informed consents. During the first
class I attended in week three, Professor Paulette discussed the library and keyword
searching. Professor Paulette showed the students how to navigate around the library
website, showed the students how to use Academic Search Premier and showed the
students google scholar. Professor Paulette also spent time during this class talking about
the research question. Finally, during the class I observed that students were introduced
to the idea that scholars use different terms that are more academic like equine and
adolescents.
During the second session of week three, students began working on finding
sources in class. I was able to help students who were struggling with finding their
sources during this class session and I thought maybe this interaction would generate
requests for a Research Assistance Program appointment with students. I also thought at
the time that it was interesting that Professor Paulette had the students already searching
for sources before I had my week of library instruction with the students.
In the last session of week three the discussion revolved around knowing your
audience and what counts as evidence. Students were also introduced to the topic of
primary, secondary, and tertiary sources through a group activity. It was during this class
period that Professor Paulette suggested I need not stay for the rest of the class session or

73

for the fourth week. Since I was new, I did not want to overstep my welcome so when
Professor Paulette suggested that I did not need to be there I did not stay.
I provided library instruction during week five and since most of the requested
library instruction had already been covered by professor Paulette, I chose to provide a
workshop style session. Therefore, I booked the computer lab for us to use so that the
students could use most of the week to find sources for their annotated bibliography.
During the first session of week five, I spent time with the students teaching
them how to use Zotero. Teaching students to use a citation manager for me was a
difficult transition as most recently I worked at a school where the focus was on teaching
students how to create bibliographies and in-text citations. Professors at my last school
relied heavily on the librarians to help students learn how to properly cite. My own
personal philosophy is that most citation managers are only as good as the person using
them. If you do not know how to create a proper citation the program most often does
not correct it for you. Professor Paulette wanted me to introduce the students to Zotero
since it was widely used by many other professors on campus. However, Professor
Paulette did not feel like she knew the program well enough to teach it, so she relied on
the librarians to teach it to the students. I also discussed the Interlibrary Loan service
with the students during this first session before giving them the last twenty minutes of
class to work on their sources.
During the second session, I showed the students the library catalog, the
Periodicals A-Z list, Global Issues in Context and Films on Demand. Professor Paulette
referred to Global Issues in Context and Films on Demand as tertiarily sources. While I
did not fully agree with this idea, I went along with it so as not to contradict the professor

74

in class. The last twenty-five minutes of this class was also given to the students to use
for finding their sources.
I used the beginning of the last class to ask the students if they had any specific
library related questions. The questions that were raised were individualized questions
related to their own topics. As a result, I told the class to use the whole class period to
work on their topic and I would come around and help individuals on a one on one basis.
During this class period, I met individually with five different students to help them
generate keywords and help them find the right database to search in. One of these five
students needed additional help and he did book a Research Assistance Program
appointment with me. Another student booked a Research Assistance Program
appointment with me but then he never kept it. I found out that he did not keep it because
he changed his topic and had greater success in finding articles. I think I did not see any
more Research Assistance Program appointments with this group because of the
concentrated time with me in a computer lab.
I stayed in this class for one more week of this section. The sixth week was
focused on the concept of summarizing information. After this week, I emailed Professor
Paulette and asked her if she thought that I should continue coming to the class. Her
response was only if you feel the urge. This response did not inspire me to stay in the
class and I ended up not going back for the rest of the semester. Professor Paulette and I
both had places to go after each class, so we could not stay and chat about each class
session. With little opportunity for communication there was little opportunity for
collaboration. As suggested by Hearn (2005) collaboration is necessary for a successful
implementation of embedding a librarian into the classroom. In this instance, there was

75

no collaboration on classroom assignments or sequence of integrating library instruction
into the curriculum.
3.9.1.3 ‘Fully embedded librarian’ section. In this section I attended almost
every class session for the entire semester. However, I was not in front of the classroom
along with the professor, I sat with the students but at the front of the class on the far
side of the room.
I started attending this section during week two of the semester. On the first day
that I attended Professor Fiora had the students watch a TED talk called Tinkering
School. This TED talk was used to show students that learning is collaborative, and all
resources are available for them to use. Once the students had finished watching the TED
talk they were put into groups and asked to come up with ideas that they would like to
research. Professor Fiora and I circulated around the room and answered questions about
the assignment and ideas for researching. The students presented their research ideas
during week four of the class. Being in the classroom for the presentations helped me to
learn more about the students and their research interests. Week five of the class focused
on experience or expertise. Students were introduced to the concept of academic
expertise and academic scholarship. Professor Fiora did refer to the expertise of the
librarian during this week. Otherwise, I did not have any interaction with the students
during this week.
The first class session that I taught was during week six of the semester. This class
session was used to expose the students to the library and the resources available to them for
research. This class session was held in the library classroom which is not equipped with
computers, therefore, students were asked to bring laptops and/or tablets to

76

the class to follow along as I demonstrated different databases. I also introduced the
students to the concept of metaliteracy and metacognition. The last twenty-five minutes
of this class was used for students to find two articles on their topic.
The second round of class presentations occurred during week seven and these
presentations were individually done where students pitched their research topics to
Professor Fiora. This assignment was called the prospectus. Commitment day which is a
day where students must choose their research topic followed these presentations.
The second library session was held in the regular classroom during week eight
of the class, right after students turned in their prospectus and before students were to
work on their annotated bibliography. Professor Fiora was absent due to illness on this
day. Students were introduced to the concept of a literature review as well as citations
during this session. The last half of the class session was used for students to do their
own research while I was present. Three students signed up for a Research Assistance
Program appointment after this session as they wanted further time one-on-one with me
to help them find sources for their topic. In their appointments, I spent time discussing
with them database choice as well as showing them how to use the interlibrary loan
service. Each student that made an appointment also asked for further help on learning
how to cite properly.
Weeks nine and ten were used to cover the following topics: urban legends,
logical fallacy, and metacommentary. The first draft of the research paper was due the
Monday of week eleven. I reviewed the papers and provided feedback to the students on
in-text citations as well as references, and then Professor Fiora provided feedback on
their writing. At the end of this week students were given old research papers from

77

previous years of the course and were asked to grade the papers and make comments on
what they thought was done well or what was missing. It was interesting to me to see
that the students could tell when a paper read like a book report and when a paper lacked
proper in-text citations and bibliographies. Several students found this activity helpful as
it showed them how they could improve their own draft. Week twelve had the students
watching the Crucible in class and this is a week that I, as a librarian, probably would not
have to attend in future classes. Professor Fiora uses the Crucible as an example of
discussing rhetoric.
Although the class originally was set up to have three library sessions the third
session did not happen. However, one class period during week fourteen was designated
as question and answer day and many of the questions that day were related to citations
and how to properly cite in-text and in the bibliography. As a result, I was the one to
answer those questions. It was during this class session that I provided students with a
signup sheet for a Research Assistance Program appointment. My rationale for providing
this as an option came from reading the second drafts of their research papers as it was
clear that many students still needed help with their chosen citation style and with finding
scholarly sources. I could have suggested to the students that they make these
appointments on their own, but it appeared that at this point in the semester many of them
would not have signed up unless they were given the opportunity to do so in class.
Eleven students signed up for a Research Assistance Program appointment with the
librarian however only five students showed up. During this round of appointments, the
following was discussed: organization of the paper, citing properly in-text and in their
bibliographies, and finding additional scholarly articles.

78

During the final week, students presented their research assignment one last time.
As part of this presentation students were to share what helped them in their research
and writing process. It was nice to get recognized for the help I, as a librarian, gave
students on their assignment. Often, librarians do not get to hear about the success
stories of a student after we work one-on-one with them.
Professor Fiora and I were in constant communication throughout the semester.
We discussed students as well as concepts and examples that might be of use during
further collaboration. However, I did not collaborate with Professor Fiora on the
development of the assignments for the first semester or the sequence of library
sessions. Although, Professor Fiora was open to making changes in the schedule
throughout the semester. Professor Fiora was also very happy to collaborate with me in
providing students with feedback on the course assignments. In this instance, the design
of embedded librarianship is like what was done by Hearn (2005), where the goal of the
librarian and professor collaboration was to “make research a significant part of the
course work” (p.34). Hearn’s (2005) study incorporated the following ideas: one-on-one
consultations with the librarian, one-on-one consultations with the professor, process
notes, and librarian instruction on library related online resources. According to Hearn
(2005), process notes are “brief descriptions written by students in which they describe
the steps involved in composing a particular document” (p. 37). This is like the last
presentation at the end of the semester where students present their research topic and
share with the class what parts of the research and writing process were easy and what
parts were difficult.

79

3.9.1.4 Reflection. I had a very difficult time writing up the narrative for the three
designs and I attempted to write without judgement, but I do not believe I was successful.
I was frustrated with the outcome of the designs of the ‘one shot session’ and the
‘partially embedded librarian’ approach. This is often the case for librarians’ due to lack
of communication between the professor and the librarian (White, 2016). Another
noticeable trend with these three sessions is the amount of engagement on my, the
professor, and the students’ part. All three parties exhibit lack of engagement the most in
the ‘one-shot session’. There was a little more engagement between all parties in the
‘partially embedded librarian’ section. I believe that the amount of engagement I put into
each section was a reflection on how I perceived the importance of my role as a librarian
to be to student learning in each section. The less I am valued or encouraged to
participate the less likely my effort of engagement will be. White (2016) suggests that
librarians should approach these types situations with the attitude of supporting the
professor. White (2016) believes that collaboration will be successful with this change in
attitude. Now that I have described the designs of all three sections in detail, the data
collection process is described.
3.10 Data Collection
Originally this study was proposed as a mixed methods study and after
considerable reflection on each data collection method; the decision was made to change
several approaches. Although most libraries tend to look at usage statistics as a primary
source of data collection (Handler et al., 2009) I determined that this single method on its
own was insufficient to properly document learning. Given the focus on learning, the
original data collection methods of a Pre/Post Test of information literacy and a

80

Community of Inquiry survey were eliminated as data collection methods. I did not
believe that the results of the Pre-and Post-test could significantly contribute to
documenting learning especially as the instructional design was not the same for each
section. I also believed that the Community of Inquiry survey is geared more for the
classroom professor in conjunction with an online component. While there was an online
component which consisted of a research skills tutorial during the first iteration, the use
of the online component was an option by both the students and the professors. I adapted
a research skills tutorial that was developed by another library that consisted of short
videos and text. Only five students from the ‘fully embedded librarian’ session viewed
the tutorial. None of the professors looked at the tutorial. With the inclusion of a librarian
into Community of Inquiry, I determined that an original questionnaire would be best
suited for both the professors and the students to complete. Therefore, my design-based
study was conducted using a primarily qualitative approach to data collection and the
methods are described in detail below.
3.10.1 Design Team Meeting. The recordings from the two meetings were
transcribed verbatim from audio and imported into NVivo. The first meeting that lasted
for one hour and ten minutes consisted of Professor Paulette and Fiora who chose to
implement the embedded librarian approach as well as the undergraduate student. The
second meeting which lasted for fifteen minutes involved Professor Oliver who
cancelled at the last minute before the design team meeting with everyone else. Professor
Oliver chose to stay with the traditional ‘one-shot session’ approach. The collaborative
design team meeting data was used to answer how the Community of Inquiry theoretical

81

framework could be used to inform the design and delivery of library instruction in the
‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course.
3.10.2 Questionnaires. The faculty and student questionnaires were administered
at the end of the semester and provided an opportunity for participants to provide
feedback on their experience. These questionnaires were not piloted or pretested. I used
this survey data to analyze the connection between the design and delivery of library
instruction and the Community of Inquiry Theoretical Framework. The student
questionnaire consisted of the following questions:
1. Did you view the librarian as part of your course? (yes or no)
2. If you answered yes to the first question why did you view
the librarians as part of your course? (short answer)
3. What do you think are the benefits of having a librarian attend class
sessions outside of specific dates set aside for library instruction?
(short answer)
4. If you chose not to attend a Research Assistance Program session
with the librarian what was your reasoning for this? (short answer)
5. In your class what role did you see the librarian as? (presenter,
observer, co-teacher, other (please specify)) (Select all that apply)
6. Who should teach information literacy/library skills? (professor,
librarian, both)
(Select all that apply) Please explain your answer. (not required)
7. In what ways do you think library instruction helps improve your
writing? (short answer)
The following were the questions for the professors to ask:
1. Did you allow the librarian to sit in on your class and provide
point of need instruction? (yes or no)
2. If no why did you opt out of this option? If yes why did you
decide to go this route? (short answer)
3. What do you think are the advantages of point of need
instruction in the classroom setting by a librarian? (short answer)
4. Are there any disadvantages of point of need instruction in
the classroom setting by a librarian? (short answer)
5. What role do you believe the librarian plays in the
classroom? (observer, co-teacher, other (please specify)
6. Would you be interested in planning and team teaching ENGL 212

82

with a librarian for an entire semester? Why or Why not?
(short answer)
7. In what ways do you think library instruction influences
student learning? (short answer)
The three professors and students were sent an email at the end of October 2016 that
updated them on the data collection method changes in the research study. The student
email provided the students with a link to both the research summary and the
questionnaire. The professor email provided the professors with a link to the faculty
questionnaire. Both the professors and the students were also given a new informed
consent form in the email that included reference to the questionnaire. It was decided by
the site ethics committee that participants would not need to sign the second informed
consent. The committee felt that since a signature was already on file a statement could
be made in the informed consent stating that by clicking on the survey they are agreeing
to continue in the study with the new data collection methods. The text-based responses
to open ended questions from the professor and student questionnaires were imported into
NVivo for analysis. The select response questionnaire responses allowed for data to be
tabulated quantitatively and responses are summarized using tables.
3.10.3 Student Interviews. Students were invited to participate in an interview at
the end of the semester to provide feedback on the instructional intervention, their
experience of the instruction, and what improvements they would suggest for subsequent
semesters. Four students agreed to be interviewed. Each open-ended interview started
with the same set of initial questions: So how would you describe where you’ve started at
the beginning of this semester to where you’ve finished? Think of yourself at the edge of
the woods. Are you in the woods? Are you still at the edge? Have you come out of the
other end? The questions that followed were driven by the answers provided by the

83

students. Each section of the writing course had at least one student who agreed to
participate in an interview. Three out of four of the students are student workers in the
library. The fourth student who agreed to participate was part of the ‘fully embedded
librarian’ section. For data analysis purposes, the research summary and student
interviews were combined by course section. Each section had at least one student
participate in the end of the semester interviews. The ‘fully embedded librarian’ section
had two students participate. The length of each interview was determined by the
responses given by each participant: interview #1-8 minutes (Peter), interview #2-8
minutes (Frank), interview #3-12 minutes (Faith), interview #4-7 minutes (Odessa).
These interviews were then transcribed and imported into NVivo for analysis.
3.10.4 Research Summary. The research summary was written at the end of the
semester by the students. Copies of the research summary were collected and analyzed to
better understand the delivery and influence of the library instruction on learners. The
design of the research summary that the students had to write has changed three times in
my design-based research study. I believe that the design of the student reflection
somehow influences the quality of the written response. For example, I originally asked
students to write a single spaced 1- page research summary of what they learned about
their research during the semester. This design reflected the design used by Stewart and
Broussard (2016). However, after submitting the first set of data collection methods for
ethics approval I found an additional study that provided students with specific reflection
prompts (Mikkelsen & McMunn -Tetangco, 2016). The focus of Mikkelsen and McMunn
-Tetangco’s (2016) study was to redesign library instruction in a course that would teach
students that research is a process rather than an event. Since Professor

84

Fiora and I also shared the desire for students to learn that research is a process rather
than an event, I opted to modify the research summary to match the reflection prompts of
Mikkelsen and McMunn -Tetangco (2016). The questions for the research summary
were adapted from the TRAIL final reflection prompts developed for study that involved
a redesign of an introductory writing curriculum course to emphasis research (Mikkelsen
and McMunn-Tetangco, 2016, p. 17). The following questions were included in this
study:
1. How has your process for doing academic research changed since
the beginning of the semester?
2. What challenges did you encounter when doing research for
your assignments in class?
3. What strategies did you use to overcome them?
4. Did learning more about the research process in this class help you
in other classes this semester?
5. Do you think that it will help you in future classes?
6. Think about the research you’ve done this semester and describe what
you think it means to ‘think like a researcher’.
No required length for the research summary was given to students, however, in
Survey Planet, the informed consent stated one-page single spaced was expected. The
research summaries were imported into NVivo to be analyzed. The results of the
research summaries as well as the student interviews were grouped together in NVivo by
class section (‘one-shot session’, ‘partially embedded librarian’, and ‘fully embedded
librarian’).
3.10.5 Researcher Diary. I kept a researcher diary which consisted of emails
between myself and my doctoral supervisor about the study, and my observations during
classes were noted as well. The observations that were collected were analyzed to better
understand the design of the intervention. With permission from Professor Fiora, the
emails between myself and the professor have also been included in the research diary. It

85

was determined that this data was important to include as Professor Fiora subsequently
agreed to collaborate further and continue the development of a ‘fully embedded
librarian’ approach within the writing course as a long-term design-based research
study. The research diary was transcribed verbatim into NVivo as my researcher diary.
However, I opted to only analyze the observations and reflections made in class. I felt
that it might look like a competition if the emails of the professors were included in the
analysis. This decision was made to reduce my bias in the analysis of the study.
3.11 Ethical Considerations
Risk assessment of a study is compared to the risk associated with normal daily
life (Penslar, 1993). The participants of my study were undergraduate students and
seasoned professors and myself. In attempting to design the library instruction with the
professors, it was a goal of the study to provide undergraduate students with opportunities
to learn more about research and writing as a connected process when writing scholarly
material. The risk to participants was minimal since all students were given access to the
instruction as a normal part of their experience in the class whether they agreed to
participate in the research. For those who agreed to participate in the data collection part
of the study, there was no risk of physical, psychological, emotional, and social harm.
Any risks to participants involved in my study were outweighed by the potential learning
benefits.
Students had the opportunity to withdraw from the research study at any time.
However, any individual work that was already completed during the library instruction
remained as an artifact in the study unless students requested the removal of their data.
Students who refused participation in the research study were still given the same

86

opportunities to take part in the library instruction, which included the option of taking
part in a research consultation if requested by the student.
Questionnaires and research summaries were submitted online through Survey
Planet and each section had their own separate questionnaire and research summary as
that is the only difference that was necessary to record which allowed for all responses
to be anonymous. The three professors also submitted their answers to the questionnaire
online. Professor Fiora agreed to continue working on this study past this first iteration,
and as a result, she understood that her identity may not be anonymous.
3.12 Phase Three: Analyze/Reflect
Phase three of the design-based research study discusses the analysis process of
the data collected during the study. This section also discusses the second iteration of the
research study that was developed as the data was being analyzed from the first iteration.
Before describing the analysis of data in detail the second iteration of the study will be
introduced.
3.12.1 Meso Cycle: Second Iteration. When I originally proposed this designbased research study, I envisioned that the study would be undertaken over one
semester. Several discussions occurred on campus (between myself, Professor Fiora, the
chair of the department as well as the VP for academic administration) about the
partnership that has come out of this initial research study which set in motion a longer
plan for multiple iterations of the design-based research study. As part of my
professional practice I have continued with this research study and I have implemented a
second iteration of the design.

87

3.12.2 Micro cycle: Design and Construction. The second iteration of the study
examined only the ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach. The course curriculum was
developed by myself and Professor Fiora and was presented to the students as a teamtaught course. Although this class was presented as a team effort I do not believe that the
term can be used to describe the actual outcome.
The second iteration of my research study took place during January to May of
2017 and happened as the analysis of the data collected during the first iteration was
being analyzed and written up. Professor Fiora and I met during the semester break to
plan the curriculum. Most of the assignments stayed the same, however, instead of
summarizing a commercial, the students were required to summarize two scholarly
articles and an additional assignment was included in this section. Students were
required to write nine journal entries discussing their research and writing process
throughout the semester. At times, these journal entries allowed for students to provide
useful tips to other students on the process of research and writing. For example, some
students commented on their database choice, notetaking tasks or why they used the
Research Assistance Program. However, towards the end of the semester students were
clearly going through the motions of writing something for the sake of completing the
tasks and not for providing useful information to others. Lesson plans from the book
Teaching Information Literacy Threshold Concepts were added to the curriculum.
One major difference between the first iteration of the ‘fully embedded librarian’
session and the second was where I situated myself in the classroom. In the first iteration,
I was sitting in the same desks as the students which could have portrayed to the students
and to the professor that I was not an equal in the classroom. During the second

88

iteration, I chose to be at the front of the classroom with the professor. I made this
decision as I wanted to portray to the students that I held more of a leadership role in the
in the classroom. I was also more confident in my ability as a librarian at this school and
I had built a relationship with the professor, so I no longer felt like I was overstepping
any boundaries. During week one of this second iteration, students were introduced to the
TED Talk on Tinkering School and were assigned groups to present their research
interests. The difference between last semester and the second semester was that students
did not get to choose their own groups. I was the one that placed the students into their
groups for this activity. This difference provided the students with an opportunity to get
to know new people.
During week three of class, students were introduced to the concept of
information creation as a process. I was not able to attend this class session where the
students worked in groups on an activity that had the students tracing information over
time, as I had to provide library instruction for another professor. This activity
introduced students to various sources such as newspaper articles, journal articles and
books. Students were also introduced to the concept of primary, secondary, and tertiary
sources. After the first assignment was due, students requested the opportunity to meet
with me, so I brought in Research Assistances Program forms for students. Eight out of
twenty students had booked an appointment with me and seven of those students booked
the appointment before commitment day, while one booked an appointment two weeks
before the first draft of the paper was due.
During week five, Professor Fiora led a discussion during which the students were
introduced to scholarly inquiry through the analogy of crime scene investigation.

89

Originally, for this week, the two of us had planned on a classroom activity related to
searching in databases versus search engines. However, I opted to change that and had
the students take part in a group activity on plagiarism and the importance of citing
sources. I chose to make this change as students were still struggling a fair amount with
creating citations and students were also asking after class why they needed to cite. It
was during this week that Students began writing their journal entries.
The first class period during week six was a co-led by both myself and Professor
Fiora as we focused on how to frame a topic for library research. During the rest of this
week, students presented their research topics to Professor Fiora and myself. In week seven
of the class there was another co-led discussion on search as strategic exploration and
students also committed to their research topic at this point in the semester.

Weeks nine through ten were focused on the following topics: urban legends,
logical fallacy, metacommentary. Students turned in their first draft of the research paper
during week eleven. During this week, I led out in the group activity of peer reviewing
old research papers from previous years on my own. Students were split up into groups
and were asked to grade the papers. This assignment was modified from last semester to
include specific questions that were required to be answered. Those questions were:
Which paper is nothing more than a book report? How do you know? Which paper does
the best about managing tone, voice, and formality? Any additional comments or
observations? Most of students could point out which paper was a book report and which
paper did the best with regards to managing tone, voice, and formality.
During this second iteration, it appears that there were more students who
understood the concept of an argumentative paper. I believe that by giving students the

90

opportunity to have a Research Assistance Program appointment with me earlier on in the
semester helped the students to better understand the concept. First drafts of those
students who attended a Research Assistance Program appointment indicated an
understanding of the concept. It is also possible that the integration of the research
process throughout the class lectures also attributed to this outcome.
Unlike last semester I did not attend class the week that the Crucible was shown
(week 12), however, during week 12 students were given another opportunity to meet
with me through the Research Assistance Program. Seven students signed up to meet
with me and six of these students were repeat appointments. These students focused on
the organization of their paper and the literature review. One student came for the first
time and she needed clarification on citations and organization, and she wanted to know
if it was an undesirable thing that her opinion had shifted after reading the research. I
told her that it was not an undesirable thing if her opinion changed after conducting the
research. I also said to her that it was good to listen to the research and develop an
informed answer that related to the research question.
After having several of these students come for help specifically on organization
of the research paper, I began to wonder if students were blurring the difference between
Professor Fiora and myself. The shift away from research during the Research Assistance
Program appointments was what prompted this concern. In future designs, we may need
to give more clarification to the students at the beginning of the semester on the roles of
the librarian and professor in the research and writing process. With a clearer
understanding of the role of the librarian and professor, students may better understand
who they should turn to for help in relation to the research and writing process. One of

91

the class sessions in week 13 was preempted by student questions about the literature
review. This led to a co-led discussion between Professor Fiora and myself on the
literature review in relation to the research paper. At the end of this class session I made
a general announcement to the class saying if any student who had signed up for a
Research Assistance Program appointment wanted to cancel, they could. Three students
opted to cancel as they had their questions answered during the class session. The reason
for making this announcement was that several of the appointments earlier that week had
been for that very topic and I had assumed that the rest of the students wanted the same
help.
The final two weeks in the course ended the same way as during the first
iteration. Students were given a day to ask questions and then students made their final
presentations on their topics. Students that asked questions during the question and
answer day, were close to finishing their papers. Their questions were more for
clarification on the literature review, writing in academic tone, as well as how include
their opinion while keeping the tone academic. Professor Fiora led the discussion while I
was available to offer additional examples if needed. It was clear from student
presentations that several students understood that the process of research and writing go
together. After several presentations, I wrote the following comments quoting students
from their presentation: “research and writing is a process”, “researching first and
mapping paper after research” and “evaluating sources”. The fact that several students
picked up on the concept of research and writing being a connected process leads me to
believe that we are getting closer to a successful design that integrates library instruction
into a writing course.

92

I believe that the second iteration of the ‘fully embedded librarian’ is a closer
example to that presented by Hearn (2005). As mentioned by Hearn (2005) “deciding on
the extent to which the librarian would take part in the classroom instruction was
integral” on the design and delivery of the course content (p. 221). While this iteration is
a closer example of how a librarian can be embedded into the ‘Writing for Scholarly
Audiences’, based on research by Hearn (2005), Peary and Ernick (2004), and Shields
(2014), I believe there are further modifications that can be made. These modifications
will be discussed in the next chapter.
The conceptual framework for this research study has changed as a direct result of
the emerging research questions, multiple designs of library instruction and the addition
of a second iteration in the study.

93

Figure 3.4: New Conceptual Framework (part adapted from Community
of Inquiry theoretical framework, Garrison et al., 2000)
Figure (3.4) is a pictorial representation of the revised conceptual framework for
this design-based research study. Observational data had been collected from the second
iteration while the evaluation and reflection micro cycle of the first iteration was being

94

conducted, therefore reflection of observational data was included into this micro cycle.
The following chapter analyzes and presents the findings of this research study.

95

Chapter 4: Findings
In this chapter I present the final micro cycle of my research study which includes
the evaluation and reflection phase. I first describe my process of completing the analysis
of the findings and give an explanation of the issue of trustworthiness of data. The
findings are then presented as they relate to the theory and practice of my research study:
1) Community of Inquiry theoretical framework and 2) library instruction.
4.1 Micro cycle: Evaluation and Reflection
In this section, the three steps taken to analyze the data are discussed. At the end
of this section the themes found through constant comparative analysis is presented.
4.1.1 Analysis using the constant comparative method. “Design research is
conducted with two main goals: creating an intervention that solves problems in practice,
and producing theoretical understanding” (McKenney & Reeves, 2012, p. 201). The first
step in the evaluation and reflection phase of a design-based research study is the
analysis of the data.
I chose to use the constant comparative method to analyze my data as this
method allows for the development of codes throughout the analysis stage of the
research study (Kolb, 2012). The constant comparative method “combines systematic
data collection, coding, and analysis with theoretical sampling to generate theory that is
integrated, close to the data, and expressed in a form clear enough for further testing”
(Conrad, Neumann, Haworth, & Scott, 1993, p. 280).
NVivo is a computer program that was used to analyze qualitative data for this
research study. The software program allowed for analysis of both text-based and
multimedia information. The first step of the analysis process was to transcribe the audio

96

recordings through the transcription service provided by NVivo. The audio was sent to
TranscribeMe which is a transcription service that has partnered with NVivo for easy
importation of the transcript. All the different data sources were saved in two locations:
one copy was printed and stored in a secure location while the other was an electronic
copy that was saved on a removable drive and kept in a separate secure location. The next
part of this section describes the various sources of data that have been imported into
NVivo for analysis.
When I first proposed the design-based research study, the plan was to introduce
the concept of metaliteracy instruction to the campus. However, after meeting with the
professors and describing the intent of the study, I realized that it might be too ambitious
to reach for metaliteracy instruction when the professors were focused on information
literacy/library skills and on how the process of writing and research was connected.
Even though the focus of instruction would not be metaliteracy, I decided to use the
metaliteracy codes developed by Stewart and Broussard (2016) as an entry point to
analyzing the data and to creating codes for information literacy/library skills. Since
metaliteracy is a component of the Framework I believed that the coding developed by
Stewart and Broussard (2016) could still be used to analyze library instruction. As a
result, I decided to use the codes developed by Stewart and Broussard (2016) to start
developing my own codebook for library instruction. The following table 4.1 shows the
codebook that was used for Stewart and Broussard’s study.

4.1.1.1 Step One of the Analysis. I decided to create a table that had six different
columns of sources for analysis. The first column included the text-based responses from
the faculty questionnaires. The second column included the student interviews and
research summaries from participants in the ‘one-shot session’ section. The third column
included the student interviews and research summaries from the participants in the
‘partially embedded librarian’ section. The fourth column included the student interviews
and research summaries from the participants in the ‘fully embedded librarian section’.
The fifth column included the text-based results from the student questionnaires and the
final column included the reflections of the librarian. The first read through of data was
used to see if I could use the metaliteracy codes as developed by Stewart and Broussard
(2016). All data sources were included in this first cycle of analysis. Table 4.3 shows the
number of references found for each code in each column as well as an example of each
code.

4.1.1.2 Step Two of Analysis. As previously discussed, once this first pass of
coding was completed, I determined that it did not make sense to use the codes exactly as
they were developed by Stewart and Broussard (2016). As part of my synthesis and
reduction, I first eliminated the codes that had no references recorded. Then I looked for
the codes that recorded the highest number of references. The top three categories were
library skills, research and confidence. I then decided to combine and group categories
with the lower number of references into the three top categories. For example, I
combined citations, search strategies and technology with the library skills category. I
moved critical thinking and evaluation to the research category and combined sharing
information with others in the confidence category. This synthesis and combination of
categories resulted in the following number of references for the three remaining
categories: Library Skills – 83, Research – 39, and Confidence 30. However, I believed
that these were still very broad categories, so I decided to revisit the data again and
create original codes under each category to see if I could discover any patterns. This
second round of analysis required me to read through all the data a second time.
Based on the second round of data review and coding, I separated the category of
confidence into the following subcategories: increase in confidence, relationship
building, retention of information and what would I do differently. Table 4.4 shows the
number of results for each subcategory in the confidence them. Due to the small amount
of references in this category, I decided that any theme with 10 references or more would
be considered main themes. Thus, the two themes that emerged from this second cycle of
analysis are an increase in confidence and relationship building.

I then created new sub categories for the theme of library skills. Based on the second
round of coding, I added the following sub categories: lack of technology, timing of
instruction, role of the librarian, and benefits of the embedded librarian approach. The
subcategory of role of the librarians was separated into both, librarian and professor.
Table 4.5 shows the results. Due to the larger amount of references in the library skills
category, I decided that any subcategory that had 15 references or more would be
considered a main theme. Therefore, the three main themes that emerged from this cycle

102

of coding was: timing of instruction, role of the librarian and benefits of the embedded
librarian approach.

4.1.1.3 Step Three of the Analysis. Once the initial analysis of the design of
library instruction was concluded, I then re-analyzed the data to look for indicators of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework in both the designing and delivery of the
library instruction. I chose to analyze the data with the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework even though the framework did not end up informing the design. It is my
belief that librarians to an extent already use the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework as a theory in designing library instruction without realizing it. It is because
of this belief that I chose to see if the elements of a Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework would exist in the analysis of my findings. Like the analysis of the design of
library instruction, I carried out two cycles of coding of data for themes related to the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. I based the original codes on the codes
Garrison et al. (2000) used in their research (see Table 4.7).

The following three of four themes emerged from the data for cognitive presence:
triggering event, exploration, and integration. For social presence, two of three themes
emerged from the data, and these were open communication and group cohesion. For
teaching presence, there were two of three themes coded in the data: building
understanding and direct instruction.
4.1.2 Themes emerging from the data. Once I finished the three steps of the
constant comparison method process of coding and data reduction was completed, the
following six themes emerged from analyzing the data sources on library instruction:
Theme #1: Increase in confidence
Theme #2: Relationship building
Theme #3: Librarian-as-a-resource
Theme #4: Timing of instruction
Theme #5: Role of librarian
Theme #6: Benefits of the embedded librarian approach
Given the coding and data reduction, the following seven themes emerged from
analyzing the data sources using the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework:

107

Theme #1: Exploration
Theme #2: Integration
Theme #3: Resolution
Theme #4: Open Communication
Theme # 5: Group Cohesion
Theme #6: Building Understanding
Theme #7: Direct Instruction.
Further comparison of the codes continued as the discussion of the findings were
written. These changes are not reflected in the above tables. Through the process of
writing up the findings of the themes in library instruction and Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework I realized that there was some overlap to the themes. I determined
that the information under the theme of Librarian-as-a-resource was a better fit for
discussion of building understanding in the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework.
I also determined that the theme of timing of instruction was also better used to discuss
integration in the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. Upon further reflection, I
did not believe that the reference I chose to represent Group Cohesion “Faculty and
Librarians are better together” was a correct indicator as it left out students from the
group. Therefore, I removed this theme from the discussion of the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework. I also removed the theme of benefits of the embedded librarian
approach as these are stated throughout the discussion of the other themes that emerged
from the study.

108

4.2 Trustworthiness of Data
McKenney and Reeves (2012) argue that the issues related to the trustworthiness
of data relates to the validity and reliability of the data collected by the study. Guba and
Lincoln (1994) describe trustworthiness of the data as results that should be paid attention
to. The authors go further in suggesting that attention to the following criteria allow a
researcher to establish trustworthiness of the data collected in a research study: a)
credibility, b) transferability, c) dependability, and d) confirmability (McKenney &
Reeves, 2012). Graff (2012) argues that “researchers evaluate whether the findings are
credible interpretations of the participants’ data” (p. 57). Graff (2012) further explains
that dependability “is related to reliability and evaluates the quality of the integration of
data collection, data analysis and formulation of a conclusion or theory” (p. 57). Next
Graff (2012) describes transferability as “the degree to which findings can apply or
transfer to situations outside the study that generate the findings” (p. 57). Finally, the
author suggests that confirmability “is a measure of the extent to which study findings are
supported by the data” (p. 57). For example, themes from the first and second cycle of
coding were reviewed and discussed with my supervisor and the professor from the ‘fully
embedded librarian’ approach.
The professor of the fully embedded librarian (Professor Fiora) course agreed to
continue working on this study past this first iteration. I used the member checking
approach to support trustworthiness of my results throughout the reflection and analysis
cycle of this research study. In the member checking approach, Professor Fiora reviewed
the analysis after each cycle of coding. Professor Fiora, therefore, has reviewed the
analysis after each cycle of coding to provide feedback based on her lived experience

109

with the design and how it played out with students on the trustworthiness and validity of
the results. I also reviewed the codes to make sure that the references that were selected
for each code reflected the code that was used. I would either remove a reference if it did
not match a proper code or I would rename the code to match the references chosen. My
supervisor also read my analysis after each cycle and offered feedback on the findings.
The following section of this chapter presents the findings of both the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework themes and the library instruction themes.
4.3 Presentation of Community of Inquiry Theoretical Framework Themes
The Community of Inquiry theoretical framework was used to analyze the design
of library instruction of the embedded librarian instruction approach. Swan and Ice
(2010) describe the Community of Inquiry model as “a dynamic process model designed
to define, describe and measure elements supporting the development of online learning
communities” (p. 1). I used the model to describe and measure elements that supported
the development of face-to-face learning communities within the embedded librarian
approach. The ‘one-shot session’ does not allow for the development of a face-to-face
learning community as the librarian was only given one class session to interact with
Professor Oliver and the students. Therefore, the ‘one-shot session’ section was not
discussed in the findings that have been interpreted for the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework. My research study had two sections that used the embedded
librarian approach. The first was with Professor Paulette which ended up being a
‘partially embedded librarian’ approach and the second was with Professor Fiora which
became a ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach.

110

4.3.1 Theme #1: Exploration. Garrison et al. (2000) used information exchange
as the indicator for exploration which is a category of cognitive presence. According to
Beck (2015),
Cognitive presence begins in decisions about the content itself: What will we
cover? Where will we place our energies and focus? It continues with decisions
about assignments that will best take students deeper into that content. (Para. 4)
I drew upon this description of cognitive presence to show how the choices about
information exchange can influence the design of library instruction.
Professor Paulette noted in the collaborative design team meeting, “I think there
are some things that the librarian, in this case you, could definitely re-emphasize,
because hearing it from me once is not the same thing as hearing it from me once and
hearing it from you, from your perspective.” This statement can be interpreted as the
professor asking me to cover the same material as the professor in hopes that the
double exposure will help the students to better learn the information. This is an
example of information exchange in how the design of the instruction was developed.
Professor Fiora noted, “information is all around us. Students don’t need to go to
school to find and access information. What they do need is help with thinking about how
to behave in the presence of information. How to determine what’s credible and what’s
useful or relevant.” This is another example of information exchange. Professor Fiora
indicates that more emphasis should be placed on “what’s credible and what’s useful or
relevant” rather than teaching a student how to “find and access information”. Upon
reflection of the library instruction during the first iteration this is how the instruction
was developed to teach a student how to “find and access information”. In

111

this section there was less emphasis placed on teaching students how to search library
databases. Students were told at the beginning of the semester that there was a research
skills tutorial available for them on Moodle (content management system). Students
were required to do this on their own and no grade was assigned to the completion. Faith
was asked to reflect on this type of teaching style:
For me, it wasn't a problem because I'm a little bit more self-motivated where I
can kind of like, “Okay. I don't know how to do this. I'm just going to go on to
Moodle.” I do think for a lot of my peers it would have been more advantageous
to either have it in class. Because the syllabus is almost always ignored. But I
do think that for the class as a whole, yeah, you're going to have students that
are going to be bored of it because we already understand how to do it and we
know our tools, and you're going to have students who are going to be bored
because they think, "Oh, I don't need it." But I do think there's those few groups
in the middle that are going to receive value from it. And I think it might have
been useful for them.
When designing library instruction, it is important not only to keep in mind the
professor’s teaching style but also the students’ learning preferences. There will need to
be several options provided for library instruction as students and professors exchange
information differently. Students will also need to be held accountable in some way for
learning the material should the instruction be provided outside of class.
I also observed that students used the librarian as a resource outside of class more
in the ‘fully embedded librarian’ section than in the other two sections. These students
that came to see me came because they needed more time to go in depth with their

112

exploration of information. Most of the students who randomly stopped by to visit me
were from the’ fully embedded librarian’ section and most of these students at one point
had set up a Research Assistance Program appointment. Several other students also met
with me for a Research Assistance Program appointment. All three sections were made
aware of the Research Assistance Program and were told to find the form online to sign
up for an appointment. The ‘fully embedded librarian’ section had a greater success rate
for using the Research Assistance Program than the other two sections. This result could
also be because I provided students with the opportunity to sign up for these
appointments during class time. This was not an option that was given to the other two
sections, but my time was limited with them and it did not occur to me to provide them
with an alternate way to sign-up. Research Assistance Program appointments were on
the class calendar for one week during the second iteration and were also requested
specifically by the students during another week. Given this success in booking a larger
number of appointments I will likely in the future take a handful of Research Assistance
Program forms to all library instruction sessions in addition to showing students were to
locate the form online and telling students how they can reach me. The results of this
data seem to indicate that including one-on-one sessions with the librarian is a way for
exploration to be present within the curriculum.
4.3.2 Theme #2: Integration. Garrison et al. (2000) used connecting ideas as the
indicator for exploration which is a category of cognitive presence. This section
discusses connecting ideas as it relates to the design of library instruction. I used this
example to interpret if integration was present in the design and delivery of library
instruction.

113

In the collaborative design team meeting Professor Paulette commented:
I’ve actually thought about having some of my past students, from this course,
come in now that they have some insight on the process and talk about different
aspects of the process including what they’d wished they’d asked the librarian,
what they wished they had used in the library.
This idea of using former students of the course to help new students connect the idea
that the processes of research and writing are connected is a good one. During the first
iteration, this was not done in any of the three sections. However, Professor Fiora and I
did bring in Faith from the first iteration to talk to the students during the second
iteration. We decided to invite a former student to help students understand the value that
a librarian brings to the class and to encourage the students to learn more about the
library.
For the embedded librarian approach to work, collaboration and relationship
building is key. In the faculty questionnaire at the end of the semester Professor Fiora
explained:
For as long as I have been teaching it, librarians have always been adjunct to the
course, and students have interacted with library faculty ‘outside’ of the regular
course delivery. But putting the library instruction peripheral to ‘substantive’
course content risks teaching or modeling to students that librarians are
peripheral, and/or that the research process itself is extra-curricular.
I believe this statement is reflected in the approaches taken to integrating library
instruction into the course by the professor of the ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach.
Professor Fiora and I spoke about student work, planned how the library instruction

114

would be implemented into the writing course together and was open to trying
innovative ideas. Professor Paulette and I did not speak about student work or plan
together how the library instruction would be implemented into the writing course.
Professor Paulette chose when the library instruction would occur and what I would
instruct on. I did not have access to student writing, so I was not able to assess if more
instruction was necessary.
There were two key issues with the timing of instruction that came up in the
discussions between the students and myself; these issues were citations and when to
offer help through the Research Assistance Program. The student participants in this
research suggested that the timing of teaching students how to cite sources should
have come earlier in the semester. Faith suggested:
I might have had citations in a more full class period. Because you mentioned
that you kind of like, "Here's where you go", but I think a more fuller
conversation on citations should have been done a little earlier. I think that might
have been a little more helpful. Because even though I wasn't using any of the
two styles that you guys were talking about more, it was still a thing that I'm like,
"Oh, I should check on that in my guide and figure out what that is for us".
It is important to note that after I reviewed the first assignment, I made sure to ask
Professor Fiora for extra time during a class session to speak about citations. The class on
citations was not planned until much later in the semester. It was clear to me after
reviewing the first assignment that students needed help right away on citations.
However, I was not given a full class session to present on citations so the best I could do
was to point them to the resources that they could use to learn how to cite. Citations were

115

mentioned multiple times throughout the semester and when students from the ‘fully
embedded librarian’ section came for a research consultation, then individualized
help was given for citations.
Participants also would have liked to have an option to take part in the Research
Assistance Program earlier in the semester. Reflecting on this feedback, I wonder if it
would have been a better use of time to require students to meet one-on-one rather than
having workshop time in the computer classroom. Faith suggested a different time in the
semester would be better for the Research Assistance Program appointments, “Yeah. I
would think, maybe before the second draft is due. If the second draft is due on Friday,
then have consultations stop that Monday. Have them on that Monday, and then no more
after that Monday.” Frank also agreed that earlier would have been more helpful, “For
me, probably earlier, because I found a lot of my resources, but I didn’t know which ones
were supposed to be used, or could be used. So I think earlier would have helped me a
little bit more.”
The professors met two and a half months after the study was completed to
debrief about the library instruction from last semester. Since the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework is only present in the embedded librarian approach, I only include
excerpts from the discussions with those professors. Professor Paulette reflected on the
semester by stating:
For me I feel like what we need is a list of what I think they need to know. And then
boiling it down to what on this list can I teach. What on this list would really work
better on a series of instruction videos that they have to watch and they do a

116

brief quiz on. Which would be self taught right? And which of these pieces do you
provide because of your expertise.
In response to a question about what she would like to include next time for library
instruction, this was her response: “Well for example maybe advanced search skills...
they still don't know the difference between what a primary, secondary and teriary
source is and how to use them.” Professor Paulette went on to state:
I feel like library instruction for them right now might be a little bit like
orientation week. Lots of stuff being thrown at them and most of it going over
their head because those are the kind of tedious things...they don't know that they
can make an account. Again on a list. Having a list of what they need to know for
the students, what can be done by the teacher him or herself and what is left that
really needs an expert.
What Professor Paulette appears to be describing is a flipped classroom approach, an
idea that will be discussed further in the next chapter. Professor Paulette also suggested
that lots of information is being thrown at the students at once and what may need to be
done is a redesign of when in the class that the library instruction occurs. All the library
instruction sessions are given before the student has committed to their topic and have
begun to really research and write. A discussion on Zotero and citations by the librarian
may be more useful to a student when the professor is ready to discuss the topic rather
than giving the librarian one week to discuss all library related topics.
Professor Fiora mentioned on the way out that she chose to let Professor Paulette
have as much time as required to debrief. However, this meant that Professor Fiora was
not given the opportunity to publicly share with Professor Paulette the experiences she

117

had with collaborating with me during the research study. My study has indicated that
professors on campus may not understand the role of a librarian in a writing course.
Sharing a positive collaborative effort between a librarian and a writing professor
with other writing professors could provide an opportunity to present professors with
a different viewpoint of working with librarians on integrating library instruction.
Collaboration once again is the key for integration to support development of
cognitive presence. Collaboration on the curriculum between myself and Professor Fiora
is necessary to connect the ideas of research and writing together throughout the process
of scholarly writing. This insight is what prompted Professor Fiora and I to redesign
Professor Fiora’s section together over the semester break. During the second iteration,
both Professor Fiora and I are consistently reflecting on where the students are in their
learning process and making changes to the curriculum along the way. Students are
given a timetable of classroom activities a month a time to allow for changes to be made
as needed according to the progress of the students in the process.
4.3.3 Theme #3: Resolution. Applying innovative ideas was the indicator used
to see if the element of resolution was present in cognitive presence. The concept of
point of need instruction was the new idea that I attempted to introduce into the ‘Writing
for Scholarly Audiences’ sections during my research study. Professor Paulette stated
that she included point of need instruction in her section because, “[she] do[es] not want
students to see me [the professor] as their only resource. They need to make use of a
wide range of resources—human and other.” Professor Fiora explained her reasoning
for including point of need instruction, “Having the librarian embedded in the course
moves the person and the process directly into the center, makes the library work central

118

and substantive, and affirms both practically and theoretically the role of librarian-asresource as well as research-and-reading-as-central.” Professor Fiora understands that
the librarian is critical to the process of research and writing.
When I asked Professor Fiora if I could read and comment on student work
Professor Fiora agreed. This was another new idea introduced into the section.
Additionally, another new idea introduced was having me available at the end of class to
answer student questions that pertained to research at the time that they were asked. For
innovative ideas to be fully seen as an indicator of the cognitive presence, collaboration
of classroom assignments should be considered at the beginning of the semester. This
was done during the second iteration (Spring of 2017). One new idea that was introduced
to the ‘fully embedded librarian’ section during the second iteration was the use of an
online forum on Moodle for the students, professor, and myself to discuss research in a
less formal way.
Students were asked to identify the benefits of having a librarian attend class
sessions outside of specific dates set aside for library instruction. Student answers
indicated that the more interaction they have with me, the more comfortable and
confident they feel in my ability to help them in their research. Frank noted that “It’s
nice to always have someone who is willing to make time to help you on things you
might not have known from the class”.
4.3.4 Theme #4: Open Communication. There was only a small representation of the
element of social presence influencing the design of library instruction. Open
communication is the main factor that needs to be implemented for the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework to inform library instruction. Communication between the

119

librarian and professor also influence how the design and delivery of library instruction
is completed.
There was little communication between Professor Paulette and myself. Professor
Paulette taught a class immediately following the section and I also had to head to
Professor Fiora’s class, which limited time for discussion after class. At the beginning of
the semester, Professor Paulette communicated via email about the timing of instruction
in her course, and how a week of library instruction fit best into her schedule. An email
conversation occurred the week before library instruction to ensure that Zotero was going
to be covered and to let Professor Paulette know that the computer lab had been
scheduled for the week. After the week of instruction, I attended class but since Professor
Paulette had moved away from conversations that could include the librarian I asked
Professor Paulette if my services were needed further. It was decided that unless I felt the
need to attend my attendance was no longer necessary. This communication is what
prompted me to not go back to the section for the rest of the semester.
Professor Fiora and I started the semester with staying after class to discuss the
activities of the day. During the sixth week of the class, Professor Fiora and I started
sharing ideas about what we were learning through the collaboration. Professor Fiora
also started sharing ways in which we could improve the curriculum. Professor Fiora
ended up having to miss a class due to an illness and it was at that time that I asked to
start reviewing student work. From then on, we were in constant communication
regarding student progress throughout the rest of the semester. It appears that
communication is necessary for collaboration to be successful and collaboration is the
key to using the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework.

120

4.3.5 Theme #5: Building Understanding. Teaching presence example
indicators are loosely interpreted as library instruction in the classroom is on a lesser
scale than a professor in charge of a classroom. Although Professor Fiora and I team
taught the course together during the second iteration, Professor Fiora is still seen as the
primary instructor. Garrison et al. (2000) used the example indicator of sharing personal
meaning. The only instance where I could provide examples of building understanding
was through the ‘fully embedded librarian’ section. Professor Fiora wanted to design the
concept of library instruction to reflect that of just-in-time instruction:
I think that notion of the just-in-time instruction, that seems to me to be the only thing
that works, the thing that works for the majority of students because you can
introduce them to all-- I can put up all the-- I don't think they see relevance, until,
"Oh shoot, now it's my turn to do this. What did she say? How do we do this?"

Being in the classroom allows me to be available at the time a student has a question
related to library content. Rather than the professor not being able to answer right away I
can provide an answer. Sometimes even saying the same thing as the professor but in a
unique way can help a student grasp the concept. Students from the ‘fully embedded
librarian’ section reflected on this concept. Faith stated: “She understood the syllabus
and the assignments we needed to complete as much as our professor did, and when we
could not as easily access our professor, we could find her for clarification and
direction.” Frank shared that “It gives me another view point to examine my writing
under, and provides me with knowledge on where to find tools I wouldn’t have otherwise
thought of or known of.” According to these students having two different experts
bringing understanding to the content helped the student to build understanding of the

121

research and writing process. Students indicated that sharing a different interpretation of
what was expected of them helped them to better understand what they were required to
do.
4.3.6 Theme #6 Direct Instruction. Once again, the ‘fully embedded librarian’
section is the only section where a glimpse of direct instruction is seen. Since the
professor is the primary instructor for the course much of the discussion is focused by
the professor. However, because I did attend the whole semester, students also saw me as
their professor. Faith reflects at the end of the semester in the student questionnaire,
“She was in the classroom with us nearly daily, she provided practical, integrated
instruction.” Students could see that my instruction was integrated throughout the
rhetoric and composition instruction. Students during the second iteration have also
noticed these efforts much earlier on in the semester after Professor Fiora and I
collaborated on the curriculum for the course. It appears the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework may help the design of library instruction through the integration
of the instruction into the curriculum.
4.4 Presentation of Library Instruction Themes
Despite having created my own codebook for my study, I produced comparable
results to Stewart and Broussard’s (2016) study. The following discussion of each theme
supports Stewart and Broussard (2016)’s claim that “one-shot instructional sessions do
not provide enough time to teach information literacy learning outcomes nor metaliteracy
abilities. As an instructional method created to teach tools, this approach is outdated” (p.
152). All three sections during the first iteration were designed in a manner that required
the librarian to teach tools.

122

4.4.1 Theme #1: Increase in confidence. A key theme that emerged from the
data was that an increased understanding of library skills appears to be related to an
increase in confidence in students. In this instance, I am referring to an increase in
confidence with regards to the process of research and writing of scholarly material.
Several observations and data sources pointed to this theme: the interviews with the
students at the end of the semester, the students’ research summaries, and my own
researcher reflections. This section provides quotes from participant responses to portray
the theme of increase in confidence along with an explanation of why I believe the
responses illustrate the theme.
During the interviews at the end of the semester, the students were given the
scenario of ‘being in the woods’ with regards to reading and writing during the semester.
Student participants were asked if they thought they were still at the beginning of the
woods, in the middle of the woods or out of the woods. Ophelia stated, “I’m probably
somewhere in the thick of the woods because although I learned a lot, I didn’t really get
out of the woods quite yet. I have lots to learn.” Since Ophelia stated, “although I
learned a lot”, one might argue that there was an increase in confidence level. At the
same time, Ophelia is not completely confident yet as she states, “I have a lot to learn”.
Peter was not comfortable with the woods scenario during the interview and said that he
didn’t like to write. Peter focused only on the fact that he did not like to write during that
part of the interview and did not reveal an increase in confidence with the process of
research and writing of scholarly material. Faith explained:
In terms of reading skills, I think I was already out of the woods, but my
researching and my writing skills, I would say I’m like at the end of the woods

123

and I can see the light at the end. I can see the barrier because, I know that
there’s a lot that I still need to know and need to know how to do, but I feel
well equipped and it’s like, “Oh, okay it’s right there and I can just walk to it.”
Faith’s confidence level can be observed through the language used to describe where
Faith is in the woods, “at the end of the woods…I can see the light…can see the
barrier…well equipped…it’s right there and I can just walk to it”. Frank’s response to
the woods scenario was, “I’d say I can see a lot of light at the end of the woods. So
definitely, I can still see a few trees, but I think I’m pretty much out of the woods.” Three
out of four student participants who were interviewed after the course expressed an
increase in confidence that may be related to the library instruction received in the
course. Although the four student participants are a small proportion of students in all
three classes, I contend that an increase in confidence is a key theme that has emerged
from the data.
An increase in confidence was also observed through the responses given in the
research summaries. Odessa stated that she knew that she “needed to get somewhere
with [her] research, so despite the challenges, [she] went and asked for help [and] that
helped [her to] move forward.” Odessa realized that she was struggling and needed
more guidance to succeed in finding the right sources for her paper. After she met with
me she was more confident in her abilities as a researcher. Odessa stated, “I believe that
going through this research process has helped in many areas that I will be able to apply
the skills and knowledge that [I] gained for future classes.” Olga explains that her
“process of doing academic research has improved since the beginning of the semester.”
Olga goes on to state that “learning more about the process of research in this class was

124

able to help [her] in [her] other classes.” Paige explains that she is now “better
equipped with the knowledge needed to write a research paper.” Paige goes on to state
that this knowledge “will definitely help future classes”. By using the words “better
equipped” Paige expresses an increase in confidence level of the process of research
and writing scholarly material. Frank declares, “Thanks to this class I consider myself a
much more confident writer than before.” Frank in this instance uses the term confident
in conjunction with how he feels as a writer.
Not all participants attributed an increase in confidence to the use of library
resources or working with a librarian. Ophelia stated, “There were some challenges with
how to use the online resources that the library has to offer but there wasn’t much
problem after I asked a friend what I was doing incorrectly and quickly found that it was
another wealth of information that I had not previously known how to use.” Faith
suggests that, “[her] process for academic research has changed in regard that [she]
feel[s] more comfortable, and familiar with the research resources that we have on
campus and their limitations.” Although Faith states she is more comfortable and
familiar with the research resources using the term “limitations” does not suggest an
increase in confidence in the use of library resources. Faith explained what she means by
“limitations” further in her questionnaire response to why she chose not to attend a
Research Assistance Program appointment:
I knew of other sources (one of the professors on campus) who would have more
information and knowledge in the area of my research than either of my librarians
would. My research topic was a neighboring topic to his area of study

125

and we had already had discussions on it so he and I already had a dialogue
about this topic and it was easy to ask him for his opinion and expertise.

These comments indicate that an exposure to library resources appears to be related to an
increase in a student’s confidence in their ability to conduct research. However, it is not
clear that the library instruction provided by me is what influenced the success of
students’ scholarly writing of material. The next theme explores the concept of building
a relationship with students and how that might influence the success of students’
scholarly writing of material.
4.4.2 Theme #2: Relationship building. The second theme that emerged from
the data was about the importance of relationships between the librarian and the students
and professors. Several observations and data sources pointed to this theme: faculty
questionnaires, the research summaries, responses from students during the student
questionnaire and my own reflections. This section provides examples from the data to
explore this theme.
Professor Oliver “thought it would be useful to create a face-to-face relationship
between students and the librarian. I do not want students to see me as their only
resource. They need to make use of a wide range of resources—human and other.” One
might gather from this response that for students to use librarians as a resource, some sort
of a relationship must be built. Professor Oliver suggested that library instruction
influences student learning by “put[ting] a human face with library resources, hopefully
thinning the barrier for students who need to ask for assistance but are shy to do so.”
Frank suggested that, “It’s nice to always have someone who is willing to make
time to help you on things you might not have known from the class.” This is something

126

that I do even if I am not embedded into a course but not all students get exposed to it so
they do not know that this is an option for them. Exposing students to me in lower
division courses provides an opportunity for students to begin to build a relationship with
me. Faith contended that, “[The librarian became] a part of our classroom. She is not a
stranger who we are hesitant to ask questions to, she is a familiar face who has already
heard our discussions, our presentations and our paper topics. She has context with
which to help us make our research decisions.” Although Faith did not seek out help
from me, our relationship helped me to find a way to help her. Throughout the semester,
Faith told me many times that I would not be able to help her with her research. Her
comments challenged me to seek out resources that she had not already been able to find.
Faith had chosen a topic that was related to history and she was having trouble relating
her topic to the current audience. I could find for her an article that allowed her to
connect her topic to the current audience. Building a relationship with a librarian is
directly connected to what role an individual prefers the librarian to play.
4.4.3 Theme #3: Role of the librarian. The final theme to emerge from the data
related to library instruction is what role the librarian should play in the classroom in
relation to teaching library skills. The section describes what role the students believed I
had in the classroom and whether students felt that I was a part of their class. This
section also explains from the student’s viewpoint who they think should teach
information literacy/library skills in the classroom. Finally, this section concludes with a
discussion of how the professors view the role of the librarian in the classroom.
The end of semester survey asked student whether they thought that I was a
presenter, observer, co-teacher or something else in their section. Each of the three

127

participants who responded from the ‘one-shot session’ section gave a different response:
presenter, observer, and co-teacher. I find it interesting that there is such a wide range of
answers from the ‘one-shot session’ section. My own classification of my role in this
class was that of a presenter. I was not in the course except for one class period so I
could not observe the professor nor was I a co-teacher. I was not sure how the professor
presented the role of the librarian in the course as I was not part of the class except for a
few minutes during the first day of class and during the one-shot session. During the
‘one-shot session’ section, Professor Oliver had no initial conversation with the students
before turning the class over to me for library instruction.
Olga who wrote that I was an observer also did not feel like I was a part of the
course. When asked, who should teach information literacy/library skills, Olga
responded with two answers the librarian and both. Unfortunately, Olga did not give any
reasoning for the two answers, so it would be hard to draw a connection between the role
of the librarian according to Olga and who should teach information literacy/library
skills.
Odessa responded that I was a presenter and a part of the class. Odessa gave the
following reasoning for her belief that I was a part of the class, “Well, at the beginning of
our class, I was told that the librarians were essential to help with the research. Also,
one time when I was struggling [the librarian] helped a lot. In a way, that contributed to
my research.” This student is referring to attending a Research Assistance Program
appointment with me. Odessa felt that both Professor Oliver and myself should teach
information literacy/library skills but did not provide a reason for her answer.

128

Opa did not feel that I was a part of the course, however Opa felt that the librarian
was a co-teacher. Opa also felt that only the professor should teach information
literacy/library skills. When asked to explain her answer Opa said, “I think the professor
should be the primary teacher, and the librarian as the secondary teacher.” It is unclear
what Opa meant by this response as no further explanation was given. Without more
responses from students in this section it is unclear what the role of the librarian is when
a librarian only presents during one class period. It was not a requirement for the students
to expand on their choice. As the librarian, I was not aware of how the professor
presented the role of the librarian in this section, so that could have an influence on how I
interpret the wide range of responses given from this group of students.
Only two participants responded from the ‘partially embedded librarian’ section
stating that they thought I was either an observer or a co-teacher. I classified my own
role in this section as an observer. Professor Paulette suggested that my attending her
class would allow for me to could get to know Professor Paulette’s teaching style and
provide feedback on her teaching style. However, my intentions of being in the
classroom daily had nothing to do with providing feedback to Professor Paulette about
her style or getting to know her teaching style. I had wanted to be involved in the daily
instruction providing point of need instruction where it fit into the curriculum. Professor
Paulette’s expectation did not create a space for the librarian to speak up in class when
needed to provide additional library instruction. Professor Paulette also introduced the
role of the librarian to the students as an observer in the class as part of the research
study.

129

Peter did not feel that I was a part of the course. Peter also felt that my role in the
course was that of an observer. This response matches the way that the professor
introduced me to the class. What is very interesting, however, is that Peter felt that both
myself and Professor Paulette should teach library skills. Peter stated that. “While it is a
teacher’s job to teach, the librarian should know more about how the library works,
making collaboration the wisest choice.” This response appears to contradict Peter’s
view of me as observer in the class, and suggests that Professor Paulette and I were not
seen to be collaborating during the semester but that Peter felt both could teach library
skills.
Paige indicated that I was a part of the class “because I signed up to be part of the
research. The tools that the librarian gave me helped with a paper that is worth almost
the whole grade of the class.” It’s interesting that Paige states as part of the reason why
she feels that I was part of the class was because she signed up for the research study. It
appears that being part of the research study may have influenced Paige’s response. Paige
also indicated that I was a co-teacher for the course and that I should be the one to teach
library skills. Paige’s reasoning appeared to be, “The librarian knows the information
first hand. So hearing it from the source is more beneficial.” This is an interesting
comment for the student to make as I observed the professor instructing the students 90%
of what I would normally cover in a library session. Both comments from Peter and
Paige align with my own observations of how instruction occurred in this section.

All participants of the ‘fully embedded librarian’ section indicated that the
librarian was a co-teacher in the section. Faith felt that I was a part of the course for the

130

following reason: “She was in the classroom with us nearly daily, she provided practical,
integrated instruction.” From this response, you get a sense that Faith really did believe
that I was part of the class. Faith also felt that both myself and Professor Fiora should
teach library skills:
Both should be versed in these skills that way if one is absent and students have
questions either can answer with a similar response. Also, in my experience in
the classroom, it can have more effect being told twice by different professors,
some students might not have had a co-teaching experience before and be less
likely to listen to a librarian where they might be more inclined to listen to their
professor. But the reverse might also be true where a student feels uncertain
about the knowledge of their professor in this area and want the expertise of a
librarian.
I observed students reaching out to me when Professor Fiora was unavailable and
Professor Fiora also shared with me the same about students who reached out to her.
Through observations of other students in the ‘fully embedded librarian’ section I could
see that it was easier for them to understand what the concept was when I would explain
it to them a second time.
Frank felt that the librarian was a part of the class “because she helped/taught for
almost every class, and gave valuable input.” Frank also referred to my role as an extra
source. This could be because Professor Fiora constantly referred to me as an extra resource
in class. Frank shared the same viewpoint as Faith in that both Professor Fiora and I should
teach information literacy/library skills because “sometimes either the teacher or the
librarian might not know something that the other does, so it’s harmonious

131

with the two.” I also observed Professor Fiora explaining this concept to the class on
several occasions throughout the semester. Freddy felt that I was a part of the class
“because she attended all the classes and graded our work.” It is interesting to note that
Freddy says attended, not helped/taught for almost every class like the previous two
students. Freddy’s response to who should teach library skills did not match either.
Freddy selected the professor should teach library skills but also selected both. This is a
flaw in the survey instrument that was noticed after it was used as this survey was not
piloted before the study. The reasoning given for Freddy’s answer was because “the
librarian taught a few times.” This response does not strongly support that myself and
Professor Fiora should co-teach library skills together in a class.
The debriefing of the research study with the professors revealed some important
insights about the role of a librarian and the expressed level of expertise of the librarian.
Professor Paulette challenged the level of expertise of the librarian by stating that the
library instruction that was provided was basic instruction. Professor Oliver also
suggested that perhaps he should have left the “basics for the librarian to do”. In the
debriefing, I stated
the key is more communication between you as faculty and we as librarians. We
base our instruction on what you are telling us to do in the class. I am guessing
from what Professor Paulette stated that it sounded almost like the [librarian]
didn’t do what she expected but yet the [librarian] did exactly what she asked her
to do. So, [collaboratively the professors and librarian] needs to figure out how
bridge the gap between this is what [the professor] wants and this is what [the
professor] really wants.

132

The responses in this section suggest that the role of the librarian becomes clearer
to a student the longer a librarian interacts with students in a classroom setting. The data
also suggests that students prefer a collaborative effort from the professor and the
librarian during the teaching of library skills. The results would therefore suggest that the
one-shot session is not the best design of teaching library skills if the aim is to influence
student learning of the processes of research and scholarly writing. However, it seems
that the role of the librarian in the research and writing process is unclear to the
professors.
4.5 Summary
Students scholarly writing in higher education is influenced through the
relationship built between the student and the librarian. Results of this study indicate that
the more a student interacts with a librarian the more comfortable that student becomes
with the librarian. This increased comfort level between the librarian and the student
increases the confidence in the student that a librarian can help students with their
research for scholarly writing.
The first research question of this study asked how can the delivery of library
instruction influence students’ scholarly writing in higher education. What became clear
through my study was the design of library instruction not the delivery influences
students’ scholarly writing in higher education. Two key factors influence the design of
library instruction: 1) how a professor understands the value of a librarian in a writing
course. 2) Collaboration between professors and librarians on course content. Librarians
should work towards providing opportunities for professors to understand how librarians
can be used to teach research skills as they relate to scholarly writing. A greater

133

understanding of this role can lead to collaboration between a librarian and a professor
which will then help influence integration of research skills into course content.
Collaboration is the key to using the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework
to inform the design of library instruction. Embedding a librarian into a course can
contribute to creating a community of learners. However, after going through one
iteration and partially completing the second iteration of embedding a librarian into the
‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course, I do not believe it would be feasible at this
college for a librarian to be fully embedded into more than one section in a semester. The
college only has two librarians so embedding librarians into more than one section would
take the librarians away from other courses and duties in the library. The next step of the
project would be to figure out when a librarian would need to come in to teach the library
skills in the other sections. I believe that the continuation of online forums where students
are connected to librarians should be explored further for all writing courses. I also
believe that to some degree librarians should be involved in the review of student work
during the semester. Reading and responding to student work can help a librarian to
assess the current state of a student’s research skills and may also indicate areas where
the librarian and/or professor will need to further reiterate with the students. It is also
possible that we may need to do training with professors with the new curriculum,
however it is too early yet to tell. The next chapter further interprets the key themes of
this chapter relating the findings to the literature and the theoretical framework.

Chapter 5: Interpretation of Findings
The final chapter of this dissertation provides a review of the study and a
discussion of the research outcomes and findings in relation to the research questions.
Design principles for library instruction and a theoretical understanding of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework are also presented in this chapter. This
chapter concludes with some recommendations for research and practice both locally and
globally.
5.1 Review of Study
Design-based research is a dynamic approach to researching change and
innovation in education. Given that design-based research is an emergent, participatory
approach to educational research, there can be many twists and turns, errors,
compromises and changes along the way. Design-based research is also embedded in
everyday activities in naturalistic contexts, there can also be time constraints and
miscommunications that should be addressed. My research study is no exception to these
issues. As an active participant in the research, I am constantly learning and updating my
skills as a researcher and as a practitioner. My knowledge of and experience with the
process of a design-based research study increased during and after conducting the first
iteration of this study. As the study progressed I took more of a leadership role in the
design of library instruction and the direction of the research study.
I first discovered that there were some limitations in how I originally set up the
research study. For example, I had started with an assumption that the professors of the
‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course were open to and ready for the introduction of
two new theoretical frameworks: 1) the Framework, and 2) the Community of Inquiry

135

theoretical framework. Due to the limited amount of time I was given with the
collaborative design team, one of the choices I made was to send information about the
two theories framing my study to the collaborative design team members (undergraduate
student and professors) electronically, rather than taking the time to present these two
frameworks and discuss how these were related to the expected design work. I assumed
that the practitioners and undergraduate student would read and understand both theories
prior to attending the collaborative design team meeting. Second, during the
collaborative design team meeting, instead of carefully setting the stage during analysis,
exploration, and prompting and guiding the discussion about the design of instruction, I
allowed the collaborative design team members to share freely and organically what they
interpreted as necessary within the allotted meeting time. It was important to include a
student voice in the design, however, the undergraduate student who was chosen for the
collaborative design team meeting did not make significant contributions to the
discussion during the design team meeting. The relative lack of a student voice in the
design may have been related to the constrained collaborative design process, and the
lack of direction on the design provided by myself. The undergraduate student was
involved in the design team in the hopes of bringing in the perspective of the students to
the innovative design. However, because there was no collaboration between the
professors and me at the beginning of the study the undergraduate student’s role and
voice was limited.
Because of the collaborative design team meeting, I realized that I should rework
my original research question. The initial focus for the research question was the
metacognitive component of metaliteracy which is tied to the Framework. It became

136

clear to me, after listening to the professors’ accounts of previous library instruction
sessions, that the professors were still working with the knowledge from the previous
Standards. Each professor involved in the study had a unique pedagogical approach to
teaching and different perspectives on the role of the librarian within a writing course. In
part because of these different approaches and diverse perspectives on the role of the
librarian, several designs of library instruction emerged and were implemented during the
research study. It was also my assumption and expectation that the implemented design
would help to create a community of learners in an undergraduate writing course
comprised of the librarian, professors, and the undergraduate students. However, at the
beginning of the study, it became clear that in two of the designs, the collaboration
between the professor and myself regarding integrating library instruction was limited. It
was difficult to create a community of learners without the practitioner-instructor and
researcher-librarian collaboration.
When I originally proposed this design-based research, I envisioned that the study
would be undertaken over one semester. I also set a delimitation of one academic year
for the completion of this study so that data would still be new and relevant to the fastchanging roles of liaison librarians and libraries. However, several discussions occurred
on campus (between myself, Professor Fiora, the chair of the department as well as the
VP for academic administration) about the partnership that has emerged from this initial
research study which has also set in motion a longer plan for multiple iterations of the
design-based research. As part of my professional practice, I have continued with this
research and I implemented a second iteration of the design-based research. Preliminary
observation data has been included in this dissertation as both Professor Fiora and I have

137

seen signs of improvement on the design of library instruction between the first iteration
and the second. The main difference between the two iterations is the amount of
collaboration between the practitioner and researcher on the design of the course
curriculum. The curriculum for the section during the second iteration was designed with
full collaboration between Professor Fiora and me.
5.2 Research Design
I choose the designed-based research methodology for two reasons: 1) the
researcher is part of the research and the design along with the practitioners and 2) to
generate theoretical insights related to solving real-world problems in naturalistic
settings. I discovered throughout the study that all parts of the research can be emergent.
The research questions that emerged from the study were.
1. How can the delivery of library instruction influence students’
scholarly writing in higher education?
2. How can the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework inform the
design of library instruction?
5.3 Instrumentation
My study was conducted using a primarily qualitative approach. I surveyed both
the professors and the students of the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audience’ course. The
professors had two data collection methods they were required to take part in:
collaborative design team meeting and faculty questionnaire. The collaborative design
team took part in two meetings at the beginning and the end of the research study. The
first meeting was meant to help plan the design and the last was a debriefing session. The

138

professors were also given a questionnaire with seven short answer and multiple-choice
questions to answer at the end of the study. Students took part in three data collection
methods: research summary, student questionnaire, and student interviews. The student
questionnaires also were made up of seven short answer and multiple-choice questions.
The students were asked to take part in a debriefing interview at the end of the
semester. There was only one question that was asked that was the same among the
interviews. Supplement questions were asked based on the responses. Participants were
required to agree to being recorded.
5.4 Summary of Major Findings
There are several major findings of this research study. The first is that the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework can be used to inform the design and
delivery of library instruction. The second is the value of collaboration between the
professor and a librarian as a key finding of this study relating both to the use of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework, and the design and delivery of library
instruction. The third is that the understanding a professor has of the role of the librarian
regarding teaching research and writing is also key to the design and delivery of library
instruction in a writing course. The fourth is that library instruction can best influence
student learning when students and professors understand the role of a librarian in the
classroom. The final key finding of this study is that student use of a research
consultation service is influenced by how a student perceives the role of the librarian
and the comfort level of the student with the librarian.

139

5.5 Relating Findings to Literature
My intent in using the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework in my study
was to “provide order and guidance into the complexities and dynamics of a blended
learning environment” (Akyol & Garrison, 2011a, p. 234). Integrating library instruction
into the classroom offers a form of blended learning environment. The Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework has been connected to online library instruction (Finch &
Jefferson, 2013; Rapchak, 2016; Weissman & Swan, 2013). Librarians are interested in
the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework because of the personal connections this
approach to designing instruction can generate (Raphcak 2016; Weissman & Swan, 2013)
along with the facilitated learning approach (Finch & Jefferson, 2013). These are the
same aspects that drew me to using the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework
model in library face-to-face instruction. Most library instruction that I have done in the
last five years has been through the traditional demonstration style lecture and this type of
lecture style does not lend itself towards personal connections or facilitated learning.
Often a librarian is not given much time to instruct students on the process of research
(Scott, 2016). Through the intentional design and inclusion of a blend of in-class group
activities, online instructional videos, online forums and class research consultations, a
librarian can continue to provide guidance to students as it relates to the research process,
therefore allowing the professor most of the class time to teach students the writing
process.
The results of the data from the first iteration suggest that the principles from the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework were not very present in the design of
library instruction for writing courses. However, aspects of the Community of Inquiry

140

theoretical framework was present in the ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach. Szeto
(2015) suggests that the “teaching presence plays a lead role in facilitating social
presence for communicative interactions and fostering student learning to achieve the
intended learning outcomes” (p. 192). I suggest that the same is true for integrating
library instruction into writing courses to influence student learning on the research
and writing process.
While all three sections showed an increase in self-reported confidence of the
students’ understanding of the research and writing process, the evidence was stronger in
the embedded librarian approach (see Table 4.3 and Table 4.4), which had the most
teaching presence. The primary difference between the ‘partially embedded librarian’
approach and the ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach appears to be in how the instructor
designed, facilitated, and integrated the librarian and her instruction throughout the
course.
Comments from the students in both embedded librarian approaches support the
use of the embedded librarian approach. Faith states, “[The librarian] was in the
classroom with us nearly daily, [and the librarian] provided practical, integrated
instruction.” Frank suggests, “sometimes either the teacher or the librarian might not
know something that the other does, so it’s harmonious with the two.” Peter contends,
“While it is a teacher’s job to teach, the librarian should know more about how the
library works, making collaboration the wisest choice.” Peter indicates the key to
successful integration of library instruction into a writing course and that is through
collaboration. Collaboration between Professor Fiora and I allowed for innovative ideas
to be implemented during the second iteration. These innovative ideas were geared

141

towards creating a stronger presence of the social and cognitive presence in the
classroom.
The second iteration of the research study included an online forum that was
designed to “support collaboration and deep learning” (Akyol & Garrison, 2011a; Warner,
2016, p. 434). While data collection has not been completed yet in the second iteration, it
has become clear from the initial observations that a community of learners began to form
whereby students provide tips to each other and responded to each other’s posts. From the
responses given by some of the students, it appears that deep learning does not happen for
all as there are students who give simple responses to the question and those who give more
detailed and substantive responses later in the semester.

The simple responses give the impression that the student is answering the
questions simply to complete the assignment. It may be that a distinct set of questions
need to be used for the prompt of the forum entry. Towards the end of the second
iteration many students began to respond to the journal entries by sharing what was
working for them during the research and writing process. They stopped responding just
to answer the questions and complete the assignment. They began to encourage each
other and provide each other with tips. These responses showed that collaboration and
deep learning increased over the semester. Unfortunately, an example cannot be given as
the journal entries were not part of the data collection methods included in the ethics
protocol for this study.
If design was the only factor that influences students’ scholarly writing in higher
education, we would likely not have seen students from each writing session expressing an
increase in confidence. Odessa “went and asked for help” from the librarian. She

142

attributes this interaction to increasing her confidence in research. Paige explains that she
is “better equipped with the knowledge needed to write a research paper”. Frank
declares: “Thanks to this class I consider myself a much more confident writer than
before.” Stewart and Broussard (2016) suggest in their study that “confidence gained
from information literacy instruction is often associated with self-perceived competency
on behalf of the students in their ability to perform tasks associated with information” (p.
150). The results of Stewart and Broussard’s (2016) study indicate that “student
reflections not only indicate self-confidence; they also demonstrate ability” (p. 150). The
difference between my study’s research summary and that of Stewart and Broussard
(2016) is the open-ended nature of the response. Stewart and Broussard (2016) asked the
students to reflect on their work during the semester. In their response, students were
supposed to reflect on the work they produced as well as a reflection on the “knowledge
and information habits they have developed over the semester” (Stewart & Broussard,
2016, p. 142-143).
The design of the research summary that the students had to write changed three
times in my design-based research study. I believe that the design of the student reflection
somehow influences the quality of the written response. For example, as mentioned in
chapter three, I originally asked students to write a single spaced 1- page research summary
of what they learned about their research during the semester. However, when the focus of
my study changed to designing library instruction in a way that connects the processes of
research and writing, I redesigned the research summary to match that of a similar study
conducted by Mikkelsen and McMunn-Tetangco (2016). Frank was the only participant who
completed the research summary under the original

143

requirements. His reflection provided insight on how he experienced the whole semester
with having a librarian embedded into the classroom. All other participants answered the
reflection prompts of Mikkelsen and McMunn-Tetangco (2016). While the responses did
provide useful data, I learned that what was missing was the reflection of the embedded
librarian approach. Initial analysis of the second iteration has brought new insights to the
current embedded librarian approach. Through personal observations between the
students and myself, I believe that students in this course forgot that I was a librarian and
instead perceived that my role was to help them with research and writing. Towards the
end of the semester several students asked for a Research Assistance Program
appointment, however their questions were mainly related to the content and organization
of their paper rather than about the research process. While I could answer the questions
on content and organization, given that I was the librarian in the classroom and developed
familiarity with the grading style of the professor, these are not typical questions I would
answer as a librarian.
The results of my study build and extend upon the work of Stewart and
Broussard (2016) in that students also indicated confidence in research and writing in all
three designs of library instruction. However, the indication of student confidence was
stronger in the ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach than in the other two approaches.
Students and professors of all three approaches also indicated that a face-to-face
relationship with the librarian is important for a ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’.
Students suggested that more one-on-one time with the librarian would be helpful for
their research process. These findings align with results from other studies that suggest
research consultations increase “librarian/student facetime” and “tailor[ing] research

144

assistance to the individual needs of the students” influence student learning (Magi &
Mardeusz, 2013b; Savage, 2015; Swoger & Hoffman, 2015; Watts & Mahfood, 2015, p.
71). However, a source of resistance was identified by a professor of the writing program
during this research. He indicated that using the librarians for one-on-one appointments
was very inefficient.
Both the professors and students suggested that library instruction may need to be
redesigned to better help students at the time they need to learn a concept such as
teaching students how to properly create bibliographies and in-text citations. These
findings align with those from Mikkelsen and McMunn -Tetangco’s (2016) study.
Mikkelsen and McMunn -Tetangco (2016) found that collaboration with the professor
and librarian on course content and curriculum influenced the success of a student in
learning that the research and writing process are connected. Research has found that
collaboration between librarians and professors is key for a successful design of library
instruction (Black, Crest, & Volland, 2001; Floyd, Colvin, & Bodur, 2008; Hines &
Hines, 2012; Hsieh, McManimon, & Yang, 2013; Sanborn, 2005). Further, Black et al.
(2001) suggest that collaboration can be created through “interpersonal relationships”
and “informal and formal faculty development sessions” (p. 216). A curriculum that is
content focused and time constrained combined with professors who are resistant to
change and come with preconceived attitudes towards librarians, often make building
relationships between librarians and professors a challenge (Black et al., 2001, p. 216;
Sanborn, 2005). However, the more exposure a professor has with librarians, the greater
the chance of building a relationship (Black et al., 2001; Sanborn, 2005).

145

This shift in focus towards more collaboration was portrayed in the research study
through the relationship between Professor Fiora and myself in the ‘fully embedded
librarian’ approach. Professor Fiora reflected on the experience she had with me and
shared “The collaborative work we did in the [first iteration] was a grand experiment.”
Professor Fiora went on to state that “The opportunity to cross-map, and cross-hatch the
threshold concepts drawn from both library science/information literacy and rhetoric and
composition created an infinitely pluder-able matrix of possibilities – both for the
teachers and the students.” Once a relationship has been built between the professors and
librarians, then the team can focus on developing library instruction that is informed by
theory and prior research on learning and creating opportunities that can further help
build the relationship between the librarian and student. Professor Fiora stated:
In and out of our professional lives we speak and we listen; we write and we read;
we think, and we act. Theory is important, but so is infrastructure. Building that
infrastructure so that we might demonstrate a collaborative approach to teaching
writing and information literacy – not one at a time, not separately, not either-or,
but, both, and all together – is what I saw over my shoulder as I looked back on
the first iteration of this study.
Library literature suggests that resistance from professors to work with librarians
on teaching students the processes of research and writing has been an issue for a long
time (Farber, 1999; Gardner & White-Farnham, 2013; Hardesty, 1995; Jacobs & Jacobs,
2009). However, librarians and professors both play a role in students learning the skills
necessary to understand the processes of research and writing (Gardner & WhiteFarnham, 2013). This resistance of professors to work with the librarian regarding

146

student learning of the processes of research and writing was prominent in my research
study. For example, Professor Paulette requested that instructional videos be made to
“not waste classroom time on certain topics”. In addition, Professor Paulette also
suggested, “having a list of what they need to know for the students, what can be done by
the teacher him or herself and what is left that really needs an expert”. Professor Oliver
also suggested that perhaps he should have left the “basics for the librarian to do”. Even
though there was a collaborative effort growing between Professor Fiora and myself, I
would not consider our expertise in the classroom instruction to be equal. For example,
in the first iteration I was not given a full class session to provide instruction with the
students. Likewise, in the second iteration I was only given full class sessions with the
students when Professor Fiora could not attend. All other one-on-one interactions either
occurred in the online forum or in the Research Assistance Program appointments.
Gardner and White-Farnham (2013) contend that “Promoting a process view of
information literacy instruction that includes the librarian in the planning of the course is
key to helping writing instructors appreciate a more integrated approach to information
literacy” (p. 236). Professor Fiora agrees with Gardner and White-Farnham (2013) in the
need to create a more integrated approach to information literacy.
For as long as I have been teaching it, librarians have always been adjunct to the
course, and students have interacted with library faculty ‘outside’ of the regular
course delivery. But putting the library instruction peripheral to ‘substantive’
course content risks teaching or modeling to students that librarians are
peripheral, and/or that the research process itself is extra-curricular.

147

Overall the findings of my study suggested that an integrated approach to
library instruction can influence student learning. For an integrated approach to library
instruction to occur there needs to be a relationship between the professor and the
librarian, collaboration between the professor and the librarian and an understanding of
the role of the librarian in classroom instruction as it relates to the processes of research
and writing.
5.6 Relating Findings to Theoretical Framework
Findings from my study inform the following design principals that are necessary
for the integration of library instruction into courses to influence student learning of
scholarly writing. Library instruction first should be designed collaboratively with the
professor and the librarian to align with course objectives and assignments. Library
instruction should also be designed using the Framework as this allows for librarians to
introduce the concept of metacognition, which will provide a deeper learning of the
concepts discussed during library instruction sessions. Integrating research consultations
into a writing course allows for students to be given one-on-one feedback and advice
which may also improve their understanding of the process of research and writing. With
the inclusion of metacognition into library instruction, the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework can be used to inform the design of library instruction.
Through the findings of my study, as well as from other research (Rapchak,
2016), it became clear that students desire a personal connection with a librarian. Both
the one-shot approach and the embedded librarian approach provide different obstacles
to the development of a personal connection between a student and a librarian. As found
in my research study, the ‘one-shot session’ approach did not provide enough interaction

148

between the librarian and the students to allow for a relationship to be built. While the
embedded librarian approaches developed in my research study did allow for more
personal connections to be built between the librarian and the students it may not be a
sustainable model as time and staffing issues are a factor in how widely this approach can
be implemented. However, based on the findings of this study, I do suggest that the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework can be used to design library instruction
that allows for the development of a more engaging learning environment. I suggest that
this can be done through the inclusion of the online forum which connects students to the
librarian throughout the semester as well as through the inclusion of research
consultations, such as the Research Assistance Program.
As noted by Stenbom, Jannson, and Hulkko (2016), the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework “has predominantly been used only to examine learning within a
group of several students and one or more teachers” (p. 37). Stenbom et al. (2016)
contend that “in modern education, large-scale instruction is sometimes combined with
more exclusive one-to-one, tutoring-oriented activities” (p. 37). The ‘partially embedded
librarian’ and ‘fully embedded librarian’ approaches of my study provided the most
indications of the three presences of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework.
Research consultations were used most with the students of the ‘fully embedded
librarian’ approach. It is in the ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach that the concept of
building a relationship with the librarian appears to have the greatest influence on student
success in understanding the process of research and writing. Stenbom, Hrastinski, and
Cleveland-Innes (2012) and Stenbom et al. (2016) have adapted the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework for an online coaching setting by including an emotional

149

presence element. This theoretical framework that they have presented is titled the
Relationship of Inquiry framework (Stenbom et al., 2016). However, based on the results
of this study, I suggest that the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework can be used
as is to inform library instruction which includes one-on-one instruction activities. I
argue that the emotional presence is already included within the Social Presence element.
I do not think it is the only way that the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework can inform library instruction. I suggest that the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework can also influence the design of library instruction through
the collaborative efforts of the professor and a librarian. This collaborative effort can
be guided by the seven principals of practice for a Community of Inquiry. The seven
principals are:
1. Plan for the creation of open communication and trust
(social presence);
2. Plan for the critical reflection and discourse (cognitive presence);
3. Establish community and cohesion (social presence);
4. Establish inquiry dynamics (cognitive presence);
5. Sustain respect and responsibility (cognitive presence);
6. Sustain inquiry that moves to resolution (cognitive presence);
7. Ensure assessment is congruent with intended processes
and outcomes. (Garrison, 2016, p. 88)
Using these seven principals to guide the collaborative effort between a professor
and a librarian may eliminate underlying assumptions a professor has on the value of a
librarian as their role relates to student learning. The following figure 5.1 is a pictorial

150

image of the design of library instruction within the Community of Inquiry
theoretical framework.

Figure 5.1: Library instruction using the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework (adapted from the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework, (Garrison,
2016, p. 59))
A combination of the Framework, assessment, assignments, collaboration, instruction
videos, and research consultations should be developed into a curriculum for integrating
library instruction into course content using the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework to influence student learning on the processes of research and writing. Further
research should be conducted by librarians to verify that the Community of

151

Inquiry theoretical framework can be used to inform library instruction within face-toface instruction opportunities enhanced with technology.
5.7 Implications of Findings
5.7.1 Research. Bowler and Large (2008) suggest that librarians are concerned
with how theory and practice connect in relationship to their services and resources.
Bowler and Large (2008) argue that the goals of a design-based research study in both the
educational field and library and information science are the same:
•

Educational research: develop educational technologies that have been informed
by theoretical frameworks

•

Library and information sciences research: develop information products and
services and building theory around these products and services about how
people interact with the information. (p. 40)
My design-based research study explores how the design of library instruction

can influence student learning of scholarly writing in higher education using the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. My study addresses a gap that was
discovered through the research presented in the literature review, namely the use of the
Community of Inquiry theoretical framework to inform the design of library instruction.
It appears to date that few or no studies document the attempt to use the Community of
Inquiry theoretical framework to inform the design of library instruction developed
through the Framework. However, Rapchak (2016) argues for the use of the Community
of Inquiry theoretical framework in online [library] instruction as it will create an
“environment that engages students and promotes deep learning” (p. 7). The engagement

152

of students and deep learning are key components of the Framework. Although the first
iteration of the study was not designed with the use of the Framework, glimpses of the
elements of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework were seen in the ‘fully
embedded librarian’ section. Through collaborating on a curriculum redesign, Professor
Fiora and I used the Framework and included an online forum which appeared to have
helped to create a community of learners. More research needs to be conducted to
evaluate how the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework can inform face-to-face
and blended library instruction.
I recommend another iteration of my research study be conducted. I suggest that
Professor Fiora and I consider carefully all the following suggestions for further
modification of the embedded librarian approach and implement an innovative design.
First, I suggest including the students’ weekly journal entries as a data collection method.
This was not done during the second iteration and I was not able to analyze the content to
see if the inclusion of the journal entries helps to create a community of learners. These
entries could also shed some light as to what part of the design and delivery of library
instruction is improving student learning. Second, I also recommend that Stewart and
Broussard’s (2016) version of the research summary be used as a data collection method.
More information was gathered from Frank’s research summary which reflected Stewart
and Broussard’s (2016) research summary in relation to what students learned about the
process of research and writing as well as what students thought of the embedded
librarian experience. Third, I recommend continued use of the student questionnaires
from the first iteration as these can provide insights on the design of library instruction.
The student questionnaires provided rich data that was useful in learning how library

153

instruction influenced student learning that the processes of research and writing were
connected. The last recommendation I suggest is to consider the inclusion of either the
SOLO, content-mapping, or test blueprinting instruments mentioned by Rourke and
Kanuka (2009) to more clearly indicate if deep and meaningful learning occurred in the
class that adopts the ‘fully embedded librarian’ approach. These suggested changes can
provide an alternative design to the librarian being fully embedded in the classroom
throughout the semester. Providing a fresh design for library instruction may help the
librarian to be able to understand what allows students and professors to understand the
role of the librarian as well as what prompts relationships to be built with the librarian.
Additional data collection methods would be added to determine how the Community
of Inquiry theoretical framework informs information literacy.
Two additional research ideas might be pursued for campuses which are exploring
how the design of library instruction influences student learning of scholarly writing.
Through the results of this study it has become clear that this campus needs to identify
from the faculty viewpoint what they consider the librarian’s role is in relationship to
student learning of scholarly writing. The research also uncovers a connection between
relationship building and an increase in the use of library resources by students. Further
research that focused on exploring the comfort level of students with librarians in
relationship to research skills would help libraries build services and outreach activities to
support relationship building.
5.7.2 Practice. Libraries are currently faced with proving their value in relation to
student learning in higher education (Gardner & White-Farnham, 2013). There are some
individuals in the higher education community who do not clearly understand the role

154

that librarians play in relation to student learning (Gardner & White-Farnham, 2013).
Many librarians hold the rank of faculty however classroom instructors do not always
consider them to be of equal faculty rank (Gardner & White-Farnahm, 2013). Some
classroom instructors tend to underestimate and undervalue a librarian’s ability to
teach (Gardner & White-Farnham, 2013). Librarians contribute to student learning by
providing resources and information literacy instruction (Gardner & White-Farnham,
2013).
5.7.2.1 Local Implications. Based on this design-based research, I present several
recommendations for the design of library instruction that focuses on the integration of
library instruction in the hopes of making research an integral process to writing. In this
section, I offer specific recommendations for integrating library instruction into the
‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course from the perspective of the students,
professors, and the librarian. In addition, I offer some suggestions for improving the
overall influence of library instruction on student learning.
Students provided suggestion for further improvements of the design of
embedding a librarian into the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course. The first
recommendation from the students was in relation to citing sources. Students suggested
including a full lecture from the librarian during which she provides instruction on how
to properly cite within the research paper and for the bibliography. A second request was
for more instruction on the use of keywords in relationship to database searching. Finally,
all students were in favor of including research consultations with the librarian as part of
the course. Students recommended that they needed to have one-on-one time with

155

the librarian before commitment day as well as before the second draft of the research
paper is required to be turned in.
The professors of the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audience’ courses who were
involved in this study recommend that a list of library skills necessary for students to
know be developed. Professors also recommend that this list of necessary library skills
for students be organized into the following categories: 1) skills that can be self-taught,
2) skills that can be taught by the professor, and 3) skills that must be taught by the
librarian. Professors also recommended that instructional videos be developed for topics
that do not require coverage in class, such as how to create an EBSCO account. Without
naming it, the professors’ recommendations about video instruction for students prior to
or outside of class is related to a flipped learning design. As presented in chapter two,
research on the flipped classroom approach demonstrates that it allows for more social
interactions in the classroom (Arnold-Garza, 2014; Becker, 2013; Datig & Ruswick,
2013; Fawley, 2014; Hersey & Belcher, 2013-2014; Obradovich, et al., 2015). Flipping
the classroom allows for students to increase their metacognition on core concepts as
they review the items individually and then in active learning activities with the librarian
and/or professor of the class (Arnold-Garza, 2014; Becker, 2013; Datig & Ruswick,
2013; Fawley, 2014; Hersey & Belcher, 2013-2014; Obradovich et al., 2015). Professor
Fiora has also recommended that we continue to work collaboratively together to find an
integrated library instruction program that works well for both the professors and the
librarians.
Based on the study findings, prior research, and my immersive experience of
being fully embedded into one of the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ sections for two

156

semesters, I make several recommendations for further embedding of librarians into this
course. The first item that should be included is introducing the students to the library
and the librarian during the first week of the class. After the first group presentations, a
class session introducing students to the concept of plagiarism and why they need to cite
should occur. Instruction should also be given during the class session on how to create
in text-citations and bibliographies. The online forum appears to hold potential in
creating a community of learners and I recommend exploring the concept further. I am
interested in evaluating whether having a requirement that students attend a research
consultation with the librarian before they commit to their topic makes a difference to
the types of topics that are chosen. I recommend that a class session on writing a
literature review be co-taught by the professor and the librarian before the first draft of
the paper is due. An invitation for the librarian to attend class during the weeks that
students give presentations is recommended as it appears to help the librarian get to
know the student better as well as to better understand their research interests. I also
recommend that the librarian continue to provide feedback on student work. However,
an explanation needs to be provided in the syllabus on the content reviewed by the
librarian and the professor to make grading and reporting processes clear to students.
While it is important to continue to try innovative ideas at the course level, I also
recommend that the library staff work on the overall instruction program. Therefore, I
suggest that a sustainable design for library instruction be developed given the number of
course sections, students and librarians. I also recommend enhancing the Research
Assistance Program using undergraduate students using the peer learning theory
(O’Kelly, Garrison, Merry, & Torreano, 2015). Another suggestion is to develop a

157

campus wide library instruction program. The professors of the ‘Writing for Scholarly
Audiences’ course wondered at times what other professors expect students to already
know about the processes of research and writing. The development of a campus wide
instruction program could help other professors to understand the role of the learning that
occurs during the ‘Writing for Scholarly Audiences’ course as it relates to the process of
research and writing. Lesson plans could also be developed or modified to include inclass activities connected to the six frames in the Framework. Last, but certainly not
least, I recommend developing faculty workshops geared towards understanding and
promoting the role of librarians in enhancing student learning.
5.7.2.2 Global Practice Implications. In my personal experience at three different
libraries, it appears to be the case that library instruction is specific to the dynamics of
each institution (White, 2016). However, both librarians and professors can learn from
the examples of other institutions. For example, reviewing the experience of librarians
who attempt the fully embedded approach in a writing course at one institution can either
provide support for or against the concept at another institution. Another example of how
other institutions can use this experience is to perhaps gain additional ideas of ways to
integrate library instruction into a writing course.
Literature indicates that libraries have been researching their role in student
learning for several years (Hufford, 2013; Oakleaf, 2015; Salisbury et al., 2012; Tucci,
2011). Professors may want to work more directly with librarians if they understand how
librarians can contribute to student learning. Creating a collaborative environment
between librarians and professors may improve the integration of library instruction into

158

the classroom therefore having a greater chance of influencing student learning of
scholarly writing.
Librarians can take several key points away from my research study. Firstly,
library instruction should be responsive to the needs of the students. Secondly, I believe
that the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework can help in designing library
instruction that is responsive and adaptable to what the students want to know and the
ever-changing learning environment. However, the details of the actual content of library
instruction will differ depending on the course content. Lastly, it is clear from my study
that librarians need to work more closely with professors to design assignments relevant
both to content and library research as well as providing guidance and assistance through
one-on-one consultations.
5.8 Conclusion
Chapter one of this research study introduced the problem that this research study
sought to address. Firstly, a single in-class instructional session does not give librarians
enough time to teach library instruction with any depth for students in a course
(Tumbleson & Burke, 2010; Walker & Pearce, 2014). Second, it is hard to provide
individualized instruction to a student within an instructional session that is delivered to
an entire class (Bash, 2015; Yi, 2003). However, as the research study progressed, the
problem evolved to become how can library instruction be integrated into a writing
course to teach students that the processes of research and writing are connected?
Chapter two connected the Information Literacy Standards, Framework
for Information Literacy in Higher Education, metaliteracy, threshold concepts,
collaboration between librarians and faculty, one-shot sessions, and research

159

consultations to the teaching presence of the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework. Chapter two also connected embedded librarianship and the flipped
classroom to the social presence of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework.
The final connection made in chapter two was to connect metacognition to the cognitive
presence in the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework. Chapter three described in
detail the design-based research methodology and data collection methods for my study.
I also described the process I used to come up with my own codebook (see Table 4.2).
The following themes emerged from the data and were discussed in chapter four:
•

Library Instruction: Increase in confidence, Relationship building, Librarianas-a-resource, Timing of instruction, Role of librarian, Benefits of the
embedded librarian approach

•

Community of Inquiry theoretical framework: Exploration, Integration,
Resolution, Open Communication, Group Cohesion, Building
Understanding, Direct Instruction.

Chapter five discussed the findings as they related to theory and literature and I proposed
a new model for library instruction using the Community of Inquiry theoretical
framework.
I have learned so much from this academic endeavored. I strongly believe that
designed-based research should be used as a methodology to study library instruction
because it allows librarians and professors to work together to develop a theory and
practice that can be tested in the naturalistic setting. There is still much work to be done
in studying how to integrate library instruction into writing classrooms to help influence
student learning of the processes of research and writing. Part of that work comes with

160

assessing student learning and I believe the key to this is as Rourke and Kanuka (2009)
describes them: 1) assess students in appropriate ways, 2) reduce content, and 3) confront
students’ misconceptions. Collaboration between librarians and professor is the
beginning place to start developing an integrated approach to library instruction.
