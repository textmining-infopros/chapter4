FROM LIBRARIAN TO PROFICIENT MANAGER:
THE JOURNEY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY FRONT-LINE MANAGERS
Michele A. Leininger, PhD
University of Pittsburgh, 2014

This study of the transition of public librarians to front-line managers and how they build
proficient knowledge, skills, and behaviors describes the context in which the managers learn,
adapt, and grow as well as their internal analyses and syntheses that led to observable and
demonstrable actions and serves as a critical foundational step in public library management
research that does not currently exist. As a qualitative descriptive case study with embedded
subunits, this research was designed to unpack the steps participants took in learning to become
managers, as well as how they interacted with colleagues and the organization to become
proficient.
The case study involved twenty-one participants from a population of 30 managers at the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and was conducted in two phases. In phase one, participants
responded to three structured diary entries; in phase two, the researcher conducted two in-depth
interviews with ten participants chosen from phase one. Diary entries and interview transcripts
were coded using Descriptive Coding as well as Provisional Coding based on two business
studies. Hill’s Becoming a Manager and McCall, Lombardo, and Morrison’s Lessons of
Experience provided a conceptual framework; the study findings, however, revealed two
important differences: managers universally expressed pride, love of job, and service to others
and affirmed the community’s role as a motivating factor.
iv

The primary outcome of the study was the profiles created of the ten in-depth
interviewees describing their journeys from librarian to proficient manager. The narratives and
data reveal that gaining knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become a proficient manager is
multifaceted and complex. While there were an array of answers as unique as the individuals
who participated, there were some similarities: observing and identifying models (former bosses,
current supervisors, administrators, or peers), capitalizing on and learning from previous
experiences, and actively working to become proficient particularly in areas that are personally
difficult.
The uniqueness of this study is that it provides one of the first glimpses into the day-today nature of the complexity of the public library environment in which managers must learn to
operate successfully.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

THE PRACTITIONER’S CONTEXT WITHIN THE RESEARCH

In an issue of Library Journal’s Academic Newswire e-newsletter, columnist Steven Bell
discusses the issue of library leadership. Provocatively entitled, “There’s No Such Thing as
Library Leadership,” Bell (2013) posits that “[l]eadership is leadership,” regardless of whether
employed in a library or business organization. (p. 1) Referring to a leadership workshop
attendee’s comment on an evaluation that “[t]here is a big difference between running Apple and
running a library,” Bell (2013) lays out the leadership differences, such as dealing with
competitors like Samsung and supply chain management versus service development for a
specific community and making new content accessible, but states that “...when it comes to being
a leader, there are surely many more similarities than differences.” (p. 1) He goes beyond just
accepting a universal view of leadership, regardless of the work managed and the type of
organization in which it is done, to encourage library leaders to find and apply those examples of
good leadership practices from business to “reinforce the principle and demonstrate that business
practices are relevant to libraries.” (Bell, 2013, p.2)

1

Bell, however, refers to a number of traditional management tasks and practices while
discussing the universality of leadership. As the literature review in Chapter 2 shows, leadership
and management have become entwined, to the point there appears to be no perceivable
difference in practice:
Certainly, there are technical differences [Bell is referring to running Apple and running a
library]... [but] you still need to have a process to make the decisions that establish your
priorities as a leader… If you manage people...you still need to apply management theory. Open
any book whose title claims it is about library leadership and you’ll find chapters about human
resources, strategic planning, budgeting, motivating staff, organizational structure and change,
organizing teams, or any of the other myriad tasks associated with leadership. (Bell, 2013, p.1)
At the heart of this study is the attempt to understand and describe how management and
leadership operate in the day-to-day professional lives and activities of front-line public library
managers. Like Bell, there are a number of people (e.g., library administrators, consultants,
researchers, LIS educators, continuing education providers) who stress the importance of
leadership in libraries. Yet, there is no preponderance of data or research that even describes
what “leadership” looks like in action, particularly among those who are not library directors or
administrators. Similarly, there are few research studies that describe the work actions and
activities of front-line public library managers, as the literature review shows.
However, there is some data and research that focus on these topics of leadership and
director-level work as described through competency lists that can help practitioners and
researchers better understand the nature of work for those who manage libraries.
Notwithstanding this small amount of research and literature in this area of public library
management, none reveals how the knowledge, skills, and behaviors are acquired and put into

2

service. Thus, this dissertation research focuses on discovering and describing the thoughts,
processes, and actions entailed in a public librarian becoming a proficient manager.
The worldview and approach embodied in this study focus on discovering the “how” and
“why” of the events from librarian to manager rather than on the events themselves. The
discovery of how this journey happens coupled with knowing both the “how” and the “why” can
make a critical difference in public library management given its growing complexity as a public
organization and the necessity of its continued success in wide variety of communities. Thus,
the worldview and approach of this study do not abide by any specific disciplinary approach nor
does the study comply with tools or actions of a specific academic school. Instead, the study
design endeavors to describe the “how” and “why” of the transitions public librarians make
when becoming proficient managers: “In the one world of ideas there are no barriers to trade or
to travel. Each discipline may take from others techniques, concepts, laws, data, models,
theories, or explanations — in short, whatever it finds useful in its own inquiries.” (Kaplan,
1964, p. 4)
Following Kaplan’s sage advice, the research is a descriptive case study with embedded
subunits that uncovers the personal approaches, processes, and transformations of a specific
group of front-line public library managers working for a specific public library have had or are
currently having while moving from the position of librarian to one of proficient manager. The
outcomes of the study focus on the narratives of both the individuals involved as well as on the
library organization as an important and critical participant in this journey from librarian to
proficient manager. Thus, in the pages that follow, the report details the specifics of the study
and the reasoning behind the research choices made to fully understand this transformation and
contribute to the knowledge of managing a public library today.

1.1.1

Personal Statement: A Phenomenon Observed

Throughout my twenty-year career as a librarian and manager in public libraries, I have always
been interested in helping customers and staff learn whether a new skill to get a better job, new
knowledge to make a life-impacting decision, or for a variety of other reasons people seek
information to learn. Early on, as I thought about my own career path, I began to apply that
desire to help others learn to my own journey, trying to determine the best way to become a
manager and learn the knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary for success in managerial
positions. Through various conversations about my career options with a number of people, as
well as the good fortune to have several instrumental mentor-managers, I was able to chart a
course that kept me growing and learning in each position I held in every organization I worked
for. Through these conversations and my own observations, however, I was very aware that
making the transition from librarian to manager was not going to be as easy as those transitions I
had previously made to new positions, job responsibilities, and locations. In fact, my primary
observation was that most often, the transition from librarian to manager was a singular, difficult
journey without much direct support, training, or coaching.
As I have observed and spoken with other managers as they struggle with this transition
from librarian to manager (and are often still struggling years after becoming a manager or
supervisor for the first time), I have tried to determine the most effective combination of training,
support, and self-direction that would ease the transition and increase the percentage of
successful transitions. Part of it is altruistic because I want these managers to succeed for their
own sakes. More importantly, however, I want them to succeed because of the high cost to staff
and the organization as a whole when they do not. I have seen and experienced both complete
failure on the part of a new manager to make the transition successfully as well as the
4

significantly long time needed for manager to make the transition completely. The cost is the
same: years of recovery for the staff, the management team, and sometimes even the library
customers themselves depending on how public and absolute the failure was.
Thus, it is at this intersection of management and adaptation and growth where my
interest lies and has for a significant part of my career. My transition to a manager was so
different from most of my colleagues and peers that I find myself asking other managers about
their experiences, especially those who appear to be very successful in their roles as senior
managers and directors, and about how they gained the knowledge, skills, and behaviors
necessary to succeed and move through the public library leadership pipeline. Many of these
conversations focused on the difficulty and “lessons learned” during their first management
positions, which the majority claimed to have acquired “accidentally.” With no early thought of
being or becoming a manager or director in a public library, most seem to have fallen into
management and had to struggle to gain the knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to do the
job well, while trying to do the work of the job itself.

It is mostly with pride that they recount

what sounds oddly like a hazing ritual of being thrown into management or supervisory
situations without much knowledge or support, or even clear expectations from their own
supervisors. Yet, they come through having gained experience (and a few scars) and a survivor’s
sense of accomplishment. Moreover, a surprising number continue the survival-of-the-fittest
scenario with those they hire, basically saying that they were able to figure it out and succeed so
others who are worthy should be able to do the same. When pressed about this, however, almost
all acknowledge that it is not really the way to “grow” managers, and they find many are
learning the “wrong” lessons in potentially detrimental ways. Furthermore, they often agree that

5

there must be a “better way” to hire, train, coach, and support managers but no one has yet
figured out exactly what that might be.

1.2

WHY THE “ACCIDENTAL” PUBLIC LIBRARY MANAGER MODEL OF THE
PAST HAS NO FUTURE

Public library staff has been at the forefront of the changing technological landscape, not only as
it has changed how they do their own work, but also as public library customers need help in
learning these new technologies for both their work and personal lives. Thus, librarians and
other staff are constantly learning about these new technologies, as they impact how they do their
jobs, what services they provide, and how they help customers who are also trying to learn these
new technologies. (Kajberg, 1997; Partridge, 2010) Library staff now seem to be in a constant
state of changing tasks that require updated knowledge, skills, and behaviors. (Gonzalez, 2010)
Front-line public library managers, in particular, have acutely felt this pressure of needing to
update their own technological skills continually to help and coach staff with ongoing learning.
Moreover, these managers are in positions for which it is unlikely they were prepared and which
demanded that they learn completely new knowledge, skills, and behaviors that they did not
build as librarians. (ALSC Managing Children’s Services Committee, 2007; Harris, 2011)
Further, with all the pressures that public libraries face, managers need to adapt and change as
managers, not just as librarians. (Haycock, 2011; Lubbers, 2004)

Hill (2004) states that

“research…has made it clear that managers on the front line…are critically important to
sustaining quality, service, innovation, and financial performance.” (p. 123) It is this stress on
managerial responsibilities, even at the lowest levels of management, that has driven the
6

evolution of duties and tasks that, in turn, has demanded constant growth of the management
skill-set.
Unlike technology and other learning for front-line staff, public library managers do not
have as many opportunities for formal learning to grow their skill-set; furthermore, they may not
have been taught management basics while pursuing their master’s degrees. (Mackenzie &
Smith, 2009) Thus, they are left on their own to identify and learn what they need to be
successful. (Hill, 2003, 2004; van der Sluis, et al., 2002; Longenecker, 2010) Moreover, these
changes have demanded that managers further develop “soft skills” (defined as learned traits that
are relationship-based and include coaching, leadership, team-building, and communication) and
self-knowledge to be successful in the new environment. Hill’s (2004) research has borne this
out: “With the increased need to…build and lead effective teams capable of adapting and
innovating, it is the human competencies required for management that have become especially
important…[and can only be obtained through] self-awareness, empathy, discipline, and
practice.” (p. 124) Yet, these relationship skills are very difficult to learn and apply, happening
slowly over time and only with concerted effort. However, given all these difficulties and
obstacles, managers still learn, adapt, and grow. (Hill, 2003; Dechant, 1999; Ellinger, 2005)

1.3

GROWING COMPLEXITY OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY REQUIRES A NEW
TYPE OF MANAGER

Moreover, what managers need to know, do, and resolve in their day-to-day activities has
become somewhat of a moving target. Public libraries have become increasingly complex
organizations, requiring more time and attention from managers at all levels. Today, they have a
7

number of demands for their attention and resources. The diversity of American society, the
increase in unfunded mandates from government agencies, the speed of technological advances,
slow economic recovery from the last recession, and even globalization have all contributed to
the changing roles and responsibilities of a public library to the community it serves. Gone are
the days when strategic planning exercises could help a public library focus on no more than two
or three main objectives that could satisfy the majority of the population that it served. As Berry
told readers in his 2006 Library Journal column, “There are many other roles that can and
should be added to the public library mission. We cannot simply focus on one or two and
capture wide public support… I think our slogan should be ‘the public library, something for
everyone’.” (p. 10)
As public libraries have tried to address the growing variety of needs from both
individuals and the community, an ever-changing technological landscape coupled with demands
of customers and the uncertainty of its budget balanced with the community’s economic health,
the complexity of its organization has increased. There are many more “moving parts” in
operating a public library — a more diverse population to serve; more services to provide; a
wider variety of technologies to make available; more funding streams to pay attention to and
know about; increasing pressure for more programming; a variety of local, state, and national
partnerships to engage in; and marketing, public relations, and advocacy to deploy. There are
also vigorous professional discussions, such as the true mission of the public library, the angst
over the application of business practices, and the role of the public librarian in today’s society,
that at the very least need to be paid attention to, if not participated in.
This growing complexity of the public library organization must be addressed amid
significant decreases in funding and operating resources. In fiscal year 2012, more than half of

8

U.S. public libraries reported budgets that either decreased or remained flat; for the third year in
a row 40% of states reduced their contribution to libraries; and full-time equivalent staff have
decreased more than 7% over the last three years. (Hoffman, et. al., 2012, p. 11) As local and
state budgets have shrunk, mainly because of fewer tax dollars being collected and distributed, so
too have most public library budgets. Directors, managers, library boards, and advocates have
worked to at least maintain funding while staff has tried to maintain and in some areas, such as
workforce help, increase services.
A complex organization like a public library needs to be operated in very specific ways
by managers who understand this complexity. It is this increasing complexity that suggests the
“accidental” manager concept so much an integral part of public library management in the past
has no place in the future.

Public libraries must be operated by managers, particularly those

who manage front-line and public services staff and interact most frequently with a variety of
community members, who are interested and engaged in management best practices and debates,
and not just those of librarianship. Thus, public libraries as organizations need and deserve
managers who have planned and worked to become managers, not just who have “accidentally”
happened into these positions.

1.4

LACK OF RESEARCH IN PUBLIC LIBRARY MANAGEMENT

In the face of this growing complexity of the public library organization, there is a remarkable
lack of research in public library management, particularly as it applies to managers. For the
most part, research has focused primarily on the work and tasks of management (e.g., budgeting,
collection development, community partnerships).
9

When it has focused on the managers

themselves, most studies look at only at the top position, most often referred to as the public
library director. Furthermore, many of these studies have focused not on the day-to-day work of
directors or how they operate, but on the qualities of leadership in particular. There seems,
however, to be a profession-wide confusion between leadership and management, with many
studies reflecting this confusion by stating that there is a clear distinction between the two while
the profession itself seems to use the words (and the actions behind them) interchangeably.
Unfortunately, the few studies that have been conducted in the area of public library managers
have become a disservice to the operations of public libraries by focusing on what appears to be
an academic argument with little meaning for practitioners.

Instead, the library field and

researchers would be better served by looking at leadership and management together to see how
leadership works within the specific framework of management (in which the profession
presumes it is embedded anyway), rather than to continue to argue about and systematically
attempt to make distinctions between the two. Studying how the two work together would allow
a stronger formulation of best practices of leadership applications within management. This is
particularly needed because the public library as an organization continues to become more
complex and operating one takes a wider array of knowledge, skills, and behaviors than ever
before.
The literature review in the following chapter focuses on articles (many of which look at
libraries generically or at libraries of all types) that have attempted to make these distinctions and
a few studies that have ultimately bypassed the argument by combining the two to show that
practicing managers do not see a distinction between leading and managing and use both
together to get the work done. This concentration on the singular discussion and study of
leadership comes at the detriment of any widespread studies of managers themselves, including

10

their work, attitudes, and behaviors, particularly in the public library field. Furthermore, whether
because of the current fascination with leadership or because all public libraries have an
identifiable director, most studies that do look at management personnel focus only on the top
position ignoring other levels of managers.
Of these studies that have looked at management positions, the majority have adopted a
competency-based approach, examining these top positions without much discussion or debate
on the worthiness of the competency model. The literature review briefly addresses the debate of
competency models in business, as well as reviews competency models developed for the
American Library Association (ALA) and those developed through research. Many of these
studies (both leadership-targeted and competency-based) call for stronger development of leaders
and managers through library and information science (LIS) education and a few studies evaluate
LIS management courses and continuing education opportunities.

1.5

U.S. METROPOLITAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES

What these studies (both leadership and competency) fail to recognize, however, is that for many
public libraries, it is not just the director who acts as a manager but, in fact, many staff members
oversee other staff as well as day-to-day operations. Public libraries, particularly those operating
in U.S. metropolitan areas, generally have organizations large enough to have multiple levels of
managers within the organization. In fact, the locale code, which is used in the Institute of
Library and Museum Services’ (IMLS) Public Libraries Survey that collected statistics for fiscal
year 2011, showed 28% of libraries fall into the city or suburb category (as identified by the U.S.
Census); further, when towns are also taken into account (absenting only the rural categories),
11

52.3% of libraries are included. (Swan, et. al., 2013, p. 133) Although there is a smaller
percentage of libraries serving metropolitan areas, the 2010 Census found that 80.7% of the
population lives in these urban areas, which are identified by the U.S. Census as communities
over 50,000. (Lambert, 2012)
Therefore, with approximately half or fewer of the public libraries serving the vast
majority of the population, it logically makes sense that these libraries (whether single buildings
or multiple branch systems) have deeper layers and larger numbers of managers beyond the
director. Because of this, a strong argument can be made that managers other than the director
should be studied to see how these staff members operate, learn, adapt, grow, and move along
the managerial ladder to higher-level executive and administrative positions. That is not what
has happened in the field of public library management research. Instead, the focus has been on
the work being done or, when focused on the managers themselves, directed at the top position.
This focus has produced lists of qualities, characteristics, and/or competencies, some of which
are discussed in this study. There are two studies that explored managers at lower levels in the
public library organization but these also focused on creating lists and measuring managers
against those lists, bypassing the experiences and stories of the managers themselves.

1.6

LOOKING TO OTHER FIELDS OF RESEARCH

As there are so few articles that focus on non-director managers in public libraries, two major
studies from business (Hill and McCall, et. al.) that have looked at people in varying
management positions, gathering a broader, more holistic view of the individual work entailed in
becoming and acting as a manager, and the learning and changes necessary at different
12

transitions in a management career are discussed.

These two studies form the conceptual

framework for this study and provide an opportunity for comparing the outcomes of how public
library managers, especially those in first-level management positions who manage the day-today work and activities of front-line staff, become managers with those in the business field who
have experienced the journey from producers to managers.
Finding the most appropriate methodological approach and tools, then, is critical to
gathering the best data from the most pertinent sample. Without such care to methodological fit,
the study is at best anecdotally interesting and at worst irrelevant. Edmondson and McManus
(2007) “define methodological fit as internal consistency among elements of a research project.”
(p. 1155) Further, “in well-integrated field research the key elements are congruent and mutually
reinforcing.” (Edmondson & McManus, 2007, p. 1156) Thus, “the key to good research lies not
in choosing the right method, but rather in asking the right question and picking the most
powerful method for answering that particular question.” (Bouchard as quoted by Edmondson &
McManus, 2007, p. 1157) They establish a framework for management research, arguing that
research falls along a continuum, from mature theory at one end and nascent theory at the other,
with intermediate theory sitting half way between the two. (Edmondson & McManus, 2007, p.
1158) Edmondson and McManus (2007) argue that, “in general, the less known about a specific
topic, the more open-ended the research questions, requiring methods that allow data collected in
the field to strongly shape the researcher’s developing understanding of the phenomenon.” (p.
1159) In particular, studies that involve nascent theory, in which the phenomenon to be explored
in this study firmly sits and as the scarce amount of literature will attest to, focus on questions
that attempt to understand how processes unfold, where little understanding of the variables

13

involved prevent the formulation of scientific hypotheses, and need “rich, detailed, and evocative
data…to shed light on the phenomenon.” (Edmondson & McManus, 2007, pp. 1161-1162)

1.7

RESEARCH STATEMENT

Thus, the growing complexity of the public library organization, the ever-changing nature of the
work of public library managers, and the lack of research findings to help direct organizations,
professional associations, LIS graduate programs, and the public library managers themselves
reveal the necessity for research in this area. Furthermore, as the literature review shows, there
is no holistic view of the public library manager’s experiences, particularly those who manage
front-line staff in branches and public service departments.

Without their viewpoints,

experiences described, and “lessons learned” revealed, more specific research is difficult to
conduct and assess because it must rely heavily on the assumptions of those experiences, often
presuming management experiences are universal, whether taken from non-public library
managers’ experiences (such as academic or special library managers) or non-library managers’
experiences (such as those in businesses or public administration).
Therefore, this qualitative descriptive case study studies how front-line public library
managers (defined as managers with a graduate degree from a LIS program who supervise staff
that serve the public) gain knowledge and proficiency in management work and begins to lay an
important and needed foundation in the area of public library management research.

The

research focuses on answering the following questions to reveal the managers’ stories,
experiences, and processes:

14

1. What are the most influential or impactful ways that public library managers gain
knowledge, proficiency, and/or expertise?
2. In their view, what are the critical knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to succeed
at being a public library manager?
3. How do public library managers view leadership and what role does it play in their work?
4. How do managers make meaning out of their challenges and experiences and apply the
lessons learned?
As the remaining chapters show, the methodological choices and the participants’ data reveal
aspects applicable to all four questions and describe the variety of ways in which librarians have
become proficient front-line public library managers.

DISSERTATION ORGANIZATION

This dissertation is organized into five chapters that follow the non-linear path of the research
while maintaining the common dissertation presentation. In this first chapter, the context of the
dissertation includes the personal observations and public library managerial experiences, the
growing complexity of public libraries, the concept of the “accidental” manager model, and the
lack of research about management in public libraries. In the second chapter, the Literature
Review focuses only on major studies in library management and leadership as well as select
studies in other fields and includes the two business studies that informed the conceptual
framework of this study. This literature review is designed to provide the context for the analysis
of data collected in this study. Some of this study’s research findings, thus, are included in when
they specifically relate and compare with the findings of the research highlighted in the literature
review and methodology chapters.

LITERATURE REVIEW

This chapter describes the context for this study and the literature that supports it.

2.1

THE LEADERSHIP DEBATE

The rise in the number of articles about the theories and outcomes of various studies in
leadership over the last decade has been no less a call to arms and a persistent insistence that
libraries of all types need strong leadership to navigate through budgets, funding issues, and
customer demands in the face of changing technological, fiscal, and political factors. Riggs’
2001 article, “The Crisis and Opportunities in Library Leadership” is one of the earliest and most
strident of these articles that call for increasing leadership in libraries. As many of these early
articles declare, “it is common to confuse management with leadership, not withstanding the fact
that both are necessary, management and leadership are two separate hemispheres,” and by
implication, never should the two meet. (Riggs, 2001, p. 6) The primary argument for this
separation is most often based on Warren Bennis’ list of distinctions between the two:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The manager administers; the leader motivates.
The manager is a copy; the leader is an original.
The manager focuses on systems and structure; the leader focuses on people.
The manager relies on control; the leader inspires trust.
The manager has a short-range view; the leader has a long-range perspective.
The manager asks how and when; the leader asks what and why.
16

•
•
•

The manager imitates; the leader originates.
The manager accepts the status quo; the leader challenges.
The manager does things right; the leader does the right thing. (Riggs, 2001, p. 6-7, as
quoted from Bennis’ book On Becoming a Leader)
To soften these disparaging statements about managers, Riggs (2001) hastens to add that

it “should not imply that one cannot be a good manager and a fine leader”; however, he must
believe many of them are not because he concludes “libraries are well managed but under-led.”
(p.7) Citing a lack of articles published without “leadership” in the title as an example, as well
as questioning why the Journal of Library Administration (in which his article was published)
does not change its name to the Journal of Library Leadership, Riggs (2001) imagines that
readers might “conclude that there is an unconscious conspiracy against library leadership and it
is leading to a potential crisis.” (p.8) Riggs (2001) then discusses a number of leadership myths,
such as only the head of the organization can be a leader and leaders are born not made, and
concludes that excellent leadership qualities are not always transportable because “the various
complexities of a given library situation will require a leader of a specific temperament, focus,
and charisma.” (p. 9)
The reason for Riggs’s call to arms is the changing times in which libraries find
themselves, mainly due to technology (and, although not mentioned in the article, soon due to
9/11, the War on Terror, and the inevitably changing society). Thus, “effective library leadership
is characterized in part by the ability to break away from established structures” and to “engage
in continuous improvement”; however, it is not just about reacting and accepting change, but
also anticipating and leading the change. (Riggs, 2001, p. 10)
Riggs leaves the reader with a list of the qualities library leaders now need, which are
vision, dreams, creativity, innovation/entrepreneurship, planning, courage, “getting the truth,”
trust, values, passion for one’s work, caring for followers, communication, transformation, and
17

inspiration/motivation. Describing each of these qualities (some in more detail than others) leads
Riggs to talk in general about developing library leaders with these qualities, which include
starting at the local level with the “head librarian” identifying potential leaders, looking to
consortia, regional networks, and various professional associations to provide more leadershipbased programs, specifically the Library Administration and Management Association (a
division of ALA , which later became the Library Leadership and Management Association
[LLAMA]) to serve in a “pivotal role” developing leaders, shifting their programs away from
management and toward building leadership. But Riggs (2001) insists that the first and largest
hurdle to overcome is to create a “clear differentiation between ‘management’ and ‘leadership.’
The differentiation cannot be over-emphasized; our tendency to refer to a program or session as
being related to ‘leadership’ when it is clearly ‘management’ is destructive to the advancement
of leadership.” (p. 15)

2.1.1

Leadership Competency Model

Riggs’ plea for “differentiation” seems to have fallen on deaf ears, as the number of articles and
studies that embrace the leadership concept either include management topics and issues or use
the words together or interchangeably. An example of this is from the development of core
leadership competencies as part of ALA’s 2008 Emerging Leaders program. Five members of
this class, along with a former LLAMA president who acted as mentor, were tasked with
reviewing the literature, interviewing current leaders in the profession for insights, and ultimately
creating a leadership competency model that was presented at the 2008 ALA conference.
(Ammons-Stephens, et. al., 2009, p. 63) The recommended model presented four general areas
of competencies (meta-competencies): cognitive ability, vision, interpersonal effectiveness, and
18

managerial effectiveness.

Personal attributes were included but separated from the meta-

competencies. Each meta-competency was divided into a total of seventeen areas of competence
(plus another five under the personal attributes). Finally, there were bulleted lists that further
explained each area. (see Table 1, as created from Ammons-Stephens, et. al., 2009)
Table 1. Areas of Leadership Competencies
MetaCompetencies

Cognitive
Ability

Interpersonal
Effectiveness

Managerial
Effectiveness

Personal
Attributes

Individual
Competencies

ProblemSolving

Global Thinking

Culturally
Competent

Manage

Reflective
Thinking

Forward
Thinking

Team Building

Strategic
Planning

Humble

Development

Collaboration

Gracious

Inspirational /
Motivational

Flexibility /
Adaptability

Teachable

Vision

Communication
Skills

What is most striking about this list is that, while the title of the article (“Developing
Core Leadership Competencies of the Library Profession”) implies that the leadership
competency model is for the entire profession, many of the categories and bullet points are
clearly meant for those in a position of traditional management. For example, under the metacompetency Interpersonal Effectiveness, the descriptions do not refer to self-development, but
rather to the development of others, which is typically the role of a manager. (AmmonsStephens, 2009, p. 69)

Furthermore, under this same meta-competency, a paragraph that

explains and justifies the inclusion of interpersonal effectiveness includes a quote from the
literature used to help build the model, underlining that these meta-competencies describe
19

management positions: “...[S]taff want to know that they can talk with their managers and feel
that they are really being heard and known as individuals.” (Ammons-Stephens, 2009, p.69)
Finally, the meta-competency Managerial Effectiveness has “managerial” included in its title,
although the authors explain that, “although leaders are not always in management positions, this
competency applies to everyone, as it involves managing oneself effectively in addition to others
and the organization.”

(Ammons-Stephens, 2009, p. 70)

Yet, the majority of individual

competencies, the bulleted lists, and further descriptions do suggest management positions.

2.1.2

ALA’s Core Competences of Librarianship

“Principled, transformational leadership” was the only addition to the Core Competences list that
came from the council floor during the discussion of its adoption at the 2009 ALA Midwinter
Meeting. Hicks and Given (2013) asked whether leadership was discussed by the task force, and
members replied that it was not: “Task force members described leadership as a skill best
developed outside the LIS programs through professional development and experience.” (p. 13)
Task force member Michael Gorman responded, “to my mind, leadership is not something you
know. It is an attribute, a quality. It can be developed. There’s a question about whether it can be
taught or not, in the way that administration can be taught.” (Hicks & Givens, 2013, p. 13)
Omitting leadership appeared as an oversight to LLAMA, and Charles Forrest, LLAMA’s
elected division councillor at the time, requested the addition from the floor. To those who
attended and were interviewed for the research, there was no discussion or debate around the
amendment, nor was it sent back to the task force for further discussion, and it passed quite
easily. (Hicks & Given, 2013, p. 14)

20

Interestingly, referencing Riggs’ article, Hicks and Given conclude that there is no real
meaningful difference between leadership and management with the placement of the leadership
amendment under the Administration and Management Competence.

In fact, “this

separation…is merely rhetorical, as the discourse of leadership implies that leaders must be in
positions of organizational influence to implement their visions and goals,” further confusing and
combining the two, rather than separating them distinctly. (Hicks & Given, 2013, p. 14)

2.1.3

Studies that Combine Leadership and Management

Other authors and researchers seem to have come to the same conclusion as Hicks and Given,
either using the terms interchangeably or embracing them both in a combined form. One
example can be found in Jordan’s (2012) article “Developing Leadership Competencies in
Librarians.” Although ‘manager’ or ‘management’ is not in her title, participants are referred to
as “manager-leaders” throughout the article. Furthermore, when reviewing the competency list
developed in her study, many competencies would be considered managerial in nature (e.g.,
resource management and customer service) and leadership is mentioned only once explicitly as
“demonstrating leadership,” described as “taking charge of situations effectively.” (Jordan, 2012,
p. 42)
Likewise, Chow and Rich’s (2013) study, which was part of a management class project
at the University of North Carolina—Greenboro’s LIS program, includes a literature review on
leadership and uses a number of leadership-type qualities in interviews of library administrators
who are identified and labeled as such in the article. (p. 6) It is unclear from where these
qualities came, how the list was developed, and what the students asked during the interviews to
obtain the data (only the assignment is included in the article).
21

The study included

administrators from all types of libraries, so while 114 administrators were interviewed, only 32
came from North Carolina public libraries. (Chow & Rich, 2013, p. 6) The research attempted
to discover which qualities were universal regardless of library type and which were dependent
on type of library. (Chow & Rich, 2013, p. 5) Furthermore, the interviews probed tasks that
administrators performed, helping to blur the lines between leadership and management further
in this study.
Two qualities that were deemed to be universal leadership qualities as cited most
frequently across types of libraries were empathy and vision. (Chow & Rich, 2013, p. 7) Chow
and Rich (2013) remark that these qualities fell into the Transformational Leadership and
Emotional Intelligence frameworks, both of which are often applied to determine levels of
leadership present. (p. 17-18) However, in reporting both the qualities and the tasks, the authors
use the phrase ‘leadership and management,’ not discerning between the two. Finally, what they
discover about public libraries was that these “leaders focus more outward onto the
community…and perform the usual tasks to maintain the smooth functioning of the
library…focus[ing] more upon their users, providing the service to support them and resources to
meet their information needs.” (Chow & Rich, 2013, p. 19)

Although not conducted as

traditional research because of the number of research assistants (students from the class), not
being well-grounded in the literature, not explaining how the categories reported were created,
what the interview questions were, or how the data were analyzed, the Chow and Rich study
does show some of the potential difficulties with discerning between leadership and management
by both researchers and subjects/practitioners.

22

2.1.4

The Practitioner’s View of Leadership and Management

No study reveals the practitioner view of leadership and management more clearly than Mullins
and Linehan’s (2006) research using thirty “top-level public librarians” from Britain, Ireland, and
the East coast of the United States published as the article “Are Public Libraries Led or
Managed?” (p. 237) Although this study includes librarians from outside the U.S., the findings
from the interviews about whether and how practicing library administrators viewed leadership
and management differently showed that 22 of the 30 did not find a difference, cutting across
nationality. (Mullins & Linehan, 2006, p.240) Using a quote from a British librarian as a
representative comment from this group, most found that “leadership is one of the core areas of
effective management and the separation of management from leadership is arbitrary,”

a

viewpoint that seems to be supported by the placement of the leadership competence addition to
the ALA Core Competences of Librarianship only under the Administration and Management
Competence. (Mullins & Linehan, 2006, p. 240)

2.1.5

Leadership Workshops and Institutes

If, as indicated by Mullins and Linehan (2006), Jordan (2012), and Chow and Rich (2013), there
is a pervasive view that leadership is an element of management and appears to be best described
as attributes and behaviors applied to the work of management, where does that leave the many
continuing education workshops, trainings, and state and national library leadership institutes?
Unfortunately, as these offerings are relatively new in the field, there have not been many studies
indicating their success or how participation has impacted the work and behaviors of the
attendees. One such study, done in 2004 by Mason and Wetherbee, provides a list (from a
23

database and web-based search only) of all library leadership programs offered across the world
at the time of the research, including 21 that had been developed between 1996 and 2002. (p.
196)

Pointing out that much of the leadership literature describes multiple non-

training/educational events as being the most conducive to developing leadership skills (e.g.,
developmental job assignments and organizational context), Mason and Wetherbee (2004) state
that “ability to learn” is also important in leadership development. (p. 195)
Providing a few details of leadership training models, both outside and inside the field of
librarianship, they note a variety of approaches employed by these models, including the use of a
mentor, project assignments, and exercises and activities. (Mason & Wetherbee, 2004, p. 203)
One note they make about the majority of these workshops and institutes is that they “appear to
be selective in terms of participants,” often accepting people to attend after some sort of
competitive application process. (Mason & Wetherbee, 2004, p.203)
From the published sources that the authors could find online and access, the reports
revealed that evaluation and assessment relied heavily on participants’ self-reporting which are
“of limited value in evaluating the efficacy of leadership training” as they do not directly address
“whether the participants actually learned anything new, whether that learning is retained and
applied in the workplace, and whether that knowledge or those skills improved the individual or
improved the workplace.” (Mason & Wetherbee, 2004, p. 207-8) Mason and Wetherbee (2004)
did discover, however, three more in-depth evaluations from the Northwest Career Development
Assessment Center (which conducted leadership training for librarians in the Northwest U.S.),
the Stanford-California Institute (for librarians in California), and the Snowbird Institute (for
early-career librarians selected nationally), but even these more rigorously-evaluated programs
still evaluated on such a variety of measurements that it was difficult to glean any results or

24

indications of success beyond the specific program and individuals who participated. (p. 208212)
What did emerge, however, beyond the heavy reliance on self-assessment, was the “lack
of a clear and agreed definition of ‘leadership skills.’” (Mason & Wetherbee, 2004, p. 212) This
lack of a core list of leadership skills or competencies “means that, although training programs
are often worthwhile and beneficial to the individual participants, there is no accurate way to
determine if the most effective skills are being taught to leaders and aspiring leaders.” (Mason &
Wetherbee, 2004, p. 214) (Keep in mind that this article predates the 2008 ALA Emerging
Leaders’ creation of a leadership competency model, which has never been formally adopted by
either LLAMA or ALA, nor are there any indications that it is currently being used.)
Furthermore, without an agreed-upon list, it is impossible to compare data across these programs
and get a larger view of the impact of these programs on the profession as a whole, and on public
libraries in particular.

2.1.6

Leadership and Management Conclusions

Although leadership has clearly become an important aspect of the library profession, and
certainly a buzzword in not only the literature but also at conferences and in professional job
descriptions, there is little indication, aside from rhetoric, that there is any meaningful difference
between leadership and management for most practitioners. It appears, through its usage in the
articles and studies discussed here as well as others, that leadership is a way of behaving, as seen
through qualities and attributes, that should be applied to all aspects of a professional’s work,
and most rigorously and continually to the work of managers at all levels of an organization.

25

Although, this study does not resolve the ongoing argument between leadership and
management, it does strengthen the idea, through a variety of comments and descriptions, that
separating the two is irrelevant in terms of the work of front-line public library managers. For
example, the list of leadership qualities that Riggs says are needed in librarians are all
demonstrated, in one way or another, by the participants of this study, all while “managing” their
locations and staff in the day-to-day work of the public library.

Furthermore, while the

organization in this study has conducted some leadership training, it could be argued that
multiple qualities, particularly those qualities needed to create and implement the Strategic Plan,
have contributed more to the creation of leaders in this organization than anything else.
As a result of these processes of creating and implementing the Strategic Plan, there is a
new “openness” described by many participants, particularly in everyone’s voice being heard
throughout the organization, which, as another by-product, seems to have created the potential of
leaders throughout the hierarchy, not just those responsible for managing and leading within the
organization. This approach, in fact, has been able to better capture the essence of what the
leadership competency list developed by ALA’s 2008 Emerging Leaders attempted but did not
quite succeed at: the creation of elements of leadership at all levels of a library organization,
regardless of holding a managerial position.
Likewise, at least in this organization as studied, not only can leadership happen at a
variety of levels and classifications throughout the organization, but also the elements of
demonstrable leadership and management can be integrally combined to achieve the mission and
vision, as well as the changes needed to implement the Strategic Plan. As Gorman said in the
Hicks and Given article about “principled, transformational leadership” being added to the core
competencies of librarianship before being adopted, it remains debatable whether leadership can

26

be taught, either in a LIS program or other formal training venue. What this study does suggest,
however, is that there is some credence that learning and developing leadership qualities can and
do happen within the organization.

Instead, what is unclear, especially given that this

organization conducted some leadership training, is the right mix of formal and experiential
learning in the work environment, as well as the necessary elements in either type of learning to
create an organization with effective leaders.
Moreover, the two qualities Chow and Rich report among all library directors—empathy
and vision—are identified in this organization as well. A number of participants talk about
empathy and vision as important attributes necessary to do their job well and all talk about the
community as an integral part of their work, both directly and indirectly. As discussed later in
Chapter 4, this community piece of their work, as well as its attributable elements, is a major
difference found between this study and the conceptual frameworks from the two studies in the
field of business.
The overriding leadership view of participants is their pivotal role in making real the
mission, vision, and values of the organization, as well as the accompanying elements of the
Strategic Plan, leading their teams to discover what that means for their particular location and
community, and then managing the work that accomplishes the translated concrete components.
As one of Mullins and Linehan’s participants concluded to a general question of whether public
libraries are managed or led, it does not really matter to those carrying out the work. The
participants of this study agree; to try to decide presents only issues that seem irrelevant and
unnecessarily academic.

Moreover, in the simplest terms, this study supports Mason and

Wetherbee’s point that without an agreed-upon list and set of definitions about what constitutes
“leadership skills,” as well as the unstated but related question as to what constitutes

27

“management skills,” it is difficult to determine whether leadership training has an impact on the
creation or growth of leaders.
The library organization in this study, with the aid of a grant and a local organizational
development company, created a leadership institute that conducted a series of trainings for at
least two cohorts over the course of two years. Referencing the institute both directly and
indirectly, the majority of participants found this training program highly influential to their
development as managers. However, when discussing the details and what has remained with
them, the one workshop that the majority mentions focused on giving feedback to staff (using a
method called STAR-AR), which potentially could be argued is developing the managerial skill
of supervising staff. On the other hand, it could also be argued that learning such a tool builds
leadership behaviors. Managers must work with staff not only to accomplish the work of the
organization, but also to build trust, relationships, positive work environments and, ultimately,
productive teams.
As it appears to be too difficult and potentially extraneous to separate leadership from
management in the work of practitioners, the continued debate and attempts to categorize and
label these various tasks, skills, and knowledge as one or the other do so on some level as an
academic exercise separated unhelpfully from practice in the field. Moreover, as the two sets of
ALA competencies discussed here indicate, the profession as a whole does not seem to view the
two separately either. Thus, such a debate does not move the profession or the work of those in
management positions any further ahead in the form of meaningful understanding or application.
Furthermore, the debate runs the risk of insulting or alienating those who are managers by
continual replication of attitudes such as those of Bennis that make one as more important and
better than the other.

28

2.2

COMPETENCY MODELS

Unlike the debate between leadership and management, where there has been at least some
discussion of whether and how the two have meaningful differences and whether those
differences actually manifest themselves in practice, the concept of competencies seems to have
been adopted more or less wholesale with little reference to and discussion of the debate
surrounding the creation and use of them in other fields, including higher education (see Milliron
or Schneider for examples). Hicks and Given do not mention in their article on the document
analysis of ALA’s Core Competences that there was any discussion among the task force
members on the topic or even as part of their charge to look into a variety of models instead of
settling immediately on creating a competency list. However, given that the term “competences”
was in the title of the task force, and ALA’s apparent use of competency lists (at the time of this
writing, ALA has 13 professional competencies posted on its website, plus another 7 with
“guidelines” or “standards” in their titles) 1, it makes sense why there was potentially no
discussion noted in the records of the task force and why the authors did not include literature or
discussion about the appropriateness or necessity of another professional competency list.

2.2.1

A Competency Debate in the Form of Correspondence

Ammons-Stephens, et al. (2009) published one of the few articles that mentions an alternative
viewpoint to competencies, but even they relegate the discussion to the conclusion of the article,
briefly stating that competencies are not a “universally supported idea.” (p. 71) Referencing an

1

See http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/careers/corecomp/corecompspecial/knowledgecompetencies to review the
list in its entirety.

29

article that is presented as a series of letters, Hollenbeck, McCall, and Silzer (2006) represent
both sides of the debate clearly and succinctly. On one side are Hollenbeck and McCall who are
concerned that:
the wholesale adoption of competency-based HR practices [although in the library field,
most of these lists seem to be used more for formal and self-education measurements of
learning than by library HR staff] has hindered more than it has helped the advancement
of leadership development… [with] the most dangerous impact of competencies [being]
that their very popularity has prevented the search for more useful alternatives.
(Hollenbeck, McCall & Silzer, 2006, p. 399)
While Silzer agrees with some of this criticism because of poorly designed and/or
implemented competency models, he firmly believes that “competencies can provide clear
guidance on the behaviors that seasoned incumbents think are related to effectiveness. They
provide a tremendous educational tool to people trying to learn how to become more
effective…” (Hollenbeck, McCall & Silzer, 2006, p. 402) However, Silzer stresses, “it is a
general map to leadership effectiveness, providing alternate ways of reaching a destination…not
a trip ticket that dictates very specific and rigid directions.” (Hollenbeck, McCall & Silzer, 2006,
p. 403)
Unfortunately, Hollenbeck and McCall argue, this is the primary issue with competency
models. Produced most often as a list encompassing knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs),
they are pressed into service as a checklist and each item is applied as a fully separate entity,
which is not what the research shows how leadership KSAs are used in practice. Instead, the
KSAs are all interdependent and highly situational, as some KSAs get used together in one
situation and may cause harm when used together in another situation. (Hollenbeck, McCall &
Silzer, 2006, p. 399-400) Moreover, when these KSAs are accepted by senior management or a
professional association, there is an inherent stamp of approval that often gets translated into

30

“correctness,” leaving little room for criticism of its efficacy or discussion around what has been
included or omitted. (Hollenbeck, McCall & Silzer, 2006, p. 400)
Silzer, on the other hand, sees competencies more as guidelines rather than hard-and-fast
rules, even though he acknowledges they can appear to be applied more rigidly in the wrong
hands. However, that does not diminish the guidance they provide especially among the less
experienced. In fact, Silzer believes users of competency models do not look at the items
independently (as Hollenbeck and McCall charge), but see them as interactive as well. These
competency model users understand that the model is a simplification of what in reality is highly
complex, and not meant as a complete version or description of KSAs, particularly in the area of
leadership. (Hollenbeck, McCall & Silzer, 2006, p. 400)

2.2.2

Competency Study of Public Library Directors

While each side makes additional, more detailed arguments, these primary points speak directly
to most of the competency models reviewed here, including the two sets created at the behest of
ALA. These competency lists and models, especially the ones produced by ALA, are created by
small groups of people and with little discussion or debate as the Hicks and Given article attests.
Moreover, while some of these competency lists and models are produced by research using
solid methodology behind the results, again they are created only by a small, select group of
people. Yet, these lists and models are published and used as checklists by library practitioners
and staff, whether for hiring purposes or self-education and self-measurement without noting or
possibly even understanding the potential pitfalls in the research or the issues surrounding their
application, often because that information is missing from these articles. Keeping this debate in

31

mind, there are a few studies of note on the competencies modeled by library directors and
managers.
Jordan (2012) conducted a Delphi study to produce a competency list that addresses the
areas needed to be an “effective manager-leader.” (p. 37) Stating the objective of the research as
the “refine[ment]…of competencies, identified from the literature, through the opinions of
current library directors” (p. 37), Jordan (2012) enlisted the 100 best directors identified as the
top ten in each population category of Hennen’s Annual Public Library Ratings to participate in
three rounds of the study (p. 39):
•

•

•

Round One: Directors were sent a list of 35 competencies, along with definitions, and
asked to check the most important ones. They were then given the option to suggest
other competencies they thought might be missing from the list. Thirty-one directors
participated. (Jordan, 2012, p. 39-40)
Round Two: The list, pared down to the 18 competencies identified by more than 60% of
the participants as important in the first round, was sent out along with five additional
competencies included by the directors. This time, the 31 directors who participated in
the first round were given a Likert scale (1 as non-essential; 7 as essential) to rate each of
the 23 competencies. Twenty-three directors responded and the mean and standard
deviation was calculated for each competency. Four were deleted from the list as being
below a mean value of 6. No additional competencies were added. (Jordan, 2012, p. 4041)
Round Three: Using the same format and scale as Round Two, 19 of the competencies
were rated at a 6 or higher and deemed important and necessary. The same 23 directors
that responded to Round Two also responded to this last round. (Jordan, 2012, p. 41)
The final list of competencies that this study created (in rank order by mean score, with

score listed after the competency) were:

In the discussion, Jordan (2012) posits that this competency list will be helpful “to new

and aspiring public library directors looking for information on their own competency
development.” (p. 44) Jordan (2012) recommends that further research be conducted with
directors in other types of libraries as well as with managers at all levels in a library organization.
(p. 45)

2.2.3

Two Non-Director Managerial Studies on Competence or Characteristics

Like Jordan’s study, most of the competency studies are aimed at directors. While it could be
argued, especially for leadership competencies, that many individual competencies in a given list
apply to managers other than directors, there are very few studies that are exclusively focused on
at lower levels of management in libraries and particularly public library managers. Two studies
that do look at other managers, however, are Arns and Price’s (2007) informal study of new
public and academic library supervisors’ about the most important skills and managerial
competencies and Haycock’s (2011) study of exemplary public library branch managers, which
attempts to identify what makes them most effective.
Arns and Price (2007) conducted their study at a 2003 ALA conference by asking new
supervisors (defined as being a degreed librarian in a supervisory position for fewer than five

33

years), producing a sample of 39 participants.

(p. 13)

A survey was created, listing 22

competencies taken from the book Staff Development: A Practical Guide; these competencies
were divided into three categories, with eight associated with the first-level supervision category,
six with the mid-level supervision category, and the remaining considered to be foundational.
(see Table 2) (Arns & Price, 2007, p. 13-14)

The survey was conducted via telephone and used a semi-structured survey format,
asking the participants to rate each competency from 1 (little importance) to 5 (great
importance). (Arns & Price, 2007, p. 14) The interviewers also asked participants if their
master’s degree coursework was helpful in their current jobs. For the most part, participants
ranked themselves quite high (a 4 or 5) on the majority of competencies (with no triangulation
from supervisors to verify these ratings); only three competencies (i.e., flexibility, technical
competence, and financial management) had fewer than 30 participants awarding themselves a 4
or 5. (Arns & Price, 2007, p. 15)
34

When applying the same list of competencies against their graduate education, however,
no category ranked above 30. (Arns & Price, 2007, p. 15) Asking more about their graduate
learning experiences, Arns and Price (2007) learned that, “almost all participants indicated that
they needed less theory and more specific nuts-and-bolts lessons in areas such as finance, labor
law, goal setting, fundraising, and working with the media.” (p. 15) Finally, when asked to
identify other training and experience that had helped them in their current positions, participants
said that “previous job experience was by far the most frequently mentioned, with nearly threequarters of the participants providing this answer.” (Arns & Price, 2007, p. 16) Likewise,
professional reading and personal experiences also played a role in learning these competencies,
particularly those related to the first and mid-level supervisory competencies. (Arns & Price,
2007, p. 16)
The authors’ comments about the participants’ references to previous experiences as
being helpful is very striking: “The importance of prior life experience to their success in
supervisory positions is given significant attention in their remarks; and several of the
characteristics most highly valued by the study participants, such as self-awareness, interpersonal
skills, leadership ability, and flexibility, reflect…hidden reserves” are not measured by the
competency list. (Arns & Price, 2007, p. 18) This suggests that finding ways to give potential
managers developmental experiences, and not training, might be the best way to help prepare
potential managers. Yet, Arns and Price (2007) conclude the article with a call for training:
“…[A]s many current managers retire, there will be a growing demand and need for post-MLIS
training opportunities that provide affordable, hand-on, decision-based experiences that facilitate
the transition to new supervisory positions.” (p. 18)

35

Likewise, Haycock (2011) comes to some of the very same continuing education and
training conclusions in his study, “Exemplary Public Library Branch Managers: Their
Characteristics and Effectiveness,” as well as contributing his voice to the call to create
competency models and lists. In this case, Haycock (2011) recommends using his findings as
the basis for the creation of a competency model for public library branch managers, citing the
significant lack of studies of managers in non-director positions. (p. 267)
Triangulating among all branch managers (not just exemplary ones), community leaders,
and others (including staff, board members, and elected officials), Haycock (2011) identified
“exemplary” branch managers using information from all three groups to create a sample of 26
participants from the greater Vancouver, B.C. area. (p. 268) Participants then took a survey to
glean “professional, personal, and demographic attributes and characteristics;” they also
completed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality assessment. (Haycock, 2011, p. 268)
In phase two of the study, forty stakeholders (i.e., public library directors, immediate
supervisors and subordinates, board members, and peers) were interviewed briefly
(approximately 15 minutes each) to “elicit professional and personal competencies essential to
library management…[and] necessary to be an exemplary public library branch manager.”
(Haycock, 2011, p. 269)

Thus, “the Myers-Briggs results, combined with stakeholder

interviews, provided a desired management and personality profile for a library branch
manager.” (Haycock, 2011, p. 272) These included effective people skills, motivational skills,
direction-setting skills, human resource expertise, communication, and breadth of experience.
Haycock (2011) states that by identifying the perceived differences between an ordinary
and extraordinary branch manager, “professional development and post-graduate educational
programs can be designed to ensure sustained library branch services.” (p. 276) Moreover, the

36

“groundbreaking” inclusion of stakeholders produced “results [that] point to a demand for branch
manager competencies that can enhance not only managerial effectiveness but also enhance
leadership, responsiveness to community needs, and the ability to facilitate the organizational
change.” (Haycock, 2011, p. 276) Finally, Haycock (2011) concludes that “some of these traits
can be taught and developed in graduate programs of library and information science
(LIS)…[and] some can be developed through continuing education.” (p. 276)

2.2.4

Competency Models Conclusions

While competency lists can be helpful, particularly for a person new to a position that is
remarkably different than those held prior, such as from librarian to manager, these lists are
missing two essential ingredients for most people who might use them: how to achieve each
competency and how to measure the competency so one knows that it has been achieved. In
fact, for many people using a competency list, most of what is on a specific list would not be
surprising, but the difficulty is translating the list into a workable, achievable, and measurable
plan to gain the competencies at a meaningful level.
Thus, for example, while not using the exact language (and the fact that the list is meant
for directors and not front-line managers), the majority of competencies Jordan identifies in her
study are also identified by the participants of this study as either components of their work or
attributes that are important for someone in their positions. This could be why no participant
discussed using competency lists, either as a way to prepare to become a manager or, after
holding a managerial position, as a way to measure where they were in achieving the set of
managerial knowledge, skills, and behaviors. Because this study purposefully did not use any
competency list as either a springboard or a measurement to identify the important components,
37

attributes, and competencies of front-line managerial work in this organization, it is unclear as to
whether anyone used such lists or would have used them if they knew they existed. Thus,
without a direct question about competency models, this study can only be silent on the topic.
However, what the study does reveal is supporting evidence for the research of Arns and Price as
well as of Haycock.
With regard to Arns and Price, this study discovered some of the same conclusions, most
notably that each manager’s own experiences, both prior to becoming a manager and afterwards,
have been some of the most influential pieces in learning how to be a manager. Interestingly,
what the Arns and Price study did not find or discuss, but was found in this study, is the
importance of various people along the way who have aided them in becoming well-versed in
managerial work including bosses (both former and current), other people as models, and peers.
Likewise, this study’s participants also noted many of Haycock’s characteristics as being
particularly important to their work as managers, but these were often the areas that presented
themselves as difficult to achieve a level of proficiency with which they were happy.

2.3

LIS EDUCATION AND OTHER FORMAL TRAINING’S ROLE IN PREPARING
LIBRARY DIRECTORS

Most of the studies discussed here, including Haycock’s, look to LIS education and continuing
education (or other formal training and development activities) and in many ways, shift the
burden of responsibility to those who may not be able to produce the desired results, because it is
not supported that these mechanisms are the best way to learn managerial knowledge, skills, and
behaviors. Mackenzie and Smith (2011) conducted a three-stage study examining how LIS
38

schools are educating students to become library directors. Phase one and two looked at 48
fully-accredited programs (excluding those that were provisional at the time), what degrees they
offered, whether they offered and/or required management courses, and the curricula of those
courses that were offered and had a syllabus posted online. (p. 57) Based solely on information
provided online, the authors discovered that 43.8% of the schools required no management
courses, although some of them did offer management courses as electives. (Mackenzie &
Smith, 2011, p. 57) Of the 56.2% that did require management courses, the vast majority only
required one for graduation. (Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 57) From those programs that did
require at least one course, Mackenzie and Smith (2009) obtained and analyzed twenty-four
syllabi. (p. 137)
The most notable outcome of the first two phases of this study was that there was no
agreement to “the requirements for preparing future librarians…[which would have] the potential
to improve the design of graduate library education.” (Mackenzie & Smith, 2009, p. 138) In
fact, Mackenzie and Smith (2009) interpret this to mean that “as a result of the lack of explicit
guidance from ALA as to how the master’s level curriculum should ensure specific peoplemanagement outcomes [for example], library directors enter the field at a disadvantage.” (p. 140)
Recognizing that the lack of agreement on what should be taught, as well as finding that
almost half of the schools did not require a management course, Mackenzie and Smith (2011)
interviewed directors in phase three to determine whether and how their LIS education
contributed to their abilities as a library director. (p. 53) Using the 2007-2008 American Library
Directory to identify the population, a random sample of 380 directors were sent a survey, with a
response of 49 acceptable surveys which the authors deemed an acceptable response rate.
(Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 59) Twenty-eight LIS programs were represented among the

39

participants, with 43 graduating from an ALA-accredited program between 1967 and 2005.
(Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 59)
The results revealed that fewer than half (42.9%) of these directors were required to take
a management course. (Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 62) When asked whether their LIS
education prepared them to manage a library, 55.1% said no, and only one respondent gave an
unqualified “yes” answer. (Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 63) When asked what they did to
prepare themselves to manage a library, the majority (29 participants) said they taught
themselves. (Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 64)
Focusing most particularly on managing people and how this is handled in MBA and
other management programs, all phases of the study revealed that LIS education, even when
there is a required management course, generally ignores human resources topics, which puts
those who want or are thrust into management roles, particularly early in their career, at a
significant disadvantage. (Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 68) Mackenzie and Smith (2011),
however, do point out that, “To their credit, the library directors who responded to this study
have recognized that they lack management skills and have used their information location skills
to find programs, materials, and mentors to give them the information and training they lack.”
(p. 68) The authors still press LIS educators stating that “[m]uch of this independent work
would not be necessary if library school curriculum better met the real world management needs
of librarians—perhaps through continuing education program [sic] if not their formal curricula.”
(Mackenzie & Smith, 2011, p. 69)
Continuing education (CE), however, does not seem to offer much training in the area of
management. Matteson, Schlueter, and Hidy (2013) surveyed Ohio public and academic library
directors on the topic of library management and continuing education. Making the argument

40

that there is currently a lack of adequate management education (citing a lack of agreed-upon
professional standards or competencies for library managers along with the growing complexity
of library organizations), librarians are left with continuing education opportunities to fill the
gap.

(Matteson, et. al., 2013, p. 220)

To determine the perceptions of library directors

“regarding the need for and value of CE in library management,” Matteson, et al. (2013) built an
eleven-item survey sent electronically to 382 directors; eighty-two usable surveys were returned
which, they noted, has the potential for a non-response rate bias (as it did but was not noted in
the third stage of the Mackenzie and Smith study). (Matteson, et. al., 2013, p. 224) Participants
were asked to rate the importance of twelve knowledge areas pulled from the curriculum of six
regional and national business schools, which were deemed as the most important for mid- to
senior-level library managers to have. (Matteson, et. al., 2013, p. 224) While size of the library
was said to have some impact on how the participants responded, most of the knowledge areas
were deemed important by at least 90% of the participants. (Matteson, et. al., 2013, p. 225)
One of the findings, through indirect measurement, revealed that directors perceived that
“rising professional librarians at best have an average level of management knowledge, and that
only a small subset of applicants [for management positions] possess greater levels of
management knowledge,” which directors saw as an impediment to hiring and promotion for
many of them. (Matteson, et. al., 2013, p. 226-7) For directors reviewing CE requests, however,
the major factor was budgetary (i.e., cost, time away from work) before quality and other factors.
Furthermore, libraries tended to support only short-term CE or conferences, rather than
“sustained, in-depth educational experiences.” (Matteson, et. al., 2013, p. 229-230)

While

offering a number of suggestions, such as partnerships with those in the community with similar
needs, Matteson, et. al. (2013) clearly see training and other educational opportunities as the way

41

to prepare librarians for management and for those already doing the job and, thus, a need for
better clarification of outcomes in LIS management courses. (p. 231-232)

2.3.1

Formal Education Conclusions

Certainly, this study found what Mackenzie and Smith discovered, even more starkly, in that all
but a very few participants stated that the management classes they took in their LIS program did
not prepare them to be a manager. Many attended at a time when they were not required to take
one, although some did take one as an elective. Others, while they did take a management class,
did not find it particularly helpful to what they were currently doing as managers. In fact, only
one participant out of the ten in-depth participants who were specifically asked a question
regarding LIS education’s role replied unequivocally that the management class was helpful to
her transition to manager.
This research also supports Mackenzie and Smith’s conclusions that supervising staff is
where new managers are often least prepared and supervision is one of the most difficult roles to
master. As some of the participant quotes in Chapter 4 show, learning how to supervise staff is a
long process and it is difficult to achieve all the different but related components. For most, even
those who had some experience supervising staff in previous positions, supervision continues to
be a major focal point of their work as well as their transitions from librarian to proficient
manager.
Interestingly, not a single participant responded wistfully or even angrily that they had
not been prepared through their education to be a manager, mainly because being a manager was
not their purpose nor on their minds when attending graduate school. Even those who stated that
becoming a manager was a planned step in their career, no one said that it had been their plan
42

while attending a LIS program, although a few stated that they wish it had been, as they thought
they could have at least gained a better understanding of management in general. Moreover, a
few responded that they had no expectation, given what they now knew about managerial work,
that they could have learned what they needed in a classroom.
Furthermore, this general attitude seems to apply to other formal learning opportunities,
such as classes, trainings or workshops, so as a group, they did not look to formal learning
opportunities to learn and gain proficiency in managerial duties. Of those areas where managers
are still working to be proficient, only two specifically mentioned taking a class or looking for
training to help achieve proficiency. Moreover, both of these participants were looking to build
foundational skills that would support a myriad of their managerial duties, not to learn a
manager’s task per se: one was looking to increase technology skills to leverage for time and
information management and the other to learn public speaking skills. Instead, the preference
overwhelmingly includes getting help and input from others (e.g., peers, supervisors, mentors, or
situation-specific experts like HR staff) and then seeking out situations that help them build
knowledge, skills, and behaviors in a specific proficiency area.

2.4

THE REFLECTIVE PRACTITIONER MODEL AND ITS APPLICATION

Donald Schon, in his 1983 book The Reflective Practitioner, establishes a theory that combines
reflection and action in a way that explains professional mastery steeped in experience and tacit
knowledge: “Our knowing is ordinarily tacit, implicit in our patterns of action and in our feel for
the stuff with which we are dealing. It seems right to say that our knowing is in our action.” (p.
49) Continual interaction and gaining a “feel for the stuff” where the tacit knowledge builds and
43

grows is what leads to professional mastery: “It is this entire process of reflection-in-action
which is central to the ‘art’ by which practitioners sometimes deal well with situations of
uncertainty, instability, uniqueness, and value conflict.” (Schon, 1983, p. 50)

Thus, a

professional demonstrating such mastery acting in the moment is described by Schon (1983) as
“…reflection [which] tends to focus interactively on the outcomes of action, the action itself, and
the intuitive knowing implicit in the action.” (p. 56)
Yet, a true reflective practitioner continues this reflection-in-action, instead of relying
solely on knowing-in-action that she has built through experiences and maturity in the field,
because “through reflection, [she] can surface and criticize the tacit understandings that have
grown up around the repetitive experiences of a specialized practice, and can make new sense of
situations of uncertainty or uniqueness which [she] may allow [her]self to experience.” (Schon,
1983, p. 61) Hence:
when someone reflects-in-action, he becomes a researcher in the practice context. He is
not dependent on the categories of established theory and technique, but constructs a new
theory of the unique case. His inquiry is not limited to a deliberation about means which
depends on prior agreement about ends. He does not keep means and ends separate, but
defines them interactively as he frames a problematic situation. He does not separate
thinking from doing, ratiocinating his way to a decision which he must later convert to
action. Because his experimenting is a kind of action, implementation is built into his
inquiry. Thus, reflection-in-action can proceed, even in situations of uncertainty or
uniqueness…” (Schon, 1983, pp. 68-69)
Schon (1983) includes managers as part of the professions he describes as reflective
practitioners, even though as a profession, managers will look and operate differently than those
in the fields of medicine or engineering, for example:
A manager’s professional life is wholly concerned with an organization which is both the
stage for his activity and the object of his inquiry. Hence the phenomena on which he
reflects-in-action are the phenomena of organizational life. Organizations, furthermore,
are repositories of cumulatively built-up knowledge: principles and maxims of practice,
images of mission and identity, facts about task environment, techniques of operation,
stories of past experience which serve as exemplars for future action. When a manager
reflects-in-action, he draws on this stock of organizational knowledge, adapting it to
44

some present instance. And he also functions as an agent of organizational learning,
extending or restructuring, in his present inquiry, the stock of knowledge which will be
available for future inquiry. (p. 242)
Furthermore, even in operationally smooth times, there is a “…range of organizational
phenomena with which reflective managers concern themselves: the problem of interpreting the
external environment’s response to organizational action, the diagnosis of signs of trouble within
an organization, the process by which an organization learns from its experience, and the effects
of an organizational learning system on the way in which organizational problems are set and
solved.” (Schon, 1983, pp. 242-243) But these are not operationally smooth times for most
organizations and the organization in this study is no different. Thus, even the most reflectivepractitioner managers will struggle as the knowing-in-action and the tacit knowledge on which
their actions are based shift under their feet.
Following the publication of The Reflective Practitioner, there were many professional
fields that made attempts to adopt and adapt Schon’s ideas and methods including nursing and
teaching. Yet, this has not been an easy transition, much of which seems to start with the
difficulty of completely understanding how Schon defines and views “reflection” and how that
translates into action. Most notable is the confusion with Schon’s concept of “reflection-inaction” which is defined as happening somewhat simultaneously as a practitioner is faced with a
unique, new, and/or complex situation that tests the boundaries of her current knowledge and like
experiences. Instead, many teaching methods, studies, and articles have focused on reflectionon-action, that which happens after the fact.
In a criticism of nursing’s wholesale adoption of reflective practice both in education and
the field, Rolfe (2014) states that “it has largely been misunderstood and misapplied.” (p. 1179)
Reiterating the differences between reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action as described by

45

Schon and noting that the latter is barely mentioned in Schon’s two seminal works, Rolfe (2014)
states that “if we regard reflection simply as a way of generating knowledge about our practice
by thinking about it retrospectively, then that knowledge will always find itself at the very
bottom of the hierarchy of evidence alongside personal experience and unsubstantiated belief.”
(p, 1179) Further, again relying on Schon, he notes, “reflective practitioners reflect on-the-spot,
in the here-and-now, and the products of their reflections are immediately put into practice in a
continuous and spontaneous interplay between thinking and doing, in which ideas are
formulated, tested and revised.” (Rolfe, 2014, p. 1180)
In terms of educating those who are entering the field, Rolfe (2014) envisions an entirely
different relationship between educator and student:
The primary task of reflective educators is therefore to form partnerships with their
students in order to identify what they see as their learning needs and problems; to try out
and appraise novel and individualised [sic] responses aimed at meeting those needs, and
to arrive at a mutual agreement about what might constitute a resolution. Rather than
regarding education as a technological intervention based on the technical–rational
model, with learning outcomes, teaching methods and assessment schemes laid out in
advance, learning becomes a joint enterprise which requires a personal and individual
partnership between tutor and student. (p. 1181)
Moreover, as he again reiterates Schon’s concepts, Rolfe (2014) suggests dusting off an
apprenticeship model that was abandoned by the nursing profession approximately twenty years
ago because “students can only learn to be reflective practitioners when they are in practice
[author’s emphasis],” which makes it “necessary to actively interact with our environment
[which] requires a strong and mutual partnership between student and coach in which the student
feels safe to speculate, theorise and hypothesise [sic] about care and to test out hypotheses in
practice under closely supervised conditions.” (p. 1182)
Thus, along with the growth of interest in reflective practice, there are also ongoing
understandings that can be seen as contradictory or even mistaken, depending on one’s own
46

viewpoint, particularly as it relates to Schon’s ideas. Finlay (2008) attempts to “[draw] attention
to the problems — conceptual as well as practical — which surround it [reflective practice] and
render its application complex and difficult.” (p. 20) Starting with Schon’s work, particularly in
health care and education, Finlay recounts studies that attempt to make Schon’s theory more
applicable while also noting a number of criticisms, which generally focus on a lack of
methodological support for his theory. Finlay’s (2008) article, then, focuses on where the
majority of work has been, which is different than Schon’s: “Models vary in their levels of
prescription, explanation, criticality and reflexivity, but most share a focus on reflection as being
essentially retrospective [Schon’s reflection-on-action],” all of which seems to have important
ingredients of retrospection, self-evaluation, and re-orientation meant to change future
approaches to similar situations. (p. 7-8)
The result, however, is what has created the confusion among educators and practitioners
in a variety of fields:
In summary, different conceptions and models of reflective practice continue to emerge
across different professional groups. Paradoxically, the demand for better (i.e. more
thoughtful, reflexive and critical) reflective practice has tended to generate yet more
models or typologies — which, if used blindly or unthinkingly, can render practice more
mechanical and externally subscribed. This, of course, is the very antithesis of Schon’s
notion of ‘professional artistry’. In the end, it seems neither possible nor desirable to fix
on any one model as the definitive ‘answer’. Different models are needed, at different
levels, for different individuals, disciplines and organisations [sic], to use in different
contexts. Professional practice and education are also likely to benefit from the stimulus –
and challenge – provided by competing perspectives and multiple models. Models need
to be applied selectively, purposefully, flexibly and judiciously. [Author’s emphasis]
(Finlay, 2008, p. 10)
Interestingly, this outcome is very similar to the wide array of competency models and lists that
not only create confusion but are also lacking in how to achieve success — whether it is in
obtaining a specific set of competencies or becoming a reflective practitioner.

47

Thus, this research study of the journey from librarian to proficient manager focuses
primarily on one proposed framework that applies to the specific situation of this organization
and the findings, which also places one definition of reflection within the context of management
and leadership. Nesbit (2012) puts forth “a framework of self-directed leadership development
(SDLD) to advance conceptual understanding and practical applications of leaders in
organizations.” (p. 203) The framework itself requires three meta-skills (i.e., foundational skills
necessary for other skills to be developed) to be in place and working together to have SDLD
actually take place and work.
The first meta-skill is self-reflection, defined as the ability “to analyze one’s past and
current experiences to operate more effectively in the future [i.e., reflection-on-action].” (Nesbit,
2012, p. 209) Reviewing a variety of studies, Nesbit (2012) concludes that not only is this metaskill important for individuals internally but also is needed to be self-reflective with someone
else: “Reflective processing of experiences would likely benefit by purposeful reflective
interactions with another person, such as the use of an executive coach or mentor. Talking about
events can stimulate reflective processing as it aids the leader in making sense of events and
drawing out insights about one’s areas for improvements and to assist in the development of
action plans.” (p. 212)
The second meta-skill is being able to manage one’s emotional reactions to feedback.
Noting the difficulty in achieving this meta-skill, Nesbit (2012) discusses some of the outcomes
that could happen as a result of not achieving it, such as “…limit[ing] the extent that leaders are
willing to put themselves into positions where they will acquire experiences and where they may
learn about their skills and deficit areas” and the potential “quality of ongoing reflective
processing because emotional processing may undermine the limited conscious resources

48

available for reflection.” (p. 213) Hence, regulation of emotions becomes critical in building
one’s own leadership capacity: “…leaders need to adopt a learning orientation where they
consciously monitor their emotional reactions in response to negative feedback and consciously
highlight interpretations of feedback as opportunities for learning.” (Nesbit, 2012, p. 214) Most
interestingly in this section, however, is Nesbit’s lack of any reference to Goleman and other’s
work in the area of leadership development and emotional intelligence.
The last meta-skill is self-regulation. While the first two work in conjunction with each
other to develop self-understanding and awareness, this third skill operates during the change
phase of learning as well:
The SDLD framework…conceptualizes development as a sequence of phases beginning
with a self-understanding phase that incorporates processes that highlight the role of selfreflection and emotional management and lead to a self-change phase, which focuses on
self-regulation performance processes. These self-regulatory performance processes
incorporate sub-phases of goal-selection, goal-striving, and monitoring and evaluation
actions. (Nesbit, 2012, p. 215)
Thus, the framework also requires action based on the outcomes of employing the first two skills
to a given situation, which will require a number of other skills to succeed. For example:
…action-plan strategies may include increasing awareness of explicit knowledge through
reading (books, Internet, etc.) as well as learning from and observing those already
displaying the desired behavior (reference on modeling as a learning strategy). A typical
environmental-focused task strategy is to negotiate support from significant others, such
as one’s direct manager or work colleagues or mentor or coach to support one’s efforts in
the change process. (Nesbit, 2012, p. 216)
Nesbit’s framework, which employs a segment of reflection-on-action, can be seen
among the participants of this study, much more so than Schon’s reflection-in-action. As many
of the profiles (see Appendix G) and quotes in Chapter 4 attest, all three meta-skills are
employed as part of the journey from librarian to manager. Although there were no diary or
interview questions specifically aimed at teasing out the building of these meta-skills, there is

49

still a remarkable amount of evidence potentially supporting Nesbit’s framework. Certainly, a
future review of this study’s data through the lens of Nesbit’s framework could add to not only
the strength and applicability of it, but also become a potential piece of creating a meaningful
theoretical framework specific to how librarians become front-line public library managers.
That is not to say that Schon’s reflection-in-action does not exist among the participants
in this study because there are descriptive aspects that appear to contain elements Schon
discusses. Unlike Nesbit’s framework where data can clearly be seen as applicable without
direct inquiry from the researcher, Schon’s underlying premise of tacit knowledge and reflection
as part of the action as it happens makes these more difficult to identify in a study that does not
directly inquire about these specific elements. Yet, the potential for them to exist in the current
data is there and, with further exploration of the data using Schon’s lens, is likely to produce a
series of research questions to inform future studies.
Moreover, this study itself is where Schon’s (1983) own interest lies:
In the varied topography of professional practice, there is high, hard ground where
practitioners can make effective use of research-based theory and technique, and there is
swampy lowland where situations are confusing ‘messes’ incapable of technical solution.
This difficulty is that the problems of the high ground, however great their technical
interest, are often relatively unimportant to clients or to the larger society, while in the
swamp are the problems of greatest human concern. (p. 42)
Trying to disassemble the journey from librarian to proficient manager is centered surely in those
“swampy lowlands,” questioning and probing to discover the components and nature of each step
along the path, only to have the answer often be that of uncertainty, except that it happened and
the step was taken.

Schon (1983) accurately describes many of the exchanges between

participant and researcher in this study: “There are those who chose the swampy lowlands. They
deliberately involve themselves in messy but crucially important problems, and when asked to
describe their methods of inquiry, they speak of experience, trial and error, intuition, and
50

muddling through.” (p. 43) Thus, it is certainly within the realm of possibility, and even
likelihood, that there are data in this study, when combined with data from future studies, could
unlock whether reflection-in-action exists for the professional manager-librarian.

2.5

DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND BUILDING PROFICIENCY

One model that focuses in the area of domain expertise and building proficiency is the Dreyfus
Model of Skill Acquisition. Most notably adapted to the field of nursing, Brenner (2004), whose
studies “extend the understanding of the Dreyfus Model to complex, underdetermined and fastpaced practices,” specifically explored how nurses develop critical-care practices and the
practical knowledge then embedded in their expertise. (p. 188) Following Dreyfus’ path, the
studies explore each stage and describe what takes place in terms of knowledge and skill
acquisition from beginner and advanced beginner, through the competent stage and proficiency,
until reaching expertise. Brenner (2004) and her associates “found that the model was predictive
and descriptive of distinct stages of skill acquisition in nursing practice.” (p. 198) Moreover,
they “found that nurses who had some difficulty with understanding how the ends of practice and
difficulty with their skills of interpersonal and problem engagement did not go on to become
expert nurses.” (Brenner, 2004, p. 198)
Sweeney, on the other hand, adapted the Dreyfus Model to reference work in an
academic library, studying seventeen librarians and two assistants. Sweeney (2008) found that
the model did apply, negating the beginner level as it is most applicable to students prior to
entering the profession:

51

The librarians in this study showed a definite progression from detached, rule-based
behavior to increasingly more involved, responsive, situated engagement with the client
and environment, and a growing awareness of how the world outside the library
influences and is influenced by what goes on in the library. The Dreyfus model
integrates these discrete aspects of skill which up until now have been fragmented, and
transforms the way reference skill can be analyzed. (pp. 23-24)
Moreover, one of the outcomes was a reorganization of the RUSA Competencies for
Reference Librarians, from which the narratives of the participants were measured to determine
where they placed on the Dreyfus spectrum: “The shift in thinking represented by the Dreyfus
model requires us to accept the notion that the reference environment is complex, that the context
of each situation is unique and new, and that skill develops across performance mode and
perceptual acuity through both situations and relationships.” (Sweeney, 2008, pp. 24-25)
What both the Benner studies and Sweeney’s dissertation research have in common,
however, is an agreed-upon set of outcomes or competencies from which the Dreyfus spectrum
of beginner to expert can be used to measure each competency that is necessary to achieve a
fairly singular task — critical-care nursing or academic reference work, for example.
Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier in this chapter in the Leadership and Competency sections,
the managerial and leadership work of front-line public library managers is not as neatly defined
because of a wide variety of contributing factors. Moreover, each knowledge, skill, or behavior
that could be agreed upon and deemed required might place a manager in different places along
the Dreyfus spectrum, even within the same general topic area.

For the general area of

supervising staff, for example, the component parts of supervision can be broken down into
related but separate pieces, such as hiring, directing and evaluating work, and correcting and
disciplining. While considered competent or proficient in directing work or correcting actions,
the same manager could be a beginner in hiring staff, which is also made up of a number of
factors.
52

As shown in Hall-Ellis and Grealy’s article, “The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition: A
Career Development Framework for Succession Planning and Management in Academic
Libraries,” the potential for erroneous assumptions exists without more detailed knowledge and
understanding of what librarian knowledge, skills, and behaviors look like in action, as compared
with the same for public library front-line managers. Hall-Ellis and Grealy (2013) posit that,
“The Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition provides a research-based framework that can be used
to monitor the preparation of talented individuals with the technical skills, workplace knowledge,
and experience needed for leadership positions.” (p. 588)
Using the Special Library Association’s list of personal and professional competencies,
Hall-Ellis and Grealy (2013) state that, “Library leaders use lists of competencies to assess the
skills, knowledge, experience, and abilities of current and future employees,” particularly in the
area of technical knowledge and skills needed by an academic reference librarian. (p. 592) Thus,
the authors argue, given these competencies and the success of librarians to move along the
Dreyfus spectrum from beginner to expert, this knowledge can drive an academic library’s
succession planning:
Understanding how experienced librarians use knowledge to get around in the library
environment and how and what knowledge was acquired in the course of getting around
illustrates the ways in which an individual gains mastery over technical skills, increases
proficiencies and competencies, and progresses professionally. These enhancements to
the skills levels at the time of LIS graduation give evidence of readiness to move up a
career ladder and preparation for the assumption of leadership assignments. Readiness for
leadership is a fundamental component of succession planning and management. Those
individuals who work over time to increase their technical skills and competencies,
coupled with tacit knowledge of the organization, become prime candidates who will be
prepared to take leadership roles. (Hall-Ellis & Grealy, 2013, p. 593)
This study, based on the quantitative content analysis of 9,500 academic position
announcements from 1998 through 2010 and focused on technical skills and competencies,
“…suggests that there are specific levels of skills acquisition and mastery that are essential for
53

advancement within the ranks of academic librarians.” (Hall-Ellis & Grealy, 2013, p. 597) Yet,
while the direct outcomes regarding the nature of academic librarian work may hold true, the
assumption that reaching expert level on the Dreyfus model for a technical and singular focus to
achieve a library service does not necessarily hold true. As stated earlier, it is unclear that the
knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to perform as an expert reference librarian overlap
significantly with being a manager in an academic environment. Moreover, given the very
notable differences between an academic librarian and a public librarian, it is equally unclear
whether the Dreyfus model can be applied as easily to the public librarian’s acquisition of the
necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors, let alone to the position of front-line public library
manager.
Given the outcomes discussed in Chapter 4, McCall and Hollenbeck’s conceptual article
on applying theories of expert enactments seems more relevant, especially to this case study that
includes managers who are relatively new and untested as well as those who have been in
managerial positions for much of their careers.

One of the objectives that McCall and

Hollenbeck (2008) discusses is domain learning, which is essential in understanding how
expertise is developed in sports or music, for example. (p. 22) Domains, however, are more
clear in those areas than they are in the fields of management and leadership. In fields such as
music, the expert domain can be explained as a level of technical proficiency that can be clearly
demonstrated and evaluated. In the management and leadership field, however, there are many
areas that can be construed as domains that are not technical and, thus, more difficult to
demonstrate proficiency: “People in leadership roles simply must deal effectively with a much
broader array of activities than, say, a chess master or a world-class pianist… Indeed, one might
argue that leaders, unlike other kinds of experts, actually must operate in multiple domains and

54

that true mastery in leadership means the ability to cross the bridge across differing domains.”
(McCall& Hollenbeck, 2008, p. 22)
Moreover, “[e]xperts have vast stores of declarative knowledge, represented by formal
knowledge such as the fact and principles found in textbooks, but they also have prodigious
stores of tacit knowledge, learned informally, and often not ‘visible’ even to themselves about
the domain in which they operate.” (McCall & Hollenbeck, 2008, p. 23) Thus, McCall and
Hollenbeck (2008) argue that it makes sense that “[g]iven the enormous amount of different
types of knowledge demanded, it is not surprising that no one, no matter how talented, becomes
an expert without a long period of learning and practice.” (p. 23) Implicit in this argument,
however, is the necessity of determining what constitutes “practice” in a managerial position.
Moreover, as mentioned in the discussion of Schon’s work, attempting to describe and explain
how tacit knowledge is built and gained can be difficult for participants. Finally, without a
specific definition or universal understanding of what constitutes “expertise” (and specifically in
this case study, “proficiency”), the answers of whether a certain level of knowledge and skill has
been obtained is sometimes left unknown to either the researcher or the participant.

2.6

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS

As the lack of literature regarding public library managers has shown, there is very little data,
qualitative or quantitative, that aid in the understanding of their experiences as they become a
manager or work to become proficient. Without such a preponderance of data, then, it is difficult
to have any theories against which to measure the outcomes of this study. As researchers strive
to probe and understand a phenomenon’s context, meaning, and processes with multiple types of
55

inquiries before attempting to classify it, so must the scientific inquiry explore concepts as it
relates to a phenomenon before creating the theories that exemplify it. Simply, “concepts…mark
out the paths by which we may move most freely in logical space…identify[ing] nodes or
junctions in the network of relationships, termini at which we can halt while preserving the
maximum range of choice as to where to go next.” (Kaplan, 1964, p. 52) Thus, “the function of
scientific concepts is to mark the categories which will tell us more about our subject matter than
any other categorical sets.” (Kaplan, 1964, p. 52)
Yet, there is a paradox in the relationship between scientific concepts and theory.
Without good concepts, it is difficult to create solid theory; but without good theories, it is hard
to arrive at solid concepts. (Kaplan, 1964, p. 53) One way this paradox resolves itself is to take
concepts or theories from other disciplines and apply these to new areas to create the concepts in
the applied field: “Like all existential dilemmas in science, of which this is an instance, the
paradox is resolved by approximation: the better our concepts, the better the theory we can
formulate with them, and in turn, the better the concepts available for the next improved theory.”
(Kaplan, 1964, p. 54) It is this constant give-and-take between concepts and theories that can
lead to more empirical theories, and eventually (at least potentially) to scientific laws. Thus,
starting with concepts and their contextual applications is a critical place to start in the process of
discoverable theories and laws: “As evidence accumulates in support of theory, we
simultaneously come to a better understanding both of the world and of our ideas about the
world.” (Kaplan, 1964, p. 65)

2.6.1

Two Managerial Research Studies from the Field of Business

The library studies reviewed here collect useful data on the knowledge, skills, and behaviors
needed to serve as a manager at various levels of the public library organization, although it is
certainly not enough to warrant any conclusions or create any definitive models or lists yet.
Situating the participants’ data within the leadership and competency/characteristic studies, as
discussed here, certainly provides an important context within the library management research
field itself and gives helpful suggestions on the direction of future research, as do the conclusions
in Chapter 5. Moreover, providing qualitative data from the viewpoint of practicing public
library managers only strengthens some of the findings of these studies. Yet, this stress on
competency lists, criticized by several authors, seems to lead inevitably to training programs and
more effective LIS education without any indication in the public library field that competencies
and formal learning programs are the best way to create quality public library managers. This
study suggests that, while both of these formal learning situations are and can be helpful, they are
only one piece of the puzzle that creates proficient front-line public library managers, and they
are likely only a small piece. The library research is in contrast to business research, in which
there have been numerous qualitative and quantitative studies to show how managers learn the
knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to be successful. A major purpose of this study is to
begin to create the same foundation for public library management research.
The public library has become such a complex and unique organization today that
managers need to take the best practices from business, public administration, and the non-profit
and educational fields to find and develop the unique set of knowledge, skills, and behaviors
necessary to manage in the public library setting. Thus, while the studies here speak directly to
libraries and their management (and a few even to public libraries exclusively), these only touch
57

on a single aspect or several limited aspects of the development of public library managers.
None of the library studies have explored, researched, or described in any detail the nature of
being a public library manager in today’s complex environment. Moreover, most of these
studies, even though narrow in subject, focus on the director position, not that of a front-line or
middle manager. While there is not an over-abundance of these types of studies in the business
field, the studies published focus on CEOs and other chiefs. There are, however, a few studies
that describe primarily the lower-level managers’ work experiences and create conceptual ideas
and frameworks that can then be tested and validated using different business situations and
methodologies. Thus, the following two major studies from the field of business contribute to
that discipline’s understanding of how managers are developed and provide a conceptual
framework for this study, allowing guidance, insight, and comparisons in order to describe and
situate the processes involved from librarian to proficient manager.

2.6.2

The Transformation from Contributor to Manager

One major study was conducted by Linda A. Hill (2003) and published as the book Becoming a
Manager. She undertook the research because “few systematic or rigorous studies had been
done on the transition to management and that we know surprising little about how managers
learn to do their jobs.” (Hill, 2003, p. 337) The study followed nineteen managers (ten branch
managers in a securities firm and nine sales managers in a computer company) during their first
year as managers. (Hill, 2003, p. 3) Prior to that, all were individual contributors in the same
industries, most in the same organizations. Although the difference between an individual
contributor and a front-line manager can be indistinct, because these managers often also
performed the technical work that they used to do regularly, “it is the formal authority over
58

others and the attendant rights and duties that differentiate the manager from the individual
contributor.” (Hill, 2003, p. 3) Hill (2003) employed a number of qualitative data methods,
including multiple interviews over the year with participants, as well as with their direct
supervisors and subordinates, and observations in the workplace. (Hill, 2003, p. 345-346)
Looking at the popular materials and workshops meant to help new managers, Hill (2003)
found that “most treat management development from the single dimension of task learning,
acquisition of necessary competencies…and establishment of key relationships. Becoming a
manager is largely presented as an intellectual exercise, albeit a demanding one.” (p. 5) The
research, however, did not support that conclusion. Instead, in interviewing these nineteen
managers, “it becomes quite clear that the transition to manager is not limited to acquiring
competencies and building relationships. Rather is constitutes a profound transformation, as
individuals learn to think, feel, and value as mangers.” (Hill, 2003, p. 5) While working through
this personal transformation, the managers mastered four main areas:
•
•
•
•

Learning what it means to be a manager,
Developing interpersonal judgment,
Gaining self-knowledge, and
Coping with stress and emotion. (Hill, 2003, p. 6)
Further, Hill (2003) saw that their learning was “the sort of learning after which an

individual conceives of something in a qualitatively different way, and which has a lasting
influence.

Moreover, this learning goes beyond the intellectual sense: it involves being

acquainted with something experientially.” (p. 7) Their constant interaction with the four areas
above and the learning taking place among them became part of their overall transformation into
a manager, which in turn, became part of their learning and development from which “came the
erosion of one set of beliefs, attitudes, and values and the build up of another.” (Hill, 2003, p. 7)

59

It was this qualitative approach, with few preconceived ideas about this transition from
contributor to manager that allowed Hill to observe and describe how these nineteen new
managers coped and learned in their first year. From these interviews and observations came a
clearer picture—holistic, complex, and even a little messy—that allowed Hill to build this
framework of transformation and experiential learning.

Moreover, Hill’s focus on new

managers, instead of senior or more seasoned ones, also created a more complete picture of those
positions as compared with in-depth studies of senior managers and executives. Hill remarks in
this book, as well as in her other articles (2003, 2004, 2007), about the importance of the first
management job, which for most new managers will begin a career of many managerial
transitions. This first position is where they begin to develop not only multiple managerial
knowledge, skills, and behaviors but also begin to design their personal managerial style and
values. It is also from where most of the reports of “incompetence, burnout, and excessive
attrition” comes. (Hill, 2003, p. 2)

2.6.3

Reflections of Executives

The second major study, a combination of data from four studies, was completed prior to Hill’s
study and was used as one of the primary resources for her study. In 1988, McCall, Lombardo,
and Morrison used data and findings to create a framework and offer advice in the book Lessons
of Experience: How Successful Executives Develop on the Job. Interestingly, the introduction
was written by Warren Bennis who stated that “the executives the authors describe and quote
are…people who regard everything — from bad bosses to crises to triumphs — as an
opportunity to learn…” (McCall, et. al., 1988, p. x) Moreover, “…the principle merit [of the
book is that] the primary responsibility for effective management development resides in the
60

managers themselves. There are many things a corporation can do…to encourage its talented
executives, but only if the talent is there and willing and able to develop itself.” (McCall, et. al.,
1988, p. x)
The research began in 1981 with a question about whether the corporations with which
they were working thought they had enough managers coming up through the ranks to fill open
and soon-to-open executive positions. McCall, et al. (1988) began “down a tortuous research
path that went from interviews to open-ended surveys to mailed questionnaires, that started with
three but eventually involved more than a dozen Fortune 500 corporations…” (p. 6) Ultimately,
the foundation of their book is based on the data and findings of four separate studies that
interviewed 191 executives from six major corporations who gave information on 616 events
that led to 1,547 lessons. (McCall, et. al., p. 6)
Many of the conclusions of Hill’s research, including her two main themes of personal
transformation and learning from experience, are also conclusions of McCall, et al.; yet, the
approaches of the two studies are very different. Instead of speaking with new managers as Hill
did, to catch glimpses of the learning as it happened and often needing to translate what is going
on because as the new managers are in the thick of their learning and not always able to
recognize what is happening for themselves, McCall, et. al. interviewed the opposite end of the
spectrum — the long-standing, seasoned executives — asking them to reflect on those
transitional, learning, and pressure-filled points that still resonated with them, even years later.
One could argue that they may have forgotten too much over the course of their careers; on the
other hand, it could be said that only those distinct (and many probably painful) points are never
forgotten and thus hold the pieces needed to see the entire picture of how a manager develops
and changes in response to situations and challenges over time.

61

From these interviews, McCall, et al. created a framework from which executives, over
the course of a career, learn to become managers as well as prepare to become executives. The
three main experiences during which the majority of learning and growth into a managerial
position took place were 1) assignments and jobs that made the managers stretch and challenged
them developmentally; 2) bosses (and others) both good and bad who modeled behaviors that
allowed managers to learn how to adapt to them as well as analyze them for potential
application; and 3) hardships that basically knocked them solidly to the ground requiring them to
not only stand up but also to learn from them in order to move forward more successfully.
One of the pieces McCall, et al. (1988) discovered was that managerial development
could rely on formal education or training only in very specific instances and that this education
or training did not have much of an impact on most managers’ knowledge or skills. (p. 12) For
those who did reference a valuable training experience, the difference between valuable and not
valuable “hinged on timing, such that whatever was being learned had a direct bearing on
something the executive wanted to accomplish.” (McCall, et. al., 1988, p. 12) For others, when
they referenced valuable training, “the most potent lessons from the classroom involved
increasing self-confidence,” instead of teaching them something new or providing new
knowledge or skills. (McCall, et. al., 1988, p. 181)
While these executives identified a number of examples from long careers, for many the
most vivid were those in their first or early managerial positions, or other instances when they
were required to accomplish something that they had never done before and they did not have the
skills at the outset to get it done. Most of these early work experiences were characterized by
three areas in which learning was likely to take place:
•

The first glimpse of the organization as a whole and the realities of what that meant;

62

•
•

The discovery of the joys and difficulties of working with people (new bosses, new peers,
subordinates for the first time who could have formerly been peers, and/or vendors); and
Some kind of confrontation with the new realities embedded in the two situations
described above. (McCall, et. al., 1988, p. 21-22)

As described and categorized by McCall, et. al. (1988), these lessons, many of which stayed with
executives throughout their careers, included learning what aspects of the business were not
interesting thus potentially impacting future career paths (p. 24), learning to supervise people (p.
27), learning to lead through persuasion instead of exerting managerial authority (p. 31),
recognizing that one cannot be the expert on all things and reliance on other’s expertise is
necessary (p. 33), coming to live with and accept ambiguity (p. 38), and learning to understand
and navigate organizational bureaucracies and culture. (p. 39-40)
Similar to Hill’s new managers, these executives learned to become managers not in a
classroom, but through experiences on the job that were then reflected upon and formulated into
lessons that could be applied in other situations. Both sets of managers applied a variety of tools
to make these lessons “stick” and make them useful in the long-term, such as conversations with
supervisors and mentors; feedback from supervisors, peers, mentors, and subordinates; selfassessment and reflection; correcting mistakes; and occasionally, from a formal educational
setting. The success of these tools to create an experience from which a manager learned
required one basic thing: the manger was driven to learn the lessons presented in the experiences.
As McCall, et. al. (1988) states:
It’s one thing to make a list of lessons, quite another to master them. These lessons are
not delivered with spellbinding clarity; they must be dug out of complex, confusing,
ambiguous situations. Even when they are delivered up, they are tough to incorporate.
Especially for executives, learning is a murky business, occurring in fits and starts over
time. Lessons accumulate, evolve, affect one another, gain potency in combination, don’t
take the first time, atrophy, and get forgotten. Some are much tougher to learn than
others, and the toughest part of all may be using what one has learned to make a
difference on the job. (p. 9)

63

2.6.4

Conclusion of Frameworks

The Hill and McCall et al. studies provided the initial framework which contributed to building
the diary entries (Appendix B) and Interview Guide (Appendix C), as well as the Provisional
Coding Guide (Appendix E). Following the collection of all primary data and the creation of
codes, categories, and themes, the data was reviewed again, using the Provisional Coding Guide,
noting the areas of strong similarities and differences. The two areas most similar are the
influence of developmental assignments and good/bad bosses on the journey to proficiency. The
most notable differences are the incomplete transformation from producer to manager (as
described by Hill), the level of emotion attached to the work of public libraries, and the
significant role that community and customers play. These are all discussed in further detail in
Chapter 4.
As further explained in the next chapter, in qualitative studies each piece of data, as well
as each step in the process, moves the research project forward while simultaneously
encouraging the researcher to examine what actions have been completed, what data have been
collected, and what reflective thoughts were written with a view to assessing and correcting the
research path ahead. Edmondson and McManus (2007) state that “openness to input from the
field helps ensure that researchers identify and investigate key variables over the course of
study.” (p. 1162) Although these actions took place throughout the research, there were very few
modifications. The process used in this research study, similar to the ADDIE model (Analysis,
Development, Design, Implementation, Evaluation) used by instructional designers, followed
what Edmondson and McManus (2007) set forth as the same concept applied to the research
model, whereas each part of the process revises the previous work and informs the next step. (p.
1174) [See Figure 1.]

Thus, the literature and conceptual frameworks identified here were not only important in
providing important contextual evidence in the appropriate knowledge areas already explored
and developed by others, but they also provided additional language and views beyond the
personal ones collected from the participants and have given a richer narrative texture to the
managers’ stories as well as to the library organization in which they work. Ultimately, all the
pieces consciously chosen at the start of the process, from methodology and data collection tools
to analytic choices and interpretations, were decisions made within the knowledge, judgment,
and bias of the researcher. Kaplan (1964) states, “because so much of behavioral science acts are
interpreted as actions, and because what interpretation is made depends on the understanding of
the interpreter and not just of the actor, the objectivity of the whole undertaking is mistakenly

65

impugned.” (p. 360) To avoid that, the next chapter lays out the details of the research process
and the guiding thoughts of the researcher.

METHODOLOGY

THOUGHTS ON METHODOLOGY: EXPLORING A WORLDVIEW

Given the multiple books and articles discussing and dissecting examples of research paradigms,
worldviews, definitions of reality and “truth,” methodological approaches, data collection tools,
and ways to analyze data, there are enough conflicting ideas, information, and obtuse language to
make a researcher want to give up in the face of discovering her own synthesized analysis and
thoughts in each area. However, when it is necessary to understand and make research decisions
from the firmer ground of a concrete example of a phenomenon, it becomes easier to integrate
those thoughts and conclusions into a spectrum that shows that they are all useful and
appropriate depending on the phenomenon observed and the research questions asked. Each
methodology provides a lock to the phenomenon and the data collection tools are different keys
that reveal the answers to those questions, ultimately unlocking the mysteries of the phenomenon
itself. It is the systemic relationship between the phenomenon as described and the methodology
chosen that makes the tool work. Absent that, the research, as collected through the tools
selected, and the outcomes, based on the methodological views and tools, may miss pieces or
areas of the phenomenon, unable to fully unlock those hidden mysteries. As Kaplan (1964) says
in his book The Conduct of Inquiry, “…the aim of methodology is to help us understand, in the
broadest terms possible, not the products of scientific inquiry but the process itself.” (p. 22) As
67

part of the research process, the inquiry itself — the attempt to describe the observed
phenomenon that prompts important and curious questions about it — becomes the central focal
point, not the methodology or the accompanying ties to the specific disciplines that attach
themselves to the particular tools: “I believe that the most important contribution methodology
can make to science is…to help unlock the roads of inquiry.” (Kaplan, 1964, p. 24)
One idea that Kaplan presents is an alternate way to view qualitative and quantitative
methodologies. By allowing another way for a researcher to think about these approaches absent
the heavy baggage of definitions, disciplines, and critical arguments that currently accompany
them, the researcher is free to begin to find those concealed connections among the phenomenon,
appropriate methodology, and the best tools for the work. Instead of qualitative methodology,
Kaplan (1964) refers to “logic-in-use,” defining it as a cognitive style of the scientist as she
applies logic to a phenomenon in its context as it is “embedded in a matrix of an alogic-in-use,
even an illogic-in-use.” (p. 10)

This is mainly because “not only [does] language and culture

affect the logic-in-use, but also the state of knowledge, the stage of inquiry, and the special
conditions of the particular problem.” (Kaplan, 1964, p. 8) On the other hand, “a reconstructed
logic is not a description but rather an idealization of scientific practice… The reconstruction
idealizes the logic of science only in showing us what it would be if it were extracted and refined
to utmost purity.” (Kaplan, 1964, p. 10-11) Ultimately, in furthering the concept of logic-in-use,
Kaplan (1964) discusses intuition (which could also be defined as a type of tacit knowledge):
“…[W]hat we call ‘intuition’ is any logic-in-use which is (1) preconscious, and (2) outside the
inference schema for which we have readily available reconstructions. We speak of intuition, in
short, when neither we nor the discoverer himself knows quite how he arrives at his discoveries,

68

while the frequency or pattern of their occurrence makes us reluctant to ascribe them merely to
chance.” (p. 14)
His discussion of the logic-in-use (as observed in action by the researcher or others)
versus the constructed logic that the researcher creates out of the study of logic-in-use (which by
its nature becomes idealized when removed from its context) argues that both have their place;
but, in fact, more must be done to look at the logic-in-use and understand it there within the
context without immediately moving to the constructed logic, which by its definition is where
scientific method lives. More importantly, as Kaplan has described this process, methodology is
a tool used to leverage information and data from the phenomenon studied but, as a tool, cannot
be raised or praised any higher. Any elevation of status subsumes the origination of the inquiry
and, in fact, the inquiry itself. Instead, these tools are meant to unlock the “truth” of the
particular phenomenon, as seen and experienced by the participants of a given study. Many tools
or approaches may work to do this. Methodology, then, is the act of picking the right mix to best
reveal those answers and experiences. Hence, like any teacher or trainer, the researcher must
have a solid array of tools in her toolkit to pick the right ones for the given phenomenon and its
ancillary curiosities. So, the research quest must be two-fold: (1) to understand the context and
insights of the phenomenon as observed and revealed and (2) to know the array of potential
approaches and tools that will work best to reveal the phenomenon further.
In the case of this particular phenomenon (the transition of librarians to front-line public
library managers and how they build proficient knowledge, skills, and behaviors), the context in
which the managers learn, adapt, and grow as well as their internal analyses and syntheses that
lead to observable and demonstrable actions is a critical foundational step in public library
management research that does not currently exist. Thus, finding methodologies and tools that

69

keep the research as close to Kaplan’s logic-in-use is equally critical to garnering the most
appropriate data and potential insights to the phenomenon.
Put another way, the study aims to unpack the front-line public library manager’s
knowledge, as defined by Orna and Stephens (2009) as “the organized results of experience,
which we use to guide our actions and our interactions with the outside world… We do that by
transforming our knowledge, and the result of transformation is information, that is, knowledge
which has been put into the outside world and made visible and accessible through a series of
transformations.” (p. 14) Following Orna and Stephens’ concept of transforming knowledge into
information to externalize it means that a study such as this relies heavily on the participants’
abilities to reflect on that knowledge and transform it into information that can then be shared
with the researcher. [See Figure 2.]
Thus, telling the stories of these individual managers’ experiences, focusing on their
transformation into a manager, what they did to adapt to new job requirements, and gain new
knowledge, and then apply those lessons to their day-to-day activities, must inform not only the
methodology but also the tools used to obtain these stories, experiences, and processes as well as
the methods of analysis and reporting of the data. Therefore, the data analysis and reporting
focuses on the importance of the stories of these managers’ experiences as they have learned to
not only become managers, but also to learn new aspects of their work as impacted by a new
Strategic Plan and the resulting changes. As Seidman (2006) states:
Most simply put, stories are a way of knowing… Telling stories is essentially a meaningmaking process. When people tell stories, they select details of their experience from their
stream of consciousness… It is this process of selecting constitutive details of experience,
reflecting on them, giving them order, and thereby making sense of them that makes telling
stories a meaning-making experience. (p. 7)

It really is each person’s own story, combined or recognized in those of others’ stories, from
which people begin to develop meaning. Moreover, from a research perspective, it is from the
collected stories from multiple places (or “cases”) that any kind of concept of the
transformational managerial thought or process can be developed. As in all research areas, there
must be the development of a preponderance of data to create theory, and none of these kinds of
data currently exists in public library management. Thus, one of the main contributions of this
study is increasing the foundational knowledge of public library managers.
Therefore, developing not only rich experiential stories from multiple subunits, but also
collecting of each subunit’s data contributes to larger findings across these subunits, including a
better understanding of what proficiency means for practitioners. These component pieces have
been blended together to help multiple librarians become managers within this specific
organization. Moreover, the importance of the peer group began emerging almost immediately
from data collected and allowed the research to focus equally on the single library organization.
71

Finally, it was critical to represent these individual cases as accurately and as close to
their contexts as possible (to the logic-in-use) so that all the variables that impacted any given
manager, as well as the linkages between their external inputs, syntheses and analyses of a given
experience, and their application of the “lessons” from that process, could be identified. As
conceptual frameworks for the study, Kaplan (1964) reminds us, “[w]hether a concept is useful
depends on the use we want to put it to; but there is always the additional question whether
things so conceptualized will lend themselves to that use. And this is the scientific question.” (p.
51) As mentioned earlier, for this researcher, the process of becoming a manager, let alone a
proficient one, was a long and complex process. It was critical to look not just across the
subunits only for commonalities, jump to conclusions, or make assumptions from one to another,
but to explore the idea of these concepts within a public library, which has shown itself to be a
highly complex organization. Without these attempts at in-depth inquiry from the viewpoint of
the managers themselves, the general inquiry of how front-line public librarians become
proficient managers potentially would have led to a faulty reconstructed logic, simplifying a
process before it is truly understood.

3.2

A DESCRIPTIVE QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY

Yin (2009) states that a case study methodology is appropriate when the study is “an empirical
inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon in-depth and within its real-life context,
especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident.” (p.
18) In this study, given that the research pursuit of understanding the journey from librarian to
proficient manager required looking at both individuals and the organization in which they work,
72

a single case study with embedded subunits was identified as the best fit. This allowed each
individual participant to be viewed as a smaller independent unit of analysis within their context.
Choosing a particular public library as the single case allowed a deeper understanding of the
environment in which the participants operated and the impact the library has had on both the
group of participants and the individual participants. As Kaplan (1964) points out, “the analysis
of meanings must…focus on the particular contexts in which the action is performed, and on the
purposes which the actions as a whole is meant to achieve.” (p. 46) Further, “the ability to look
at subunits that are situated within a larger case is powerful when you consider that data can be
analyzed within the subunits separately (within case analysis), between the different subunits
(between case analysis), or across all of the subunits (cross-case analysis),” which are the main
areas of focus of the findings, as laid out in Chapter 4. (Baxter and Jack, 2008, p. 550)
Moreover, it is important to recognize that in scientific inquiry, the researcher does not
“start from scratch” but in fact, she must start from where she finds herself and the phenomenon.
(Kaplan, 1964, p. 86) Thus, the researcher carries along a number of notions, or presuppositions,
already even before the research begins:
The task is not to move from wholesale ignorance to knowledge, but from less
knowledge to more, from knowledge of some things to knowledge of others, from the
vague and uncertain to what is clear and warranted. We presuppose, in every inquiry, not
only a set of data but also a set of generalizations, both about our materials and about the
instruments by which they are to be transformed in the cognitive enterprise. We draw our
presuppositions from earlier inquiries, from other sciences, from everyday knowledge,
from the experiences of conflict and frustration which motivated our inquiry, from habit
and tradition, from who knows where. (Kaplan, 1964, pp. 86-87)
Prior to this research, there were more personal observation and experiences than data, empirical
or otherwise. The phenomenon, that public librarians do transform into front-line managers, has
been acknowledged but was not sufficiently probed or described in a way that makes the creation
of concepts, theories, or even a deeper understanding and knowledge possible, let alone
73

probable. Therefore, one of the presuppositions this study carried was that a deeper description
of the phenomenon is critical to a wider empirical understanding and the way to accomplish this
understanding is to employ qualitative methodological approaches and tools.

3.2.1

The Case and Embedded Units

As described earlier, public libraries in urban and suburban environments serve the vast majority
of the U.S. population. Furthermore, those libraries as organizations are large enough to have
multiple layers of management. Thus, because of the focus and approach of the study, it was
important that the library be large enough to have a range of public service managers who have
been in such positions for varying periods of time. The public library selected for study is the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (CLP) which is situated in the Eastern Time Zone of the U.S. in a
city of 300,000+ people and with 1,000,000+ residents in Allegheny County, all of whom can
use the library through a consortial agreement. According to the demographic and statistical
breakdowns used by Hennen’s American Public Library Ratings and based on the library service
area defined by the Institute of Museums and Library Services, CLP is classified in the “250 K”
category (with a service population between 250,000 and 499,999) along with 104 other
libraries, which places it in the second tier. (There are 84 libraries in the highest tier of service
populations over 500,000. 2) From this information, CLP can be described as a larger mid-size
public library serving a mid-sized U.S. city.

In this way, it is an ideal candidate as a

representative case. A feature that makes CLP unique, at least in the last five years of economic
downturn and slow recovery, is that unlike the majority of public libraries that have had

2

74

shrinking budgets, laid off staff, and/or closed buildings, CLP was supported by voters who
approved a levy by a sizable margin and is thus more stable economically than many other
libraries in the country. This circumstance can be considered an advantage for this study because
it means managers have been able to focus on their day-to-day work and activities and not be
overwhelmed by constant budgetary talks and issues.
Another feature that made this public library well-suited for the study, although not
unique, is that the organization conducted a year-long strategic planning process following the
passage of the levy and is now in the midst of implementing the goals and outcomes of the plan.
That CLP is undergoing transition has necessitated the managers adapt, change, and learn new
information, processes, tasks, and approaches to their work, and this transition has given many of
the participants a focus of exploration and a willingness to discuss this transition with the
researcher.
At the time of the launch of the research in May 2014, CLP had a staff of 533 (436 FTE)
with 89 considered to be managers. 3 As mentioned earlier, Hill (2003) states that “it is the
formal authority over others and the attendant rights and duties that differentiate the manager
from the individual contributor,” and thus, only managers who supervise other staff were
considered for the study. ( p. 3) Further, the study focused on a particular group of managers, the
39 who directly supervise public services staff and who work primarily ensuring quality library
services for the community and overseeing the staff that provides those services. Not all,
however, are master-degreed librarians, and because one major element of the study is to explore
how librarians transition to managers, only those with master degrees were considered, bringing
the total population of this study to 31 managers. One position was unfilled at the time of the

3

This information was gathered through a conversation with the CLP Human Resources.

75

launch; only 30 positions were included in the final total. While there is not a methodological
reason that required the research to limit the population to those of a similar background, the
decision was made primarily because with similar educational backgrounds, participants could
be comparable subunits. Given some of the findings and the possible future studies that can
develop from this research, replications of this study could include staff in the same or similar
positions who do not have master’s degrees (but may hold other degrees) to compare the
transitional steps between those who come from the field of library science and those who come
from other educational backgrounds, such as business or public administration.
Thus, this case study focuses on analysis and outcomes that give rich descriptions of the
experiences of front-line public library managers from a single organization as they have learned,
grown, adapted, and gained knowledge and proficiency in their work. The study also provides
an overall description of the organization itself in relation to these managers and discusses the
influences it has had on these particular individual experiences, as well as the impact the
adapting front-line managers have had on the organization itself. Using the Hill and McCall, et.
al. studies as a conceptual framework, the data describe the ways in which front-line public
library managers make the transitional journey from librarian to manager both in similar and
dissimilar ways from those in the field of business. These similarities and differences further
bolster the idea that, while public libraries have some operational similarities to businesses as do
managers who work there, public libraries are more complex with elements that do not lend
themselves exactly to a business model, which results in notable differences in the areas
requiring proficiency.

3.3

POPULATION, SAMPLE, AND DATA COLLECTION TOOLS

From the thirty managers who opted to participate, a purposive sample was chosen to collect
more in-depth data from individuals who were representative, demographically and/or
experientially. The first step in the research process was meeting with the entire population as a
group, which at that time was made up of 24 women and 6 men, including 8 working in the Main
Library, 19 in the branches, and 3 in systemwide positions. The CLP top administrators were
supportive of the study and provided an hour of a regularly scheduled meeting of branch
managers, to which other members of the population were specifically invited.

At this

information session on May 21, 2014, the researcher explained the study and provided the
managers with a consent form describing the details of the study. The study had already been
approved by the University of Pittsburgh’s Institutional Review Board. [See Appendix A for a
copy of the approved consent form.] She explained that they could choose to participate, could
withdraw from the project at any time until the submission of the dissertation, and would be
provided with their transcripts to edit or clarify. She also explained the process and tools used to
collect the data, the length of time of the study as well as the time the participants would need to
commit. (Senior administrators approved work time to complete the diaries and interviews.)
She stressed her expectation of thoughtful and honest answers and explained how confidentiality
and anonymity of both individual participants and organizational would be maintained. Finally,
she discussed of how data would be handled, how long it would be kept, and for what purposes
the data might be used beyond the dissertation. Following this meeting, the identified managers
were given a short period of time in which they could agree to participate and sign the consent
form, although a large number signed the consent form immediately after the meeting. Six
managers were not able to attend the meeting, and they were immediately sent an email detailing
77

the information along with the option to speak with the researcher before making a decision to
participate. Ultimately, only three managers decided not to participate; all were female — one
Main Library manager, one branch manager, and one holding a systemwide managerial position.

3.3.1.1 Phase 1: Using Participant Diaries to Collect Data
Participants were asked to compose three reflective diary entries, which were sent as a Microsoft
Word document via email. The first was sent on June 2, the second on June 10, and the third on
June 20. [See Appendix B for a copy of the first diary entry as the participants received it,
including instructions, as well as a complete list of the diary prompts.] Each of the three diary
entries was planned to take no more than 1.5 hours to complete, and participants were
encouraged to return one diary entry before the next one was sent, although they were given the
option of completing all three by June 30. For a variety of personal and professional reasons, six
of the participants either did not complete phase 1 in its entirety or chose to withdraw. Twentyone participants continued to phase 2.
Individual diaries have long been accepted in certain methodologies, such as life
histories, biographical studies, and literary and social histories. These diaries have not been
78

solicited by a researcher; but, instead, have been created by “individuals [to] document their
daily lives and experiences [most often for] personal recollection...” (Kenten, 2010, p. 2)
However, the diary as solicited by a researcher for the purpose of collecting intimate, unseen,
and/or highly detailed data, particularly as it is taking place, has increased steadily, especially by
“psychologists, sociologists, health care researchers, market researchers, and information
scientists.” (Lewis, et. al., 2005, p. 217) Even business research delving into management
topics, particularly in the areas of identifying and describing the elements of managerial work
and how managers spend their time, has employed solicited diaries with some frequency. (Hales
1986)
These types of solicited diaries, then, are “typically very structured, cover a specific time
period, and require the diarists to collect very detailed microdata.” (Lewis, et. al., 2005, p. 217)
However, diaries can and are used to collect data about processes, especially those processes that
are not completely revealed through observable action, allowing “diaries...[to] go beyond
counting and collecting to enable the diarist to describe and reflect.” (Lewis, et. al., 2005, p. 217)
Further, solicited diaries may also “increase the visibility and significance of routine or everyday
processes which might be regarded as mundane aspects of everyday life.” (Kenten, 2010, p. 3)
Most importantly, a solicited diary as a data tool embedded in a research project is “not
solely the product of the participant rather they are constructed by the author and by the
researcher through their design, content, and analysis.” (Kenten, 2010, p. 3) It was this sort of
collaboration that attracted Zimmerman and Wieder (1977) to explore diaries as a research tool:
“The rationale of the diary approach involves more fully, exploiting the subject as both observer
and informant… Completed diaries functioned for us in a way similar to the field notes turned in

79

by our regular research assistants. Diarists thus served as adjunct ethnographers of their own
circumstances.” (p. 484)
While the evolution of solicited diaries as research tools (whether structured through
explicit writing prompts and instructions or open for the participants to write what they want
within the bounds of the study) has moved to encompass more than activity and time logs,
including the detailed actions of participants as they happen as well as the accompanying thought
processes that have prompted these actions, the vast majority of these studies that employ diaries
are primarily focused on capturing thoughts and actions as they happen, minimizing the
“vagaries of time on memory…recall or memory errors.” (Kenten, 2010, p3) Thus, the studies
continue to embrace the primary argument set forth by Zimmerman and Wieder (1977) that
states diaries can be used “for those situations where the problems of direct observation resist
solution, or where further or more extended observation strains available resources...” (p. 481)
The use of diaries, however, could be extended further. Instead of relying on diaries to
focus solely on the present, these can also be used reflectively, encouraging participants to focus
on significant events and transformations that have passed, particularly among managers who
have performed managerial work for a longer period of time.

As McCall, et. al. (1988)

discovered in researching how successful CEOs and other executive managers gained their
knowledge, skills, and behaviors, “even though early work experiences and first supervisory jobs
were long ago and far away, many executives still considered them to have been pivotal
developmental experiences.” (p. 20) In the course of an interview, the participant may not
always recall immediately what is the most significant event and/or the details surrounding it.
They can, however, recall more information and details, or how the event impacted thoughts and
actions after the interview has concluded. A diary, on the other hand, gives the participant time

80

for these reflections and reconstructions to take place without the pressure of the immediacy of
an interview.

Furthermore, by using a diary as a precursor to in-depth interviewing, the

participant has a better idea of what types of information the researcher is seeking and what the
interview might include.
Using diaries as an entry into exploring ideas with a follow-up interview is not a new
one, although it too seems to be as equally underutilized as a research tool as a solicited diary has
been. Zimmerman and Wieder (1977) developed this technique which they named the “diary:
diary-interview” method. (p. 481) Not only did the diaries act as observers when the researchers
or assistants were unavailable and formed a type of collaboration between the researchers and the
participants, they also acted as the foundation for follow-up interviews: “The diary interview
converts the diary — a source of data in its own right — into a question-generating and, hence,
data-generating device.” (Zimmerman & Wieder, 1977, p. 489) Thus, the diary entries are read
not only for the purposes of coding and analysis but also as a font of information from which
questions can be developed to probe certain thoughts, processes, and actions which, in turn, can
provide richer details and descriptions of the phenomenon being studied.
There are a number of associated disadvantages with using diaries in a research study.
The primary disadvantage is the potential time factor in keeping a diary, even for a short time. A
second disadvantage is the literacy level of the participants and closely related is the quality of
the written contribution, given that not all people are as articulate in writing as they may be when
speaking. The design of this study (along with educated speculation) attempted to address these
issues. Zimmerman and Wieder’s (1977) study of the California counter-culture found that
participants “…had at least some college or university training; many had bachelor’s degrees and
some had gone on to post-graduate training. Moreover, virtually all of them came from middle-

81

and upper-middle-class business and professional families. Thus, the task of maintaining a diary
was perhaps not inconsistent with their education and background.” (p. 486) Likewise, the
population of this study, known to have master’s degrees and holding positions in which writing
is part of the work, had no issues completing the diaries electronically and articulating their
experiences clearly and succinctly.
Further, as public librarians, the participants have been part of a profession and tradition
of helping others achieve their goals. Their contribution of participating in this study returns to
them and their profession information that could help them and others who follow them become
more successful managers, which was noted by many of the participants. Similarly, Lewis,
Sligo, and Massey’s (2005) study of New Zealand dairy farmers’ understanding of technological
learning found the participants (in both their diaries and interviews) to be:
well-educated, sophisticated in their understanding of the way in which research could
contribute to better farming practice, accepted the publication goals inherent in the study,
and understood what was needed to make a contribution to the research. For this reason
they saw themselves more as collaborators in the research, rather than merely as sources
of data, which probably encouraged them to make a more in-depth assessment of the
issues surrounding [technological learning]. (p. 222)
By meeting with potential participants face-to-face in a group with their peers, the researcher
built rapport with the participants and encouraged them to view participation as a peer effort.
Asking them to see what the dairy farmers said — that they would be collaborators in providing
data and information that can contribute significantly to the research on and knowledge of public
library managers — was a convincing and influential factor not only in encouraging them to
participate, but also in completing the study.
To counteract people choosing not to participate or not to complete the diaries because
they did not think they could articulate their thoughts clearly in writing, the researcher explained
carefully at the initial meeting that each participant could write and articulate their answers to the
82

prompts any way she saw fit, as long as these were understandable to the researcher. This meant
that the diary entries were often in more traditional essay format, but occasionally there was a
collection of random thoughts in complete sentences or fragments and bulleted lists. Moreover,
there was no minimum or maximum length set for each entry; thus, two sentences with brief but
solid information was as valuable as two lengthy paragraphs.

All most all entries were

approximately two pages. If an entry was not clear to the researcher, the process allowed for
those participants to be interviewed briefly to clarify or expound on an entry, giving those less
articulate or confident in their writing to have their voices heard and their thoughts shared.
With regard to time, the combination of the desire of participants to contribute
meaningful information to the profession and collaborate on unlocking the process of becoming
a proficient front-line public library manager, along with the limited time they needed to keep
their diary, seemed to encourage most of them to participate and helped them complete diary
entries.

Moreover, the researcher provided a clear timeline, realistic deadlines, and the

maximum amount of time to be spent writing at the initial meeting, thus lessening any surprises
participants could encounter.

3.3.1.2 Using the Critical Incident Technique to Formulate the Structured Diary Entry
Prompts
To help participants focus on the parameters of the study and to provide data that address the
research questions, the diary format for each entry provided a main prompt with two or three
follow-up questions to get them to delve deeper and provide more detailed information. These
prompts borrowed from the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), as first set forth by Flanagan in
1954. (Butterfield, et. al., 2005, p. 475) The “evolution of the CIT research method beyond its
original use as a task analysis tool into the realm of a qualitative exploratory and investigative
83

tool used for psychological constructs and experiences” lent itself well by using it to develop
diary entries. (Butterfield, et. al., 2005, p. 490) The diary prompts asked “participants to reflect
upon and write down the meaning of critical incidents, not just discuss them in an
interview…[to] explore[e] incidents of personal importance and the significance of factors
related to critical incidents.” (Butterfield, et. al., 2005, p. 489)
Thus, the questions posed as prompts in the diary entries focused on encouraging
participants to reconstruct those memorable, vital, and pivotal events, whether they had positive
or negative outcomes, in relation to how they learned key managerial tasks, knowledge, and
behaviors, such as how to supervise staff, give corrective feedback, or influence someone else’s
decision that has an impact on their and/or their staff. Concentrating both on events where they
were successful and those where they were not and learned important lessons that impacted later
actions and decisions, the CIT employed through the diary entries not only allowed a wide
variety and number of critical incidents to be described, but also provided enough information
from each participant that choosing the purposeful sample was somewhat enhanced because the
diary entries were likely to have examples of detailed situations instead of generalities. Finally,
the data from the CIT descriptions provided a broader overview of the population for analysis
and covered an array of situations and events that described steps along the journey from
librarian to proficient manager. For some participants, there were multiple CIT descriptions,
both in the diaries and the interviews, whereas for others, there were only a few major events
(often ongoing) that were so impactful that they delivered a bounty of learning.
These diary entries were analyzed as data points, which are further discussed at the
beginning of the next chapter. From these entries, a purposive sample was selected for phase 2,
the in-depth interviews. Participants’ responses were reread to determine which individuals

84

would be representative either through a combination of survey information and journal
responses revealing where they are on their journeys of transition and/or proficiency or through
specific diary responses of how they have achieved knowledge, skills, or behaviors.

This

solution proved to be much more difficult than anticipated as each participant brought both
unique pieces and substantive similarities already emerging from the data. Given enough time,
all twenty-one participants could have been included in phase 2, further enriching these data,
especially through the inclusion of profiles. Instead, the ten participants for phase 2 were chosen
based on demographic data to assure a mix of both males and females, Main and branch
managers, and new and more mature managers. Thus, of the ten participants interviewed indepth, there are 3 men and 7 women; 2 work as Main department managers and 8 work in the
branches (7 as managers and 1 as the manager of a Children’s Room under a branch manager),
with one manager serving less than a month when the research began to a manager ready to retire
after 35 years in the organization, with over half these years as a manager.
For the eleven who were not chosen, the researcher met with each to conduct a clarifying
interview. These interviews were approximately from thirty minutes to an hour and fifteen
minutes and allowed the researcher to verify details of events described in the diaries or ask for
an example of statements made.

Further, and more importantly, the researcher had the

opportunity to question her own assumptions, which had occasionally led to a misreading of the
data, and have these assumptions corrected by the participants (discussed below in the Validity
section). All interviews (except one which occurred late in August because of scheduling issues)
took place in July, before phase 2 began.

85

3.3.2

Data from the Purposive Sample

As stated above, ten participants were chosen, representing one third of the study population.
The two in-depth interviews with these participants became a major piece of the primary data
collected for the study. The first interview was semi-structured with the same open-ended
questions asked of all interviewees, two of which were added because of information provided in
most of the diary entries: (1) the definition of the “big picture,” a phrase used by the majority of
participants and (2) the role comfort level and confidence plays in each person’s measurement of
proficiency. The second interview, unstructured and unique for each interviewee, followed up
on the diary entries and the first interview and allowed deeper probing in specific areas and
thoughts of the interviewees to gather richer descriptions. The time between the first and second
interview was approximately two weeks, allowing time for both the researcher and interviewee
to reflect, as well as time for the researcher to prepare the first transcript and send it to the
participant. Again, because of scheduling conflicts, interviews for two participants were three
weeks apart and the interview for one participant was one week apart.

3.3.2.1 Phase 2: Using Formal Interviews to Collect Data
In this study, diaries were engaged for three purposes. First, they allowed data to be collected
across a larger segment of the population, providing data triangulation with a non-interviewee
participant’s information supporting an interviewee’s in-depth descriptions of thoughts, actions,
or processes. Second, they provided enough information to allow a meaningful purposive
sample to be chosen including creating a stratified sample dependent on the combination of
demographic data and diaries entries. Third, the diaries created a foundation from which to
launch the interviews. As Zimmerman and Wieder’s (1977) description of the diary: diary86

interview technique shows, “the diary interviews were a process of expansion, i.e., filling in
details that were omitted [from the diary entry]…[but] they led beyond the particular events
recorded touching on attitude, belief, knowledge, and experience of a more general character.”
(p. 491)
Unlike Zimmerman and Wieder’s reasoning for matching diary and interview tools
together, which allowed the participant to act as a surrogate participant-observer because of the
timing of many activities and the ability of researchers to be available twenty-four hours a day,
the pairing of the diary and the interview in this study was because the majority of the aspects of
the processes (learning the pieces of being a front-line public library manager and becoming
proficient) are primarily internal and have happened over lengthy periods of time making
observation as a data tool an impossibility. Hatch (2002) states, “qualitative researchers use
interviews to uncover the meaning structures that participants use to organize their experiences
and make sense of their worlds.

Those meaning structures are often hidden from direct

observation and taken for granted by participants, and qualitative interview techniques offer tools
for bringing these meanings to the surface.” (p. 91) Interviewing, then, was the most appropriate
tool that could uncover and explore what was and might be entailed. Further, these are highly
complex processes with triggers, events, and situations, moving the processes of becoming a
manager and gaining proficiency along in a variety of ways and time frames. Likewise, there are
very few tools other than interviewing that can produce the appropriate data: “Tracing a process,
finding key events and turning points, figuring out chains of causation, all require careful indepth interviewing.” (Rubin & Rubin, 2012, p. 50)
Seidman (2006) states that interviewing is a “basic mode of inquiry [as] recounting
narratives of experience has been the major way throughout recorded history that humans have

87

made sense of their experience.” (p. 8) It is the only way to explore how a person takes in
information, creates knowledge, and then applies it through actions. Thus, “the purpose of indepth interviewing is not to get answers to questions, nor to test hypotheses, and not to ‘evaluate’
as the term is normally used, [but instead] at the root of in-depth interviewing is an intersect in
understanding the lived experience of other people and the meaning they make out of that
experience.” (Seidman, 2006, p. 9)
Instead of using more common classifications of interviewing (structured, unstructured,
and semistructured), Hatch (2002) describes the three formats of interviewing as informal,
formal, and standardized. (p. 92) For the purposes of this study, a formal approach was the most
appropriate. Hatch (2002) breaks down qualitative formal interviewing as having three essential
elements: structured, semistructured, and in-depth. (p. 92) These interviews were structured in
that they are “planned events” that take place at pre-determined times and locations, away from
the location where the interviewees’ day-to-day activities (and are often the context of what is
being studied). Only a few interviews took place in the branch or department where the manager
worked. The majority took place either in a small meeting room in the Director’s Office at Main
Library or in a small meeting room on the sixth floor of the Information Sciences building at the
University of Pittsburgh, with the choice determined by each interviewee. The interviews also
were considered semistructured because guiding questions in identified topical areas were asked,
followed up by probes meant to elicit further details and meaning. Finally, they were considered
to be in-depth because most qualitative studies are about the depth and rich descriptions of the
phenomenon being studied, not the breadth of it; and thus, the interviews followed that lead.
This study, following the Zimmerman and Wieder concept of the diary: diary-interview
method, also heeded the advantages of conducting more than one interview with those in the

88

sample.

The first interview focused on a few topic areas addressing the specific areas

encompassed in the research questions:
•
•
•
•

The influential ways in which public library managers gain knowledge, proficiency, and
expertise,
What they believe are the critical knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to be a
successful public library manager,
How they view leadership and role it plays in their daily work, and
How they make meaning out of their challenges and experiences and apply those “lessons
learned.”

Further, the questions probed into the common data found in diary entries, most notably about
the “big picture” and definitions of proficiency.

These questions were asked of all ten

interviewees and in the same order, although the exact same language was not used each time.
Using this approach for the first round of the interviews helped guarantee that there would be
enough data, along with the structured diary entries, to allow comparisons between case subunits
(individuals) and across all case subunits.
The second interview allowed questions and probes from both an interviewee’s diary
entries and first interview that were not asked across most or all second interviews. Instead, the
researcher prepared a separate list of questions for each interviewee the day before the scheduled
interview so that the rereading of the diary entries and the first interview transcript would be
fresh in the researcher’s mind. The primary goals for the second interviews was to collect
specific descriptive and detailed data to further enrich and understand the narrative of each
interviewee’s journey from librarian to managerial proficiency, regardless of where they are on
that path, as well as to clarify any thoughts or comments, similar to the clarification conducted
with the eleven not included in phase 2. Finally, the combination of the two interviews allowed
for higher levels of trust and rapport to build which ultimately yielded more complete, in-depth,
and trustworthy data. As Hatch (2002) explains, “when multiple interviews are scheduled for the
89

same individuals, then analysis of early contacts will inform later interviews and spontaneous
conversation will develop out of researcher-informant rapport.” (p. 102)

3.3.2.2 Using the Responsive Interviewing Model
This study used Rubin and Rubin’s responsive interviewing model as a guide, which is detailed
in their book Qualitative Interviewing: The Art of Hearing Data. They describe responsive
interviewing as an approach that “emphasizes the importance of building a relationship of trust
between the interviewer and the interviewee that leads to more give-and-take in the
conversation… Questions evolve in response to what the interviewees have just said, and new
questions are designed to tap the experience and knowledge of each interviewee.” (Rubin &
Rubin, 2012, p. 36)
The main emphasis of the of the responsive interviewing model, like that of Zimmerman
and Wieder, is to have the participant go beyond being a subject providing data to become a
collaborator in the research project, building a co-construction of each participant’s journey from
librarian to managerial proficiency. Rubin and Rubin (2012) describe it this way:
In building an open and trusting relationship, researcher and interviewee work toward
forming what we term a conversational partnership. This term conveys the respect the
researcher has for the interviewee’s experience and insights and emphasizes that the
interviewing is a joint process of discovery. The term conversational partner also
conveys the idea that each interviewee is an individual with distinct experience,
knowledge, and perspective, not interchangeable with anyone else. In conversational
partnerships, both the interviewee and researcher play an active role in shaping the
discussion, leading to a congenial and cooperative experience in which the interviewee
comes to feel understood, accepted, and trusted as a source of reliable information. (p. 7)

90

3.3.3

Methodological Process and Tools Conclusion

Thus, the study’s attempt to discover and explore the process and nature of public librarians
becoming front-line managers and working to gain proficiency relied heavily on choosing the
right approach and tools to reveal data that could describe the phenomenon as observed and
answer the research questions as set forth. Finding that right key to unlock the mysteries means
that the study can contribute to the knowledge of pubic library management through the journey
not only as it is experienced by individuals, but also by a group of individuals together within an
organization undergoing critical change. The combination of Zimmerman and Wieder’s diary:
diary-interview method, Hatch’s concept of the formal interview, and Rubin and Rubin’s
building conversational partners within the responsive interviewing model did create the best
research framework for gathering the most appropriate data to inform the research questions. It
also created the best guidelines for the researcher: “The researcher’s role is to gather narratives,
descriptions, and interpretations from an array of conversational partners and put them together
in a reasoned way that re-creates a culture or describes a process or a set of events in a way that
participants would recognize as real.” (Rubin & Rubin, 2012, p. 7) Moreover, the combination
of familiarity between researcher and participants because of previous contact and the experience
of the researcher as a librarian and former manager who understood their stories and challenges
in a way that someone from outside the public library field would not ultimately worked together
to build rapport and trust that has resulted in strong and trustworthy data. Such an outcome of a
“real” description not only honors the participants and the information they graciously shared, it
also contributes to the transferability of the outcomes and their potential contributions to the
growing understanding and knowledge of the front-line public library manager’s experience.

DATA AND PARTICIPANT PROTECTION

As part of the development of that rapport and trust with participants, it was critically important
(and reiterated multiple times) that great care would be taken with their data and that they would
be active collaborators in how data would be used. Thus, when reviewing the ethical bounds of a
qualitative study, the two most critical issues were how to address the anonymity and
confidentiality of the participants and the case organization. However, it was also important to
92

recognize that these are not one and the same but have significant differences. Although closely
related, anonymity generally relates to the participants and confidentiality to the data they
provide through a variety of tools — in this case, the diary entries and interviews: “Although
confidentiality and anonymity are often treated as overlapping concepts, there are important
differences between them; confidentiality relates to the protection of information supplied by
research participants from other parties whereas anonymity involves protecting the identity of an
individual or organization by concealing their names or other identifying information.” (Bell &
Bryman, 2007, p. 69) Thus, confidentiality and anonymity were treated separately throughout
the research focusing on different thoughts and protocols.

3.4.1

Confidentiality

Confidentiality in this study is easier to address. First, no data (raw, coded, or otherwise) was
provided to CLP administrators, members of the Board of Directors, or any other party during
this research process, nor will it be provided following the completion of this dissertation.
Likewise, no data from any one participant was shown to any other participant, population
member, or staff; if it had been necessary, a participant’s explicit written permission would have
been sought. In this case, the triangulation interviews conducted with the four administrators did
not reveal any specific data from a specific participant but, instead, those interviews concentrated
on discussing the emerging themes and triangulating whether the viewpoints of the managers
was in accordance with or in contrast to the viewpoints of these administrators. As it turned out,
these viewpoints were in compliance with one another to a remarkable degree.
Furthermore, the study employed member-checking, allowing each participant to have
the opportunity to review her own transcripts to assure accuracy and represented what was said.
93

The participants also had the opportunity at these checkpoints to add or clarify anything they said
or ask to have anything removed because of discomfort or fear of making them vulnerable. This
approach carried through to the profiles that were created using their own language. Seidman
(2006) offers each participant her profile to be sure that it does not “contain anything inaccurate
or unfair to the larger interview…[or] anything in the profile with which the participant is
uncomfortable.” (p. 66)
However, Seidman (2006) suggests caution: “Although…I would not disseminate
anything that a participant told me would make him or her vulnerable, neither would I give the
person automatic censure on matters of interpretation,” instead making general references to
attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors talked about in the interviews but not using the direct quotes from
participants. (p. 66) To fully and accurately represent what participants share, the researcher
must ethically balance that which makes the participant uncomfortable or embarrassed (but not
harmed or made vulnerable) and the integrity of the study: “As in many other aspects of
interviewing research, the researcher has to balance conflicting claims. The interviewer must be
willing to take ownership of the material and be responsible for consequences.” (Seidman, 2006,
p. 66) Keeping Seidman’s advice in mind, while at the same time working to honor the trust that
each participant placed in the hands of the researcher, there were a number of negotiations
between the researcher and the participants, most of whom participated in both phases of the
research, and most notably in the creation of the profiles.

3.4.2

Anonymity

Unfortunately, the decision and success of anonymity is not as straight forward or as easy to
decide.

For most discipline- or professionally-based ethical codes, as well as underlying
94

assumptions for disciplines or professions without such codes, anonymity is a given that the
researcher works to protect, striving to keep both organizational and participant names
anonymous. In reality, however, this is often impossible. First, particularly in qualitative
studies, it is impossible to guarantee complete anonymity of participants. As Seidman (2006)
points out, “the focus of [this kind of] research is the experience of the participants within the
context of their lives. Because a considerable part of that experience may be shared in the
research report, a reader who knows the participant may recognize him or her.” (p. 67)
Secondly, the requirement of the organization’s anonymity, mainly to protect the
individuals involved “…has implications for what can be revealed about an organization. In a
single ethnographic case study [similar to this study], it is extremely difficult to protect the
identity of individual research participants unless a significant amount of detail relating to the
organization is changed.” (Bell & Bryman, 2007, p. 70) The researcher must balance the level at
which she is willing to protect anonymity (whether individually or organizationally) and sacrifice
the accuracy and integrity of the study. This is particularly true for single-case-study-designed
research, such as this one, because “sometimes the meaning of a case cannot adequately be
conveyed without reference to its identifying features, including geographical location, corporate
history and brand image.” (Bell & Bryman, 2007, p. 70)
At its most basic level, and often most important to the participants, creating and
maintaining anonymity at the organizational level, or even the local-area professional level, is
nearly impossible to accomplish. Nespor (2000) describes it best: “…the very activity of doing
extended field work implies a level of public visibility and engagement — of being seen and
presenting oneself as a researcher in certain places, at particular events, with specific people —
that later makes it relatively easy for others to reconstruct identities (of settings if not

95

individuals) from published accounts.” (p. 547) The only way to attempt to disguise participants
and the organization fully is to go to extremes, disengaging identifying markers and pieces of
data (which may be vital to analysis and interpretation), but “to present qualitative research
material in such a way that even the people central to the study are ‘fooled’ by it is to risk
removing those very aspects that make it vital, unique, believable, and at times painfully
personal.” (Wolcott as quoted by Nespor, 2000, p. 548)
Third, anonymity in a case study that is likely to reveal and explore relationships of
participants with others in the organization (e.g., peers, supervisors, administrators, subordinates,
and other staff) cannot exist in a meaningful way if events and situations critical the journey
from librarian to proficient manager are shared with enough detail for the researcher to
understand. Thus, others outside the participant population are not only likely to be aware of at
least some of the managers participating but also to worry because they have no direct access to
the researcher or what is being said. Moreover, for the researcher to secure permission to use the
organization as a research site, the Executive Director, Deputy Director, and Human Resources
Director were all informed, gave permission, and identified the population. Thus, the complexity
and interrelatedness that makes this type of qualitative approach and research questions so
interesting to study also makes it nearly impossible to create a protocol that accomplishes any
level of anonymity at the institutional level.
Likewise, those in the population are all fully aware of the research project because of the
informational meeting to recruit participants. Thus, even those who choose not to participate
were mentioned in diary entries and interviews, mainly because most of the managers have been
with the organization for significant lengths of time and have been previous supervisors for some
those participating in the study. Bell and Bryman (2007) give an example of this: “Network

96

studies…tend to blur the boundaries between individual consent and non-participation because
the non-participation of one individual does not necessarily mean that they will not be included
in the study, since they may feature as a result of their inclusion in other participants’ network
maps.” (p. 68) Hence, many people were indirectly included merely by being mentioned by
other participants and recorded as a piece of data. This situation was the most negotiated piece
between researcher and participants, who were highly concerned not about their own protection
but about those whom they had shared stories (regardless of whether positive or negative) and
had no recourse within the research parameters.

3.4.2.1 Anonymity: At What Price?
Research codes of ethics, however, seem to assume that participants and/or organizations want to
stay anonymous, yet this is not always the case. One reason given in the literature for this
phenomenon is “because making their identity explicit is an important way of retaining
ownership of their stories.” (Bell & Bryman, 2007, p. 69) As with the dairy farmers who kept
diaries of their technological learning efforts, many of the managers in this study felt strongly
about participating as a way to make it easier for those who follow in their footsteps and wanted
to contribute meaningfully to the profession; thus, many also wanted to use their own names.
Moreover, names themselves, whether of a person or a locale, carry certain connotations
and, ultimately, power, especially for those who choose the name. If this is the case, then
changing one name to another (through the use of pseudonyms to protect identity) also carries
with it a certain level of power and, thus, responsibility. In choosing a pseudonym poorly, the
researcher could create the wrong connotations and work against some interpretations and create
generalizations (at best) or stereotypes (at worst) not meant by the researcher. Thus, “…the
social scientist must grapple with the issue of naming, balancing the rights and wishes of
97

respondents with ethical obligations, personal values, a commitment to analytic rigor and
disseminating accurate accounts of our findings.” (Guenther, 2009, p. 413)
In a case study, any attempts to generalize from the outcomes or findings, whether done
by the researcher or reader, should be avoided. While a single case study can and should aim for
transferability, the single case study is not meant to be applied wholesale to other situations,
whether appearing to be completely similar or not.

Therefore, the researcher had to take

precautions against this, including when and how to apply any anonymity protocols which
included “strategically deleting identifying information [which] turns them into useful examples
or illustrations of generalizing theoretical categories, in which they can stand in for social
classes, ethnic groups, genders, institutions, or other theoretical constructs,” which is neither the
purpose nor the goal of this study in particular, and most single case studies in general. (Nespor,
2000, p. 550)
The researcher was also wary of the impact of not working to achieve anonymity may
have during the interpretation and/or report writing phases of the study: “The flip side…is that
the absence of pseudonyms may undermine the analytic vigor of our findings as we work to
present our research in such a way that it is unlikely to injure named respondents. Without the
seeming protection of pseudonyms, researchers may be more likely to censor their evidence at
the expense of making convincing, nuanced arguments.” (Guenther, 2009, p. 413) As many
have mentioned, finding the right balance between the protection of participants’ anonymity and
reporting accurately a study’s findings was key to a successful research process and was in no
way as simple or formulaic as often presented.
Thus, with the permission of the Director, the participants of the study had a say in
whether the organizational name would be used and whether they would use their own name or a

98

pseudonym.

As it was revealed earlier, it is clear that both the administrators and those

participating agreed to let the organizational name be known. If it had not, as mentioned above,
it could have meant some of the data and findings would have needed to either be omitted or
changed in such a way to render the impact meaningless. Interestingly, most of the participants
felt very strongly that the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh should be identified and attached to the
study. A few were a bit nervous lest something negative about the organization come out, but
even those few participants who were not quite as enthusiastic immediately still thought that the
organization had done such important and difficult work in the last few years that the real name
attached to the study would make the discussion of the outcomes that much stronger.
Likewise, the conversations about whether the participant would use her real name or
choose a pseudonym mostly concerned not protecting themselves, but protecting those who were
part of the stories they told, as mentioned above. It meant that enough details needed to be
changed to protect them, especially in those stories that had Human Resources confidentiality
attached and/or the participant needed to change her own name as well as details about where
they worked for those protections to be in place. For the most part, the negotiations between
researcher and participants focused specifically in this area and happened within the last month
prior to the submission of the dissertation. As a result, many details were generalized, names
and gender were often omitted, and a few participants chose to use a pseudonym. For further
protection, each participant is identified using first names only, but whether the name used is real
or a pseudonym is not revealed. Five chose to change their names and sixteen chose to use their
real names. While those within CLP will be able to identify the difference, it does allow more
anonymity outside the organization.

99

3.4.3

Data Confidentiality and Participant Anonymity Protocol

Below is a protocol list of the efforts the researcher took to protect participants and data:
Data Confidentiality
1. All collected participant and triangulation data (e.g., diary entries, interview recordings,
transcripts) were saved and stored on individual devices (the researcher’s non-networked
computer and a USB drive).
a. The exception was the diary entries, which were produced online using Microsoft
Word and sent between researcher and participants via email. Currently, the
documents and emails are saved on the email provider’s web server within the
researcher’s account. Upon successful completion of the dissertation process,
these emails will be deleted and copies of diary entries will be saved to a USB
drive.
b. The “raw” data was not given to any Library administrator, board member, or any
other party during or following the data collection.
c. The “raw” data is not and will not be published in this state without the
participants’ explicit written permission.
d. The “raw” data will not be submitted to any research data archive without the
participants’ explicit written permission.
e. Data (“raw” or unpublished) will be turned over to any non-participants only in
the event of a subpoena in a court case, which is unlikely in a study such as this.
2. The researcher employed member-checking at the following stages:
a. Transcripts from the diary entries.
b. Transcripts from each interview.
c. Profiles created from transcripts listed above.
d. Pertinent sections of preliminary drafts of the final report.
3. All data will be kept and may be used by the researcher without permission beyond the
initial signed consent form for up to three years following the successful completion of
the dissertation for the purpose of publishing journal articles and/or a book, as well as
conference, classroom, and/or webinar presentations. The researcher will make a good
faith effort to contact participants for permission following this three-year period or if the
data is to be used in any other way than mentioned above. Likewise, the researcher will
make a good faith effort to continue to employ member-checking in all further published
materials.
Organization Anonymity
1. Although the initial default of the researcher was to make the organization anonymous,
participants and administrators alike agreed to make the organization known as the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.
Individual Anonymity
1. Following Seidman’s (2006) advice, the researcher followed the assumption that
individuals would be kept as anonymous as possible, given that it could not be
100

guaranteed, particularly locally and within the organization. Following the last interview,
as part of the profile member-check and the distribution of quotes used in the report, the
participants had the option of revealing or concealing their real identities. (p. 69) The
researcher explained this at the information session as well as during the clarifying
interviews for the eleven phase 1 participants and at the end of the second interview for
the rest, where participants had the opportunity to explore the options with the researcher
and ask questions.
2. The initial survey collecting name and other demographic and personal data was one of
three research documents containing the person’s true identity (the second one is the
signed consent form and the third is described below). The survey was done online using
Microsoft Word via email. When returned, a single copy of each was printed and the
only digital copy saved to a USB drive (with a copy also in the researcher’s email
account, which will be handled identically as indicated above with the diary entries). On
the printed copy, the researcher gave each participant an alpha-numeric code, using Iowa
county names and a number 1-27 in the order the surveys were returned. A key that
linked the name with the code was created digitally and the file kept on the USB drive.
3. Throughout the study, the participants were referred to in all notes, memos, writings, and
transcripts by their assigned codes.
Data Security
• All participant-generated data were saved to the researcher’s USB drive.
• The printed key that links participants’ names and their assigned alpha-numeric codes
was kept in a locked file accessible only by the researcher (as well as digitally on the
USB drive).
• Notes, initial jottings, and memos were written by hand. These too are be kept in the
locked file when not in use.
• The study’s code handbook and the drafts of the dissertation report were saved to
Dropbox.
• Hand-coded diary entries and transcripts were secured in the locked file when not in use.

3.5

INTERPRETATION

While the goal of the descriptive case study is to provide an in-depth description, in this case of
CLP as a single case study consisting of front-line managers acting as subunits to reveal how
they have evolved from librarians to proficient managers, there is still a certain level of
interpretation involved. At each step of the research process, there was the opportunity to
interpret and make judgments on what should be included, which pieces received what codes,
101

categories, or themes, what data were weighed more, and how data should be presented in any
products (whether dissertation, article, or book).

These very acts constitute interpretation.

Seidman (2006) puts it another way: “Researchers must ask themselves what they have learned
from doing the interviews, studying the transcripts, marking and labeling them, crafting profiles,
and organizing categories of excerpts.” (p. 129) It is the act of reflective learning by the
researcher and the outcomes of the thought process that is interpretive.
For the researcher, this process mimicked the one she used with the participants. While
coding and analysis is a form of action, the act of exploring the meaning behind these actions
represents the reflective interpretation. This started as early as the very first reading of the initial
diary entries and concluded with the last analytic memos, final coding, and categorizing while
developing the themes discussed here. In other words, these actions led to initial, smaller
interpretations which, in turn, led to larger interpretive thoughts about what took place, why
certain decisions in the research process were made, and what it all means to the case study
itself. Seidman (2006) points out the parallels between the research request to the participants
and what is asked of the researcher later in the process:
The last stage of interpretation, then, consistent with the interview process itself, asks
researchers what meaning they have made of their work. In the course of interviewing,
researchers asked the participants what their experiences meant to them. Now they have
the opportunity to respond to the same question. In doing so they might review how they
came to their research, what their research experience was like, and, finally, what it
means for them. How do they understand it, make sense of it, and see connections in it.
(p. 129)
One question that many researchers, both novice and experienced, struggle with is: when
is the collecting and analyzing done? In other words, when is the data and thoughts around those
data complete enough to lead to solidly supported interpretation? This study followed the idea of
saturation, which is described as being achieved when the data and analysis begins to repeat

102

themselves: “exhaustiveness or redundancy…[is achieved at] the point at which new categories
stop emerging from the data, and is considered a sign that the domain of the activity being
studied has been adequately covered.” (Butterfield, et. al., 2005, p. 487) It is this preponderance
and convergence of data, codes, and categories that give weight to the interpretations that follow,
which is necessary even in a descriptive case study aiming for transferability. In this case study,
it was clear by the second interviews that the data were beginning to repeat and reinforce
previous data coded and started to be grouped together in categories that were then already
suggesting emerging themes.

Kaplan (1964) rightly states, “it is true that what serves as

evidence is the result of a process of interpretation — facts do not speak for themselves;
nevertheless, facts must be given a hearing, or the scientific point to the process of interpretation
is lost.” (p. 375)

3.6

REPORTING

In all forms of analysis and interpretation, transparency in the process is key so any critiques can
focus on the judgment and decisions made by the researcher, not questioning how conclusions or
decisions were made. The analytic memos in particular contribute significantly to transparency
in revealing and describing the researcher’s thought processes. The memos also provide another
advantage, in that much of the writing of the final report came from them: “Depending on the
depth and breadth of your writing, memos can even be woven as substantive portions into the
final written report.” (Saldana, 2013, p. 41) This held true for the researcher, as writing in a
journal helped clarify thoughts as well as acted as an internal sounding board when parts of the
process became overwhelming or confusing. While not much language in this report came
103

directly from the journal, much of what has been discussed in this chapter and is included in the
following chapter was first considered and deliberated in the journal itself.
Furthermore, given that a descriptive qualitative case study has as one of its aims to
provide transferability so other medium to large public library organizations and the front-line
managers who work within them may recognize themselves in some of the narratives and see the
findings as relevant to those situations, it was imperative that the report of these interpretive
findings be clearly presented as only one interpretation of this particular case study by this
specific researcher, most notably as found in the discussion in Chapter 5 of the importance of
further studies that collect more data in the area of public library managers. Without the
interpretive findings, this study is but one snapshot of one group of managers at a particular time
within a specific organization. Thus, the reporting hopefully shows that “…the narratives we
present are a function of our interaction with the participants and their words…[and] we still
have to leave open the possibility that other interviewers and crafters of profiles would have told
a different story…[and therefore,] we have to allow considerable tolerance for uncertainty in the
way we report what we have learned from our research.” (Seidman, 2006, p. 130)
As part of this sense-making, the researcher has made a series of decisions based not only
on the evidence but also on how to present the interpretive findings. Diefenbach (2009) states,
“it is a creative process and its quality, for better or worse, is a result of the skills and courage of
the researcher. The selection and provision of data is and remains the result of subjective
decisions of a researcher — and all the interests and influences he takes consciously or
unconsciously into account during this process.” (p. 885) This becomes clear in Chapter 5 as
potential themes found in the data that were not chosen as part of this report are reviewed
but not thoroughly discussed.

104

Finally, this is a case study that has entailed two levels of narratives — one at the
individual manager level and one at the organizational level. In this case, both levels have been
shown to be completely interdependent, and this report includes a description of some of the
interactions and interdependencies. At its most basic level, however, this is a study of narratives
that describe the singularly varied journeys of a group of librarians who became front-line
managers and have become proficient in this work; they also work together at a specific public
library system in an urban American city at a given time. The success of any transferability is
completely dependent on others finding and reading this study as a dissertation or any other
subsequent published forms. Without reports that are accessible and understandable to those it
aims to help (e.g., other front-line managers, public library organizations with multiple levels of
management, professional associations, and/or LIS educators), any positive aspects included that
aim at transferability become corrupted. Thus, any reporting of this study will heed Rubin and
Rubin’s (2012) observation: “If you fail to engage the intended audience, if you don’t present a
clear and convincing argument, no one will use your work, your insights will be lost, and the
voices of the people you have interviewed will remain inaudible.” (p. 214) Thus, following a
successful completion of the dissertation process, the researcher will strive to find appropriate
outlets for pieces of the research, as well as continue to parse through the data, particularly those
areas laid out in Chapter 5.

3.7

VALIDITY

Building trust and rapport become component parts of creating validity for a qualitative study
such as this one. Using the concept of Lincoln and Guba’s “trustworthiness” (as discussed by
105

Zhang and Wildemuth), the study has made every effort to produce valid outcomes through
thoughtful

design,

researcher

awareness,

and

transparency.

Lincoln

and

Guba’s

recommendations for trustworthiness are achieved through credibility, transferability,
dependability, and confirmability. (Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009, pp. 313-314) This research study
has achieved these in the following ways:
1. Credibility:
• Collaborate with participants to produce study outcomes using member-checking
of transcripts, profiles and quotes used within this report, along with the multiple
contacts with participants and with the triangulation interviews with the
administrators to help see the data and emerging themes from multiple viewpoints
when possible, which has led to honest and credible data.
• Maintain transparency of collection, analysis, and interpretation of data through
careful and detailed notes, transcriptions, memos, and reporting of the research
process, including thoughts and justifications of important decision-points.
• Triangulate situation and event information through interviews with
administrators, as well as situations and events that took place involving more
than one participant (e.g., peer mentors and managers who formerly supervised
some who are now managers). Triangulate data through two coding approaches
looking for convergence.
2. Transferability:
• Explain the nature of qualitative cases, which provide outcomes that are more
often transferable, rather than generalizable.
• Provide rich descriptions of the case’s narratives (individuals and the context)
through discussion of the themes in Chapter 4 as well as the profiles [Appendix
G] to allow others to recognize their own stories in the narratives and outcomes.
• Describe the choice of the case to be one that is relatively common, not overly
unique or extreme, to further allow others to see their own situations in the
outcomes.
3. Dependability and Confirmability:
• Show that all pieces of the research process, from the research questions and
literature review to the tool choices, analysis, and reporting are all tightly and
logically linked together.
• Employ a level of researcher knowledge, experience, judgment, and common
sense to be sure the analysis and outcomes are logical within the larger
professional context.
• Apply consistency throughout the research process, both within each step and
between the steps.
• Reveal transparency throughout so the researcher’s thoughts are apparent as are
the decisions and actions.

106

Furthermore, as part of the credibility of the researcher, the study, and the outcomes, the
study was able to obtain honest and credible data from the participants (as mentioned above and
further discussed in Chapter 4). All studies that rely on self-reporting must be aware of the
possibility that participants can, for a variety of reasons, give misleading and/or erroneous
information. Yet, the study that incorporates multiple encounters between the researcher and the
participants, as this one has, works toward strengthening the validity and truthfulness of the
information:
It places participant’s comments in context. It encourages interviewing participants...to account
for idiosyncratic days and to check for the internal consistency of what they say. Furthermore,
by interviewing a number of participants, we can connect their experiences and check the
comments of one participant against those of the others. Finally, the goal of the process is to
understand how our participants understand and make meaning of their experience. If the
interview structure works to allow them to make sense to themselves as well as to the
interviewer, then it has gone a long way toward validity.” (Seidman, 2006, p. 24)

3.7.1

Pilot Testing of Diary Entries and Interview Guide

Likewise, the dependency on the self-reporting of the participants to answer the research
questions means that the questions posed, both as the diary entry prompts and the interview
questions, must be vetted to be sure they are clear, understandable, in a logical order, and will
produce answers that generate the data necessary. Thus, a pilot of both sets of questions was
done with six front-line public library managers from the Pierce County (WA) Library System.
After the approval of the Deputy Director and the Customer Experience Director, the researcher
first sent the diary questions to the pilot managers and met with them via Skype to explain that
107

they were to read through the questions for clarity and construct a few potential responses so that
the researcher could get a feel for likely responses. A few days later, the interview guide was
sent with the same instructions. A week following the first online meeting, a second meeting was
scheduled and the group discussed each diary prompt and question, sharing sample data. With a
few minor tweaks, the prompts and questions seemed to elicit thoughts and responses that
contributed successfully to answering the questions.

The most helpful comments and

discussions involved the word “proficiency,” and the group advised the researcher to pay
particular attention to how the responses defined, either directly or indirectly, what proficiency
meant. The sample data and subsequent feedback were used solely to improve the questions and
the data were not used as part of the research.

3.7.2

Researcher Bias and Reflexivity

For the study to be considered valid, researcher bias must also be addressed. According to
Kaplan (1964):
What constitutes bias is that the will to believe is motivated by interests external to the
context of inquiry itself…[M]otives concern the relation between the scientific activity
and the whole stream of conduct of which it is a part; purposes relate the activities of
inquiry to the particular scientific problem which they are intended to solve...Various
purposes may serve any motive, and various motives may be involved in the decision to
fulfill a particular purpose. Bias might be defined as the intrusion of motives, which are
extra-scientific, on the fulfillment of scientific purposes. (p. 374)
Thus a researcher has to look within to uncover both the motives and purposes of the study. In
this case, the motives are made clear at the beginning of this report through the description of
personal experiences, workplace observations, and anecdotal information from conversations.
Likewise, the purpose is made clear by identifying that both the long- and short-term goals of the
108

researcher (and not just this study) are to help those in front-line public library managerial
positions be successful and proficient in a shorter and hopefully less painful period of time, as is
warranted by the changing and growing complexity of managing a public library.

Thus,

knowing and acknowledging these motives and purposes allow both the researcher and any
readers of the outcomes of the study to be aware of the context of both the researcher and the
participants.
However, knowing these motives and purposes does not mean attempting to rid them or
even deny them but instead allows the researcher to use them at various points to see if they are
interfering with collection, analysis, interpretation, or reporting of the data through constant
reflection, most often through notes and memos. As Kaplan (1964) points out:
Bias, then, is not constituted merely by having motives...by subscribing values which are
somehow involved in the scientific situation. Everything depends on the conduct of the
inquiry, on the way in which we arrive at our conclusions. Freedom from bias means
having an open mind, not an empty one. At the heart of every bias is a prejudice, that is
to say, a prejudgment, a conclusion arrived at prior to the evidence and maintained
independently of the evidence. (p. 375)
Therefore, a critical piece of the research process is the ability of the researcher to be engaged in
reflexive activities, defined as a “…conscious and consistent efforts to view the subject matter
from different angles and avoid or strongly a priori privilege a single, favored angle and
vocabulary.” (Alvesson, 2003, p. 25) It also acknowledges explicitly what is already known
implicitly — that “the researcher is part of the social world that is studied, and this calls for
exploration and self-examination.” (Alvesson, 2003, p. 24) As Kaplan implied above, it is not
the objective to rid oneself of the bias, but to handle it as explicitly and consciously as possible,
particularly through reflecting on the decision points of the research process, as Diefenbach
(2009) recommends:

109

The question, therefore, is not how to exclude the human factor in research but how to
cope with the possible downsides of subjectivity. The researcher can contribute a large
part to coping with that problem mainly by making one’s own (implicit) assumptions,
interests, and objectives concerning the research and social practice as explicit as possible
and to acknowledge, where relevant, one’s own philosophical and political perspectives.
(p. 877)
The researcher’s journal, then, becomes important to transparency in another way,
beyond thorough understanding of the process itself. The journal has operated as the explicit
consciousness of the researcher meant to ferret out the application of any bias (motives and
purposes) throughout the process. This is in keeping with the qualitative approach and not a
hardship because it is important to know what all the contexts are, not just for the researcher and
the participants, but to help develop a stronger co-construction between the researcher and
participants as they went through similar processes of reflection, self-examination, and selfawareness. As Hatch (2002) points out, “the capacities to be reflexive, to keep track of one’s
influence on a setting, to bracket one’s biases, and to monitor one’s emotional responses are the
same capacities that allow researchers to get close enough to human action to understand what’s
going on.” (p. 10)
Moreover, as the researcher discovered, biases are not always forthcoming as identifiable
and apparent, especially to the researcher herself. For example, one of the major outcomes
anticipated was the reluctance of librarians to give up those duties in favor of management
duties, that are often seen as not as enjoyable or as easy to do. In keeping with Hill’s study of
star producers making a complete transition to managers, the researcher anticipated this
transformation would not be complete, mainly because of reluctant librarian-managers. This
seemed to hold true for some managers based on data from the diary entries when they discussed
either being proficient or working toward proficiency in tasks that could be interpreted as
librarian duties, not managerial ones. Yet, when broaching the subject with participants, even
110

before phase 2 began, it became clear that the staffing levels at some of the branches and smaller
departments was such that these managers had to balance between the two if all services were to
be provided in that particular location.

Moreover, part of their journey was learning to

successfully balance those two distinct jobs while working to operate as managers are now
expected to (as described by a new job description and the subsequent conversations around that
release), not favor one over the other, as the researcher had suspected. In fact, the few mentions
from participants about the reluctance or disappointment at not doing as much librarian work
came as part of conversations around learning to balance the two, as well as working to accept
that they could no longer do as much of the work that they loved and what, for most, brought
them to the profession.

3.8

DATA ANALYSIS

As in most qualitative studies, data analysis begins as soon as the first data are collected.
Edmondson and McManus (2007) point out that, “…in this analytic journey, both the
organization of qualitative data into coherent stories of experience and sense-making processes
are essential analytic activities” with the researcher reviewing the first jottings from the
participants for what stories they might hold. (p. 1163) Second and third readings elicit further
notes and questions for clarifications, as well as additional musings for the analytic memos.
Thus, the researcher read the diary entries immediately and reflected on content, highlighted
interesting passages and jotted thoughts and questions as these occurred upon the initial readings
as well as those thereafter.

111

Saldana (2013) states that, “…your private and personal written musings before, during,
and about the entire enterprise is a question-raising, puzzle-piecing, connection-making,
strategy-building, problem-solving, answer-generating, rising-above-the-data heuristic.” (p. 39)
Where warranted, memos are written to explore these passages and thoughts. Saldana (2013)
considers memos (regardless of content) to be comparable to a journal written by the researcher,
“…a place to ‘dump your brain’ about the participants, phenomenon, or process under
investigation by thinking and thus writing and thus thinking even more about them.” (p. 41)
Taking this advice, the researcher kept notes in a journal, which ranged from brief notes,
thoughts, and ideas placed loose inside to fully written entries exploring emerging thoughts and
potential categories and themes.
From the diary entries, potential interview questions were also noted and explored. This
pattern of notes, memo-writing, and using the previous participant contacts to inform the next
round continued throughout the field work and data collection, expanding to include
transcriptions of participant interviews which were usually produced within a week following
each interview. Thus, all the thoughts around these activities, whether immediate or after
additional data were collected, were potential areas of exploration in memos: “The goal is not to
summarize the data but to reflect and expound on them.

Future directions, unanswered

questions, frustrations with the analysis, insightful connections, and anything about the
researched and the researcher are acceptable content for memos.” (Saldana, 2013, p. 42)
The study employed other methods of analysis as it progressed. More formal analytic
memos were written upon the completion of the diary entries, some of which commented on
vignettes found in the transcripts which are, “a shorter narrative that usually covers a more
limited aspects of a participant’s experiences,” and are told using a participant’s own words in its

112

construction. (Seidman, 2006, p. 119) Five analytic memos were written following the end of
Phase 1, the collection of the diary entries, on the following topics:
•
•
•
•
•

Emotions found within the responses, especially pride and love of job;
Proficiency and how it was defined by participants;
The Senior Librarian position and its role in the organization and for participants;
Staffing in smaller branches and departments and its impact on the transformation of
practitioner to manager as well as the level to which they were able to balance librarian
versus managerial duties; and
Common language used by the participants, most notably discussing the community as
part of their job descriptions, the concept of “getting to yes,” and the managers’ role in
the “big picture.”
This pattern of work continued for the interviews. The demographic data, the diary

entries, and subsequent memos provided data and indicators from which participants were
chosen for the in-depth interviews, and these provided a foundational piece of explanation and
justification following analysis and interpretation. Thus, data were collected and analyzed from
the reflective diaries of the twenty-one participants, eleven clarifying interviews from the diary
entries, and the twenty interviews conducted with the ten in-depth participants. Notes and
memos also provided data as well as initial insights and the basis for first-level analysis.

3.9

TRIANGULATION OF THE DATA

Triangulation is a way to collect and analyze data with an eye toward clarifying meaning from
multiple viewpoints in order to strengthen the outcomes of a study. Denzin established four
types of triangulation:
•
•
•
•

Data triangulation: collecting data from different sources,
Investigator triangulation: collecting data using multiple researchers,
Methodological triangulation: collecting data using multiple tools, and
Theory triangulation: collecting and analyzing data using multiple concepts or theories.
(as reported by Choemprayong & Wildemuth, 2009, p. 55)
113

This study triangulated data methodologically by collecting data from both diaries and indepth interviews. There were multiple places between a participant’s diary entries and
interviews that brought up the same issues, thoughts, or emotions and reinforced the information
these were providing. For example, LeeAnn referred to her earliest supervisory experience with
a Page and Denise discussed the ways in which she has become more comfortable doing
performance appraisals. Sometimes this overlap was because of prompting by the researcher for
additional information and sometimes it was because of the participants’ own musings and the
importance of the person or situation each was discussing. Furthermore, data points were also
triangulated from interviews with the Director and the Deputy Director as well most of the
participants’ direct supervisors: the Assistant Director of Main Library and Assistant Director of
Neighborhood Libraries. These interviews explored themes arising from the data, including their
roles in relation to the participants, their views of leadership in the organization, their description
of the “big picture,” the nature of the changes they saw in the last few years (especially as it
related to the Strategic Plan and the new “openness” of the organization noted by many
participants), as well as their thoughts on the Senior Librarian position, the appraisal process, and
whether a culture exists that staff cannot be fired. In addition, the two Assistant Directors who
are the direct supervisors for all but three of the participants were asked about their more recent
actions that were raised by participants including “one-on-ones” with them, assigning a formal
peer mentor to the new managers, and the managers’ book discussion. Finally, these themes
were compared to the secondary coding using the conceptual framework, noting similarities and
differences between this study and those.

114

3.10

CODING AS AN ANALYTIC APPROACH

While there are several vocal critics of qualitative coding as an analytic approach (see Saldana,
2013, pp. 38-40), qualitative coding made the most sense for this study, which focused on
drawing together the narratives of a particular group of front-line public library managers to
create a descriptive case study of a specific library organization. To maintain an acceptable level
of quality in using codes as the primary unit of analysis from which the interpretation was based,
the analytic method followed Saldana’s The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers. As,
ultimately, “…one of the coder’s primary goals is to find…repetitive patterns of actions and
consistencies in human affairs as documented in the data,” such a coding approach for this study
was the best methodological tool and fit. (Saldana, 2013, p. 5)
Likewise, Saldana’s clarity, regardless of methodological coding choice, also contributed
a level of validity which is necessary particularly in a doctoral dissertation. Saldana (2013) is
clear about the purpose of coding and where to be cautious to avoid confusion not only in
thought but also in that it might lead to assumptions due to a separation from the data as initially
given: “A few methodologists perceive a code as a mere shorthand or an abbreviation for the
more important category yet to be discovered. Unfortunately, some use the terms code and
category inter-changeably and even in combination when they are, in fact, two separate
components of data analysis.” (p. 8) In this study, codes were part of the first cycle analysis and
categories are part of the second cycle (see below for further explanation and Diagram 4 for a
visualization of his process).

115

3.10.1 First and Second Cycle Coding

The first round of data analysis followed the principles of Descriptive Coding, a method which
summarizes a passage of data into a word or short phrase, categorizing the variety of topics
covered within the data. (Saldana, 2013, pp. 88-89) This was particularly important in the
clarifying portions of the interviews as large pieces of data explaining something were often
attributable to only one code due to the clarifying purpose of the researcher’s question.
Simultaneous Coding, which allows for more than one code to be identified in a given passage,
was also employed to cover the richness of the data. (Saldana, 2013, p. 80)
This simultaneous coding was particularly helpful in the diary entries in which the
concise nature of a sentence could have between two to six codes attached to it. Coding was
important for this in that “…qualitative codes are essence-capturing and essential elements of the
research story that, when clustered together according to similarity and regularity (a pattern),
they actively facilitate the development of categories and thus analysis of their connections,”
which ultimately framed the data meaningfully around the research question of how public
librarians become proficient front-line managers. (Saldana, 2013, p. 8)
As the diary entries were returned, they were coded, at times using a word provided by
the text but more often with a word or phrase from the researcher. The first round of diary
entries was coded without a list, and when a new code was identified, occasionally the researcher
returned to previously-coded entries and added the new code. At the end of coding Diary Entry
1, a list from the codes used was created in the researcher’s notebook, and the diary entries
remained grouped together.
In coding the second diary entries, the list was used primarily to minimize using different
words for the same thing. New codes were also identified, used, and added to the list but were
116

not used retroactively at that time on the first diary entries. This process continued for the third
diary entries. Thus, the diary entries were initially coded as a group and not individually. When
all diaries were collected and coded, the researcher separated the diary entries, grouped these by
participant and created a file for each. After redistributing the diary entries, each individual’s
three entries were read and coded again using the list. Very few codes were changed but a great
number were added, particularly to the first diary entry. Through recoding and reviewing, it
became clear that some codes were operating more as categories and some were operating more
as subcodes, following Saldana’s model [See Figure 4]. Consequently, this is where varied
thoughts about codes and potential categories began to coalesce, and codes were placed into
categories and subcodes were identified. Upon completion, the final category and code list from
the diaries was prepared. [See Appendix D for the study’s list.]
Both the clarifying and in-depth interviews followed a similar coding pattern. Interviews
were coded usually within a week of producing the transcripts. Upon completing the coding for
the second interview, the researcher read the two interviews together to determine if additional
coding was needed. Very few additional codes were identified and added to the list. In general,
the interviews had very few codes compared with the diary entries, which made logical sense,
given that the questions drilled down to specific topics or clarified previous thoughts and
comments and so were likely to focus on a single coding area.

117

Figure 4. Saldana's (2013) model of building on codes to create themes

While this coding approach inductively focused solely on what emerged from the data
presented by the participants without any other information or guidance, it was also important to
measure how the data fit into the conceptual frameworks as presented by the Hill and McCall, et.
al. studies. Therefore, another round of partial coding followed the concepts of Provisional
Coding, which began with the pre-determined list of codes as determined by this literature and/or
anticipated responses, which can be modified as the analysis progresses, but was not in this
study. (Saldana, 2013, p. 144) [See Appendix E for the Provisional Coding list.]
To move beyond the initial subunit comparisons to the deeper comparisons and cross-unit
analysis, a second round of coding focused on emerging categories and themes from the first
round. Pattern Coding acts as a “stimulus to develop a statement that describes a major theme, a
118

pattern of action, a network of interrelationships, or a theoretical construct for the data.”
(Saldana, 2013, p. 212) After reviewing the codes and categories list, it became very clear which
codes and categories were being used more often, as well as how these were interacting with
each other. From this review and subsequent thinking and writing, a number of themes began to
emerge, some of which are identified and discussed in this chapter as well as the next.

3.11

PROFILES

At the subunit level, following the completion of all data collection, the study adopted Seidman’s
(2006) concept of creating profiles for the ten in-depth participants: “…[C]rafting a profile or
vignette of a participant’s experience is an effective way of sharing interview data and opening
up one’s interview material to analysis and interpretation.” (p. 119) Furthermore, “it allows us to
present the participant in context, to clarify his or her intentions, and to convey a sense of
process and time, all central components of qualitative analysis.” (Seidman, 2006, p. 119) Thus,
such a device and activity provided the opportunity to not only honor the narrative of each indepth participant but also to begin the process of linking the explicit thoughts, actions, and
reconstructions of the participants to the larger context of the case itself, both human and
organizational, in which these narratives took place: “…[C]rafting profiles [is] a way to find and
display coherence in the constitutive events of a participant’s experience, to share the coherence
the participant has expressed, and to link the individual’s experience to the social and
organizational context with which he or she operates.” (Seidman, 2006, p. 120)
Writing the ten participant profiles was time-consuming process. The researcher
excerpted a large amount of data from their three diary entries and two interviews, which
119

averaged approximately one and a half hours for the two interviews and resulted in 18-24 total
pages of transcripts, and used the participants’ own words to create a condensed narrative of
their individual transitional journeys from librarian to manager. Each profile included a section
on becoming a manager, role as manager, and how each learned. The remaining sections of the
profiles diverged and are as unique as the individuals they reveal. [See Appendix G for the ten
profiles.]
The researcher’s process for creating the profiles began by reading all the documents for
an individual and outlining the likely general sections. From there, the researcher read each
document again, cutting and pasting pieces of data into the appropriate sections, ending with one
document in which all data were combined. Finally, the document was edited to create a rough
draft of a narrative profile that could then be shared with each participant. The thoughts of each
participant about what each wished to include was as varied as each’s story. Anecdotally,
participant assessments reflect their length of time as a manager, as well as where they are in
their career. Changes were also related to how recent a described situation was and whether
those involved are still working for the organization or even still working in the library field.
To a person, the participants were not as concerned for themselves as they were for those
who were unknowingly participating through these examples. The researcher echoed this
concern and worked to minimize these impacts. The process of member-checking brought about
a series of negotiations between researcher and several participants. As this study’s main
purpose is to tell the narrative of an individual’s journey from librarian to proficient manger, the
vignettes themselves were told to the researcher only as examples of particular situations that
brought about a learning moment along that path. Thus, the researcher and participant, working
together, rewrote and generalized the situations, particularly those that had Human Resources

120

and confidentiality ramifications, so that individuals were not identifiable while keeping the
learning outcomes of the manager through this journey intact. Thus, all vignettes and
participants were kept as part of the study. Following input from each participant, the profiles
were edited two more times for clarity and conciseness.

MANUAL AND COMPUTER CODING

All coding of diary entries and transcripts was done by hand. Thus, all diary entries and
interview transcripts were printed and then coded, most multiple times during the first cycle and
once for the second cycle. This decision followed the advice of most qualitative methodologists
and instructors (see Saldana 2013, Yin 2009, Rubin & Rubin 2012) and because this study was
conducted as a dissertation, it necessitated the importance of closeness between data and
researcher. As a novice researcher, it is critical that there is deep knowledge and intimacy of the
participants’ data that is often hampered by the use of a professional transcriber and/or
CAQDAS software. Further, as Rubin & Rubin (2012) state, “qualitative analysis requires
attention to variation, to differences in emphasis, to shades of meaning, that go beyond mere
counting [that a computer program provides].” (p. 192) Also, the act of putting pen to paper
facilitates thinking and processing for this researcher.

ANALYSIS OF THE FINDINGS

The researcher identified the reflective nature of the participation for those involved to be the
greatest benefit for them individually. While it seems to hold true for most, if not all, of the
participants, there were a few who noted that just by the nature of the questions themselves
and/or the action during the interviews of the researcher restating what was heard and asking
whether a statement was accurate or needed correction, a strong meaningful reaction was a byproduct of the research process for the participants. For some, it was a chance to reflect on a
long career that has seen a remarkable number of changes both in the profession and the
organization, as Joyce states:
I've just been grateful that you [the researcher] asked me to do this. I'm coming to the end
of my journey and you're making me think of things that happened 30 years ago which I
thought I had put away. Some of your diary entries bubbled some things up that I
thought I'd been okay with, but it bubbled some things up which I found very interesting.
I have been thinking about what's the next part of the journey and who am I the day after
[I retire]. (personal communications, June-November 2014) 4
For others who are still in the early stages of a managerial career, it gave them an
opportunity to step out of the active, continual work of gaining knowledge, skills, and behaviors
and recount what is working and what is not, or even think about how they might handle a
typical supervisory task, such as correcting or disciplining an employee, when they had not yet

had a chance to fully experience it or do it. Ian is still new enough that he is in the middle of
experiencing all of the different aspects of supervising staff, including getting them to respond to
his approach and style:
I think my strategy has been encouragement [and] positive feedback, using those as tools
like the carrot instead of the whip. One thing I was thinking of after the [diary] entry is
I've been also trying to be more direct and honest in talking with them and I'm gearing
myself up for that. My hope is that if I've done my job in creating as much of a positive,
team-oriented, supportive environment, if there is something negative, that negativity
exists not within a vacuum but within that overall environment that I've helped to grow
within the branch. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Even those who have been managers for a while experienced opportunities to reflect where
certain actions or beliefs began that still influence how they behave or react to certain situations
today. Sarah experienced that when thinking about how she became proficient at feedback:
It's funny because I didn’t even think about it until I was doing the diary entry and you
talked about the feedback and I thought, ‘where did I get it and when did I start using it’
and it was my mother; it’s from dealing with our family and that's just how we interacted
with each other, and so maybe that's why we were happy most of the time because we all
pretty much understood each other.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)

4.1

TRUST IN THE RESEARCHER AND THE ORGANIZATION AS ELEMENTS
OF THE STUDY

It is from these nuggets — both of value to the researcher as well as the participant — that the
meaning-making of the journey from librarian to proficient manager begins to emerge. Without
their willingness and ability to reflect on these questions and share situations that describe both
successes and failures, along with that reflection to produce the lessons learned, this research
study could not produce any of the findings discussed here. Clearly, trust and rapport were able
to be built between the researcher and the participants for at least some of these stories to be

123

shared. The researcher’s previous experience with the organization and the managers themselves
and the strong support of the administration turned out to work in favor of both participation and
trust.
Prior to launching the research in May 2014, the main contact between the researcher and
the front-line managers occurred in the first four months of 2013 through a series of strategic
learning workshops conducted by the researcher and required of all library staff, including
managers. These workshops were held at a number of locations around the library system. One
of the outcomes of the workshop was to create a learning activity for each team to work toward
achieving together. After each workshop, the researcher met with the managers in attendance to
collect information on how the administration might help them achieve these learning activity
goals and/or how the administration might better support them in their work. At the end of the
workshops, the researcher attended one of the library’s quarterly all-manager meetings and
presented the report on what the managers had said they needed.
That there had been one point of contact between the researcher and staff, albeit more
than a year prior to the beginning of the research, meant that there was already a small level of
trust and rapport with the participants. For example, the report that was written about what
managers said they needed following the strategic learning workshops was shared among all
levels of management and showed that there were no revelations of “who said what” even when
there was some criticism of the administration; yet, the report still provided information about
these comments. Moreover, the workshops were well-received and administrators reported that
many of the teams had integrated some of the tips and the learning process they explored in the
workshop into their work activities, a few of whom mentioned these during the interviews.
Thus, the hope that the researcher could build on this initial amount of goodwill and it would

124

lead to more choosing to participate than would happen at an organization where the researcher
is unknown to the participants came to fruition with two-thirds of the identified population
completing the study.
Furthermore, trust continued to be built with the reassurances during interviews that the
participants would have multiple opportunities to review the use of their data and negotiate the
terms of that usage. In fact, a number of participants worked with the researcher to rework
descriptions and situations to be sure the learning pieces and lessons that the managers thought
were critical still held honest and true, while the confidential nature of others’ involvement,
whether they happened in the last year or more than a decade ago, was obscured. As those
individuals did not agree to be part of the study and the focus on the study is firmly on the
managers’ thoughts and actions, it did not breach ethical standards to make those changes;
moreover, it could have breached other standards and rules, such as those pertaining to
confidentiality in Human Resources matters, had certain details not been changed.
By negotiating these changes, two important pieces critical to the outcomes of the
research happened. First, these critical situations that led to pivotal points along a manager’s
journey were able to be kept as part of the study, producing a more trustworthy piece of research.
Second, the participants did, in fact, become co-producers and facilitators of the study itself, as
discussed in the Validity section of Chapter 3. Thus, by the end of the study, trust was firmly
established

between

researcher

and

participants,

further

creating

validity

through

“trustworthiness” leading to stronger transferability to other individuals and organizations.
Likewise, the strong support of the administration, including the Director, the Deputy
Director and the four Assistant Directors proved to be a help instead of a hindrance. In fact,
some managers noted that they felt comfortable participating because of the support from their

125

direct supervisors and the Director and Deputy Director. Another potential factor could be that
there appears to be a great deal of trust with the current administration. Much of this trust could
be based on wide participation in the Strategic Planning process, which has brought about many
of the recent changes the managers and the organization are experiencing. Whatever the reason,
however, it is clear that trust in the researcher, the process, and the organization has been to the
benefit of this study.

4.2

FINDINGS: SUBUNITS (INDIVIDUALS)

The primary findings focus on the descriptive narrative of the journey from librarian into
proficient manager and are shown in the ten profiles found in Appendix G.

As discussed in

Chapter 3, deciding on the ten participants with whom to conduct the in-depth interviews and
write profiles was a difficult decision. All participants have such interesting stories, any of them
could have been selected. Thus, focusing in this chapter on all twenty-one participants, there are
a few notable observations.
The first and foremost observation is the impact of longevity among the group. Even
among those who are relatively new managers, most have been with the organization in previous
positions. Described as “growing up in the system,” at least half had other non-librarian positions
such as Page, Clerk, and Library Assistant. Additionally, a few more were hired as librarians but
have worked mainly for this organization, with at least two who are nearing retirement having
spent their entire careers with CLP. Also, there are at least five in the study who have come to
librarianship as a second career. In these cases, they rose in the ranks and became managers
fairly quickly, holding librarian positions relatively briefly.
126

Only two participants in this sample were hired as managers and have not held a nonmanagerial position within the organization. For those two, it is unclear what impact that has
had, if any, on the process of becoming a manager as it was not a specific part of this study. For
Jody, who came in after a long sales career with a worldwide delivery company, as well as being
the director of a small public library in the region more recently, a significant number of
managerial and business skills have transferred to the current job.

The only struggle she

mentions is learning the tools and resources available in a larger library system as well as
managing a much larger staff. (personal communications, June-November 2014) Holly, on the
other hand, came into the system to become a manager at the Main Library, starting as the head
of the Teen Department and then moving to the head of the First Floor [popular materials].
Unlike Jody who had a robust toolkit of experience in transferable skills, Holly was a librarian
for one year at another library system before taking on her first managerial position in this
organization. In some ways, it appears that Holly’s first position acted as an apprenticeship in
managerial work by being an extremely small department with like-minded staff focused on a
narrow population segment:
I remember feeling overwhelmed a lot of the time in my first year at CLP and Teen’s was
so specialized and the system was so different then because there weren't as many teen
specialists; there weren’t a lot of people who knew about teens and how to serve them.
The department was only two people; I had to hire somebody, a third person, but there
were only two people in my department which was nice [as it’s] a manageable size to
start out with. So officially for six months, I was Senior Librarian and then they bumped
me up to manager. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Now in a larger department, Holly continues to add to her toolkit, learning more managerial
skills and knowledge on a significantly larger scale. However, while worth noticing, the
experiences of these two can only be surmised in this particular case study because of the small
number of participants as well as their prior experiences being so different from one another, so

127

it is unclear as to whether those who come into the organization as a manager learn differently
than those who have been promoted to manager from within.
The other interesting and impactful piece is how many of the current managers came
from a Children's and/or Teen Services background (at least nine, not including one that held a
Children's Librarian position but was appointed there and did not hold the position voluntarily).
Moreover, three participants are currently serving as managers within the Children's and Teen
Services structure, two in branches and one as a systemwide coordinator. Only one held similar
duties within a position outside the organization. Thus, more than half of the participants have a
common background, which includes similar vocabulary and work structure (e.g., committees,
feeling the pull of multiple responsibilities) and provides a built-in network of people who are
already a known quality and a career path to follow along with ready-made mentors, coaches,
and advisors. Elizabeth mentions this specifically, “[I] sought advice from fellow Children’s
Librarians in supervisor positions.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)
There was no real differences in the journey between manager participants working in the
Main Library and participants working in the branches. Anticipating that there might be, at least
in the development of relationships with administrators (whose offices are in the Main Library),
the researcher asked the in-depth interview participants to describe their relationships with senior
managers/administrators who were not a direct supervisor. In the responses, there is no
discernible difference between the two groups that fell neatly into those two specific categories.
Many of the managers have held other para-professional and nonprofessional positions in the
organization and several have held positions at the Main Library at one time or another; yet,
these past experiences also seem to play no part in how they view relationships with
administrators. Thus, proximity to administrators did not necessarily influence whether they had

128

a stronger relationship with an administrator and provided no indication that there could be a
notable difference between how Main and branch managers became knowledgeable and
proficient.

4.3

FINDINGS: COMPARISONS ACROSS SUBUNITS (INDIVIDUALS)

While there are multiple findings that came from such a rich amount of data, the findings here
have been limited to three main areas: experiences, influencers, and proficiency. Other areas ripe
for analysis and discussion but not included in this dissertation are discussed in Chapter 5.

4.3.1

Experiences

Not surprisingly for all participants, life and/or work experiences have played an integral part in
this journey. In this particular study, these experiences can be broken into three main areas:
previous experiences (as a manager or in other positions), the chance to perform significant
managerial duties while not officially holding such a position or title (the " unofficial manager"),
and holding manager positions that were intentionally meant to “grow” the person in managerial
knowledge, skills, and behaviors so that they could eventually move onto positions having
greater responsibility with confidence that they were ready to do the work at the next managerial
level, whether in a higher front-line managerial position or further up the organizational
hierarchy (“apprenticeships”). The intention of these “apprenticeships” could come from one of
two places: the first in the job description itself and the second apparently due to a combination

129

of a supervisor who viewed her role as mentor, an interested person in the position, and a
location that lent itself to a variety of experiences.

4.3.1.1 Previous Experiences
Previous experiences have played a significant role in the participants’ journey, whether they
happened in previous positions within the organization or in jobs prior to either becoming a
librarian or before coming to the organization. For those “growing up" in the organization,
holding other positions meant not only insight into these particular positions and the people
doing the work, but also how those positions fit into a department, branch, and the organization
as a whole. Mary Beth’s experiences seem fairly typical of many in this group, holding a number
of positions each with greater responsibility: “Working as a Clerical Specialist, a Children’s
Library Assistant and then Librarian before I became a supervisor helped me understand the
responsibilities of a few different positions. Having a full understanding of what was required by
each person working in those positions allowed me to ensure that each staff person was carrying
out the responsibilities of their job.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Likewise, working in professional positions such as those in Children's Services is seen
by most who held those positions to be advantageous. “Working in youth services prior to
transitioning into a managerial role, [I] was actively involved in many projects that impacted all
of youth services. This was a great experience leading to becoming a manager because I
understood how critical it was to be active in outcomes you are passionate about or skilled in.”
(Jen, personal communications, June-November 2014) Many of the participants who started in
Children’s Services voiced similar feelings, whether they went on to become a manager within
the Children’s Services structure or became managers in other capacities in the organization.
This influence of carrying out assignments that are applicable beyond the area of Children’s
130

Services is not limited to this organization. The researcher experienced it herself within another
library organization and at least one participant was told the same thing: “I remember talking to
someone at PaLA who was a director [who] started in Children’s Services and she told me that
oftentimes she sees people coming from Children's Services and moving up in leadership
because of the kind of skills that you need to work in that environment will serve you well.”
(LeeAnn, personal communications, June-November 2014) There is enough evidence here that
would warrant further studies into the role that starting in Children’s Services plays in
developing future managers and whether other areas in library organizations exist in similar
ways, such as rising in the ranks through Adult or Technical Services, for example.
“Growing up" in the organization is also an identifiable advantage for many because it
presented a natural path, collecting knowledge and skills through the experiences along the way,
as noted by Sarah:
My career has just seemed to follow a natural progression. I began working at the library
as a part-time Page, became a part-time Clerk and then I got my degree. I was a
Children’s Librarian for about ten years and then thought that I would enjoy a position
with more management responsibilities. I became an Assistant Manager at Allegheny
Regional, and after working in that position for a couple of years, my supervisor
encouraged me to apply for the management position at Knoxville. I was surprised at
how smoothly things went, which I attribute to having the opportunity to have a sort of
‘apprenticeship’ before going into a managerial position. (personal communications,
June-November 2014)
Moreover, it could also be seen as the best path as well. Ian shares:
I'm happy with the way that things transpired. I didn't realize the whole time that I was
on the course to become a manager; it was just me following the path. I think that the
most important thing is that you just need experience, just dealing with day-to-day library
situations and I had decent amount of that under my belt… I feel like I was decently
prepared. I have known people that have come out of an MLIS program and have walked
straight into a management job but I never could have done that; my experiences were
very important. (personal communications, June-November 2014)

131

With so many in the organization having held multiple positions, including those that do
not require a professional degree, identifying potential variables that create such an environment
may be essential to not only understanding the organization’s nature as a whole, but also lending
itself to further study in the future. One major variable that could minimize the transferability as
a case study for a large number of libraries is the presence of an iSchool at the University of
Pittsburgh with an ALA-accredited Master of Library and Information Science program only a
block from the Main Library. Thus, a number of the participants were already working for the
library system when they went through the program and continued to work while attending, as
Chris recounts:
I was lucky enough to get my first Librarian job while I was just finishing up my last
month of grad school. I wanted to stay with CLP and not relocate as I’d been in the
system since high school and my family and friends were all mostly local. In the years
leading up to finishing grad school, I had applied for jobs with CLP that involved
increasing levels of responsibility and was mostly successful in achieving upward
mobility within the system, going from Page, to Page Clerk (this title no longer exists), to
full-time Clerk, to Library Assistant, and Librarian in about 7 years. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Thus, the relationship between the program and the library organization cannot be discounted,
particularly given that all but one participant graduated from the University of Pittsburgh’s
program between 1976 and 2012.
The same potential influence holds true for those who came to the library field as a
second career. One influence is the applicability of a practical skill-set reimagined. Jody points
out:
For example, my knowledge of FedEx’s hub and spoke logistics… helped me easily
understand the ILL sorting system that supports Allegheny County Library Association
(ACLA). The skills I acquired running a small library, transferred with no trouble into
managing a much bigger library. These are just two examples of how I really didn’t know
how much I knew until I was pulling from my past experiences to build my leadership
skills in my new position as branch manager. (personal communications, June-November
2014)
132

Another influence is a chance to grow in knowledge and skills related to leadership before
coming to librarianship. Karen R., who worked for a number of years in the insurance industry,
states, “…I came from an outside world where [after] several years, [I] got a different job in the
same organization [as] the manager of a new division that was being created. So I had the
experience in the outside world of being a manager and creating a department, hiring staff,
setting up office procedures. I already had that under my belt when I came to the library.”
(personal communications, June-November 2014)
Just as the participants who had an influencing connection between their education and
their work at the library, those participants who came to the library field from another career also
have a number of potentially identifiable common variables. For example, managers such as
Madison, Karen R., and Jody came to the field with some managerial knowledge, skills, and
behaviors in place, which they identified as being transferable to what they are doing today.
Holding a previous managerial position, however, is not the only transferable knowledge.
Megan and Patte had influential experiences with managers in non-library jobs that have
impacted how they operate today. Moreover, just having worked in another field or industry is
enough to impact how new managers view the work they do in the library setting, as Jen points
out, “I do really feel that I was very fortunate that I had some business experience because I
could see that if I was straight out of library school that there would be some issues with
professionalism that I might not know and I would cross out of ignorance.” (personal
communications, June-November 2014) A better understanding through further studies of the
impact of second-career librarians who become managers relatively quickly upon earning a
master’s degree could provide not only more insight into which pieces of knowledge, skills, and
behaviors transfer best into the public library field but could also illustrate which experiences
133

and developmental assignments might be most useful for this subset of librarians who become
proficient managers.

4.3.1.2 The “Unofficial Manager”
For those participants who had significant managerial duties while holding non-managerial
positions within the organization, they considered it valuable in helping them move into a
managerial position while also preparing them for the work. Some embraced it and were aware
of the significance of the opportunity, as Wes describes: “I think the biggest thing that prepared
me for my position is the fact that I was doing part of the job already as a Library Assistant. As
an LA on the First Floor, I helped run our PC Center [computer center] under the guidance of a
librarian. I increasingly took charge of that position on my own.” (personal communications,
June-November 2014) Others had to take on this mantle because there was no other choice.
Joyce describes a situation at a small branch where she was a Children’s Librarian and the only
other professional in the building:
…I had a manager who was ill a lot of the time and so I took over a lot of those basic
duties that weren't in my job description but it's in the little print at the bottom, ‘other
things as necessary.’ There was a really good Senior Clerk and [together] we just worked
it out and because there was no other alternative… [W]hen she came back, she came into
whatever [we were doing] and then if she got sick again, she went out again… It helped
me understand the game, of being a part of upper management… I started learning all of
that at Carrick, so it was a natural carryover; there were no classes; there were no books;
it was on-the-job learning. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Finally, even in the most difficult circumstances, the lessons learned are seen as valuable:
I was working way above my pay grade in terms of administrative duties…(hiring, firing,
evaluations, etc.) [As a Clerical Specialist] I was responsible for evaluations of
everybody below me, which would be all the clerks … so I was already managing. I was
doing a lot of mediation [between] people, trying to make the [staff] get along and do
their jobs and come to work because we had a supervisor who hated confrontation [and]
would let things get to the point where everyone was screaming at each other and
fighting… I don't know any manager that really relishes the idea of sitting someone down
and telling them they're doing a bad job. But because of [those] previous experiences, [I
134

know] it has to be done no matter how much you hate it; because otherwise, it's going to
effect the whole staff; it's going to effect your customers; it will effect everything.
(Christine, personal communications, June-November 2014)
While these “unofficial manager” experiences were critically important to every
manager, it must be noted that the same could not be replicated in every library, at least in the
same organic and localized way that it has in this organization. Quite simply, as a non-union
library, the organization and those front-line supervisors mentoring and coaching potential
leaders have the opportunity afforded by the combination of flexibility and no union contract so
there is no danger of a grievance based on working out of classification. That is not to say that a
similar environment could not be created within a union library. Given the importance that the
managers placed on these developmental experiences prior to becoming managers, it would
certainly be worth looking to create ways within the structure (and potentially within the budget
for out-of-classification pay) and/or job descriptions in which to provide librarians such
developmental opportunities.

4.3.1.3 “Apprenticeships”
A smaller but significant number of participants also discussed previous managerial positions as
apprenticeships or suggested that they operated that way without using that language. These were
most often within the positions of Senior Librarian or Assistant Manager, which is a position that
no longer exists in the organization and was situated in Main departments and larger branches.
The most powerful vignette comes from Kathy as she describes what could have been a negative
and potentially damaging experience and, instead, not only identified it as a positive learning
experience for herself, but also gave a great deal of credit for her growth to the manager she
worked under:

135

I found out that I was a much better administrator than she was when I became her
Assistant Department Head and she just kept loading everything on me, ‘okay you deal
with the time cards; you deal with that’ and I embraced all that because I enjoyed the
detail and I had no problem with doing that. So it made her life a lot easier and she gave
me the perfect training to be what I am today because I had to do all those things. She
talked to me continuously about doing this and doing that and I had to keep prodding her
to make sure she was hitting all of her marks and hitting her deadlines, so that helped me
to understand the deadlines she had to do, what it involved, what information and data
she needed to get these things done. So it was perfect training for me, but that's how it
happened, completely.
I didn't talk a lot; I was very scholarly; I was not forward, but I had to push forward so I
had to become much bigger than I was. I had to take hold and become confident and I
had to feel good, know what I was talking about, and that all developed. That was a great
opportunity for me to become what I have become, and it all just happened because [my
supervisor] kept leaving voids and I felt those voids had to be filled. So whenever
something [came up] she didn't want to do, I stepped up and I did it, and it was a
wonderful thing. At the time, I didn't think that because I was very shy; I thought ‘I don't
know if I can do this.’ I had not spoken in public; I wasn't sure I could tackle all the
things I needed to tackle.
[Also, she] could be very intimidating. When she was not happy with you, she used to
throw pencils at you… She never wanted to be an administrator; she never wanted to be a
manager; she wanted to be a Reference Librarian and nothing more. But because they
had offered her these opportunities, she had taken them…and she wasn't willing to push
herself to do any of that, so it was the greatest thing in the world for me because I had to
push myself to do all of these things [even though] I didn’t want to do any of them.
I often say she made me what I am today. Gladys [the former head of the Main Library]
gave me the opportunity and [my supervisor] molded me to be what I am today and I
thank her a thousand times for it because I would not have been this person unless I had
been her assistant and had been given all of these opportunities to just keep stepping up to
these marks and fill these voids…. She could be extremely difficult, but I am and will
always be devoted to her because…there was a core of devotion to the customer and an
interest in good Reference Service that I was able to relate to and that made all the
difference in how we worked together.
We worked as a team… (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
The Senior Librarian position can work in this way also, but again, it seems dependent on
a number of factors, such as a manager who operates as a mentor and a person in the position
who wants to learn new knowledge and skills beyond the current job description. However,
unlike the Assistant Manager position which had being “second-in-command” of a department or

136

branch as part of the charge and an apparent understanding that the position was meant as
training from which department and branch managers were likely chosen, the Senior Librarian
position has a different purpose and intention, so it is unsurprising that not all who have held this
position have felt ready to take on more managerial responsibilities just by having held and
worked it.

4.3.1.4 A Lack of Previous Experience
There are a few managers who did not have either many "unofficial" opportunities or
“apprenticeships" and lamented what they did not know coming into a managerial position for
the first time. As Holly states: “I felt that vice-like pressure of middle management — pressure
from both sides — your bosses and those that you manage. [Ultimately,] part of it's not really
having [a complete] toolkit. I started managing really early in my career; I was only a librarian
for a year and there wasn't much to have conflict about in my first professional job; things were
just the way they were.” (personal communications, June-November 2014) Likewise, Mark felt
a distinct disadvantage in one particular area, dealing with staff, but also because the new work
began immediately with no real grace period or time to adjust:
The single piece of experience I was most lacking was not having the experience of
supervising a direct report. I would like to lay out the million steps I took…of how I
prepared once I accepted the position, but when I made the transition from Senior
Librarian to manager there was no time. In fact, because the libraries I was hired to
manage did not [currently] have a manager, almost from the moment I was hired things
concerning the two branches began to be forwarded to me while I was still in my [old]
position. Essentially, I began working 2 jobs for three weeks as well as managing the
change from one situation to the next. I think this is somewhat typical for an internal hire
for our organization and probably others. (personal communications, June-November
2014)
Because the study did not probe or ask specifically what knowledge, skills, or behaviors
they were most lacking when first becoming a manager, most did not readily supply this
137

information directly. Some of the data did reveal these lacks implicitly in responses to such
questions as “What surprised you the most the first year in that managerial job?” and “What
would your recommendation be to LIS educators now, in order to prepare people for
management positions in the field?” Further studies would be necessary to begin to suggest a
framework that reveals the necessary pieces and mix between developmental assignments or
experiences prior to becoming a manager, exposure to certain managerial models of actions and
behaviors, and interaction with a peer network. From such a framework, however, a plan could
be developed to build a librarian’s managerial toolkit prior to becoming a manager through the
early years of holding the first managerial position. For the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in
particular, the majority of those pieces are either already in place or are working for certain
individuals in specific situations. Given the data and outcomes from this report, it would not be
overly difficult to create an institutional approach to managerial development and succession
planning by highlighting more explicitly the pieces that are already in place.

4.3.2

Influencers

This section discusses the interpersonal and social nature of much of the learning for the
managers in this study. First and foremost, most participants cite at least one boss who was
influential in how they adapted to becoming a manager. [The word “boss” is used in both the
Hill and McCall, et. al. studies more often than “supervisor;” likewise, many of the participants
in this study also referenced “bosses.” Thus, a “boss” here is used mainly to distinguish these
influencers from the participants’ current supervisors, discussed below.] In some cases, it was a
positive experience that the participant adapted into his/her own approach or style. In other
circumstances, it was a negative experience (sometimes profoundly so) that impacted them and
138

they rejected the behavior and, conversely, worked to do the opposite in the appropriate
circumstances. Relatedly, most of the participants also referred to other managers who were not
bosses but in whom they had observed certain behaviors that they adapted or rejected, depending
on the model provided. Likewise, their current supervisors not only provide support to the
participants doing their jobs and helping when problems arise, but they, themselves, have also
changed some of their own approaches that were noted positively as being influential in the
participants own handling of the changes in the organization. Finally, for most participants, their
peers have played a significant role in this journey. From already being familiar with each other,
as many of the former Children's Librarians are, to being an important alternative to talking to a
supervisor, these participants have relied heavily on each other both formally and informally.

4.3.2.1 Bosses
It is natural that, when becoming a boss, people reflect on the bosses they have had while
working, often deciding on which behaviors to adopt and which ones to reject. So it came as no
surprise that these participants noted a number of positive and negative experiences with
supervisors and the impact it has had on them while becoming managers themselves. Most
experiences shared were very positive and attached to specific ways in which they now operate
as a supervisor. For example, Mary Beth notes:
…[T]here were managers, almost all of [whom] provided me with the opportunity to
work through my ideas and really take the lead in and go above and beyond in my job.
And I really appreciated that because it allowed me to grow and learn within the
organization… As a manager, then, I tried to provide as many opportunities to my staff
when they wanted to do something that was outside of their typical job description.
(personal communications, June-November 2014)
Similarly, bosses could be encouraging while at the same time giving corrective feedback so that
participants could build skills in a safe environment. Sarah describes such an experience:
139

She taught me how to be a good manger by modeling behaviors for me and giving me
increasing responsibility over time for supervising and managing a staff and projects. She
always let me know what I was doing well, gave me helpful input, pointing out what I
could have done in a different way or what I didn’t do correctly. While I have always
gotten along with people, she taught me the difference between working with people and
managing them while still being able to be myself. It was a difficult lesson for me to learn
because I was always pretty easy going. Thanks to her, I was ready to for my first
managerial job; I had had the opportunity to make my mistakes and become comfortable
in that type of position before becoming a manager. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
Unsurprisingly, other bosses exhibited behaviors that, even years later, these managers
distinctly remember. Prior to becoming a librarian, Patte recalls working in a university center
and seeing a boss interact with a subordinate: “I once got off an elevator and heard [a supervisor]
chew out one of her staff in a public place in a very, very demeaning way and I said [to myself,]
‘I am never going to do that, never ever.’” (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Often, these participants have turned the witnessed or experienced negative behaviors around
and adapted them, operating differently in similar situations. Mark mentions a boss:
…who was adept at taking credit [for others’ work]. They’re small things and they don't
ever lend themselves to pay increases to have your name out there, but I felt they
impacted the morale. That’s one thing I did learn [as an employee, changing that
experience] from a negative to a positive [when I became a manager] because credit
doesn't cost you anything and to give it is easy in a non-merit-based system. It does have
value, even to just say thank you and acknowledge the work that they did, I feel has a
great benefit and it's very important and it really lends itself to their job satisfaction. I
feel [that way] because I felt that…myself. (personal communications, June-November
2014)
Sometimes, the lessons provided became a measurement of one's own behavior. Megan
gives a vignette of a situation that happened prior to becoming a manager that she now uses to
gauge whether she, too, might be reacting in a way she would rather not:
On the side of where things that remind me where the line might be, I had a supervisor at
one point who didn't work the desk area very often [but when she did,] she was so
frustrated with the type of scrap paper we were using that she put a note on the scrap
paper container outlining the exact size that the scrap paper is supposed to be. That's one
that is always in the back of my head, not so much as don't regulate scrap paper, [but]
140

more as there is a line on where your personal preferences need to be set aside. That's the
one that I try to check in with myself periodically, ‘okay, are you distressed by this
because there is a legitimate situation or are you distressed because it isn't the way you
would've done it and you're not thinking about the fact that this will still work fine?’ If
this works for the other person, you need to just butt out because it doesn't effect the
performance, efficiency, ability to serve customers, ability to work on projects, ability to
complete things properly; just let it go. I think that's one of the ones that I’m just always
thinking about because it's like ‘am I regulating the size of the scrap paper; have I gone
completely overboard in my personal preferences?’ (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
4.3.2.2 Managers as Models
Other managers, such as administrators or other supervisors, can be equally influential in how a
manager develops. Sometimes, this is quite purposeful, as Elizabeth’s quote mentioned earlier
shows, in seeking out those who have a common background like Children's Librarians or people
who have a similar approach to management. Christine did something similar, in looking to
people who had a similar style and outlook as her own: “As far as what I did after I had the
position, I studied managers that I wanted to be like and asked them questions. I'm never going
to be a stickler for rules and policies, so I focused on managers who were a little more off the
grid and more creative, but also good leaders with happy, productive staffs.” (personal
communications, June-November 2014) Likewise, Karen R., when she first became a manager,
purposefully looked for models who she could emulate: “[At the time,] I was very aware that I
had a lot to learn and I wanted to grab as much as I could from as many people as I could, and so
I just watched…and modeled the behavior of people I respected and admired.” (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Leadership behavior is another piece that managers look to a wide variety of people to
learn from. Jen discovered a quality among a number of administrators and managers in the
organization that she works to adopt:

141

The best leaders that I see in this organization are people who know when to ask for
consensus [but] also know when to be decisive, and I feel like that really helps facilitate
progress. [You have to be] prepared to say ‘this isn’t something that we need to discuss
forever and ever amen; this will be the decision’ and [then] we’ll all get on the team. But
when there's an opportunity or it's important to get the voices, you allow those voices to
be heard. So that to me is what I think is a great leader within the organization; I see
several of the senior staff do it all the time; it's almost like predetermined consensus or
led discussion with a goal in mind. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Those outside the organization provide model behaviors as well, as Holly notes:
I [also] recently, for the first time, joined the board of an organization that's a nonprofit
[that does] social services around Pittsburgh and their executive director is a really great
leader. Honestly, I've learned from her confidence and also from her ability to not put up
with [things]. [When] she talks about [the] organization [or] staffing issues, [she
demonstrates] recognizing problems and then acting on them right away and talking
about them openly and not in a judgmental way. I really appreciate it and learn from that.
Just being on that board has really been an eye-opener for me in terms of leadership.
(personal communications, June-November 2014)
4.3.2.3 Current Supervisors
There were many positive expressions about the current supervisors for this group of managers.
A few representative ones include:
•
•

•

•

My current supervisor is a great mentor and coach and her door is ALWAYS open for
advice in every type of situation. (Kathy, personal communications, June-November
2014)
[My supervisor] has really been a mentor, as far as managing and the technical end of
things; she does a really good orientation when she has a new manager where she goes
over just about everything, and she has an open-door policy… (Patte, personal
communications, June-November 2014)
[Working with my supervisor,] it’s a different kind of work setting because [she works in]
another building, but [she’s] available via phone or email and responds quickly. If I'm
told to do something by my supervisor, I make sure it's done. I have a good deal of
respect [for her] and her words, [which] to me are very meaningful in what should be
done. (Chris, personal communications, June-November 2014)
The current branch manager is [relatively] new… she’s wonderful and is very interested
in knowing what's going on in Children's and Teen services. She's very supportive of the
work that we do [and] has an open-door policy so I know that I can go to her at any point
that I'm trying to work things out… (Megan, personal communications, June-November
2014)

142

Most notable, however, is the mention of the supervisors more recently meeting with their direct
reports:
•
•

•

This year we've been checking in [with our supervisor] quarterly to talk with her [about]
what we're working on. (Holly, personal communications, June-November 2014)
We meet monthly now [but] when I first started in May, we met every week for 12
weeks. I’d have my write-up of everything that happened that week and all the things I
wanted to talk about [and] we talked through it. (LeeAnn, personal communications,
June-November 2014)
I talk to her as she meets with me one-on-one; that’s a new practice [that’s] emerged here.
(Mark, personal communications, June-November 2014)
Another highly influential change has happened at the branch managers meetings where

the Assistant Director for Neighborhood Libraries has started a book discussion. Karen R.
describes how it operates and its impact:
I’m…benefitting from our book discussions at branch meeting and appreciate that [our
supervisor] bought all of us copies of…Managing Transitions and Crucial
Conversations. We are assigned a particular number of pages to read by the next branch
meeting and [then] we talk about it. People have been very receptive to it [and] she chose
two excellent titles…So the book discussion group is very rich; I think everybody's really
enjoying talking about the books and sharing our experiences, whether personally or
professionally. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
The books, along with the subsequent discussions, have clearly had an impact just by the number
of participants who mentioned it in both their diary entries and interviews, even just briefly as an
element used toward gaining proficiency.
Some also revealed how they have used the information or been influenced by reading
and discussing these. LeeAnn, for example, has used the information in situations as they have
arisen; however, she is also aware that the advice they provide is not always applicable or
possible to employ in the moment:
Mary’s had us read recently a book called Crucial Conversations which was essentially
about how to manage those tense situations that I've already experienced as a manager. I
think it relates back to how I reacted to that Page when I was 22; it's like these books are
really detail-oriented and very intentional. It's easy when you're in a high stress situation
to just shoot from the hip, but I think books like we've been reading just help you to step
143

back and think deliberately about a situation and how it should be handled at a time when
you're not right in the middle of it. [It] can be molded depending on where you are at that
moment, because sometimes the theoretical answer you’ll get in Crucial Conversations
isn't really going to work, but it's helpful; it's another tool. (personal communications,
June-November 2014)
Finally, the Assistant Directors began a few years ago to assign peer mentors to new
managers, regardless of whether they had been in the organization or even a manager before. In
this study, there are currently two active sets of mentor-mentees and all four participants
reference the relationships. Karen R., one of the current mentors, has also been a mentor before
to another participant, Holly, who also refers to that relationship, even thought the formal
connection has now passed:
When I first started in the Teen Department, my mentor [at the time was a] manager
[who] is so positive and so good at solving problems that her style inspires me too. She
doesn't take things personally… [Being] a model of positive behavior was one good
thing I got out of that relationship, always taking everything that's thrown at you and
working with it instead of breaking down or trying to fight against it, and doing it in a
positive way. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
In her current mentor relationship with Jody, Karen R. describes it this way:
She knows she can pick up the phone and call me at any time and I will give her 100% of
my attention and do my very best to suggest scenarios [and] think out loud…. So for me,
it's a lot of listening; it's a lot of being supportive and it's reinforcing the fact that she's
doing a great job and encouraging her and commiserating because we both a very large
staffs, so there’s always something happening. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
For Jody, it has made a significant difference as well: “Another wonderful resource I’ve had in
this new position is a mentor. On Day 1 as a branch manager, I was partnered with another
manager from a similar location. I have called this person often to ask questions and seek advice.
This mentorship allows me to address issues and make decisions quickly and confidently,
because I have a seasoned, trusted person guiding me.” (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)

144

A lack of a mentor made a noted difference for at least one manager who started before
the practice began. Mark notes:
The organization has changed a lot [since I became a manager and] the position is more
supported. When I first started, I didn't have [an] assigned a mentor… I feel like just
having someone you can speak openly and honestly about what you don't know, what
you need to learn, would be the most helpful thing, so you don't fear being wrong [which]
can result in something negative… [Ultimately,] the best thing that would've benefited
me the most would've been to have somebody I really trusted as a mentor who I could
bounce some things off of, who could save you from going over the cliff, even though
you're driving the car. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
4.3.2.4 Peers
While the relationships built through a formal peer mentoring process have developed some
strong bonds among the group, participants referenced the managers as a group as being
instrumental to both their early growth and even now as the organization goes through multiple
changes and adjustments.

Initially, a manager may not know or feel comfortable with a

supervisor and does not want to appear unknowledgeable; thus, a peer becomes an attractive
alternative. Madison describes “us[ing] my network of fellow managers who I go to whenever I
am puzzled, frustrated, bewildered, or just plain stuck. Sometimes it’s easier to learn from my
peers, because I don’t feel the pressure of appearing to understand something I haven’t grasped
yet.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Seasoned managers also look to and rely on the peer network, even when it is a challenge
to do so, as it is for Karen M. who holds a unique position as a one-person department
overseeing the substitute pool. Recognizing that peers are a valuable resource, Karen M. states,
“My greatest challenge right now is the ability to network with other managers. There is a
natural communication channel between managers when they are in similar stages in their lives
or work in Main because they see each other.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)

145

Even the manager meetings themselves and the lunch afterwards provide support and help, as
Marian points out:
…one of the things that's really great about our branch managers meetings is that we go
over these kinds of procedures and skills and talk about them, and I think that's very
useful… I learn a lot from my colleagues. What's interesting to me is even the informal
lunches with colleagues where we can talk about [things]… and people will share how
they’ve corrected issues. I find that very helpful. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
A number of managers mentioned lunch dates, whether with many of them following a meeting
or just with one or two, as a vital piece of the peer network. Madison states, “I have lunch pretty
regularly with two of my fellow managers and we remind ourselves that we can talk about things
other than the library but we mostly end up talking about the library and I find it so helpful.”
(personal communications, June-November 2014) Finally, working with peers can also be a
learning experience, as Marian states, “I think that one of the first positions we hired was a
Children's Librarian, which is a very important position in a small branch and the Children's
Coordinator was the person who would interview staff candidates with me. I think from that
very first, I learned a lot from her on not only what kind of questions to ask, but how to interpret
their answers.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)
It should be noted that there are some unique positions within the organization, and these
managers are often doing their work (or at least a portion of it) alone, and recognize the difficulty
of not having a specific peer group. Most notably, in this study, these include Wes, Senior
Librarian in charge of the JCEC [Job, Career and Education Center], Mary Beth, Coordinator of
Children’s Services, and Karen M., manager of the substitute pool.

LeeAnn, who was a

coordinator prior to her current managerial position, sums it up, “In my previous role, it was a
little different because there weren’t as many of us as there are in the branch manager position. I
feel like I have a peer group now.” (personal communications, June-November 2014) While
146

these three managers all have supervisory roles, they operate somewhat differently, sharing the
responsibility with other managers as many staff members work across the system or Main
Library. Furthermore, the singular focus of these roles, be it a service or supporting operations,
also colors where the majority of the managerial focus lies, which is often working with and
influencing a wide variety of people rather than having primary responsibilities for a department
or location where services are carried out. Thus, while in their transformations shared some
similarities, their experiences, challenges, and situations did not always fit as neatly into the
comparisons that emerged from most of the participants.
Likewise, another unique position is the one Megan holds, which is manager of
Children’s Services at one of the largest and busiest branches in the system. While her work
overlaps with a number of other managerial positions, including the Senior Librarians in charge
of Children’s Services at other large and busy branches and the head of the Children’s
Department at Main Library, it is her position as second-in-command of the branch (as laid out
in her job duties) in the absence of the branch manager that makes it unusual. While other
positions may operate as the person in charge absent managers in other branches or departments,
this position is apparently the only one with the “second-in-command” charge. Thus, as Megan
relates, “… there are some of us that are now Library Services Managers that don't feel like we
necessarily match up with anybody else; we don't have anybody else in the organization that
does something that feels like our exact position.” (personal communications, June-November
2014)

4.3.3

Proficiency

In the planning of this study, the word “proficiency” was purposely chosen and left undefined.
Other words that could have been used include “expertise” and “competence” but were discarded
as potentially having too many negative connotations that might lead very few in the study to
admit that they have achieved that level (expertise) or that they had well surpassed it, possibly
even before holding a managerial position (competence). Thus, proficient, while not completely
neutral, seemed to potentially carry the least negative connotations.
As this study is meant to tell the story of the journey from librarian to proficient manager,
it was also important not to describe or define too strictly what the endpoint should be. Instead,
refraining from defining proficiency, the researcher let each participant decide and describe the
endpoint for themselves. Likewise, it was also important not to provide a managerial or
leadership competency list such as the ones discussed in Chapter 2 because that too presumes an
endpoint that is not only prescribed but also assumes an accuracy that has not been tested enough
to warrant basing this research on it. Further, this study's purpose is not to create yet another list
that provides a detailed accounting of what constitutes managers’ knowledge, skills, and
behaviors needed to do their work but is meant to begin to lay the foundation from which further
leadership and competency studies can be conducted, including testing the outcomes of those
studies without necessitating as many assumptions in the future.
Thus, in the diary entries, one of the first things the researcher looked for was how the
participants were defining proficiency for themselves and how they measure themselves against
it. This was identified as important by the six Pierce County Library System managers who
piloted the questions prior to the beginning of the research. From these observations, as advised
by the pilot group, a question was created and posed during the first round interviews with the in148

depth participants. What emerged is how many participants had a certain level of comfort and
confidence listed as important to achieve proficiency. A few even went so far as to say they
would not likely achieve proficiency if they were never comfortable or confident doing it. A
good example of this is from Denise who has worked to become more comfortable and confident
doing performance appraisals, working with supervisors and mentors to write and conduct them;
yet, years later, she still feels a lack of proficiency in doing them:
The evaluation is still something I struggle with every September. I don't know that I'll
ever really feel proficient at it. I'm getting better; I have keywords now. I'm keeping
these little 3 x 5 cards for what they say or I keep notes on my computer, so each year I
have something to refer back to at evaluation time. But I don't know that I'll ever be
proficient with it. My staff is more comfortable coming in here talking than I am talking
to them. To me, proficiency means doing it easy, just one more task to check off your todo list and that's not something I can do. I dread it. When they start talking [about]
evaluation time, I can feel the tension crawling up the back of my neck. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
This fear or dread was noted by a number of participants; however, all recognized that it
cannot be what stops them from doing what is part of a manager's work. Ian discusses the
importance of not letting a lack of proficiency, for whatever reason, be why a manager does not
address or do something:
Sometimes, you just have to do things and plow ahead and you can't use analyzing,
wanting to be comfortable [doing something as an excuse]. I think that can be a
hindrance to doing things. Confidence and comfort is something that is produced by
repeatedly coming through situations, that doing something over and over, and
acknowledging that I can do this and I know that I could do this because I have done this
Time A, Time B, Time C, Time D. However, if you can do something, then you're
proficient. That wanting to feel comfortable and confident can inhibit you in doing
things at certain times because you’re afraid of making a mistake, afraid you don't how to
do it, or it's not something you like to do. (personal communications, June-November
2014)
Thus, fear is certainly one motivating factor in the quest toward proficiency for these
managers. Another is identifying a successful outcome and then working to achieve that, as Patte
responds quite simply to the researcher’s question about the clues associated with not being
149

proficient, “If I'm not getting the right results…” (personal communications, June-November
2014) The response can be more descriptive and explicit, however, especially when it is a more
complex skill like public speaking. Sarah imagines what the outcome looks like when it happens:
“[I know I will be proficient] when I can get up there and be able to talk without notes, or very
few notes, stand up there and be able to make them feel connected with me, rather than reading
off notes or reading notes and then looking up a minute and then reading notes again…and be
able to really connect with them and make them feel like I'm talking to them personally.”
(personal communications, June-November 2014)
Occasionally, the need to become more proficient shows up, particularly for newer
managers, through initial misconceptions about an element of the work. Jen notes:
I [didn’t] fully understanding how much time and energy is required in the people piece
of managing. I always assumed that people mostly managed themselves. I would've
liked to have prepared more in researching interpersonal communication, personal
dynamics in small workspaces, how to win friends and influence people, all of those
kinds of skills that I felt were natural things that you had the ability to communicate with
your staff [as their] leader. But it is a refined skill and that's been where I've had to focus
most of my energy and learning is on managing people well… I [do] feel that I have
gained people management skills. I feel more comfortable dealing with stressful
situations and am more confident providing correction… I have learned that thinking
through these deliveries assists with feeling prepared and confident in your conversations.
(personal communications, June-November 2014)
Yet, although a manager is able to do the job required and even with many opportunities
to practice the skill, comfort and confidence may still be a factor regardless of proficiency, as
LeeAnn points out about her former position:
I think you can be proficient and not be confident at the same time; however, you have to
fake confidence to be proficient sometimes. I have always been terrified when it comes
to public speaking… I will raise my hand in class and talk for seven minutes but when it
comes to something that's really formal [where] I have a podium, a PowerPoint, or book
talking in grad school, that definitely made me sick. I had to do so much of it as the
Coordinator… I did a session at PLA [where] there were 300 people in the room; I did a
presentation for the Board; I did a presentation at the quarterly managers’ meeting. It
was at least once a month where I would have something I would have to do. I never
150

loved it; maybe the last time I spoke I was like “okay, I'm good, I can do this.” Previous
to that, I was not excited about it; I did not feel good about it. I knew that I could do it
and I did it well because people told me that but it took me a long time to get there and it
was part of the reason why wanted to move on. Personally, I don't really feel like I've
aced something unless I feel confident… [I]f I was excited about doing public speaking,
felt super confident about it as a thing I was going to go do, then I probably would have
felt like I was proficient and wanted to keep doing that job. (personal communications,
June-November 2014)
While many participants found formal opportunities to help build a variety of skills (a
Leadership Institute conducted for CLP managers was named by many participants as an integral
piece of the journey), it was not limited to the typical training workshops and continuing
education opportunities. For example, Sarah set out to find a way to conquer her fear of public
speaking and also do it where she could have plenty of practice and support:
I am working on becoming a more effective and influential advocate for CLP. Although
I have always loved my work and loved being part of CLP, it has always been very
difficult and uncomfortable for me to talk to large groups. I have always worried that I
would not leave a good impression or that they would go away with an incorrect
message. I have joined Toastmasters and it has helped me gain confidence and become
much more comfortable speaking to groups and clearly getting the message across. Now I
actually enjoy speaking to groups and advocating and spreading the word about CLP. The
skills I am learning and practicing in a safe environment have made a world of difference
for me. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Like Sarah, there are many participants who, instead of avoiding the discomfort and the
duties associated with it, instead purposefully put themselves in situations where they can
address the discomfort and work to become not only more comfortable, but also gain confidence
along the way. Marian provides a great example, stating:
In the last five years or so, I have been trying to take on a leadership role with my
colleagues and peers. This is hard for me, and I tend to struggle with the idea of me in
this role and I tend to hold back. As part of the Leadership Institute, I was part of a small
group that was charged with planning a professional event for the library. This was one of
the first times that I took on the leadership role with a group of my colleagues. I [also]
served on the planning committee for the Pennsylvania Library Association’s annual
conference and this gave me the chance to work with colleagues from across the state. As
I gain confidence in my abilities, I challenge myself to continue with taking on stronger
and more visible leadership roles. [Regarding being actively involved with a Patron
151

Experience Focus Area (PEFA),] probably in the past, I would not have been a
participant that was very active, but I’ve actually volunteered to be one of the group
leaders and I don't think I would've done that 5 [or] 10 years ago. I think I’ve really
spread my wings. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Even managers who have been doing managerial work for a number of years can still feel
the pinch of discomfort that has to be pushed through to do what needs to be done. Kathy
discusses addressing her own occasional lack of comfort and confidence in some situations:
I’m still a little bit shy, I really am, and sometimes I have to get myself up to speed in
new situations… I still would rather have people ask me a question than approach
anyone, only because that shyness does hold me back somewhat, but I am getting better
at it; I do work at it. I do try and place myself in situations where I'm uncomfortable and
force myself to talk to new people and do different things and it's not easy for me, but I
force myself to do that because I figure this is the only way that you're going to get more
comfortable speaking up in group situations. …[as] my natural inclination is just to sit
back and observe. …[O]ver the years, I am becoming better and better because it's my
responsibility, especially as the department manager to make sure that the department is
represented and my two cents are put in wherever it's appropriate… for the good of the
Department. [I]f I don't feel comfortable doing it, I don't think I'm doing my best at it…
When I don't feel that comfortable, I feel that I need to work better at what I'm doing and
do it more often and become more knowledgeable to get that comfort level up, then I feel
it's something that I own. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
A few managers also listed self-interest as an important motivating factor, particularly in
getting over discomfort. Christine recognizes that:
[I]t’s partly just my personality to encourage people because if my staff here does well, I
do well, so obviously there's a bit of self-interest. I don't want to come to work with a
bunch of miserable people, so the more I encourage people to do their best and to try new
things, the better off we all are because now they're happy and they’re not bored which
means I don't have to hire somebody when they quit because they're bored. Some of it is
just basic self-interest; if this place runs smoothly, everything is good. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Occasionally, for some participants, self-interest as a motivating factor involves selfassessment and awareness, as Megan demonstrates:
I am a perfectionist and one of the things that [I’m continually] learning is when to let
something go for me personally and for the people around me and the world at large. It’s
recognizing that things aren’t ever going to be perfect [and that] you don't have that type
of control. I usually say that I'm a recovering perfectionist because I have gotten a lot
152

better at recognizing that if I try to do every project to the point that I believe is going to
be perfect, it's never going to get turned in, whether it's an assignment or anything else.
So [I’m] living with the messiness. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Ultimately, many participants come to the same conclusion that proficiency happens not
only by actively working to learn the knowledge, skills, and behaviors, but it also involves
practice through encountering and dealing with similar situations multiple times along with
having more time in the job and gaining maturity in general. As Madison points out:
I waited to attempt applying for this position until I was 50. I had my masters degree, I
had done all the educational groundwork, and I felt comfortable. I was ready for this job,
I convinced the people who were hiring to hire me, and I'm happy here. I don't think
there's anything else I would've done to prepare. I can't imagine being thrown into this
position 20 years ago. I would not have been ready. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
Likewise, a younger manager like LeeAnn acknowledges a similar feeling:
[In general,] I feel like I’ve grown up, realized [the part age has played] and been aware
of it. [Now,] it’s all about me and the way I project myself. I'm definitely managing two
people who are older than me and I'm confident [as] the leader of this branch. It’s
different than when I was 22 and I didn't know what I was doing. I've had experience and
I feel more confident [and] proficient [which has] helped. I heard a TED talk once [that
said] ‘it's not fake it till you make it; it's fake it until you are it.’ (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Ian, however, sums it up best: “It’s just time…whether you're baking a cake or becoming a
manager, you have to give it time. (personal communications, June-November 2014)

FINDINGS: CASE STUDY

Naturally, to work in any organization, regardless of size, staff have to know what it means to
work in that specific organization beyond the basics of a job description and the business itself.
This includes everything from the business of how to get the work done (e.g., who to call, what

153

forms to fill out, who approves what) to the more complex nature of a workplace culture,
regardless of the hierarchical chart (e.g., who really knows what, who holds influence and power,
what one can or cannot do regardless of the official policies, procedures, and rules). As any new
employee knows, this can be anywhere from a fairly short and easy learning process to a more
involved and complex one that only reveals itself over time. Holly, for example, who has been
part of the organization for eight years is still learning things: “[I’m really] learning the official
and unofficial ways in which everyone has power in my building and then working within that
structure.” (personal communications, June-November 2014) In this particular case study, almost
all participants, regardless of length of time in their current position, have been with the
organization for more than three years. In fact, only one manager (Jody) is truly new to the
organization in the last few years. Thus, they have had the opportunity to get to know and
experience the organizational culture even given all of the changes that have been taking place
over the last 10 to 15 years. Therefore, many participants have long institutional memories and
could describe the more subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) changes to both the work of the
managers and the organization but also those changes that have impacted the culture.
As an institution, the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh is well-established with an
illustrious history. In 1890, Andrew Carnegie gave the city one million dollars to build and
equip the Main Library and five branches. Ground was broken on the Main Library in 1893 and
Carnegie dedicated it in 1895. By 1900, the five additional branches were open to the public,
and in 1901, a training class for Children’s Librarians was launched, becoming the precursor to
the University of Pittsburgh’s LIS program. 5 A history such as this certainly can have an impact
on those who work there, including the managers. For example, Madison expresses, “I love
5

154

working for this venerable institution, with its grand architecture and reputation as THE Carnegie
Library. This organization is old and well-respected and we've done great work for 100+ years
and I don't want anyone on my staff to feel like they're not doing a good job continuing the
tradition. I just want to do the best job I can and live up to the Carnegie’s reputation.” (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Due to the longevity of the staff, including many of the managers, it is easy for them to
not only delineate the changes throughout the years, but also detail the impact of the more recent
ones. One significant change that began more than a decade ago was more support for those in
managerial positions, as Kathy recounts, “Back then, the library didn't offer us much training [in
being a manager]; they just expected you to do it. Eventually, the organization started giving us
opportunities for different trainings in being a professional manager… and I took advantage of
all of that.” (personal communications, June-November 2014) This support has only increased
in the last few years as noted by the examples earlier in the Current Supervisor section of this
chapter.
The more recent changes, however, seem to have had the most profound impact on the
participants. Ian gives an overall description of what this looks like:
[This] big picture, the systemwide role that I'm expected to do be a part of in terms of
committee work, Patron Experience Focus Areas (PEFAs) and changing the nuts and
bolts of how we do Reader Services, Reference Services, programming, all of those
changes that are happening for the library organization as a whole, which affects the nuts
and bolts of how we do business. [B]ut [it] also [changes] the philosophy of how we
interact with customers, how we see those relationships, what the priorities…are. Those
are all being informed or created on this larger, overarching level which is [happening in]
discussions across email and committee work and when the leadership team meets. That
kind of big picture is something that all staff has an opportunity to jump in and out of that
conversation as their schedule permits, but for somebody in my position, we’re expected
now to be simultaneously at both of these levels: one, at the local branch talking with
person front of you, but also participating in these more abstract, ideal relationships and
philosophies that the library is creating now. (personal communications, June-November
2014)
155

It's even changing the nature of the relationship between administrators and front-line
managers. Jen characterizes the change this way:
[Part of the difference is because] traditionally there has not really been a relationship
[between the administrators and the managers]. The Director was [a] kind of figurehead
and then the other senior staff had their roles and you had your senior staff person that
you worked however many layers under and that's how it was. But that definitely has
changed. With Mary Frances [Director] being a librarian [the two previous directors
were from outside the library field], she gets it more than other directors have. She’s not
a figurehead; she is a senior library director with experience and she really understands
the staff-end of things more than anybody really has. Sue [Deputy Director] is wonderful
too. She is always willing to have a great conversation about something. You won't even
realize it at the time, but later on you'll hear it come up in another discussion [and] you’re
thinking ‘boy, she really listened to me, thought about that idea and what she could do
with it’ and then brought it to a level where it can be discussed beyond just what you
[thought was an] opportunity to chat about with her walking down the hallway. Now, it
is realistic to believe that when something is happening down here, it can easily make its
way up to the higher level of management and they will be thoughtful about that
information and what to do with it and implement it into our practices more than it was
before, definitely more over the past few years. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
4.4.1

Challenges of Change

This new way of working does come with a number of challenges. One is that cultural and
institutional change happens but much more slowly than changing a process or rule, which most
managers note. Wes talks about trying to straddle the past and the future while the changes are
taking place: “There's a lot of change happening right now. I can feel it just based on moving
from being an LA [Library Assistant] and what it was like here as an LA five years ago to now…
The feeling of the change is palpable and I’m trying to adjust to where we’re going. I'm
forward-thinking so I'm with the change, but I’m kind of stuck [in my department] in a past
world, too.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)

156

Furthermore, the more “open” the organization becomes, the more all staff can and are
encouraged participate. Ian portrays it that:
Right now in this organization to be a leader, there's a lot of opportunity to take
something and run with it. The administration wants input from people in positions such
as mine as well as those above and below the division of labor, and really values their
ideas and wants them to be involved in making the library a better place and improving
service to the public. There's real opportunities to take something and run with it and
develop it and have actual input. Having been with the library for a while now, I know
that right now, there is much more of a climate of openness to new ideas, of wanting to
hear input of staff… That was not the case I think when I first started working at the
library. So had you been interviewing someone in my position 10 years ago or 15 years
ago, the answers might be very different; it was much more hierarchical. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
However, there is still the mundane nature of getting permission to go forward and
commit organizational resources, especially as who gives that permission may change as well,
depending on what the project is:
…anybody can do [or influence] anything; a Library Assistant with a great idea can take
it to the top and make it happen, which really makes it a wonderful place to work. [It
means] being more hands-on and learning how the library works from top to bottom, and
I did stumble a few times because of [the necessity to] understand who works in which
department, who is responsible for saying yes to whatever you're trying to do or who
needs to get this form that you have to fill out. [And that’s changing too because] the
administrative structure is changing. (Holly, personal communications, June-November
2014)
This new openness, allowing all staff to voice their opinions and ideas, has been
embraced by the managers and is most often described positively, as Chris does:
…[I]n the past things were done broken down by category, salary, and where you
worked; [now] those walls are being brought down because of the Strategic Plan. People
are getting a real chance now, no matter what they're doing, to be a leader. People run
meetings that aren’t senior administrators and people talk on the SLACK [an internal
communication tool explained below] channel to one another…and people were
encouraged, from Page up, to join one of [the] PEFAs, or at least comment on SLACK,
and that's giving people [the chance to] become leaders. People usually don't have a
voice [but] they have a voice now… [and] are given a real opportunity to shine. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)

157

Nevertheless, the participants also recognize and feel the challenge of managing so many
more voices in the conversation. The two factors most noted by managers, particularly as it
relates to a new internal communication tool called SLACK, as referenced by Chris above,
which the organization is using to facilitate these systemwide ongoing conversations, is time to
be committed to listening to all the voices and what to pay attention to. Madison, for example, is
one who talks about the time issue:
[One communication challenge is] SLACK, [which has] 30 [or] more channels; if I have
it open on my computer, then any new message written pops up and that's actually
helpful for me because I can glance at it and I'm either interested or not and it helps me
remember that I need to pay attention to SLACK. On the other hand, those 30+ channels
are full of hundreds of ideas flying around and I often go a whole week without looking
at SLACK, because you could spend all day reading and responding. Coping with all
these ideas flying around is a challenge. I want to be aware but I also want to get my
work done. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Relatedly, Karen M. among others, note the difficulty in managing the sheer volume of
information shared and trying to figure out what is the most important:
This idea of everyone being able to contribute to discussion is causing frustration and a
lot of time to dig through to find ideas presented by staff who aware of the higher level
decisions that are being made. We are now using the communication tool SLACK
[where] there are a hundred short bits of comments from staff… This makes everyone
have to spend more time looking through the weeds to find out what the administration
really wants. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
These organizational changes have very specific impacts on the library locations
themselves as well. While these changes are embraced and welcomed by the managers, they also
come with challenges around changing how staff does their work. For example, Jen outlines the
need for managers and staff to pay attention to what is happening across the system, not just in
their own branch:
…although we're in our buildings and we’re dealing with all the things that that entails
everyday, we also need to be involved in the system overall and communicating what
we're learning with our employees, communicating what our employees are teaching us
back up to the administrative level, and then also coordinating when we can. What I
158

mean by that is, if one person's doing a finance program [at a branch] and one person is
doing a finance program [at another branch], previously it would've always been two
finance programs and no one would know. Now we need to be responsible for making
sure that we're on top of our game, knowing what's going on in other parts of the library
so that we can make those efforts larger and better. Quite honestly, it makes us look
foolish the way that we had been doing it because people come in and say ‘Hey, what
time is that house-buying program at Carrick?’ [and our response was] ‘there is a housebuying program at Carrick?’ That's not an acceptable way to work, so I think that it's
about everybody knowing as much as they can about what everyone else is doing, but
still providing the best service you can to the people that are in front of you. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
These changes also impact how the participants, as managers, approach their own work
and help their staff with all the change. As Karen R. indicates, it means managers learning to
work at a different level than they have in the past:
Things that have changed would be the role of manager as a visionary and leader and
trying to embrace the concept of what the system is doing as a whole. So it's more of
managing from a higher level… I've been really conscious of the movement from a
manager who does tasks and has immediate responsibilities that are day-to-day [to] more
of an effort to eliminate some of that from the managers’ work so we do more of the
global work. I think that's the biggest trend I've seen. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
This means, in turn, that managers must spend more time with staff. Holly mentions what
that looks like in her department:
…we’re trying to change the service…look[ing] at what [the] collections are [and] trying
to institute more outreach and cut back on programs; that’s a lot for my department to
handle. I [can] say ‘we’re going to do it’ and then…sit in my office and type reports all
day, [but] people might not understand [or] if they have questions or complaints and they
want to work through them [but] I'm not there, then that's an issue. So talking through
the process a lot with people, especially people who have different styles than I do, it's
really important right now and will be for the next year or more. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
It also means, according to many like Jen, that it is the manager’s responsibility to not only keep
up on the changes, but also to be sure that it is communicated to staff appropriately:
…you need to be sure that, as the standards change, people are aware of them [because]
you can't blame someone for not doing something that they were never told they were
supposed to be doing in the first place. Because we’re developing all new standards and
159

changing, you have to make sure that everyone is clear on what is expected and that those
behaviors that are to the contrary are not intentional. So I try to be sure that people are
communicated to in a positive way whenever possible, like ‘you know, you really should
have been doing it this way; here's why; next time let's try to do better’ instead of just
‘you messed up and here's why and you're in trouble.’ (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
Lastly, the changes are becoming integrated as part of how managers are working with
each other. For Chris, the change among the managers has been invaluable:
When I started, about half the managers were different than they are now and half of us
have been on at least as long as I have (that’s just a ballpark). People would go to lunch
and talk but [but not like it is now]. It’s been a cultural change. Things are a lot more
open now; I don't know if it's the people that are being brought in, coupled with the
Strategic Plan, coupled with Sue [the Deputy Director who] encourages communication
and openness and dialog, but people are getting it and it's really improved. You could
always call somebody and ask what they did [in a given situation] but now you really
[can] have a conversation with them. It is real change because you had some of the ‘old
guard’ that weren't as forthcoming with things or didn't really ask if you needed help, no
matter how long you've been on the job. [Now] people are getting it and people's minds
are changing that we should all help each other out. It’s pretty cool; you can support each
other and talk to each other and rely on each other. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
4.4.1.1 Friction Points between the “Old World” and New
Additionally, the organizational changes bring forth pieces that have not been transformed yet
and are now working somewhat more poorly within the organizational structure than they were
before the changes. The two most apparent pieces that came to the forefront as part of this study
are the performance appraisal process and the Senior Librarian position. These friction points,
unlike many of the other categories addressed in this study, brought more wide-ranging
viewpoints. Regarding the appraisal process, a few managers were quite vociferous in how they
felt about it. For example, Mark shares:
I don't like the appraisal process. What I don't like about the process is that nobody likes
the process; the employees don't like the process either. In fact, I had a branch meeting
[where] an employee was openly denigrating the process…and I have new employees
there [so] I'm forced into a position to defend the process, and I'm coming off as
insincere…[Unfortunately,] the thing is the evaluations are primarily a tool for negative
160

and I only know that because I went to court and they pulled this person's evaluations and
that’s what they were looking for [was a] pattern [of behavior] to argue against
unemployment… [T]hat’s definitely one thing that I [now] understand about them.
(personal communications, June-November 2014)
On the other hand, Marian appreciates them:
I find the annual performance review to be very helpful when it comes to setting
performance goals for the upcoming year. It also provides an opportunity for staff to see
and appreciate their accomplishments from year to year. We all make goals every year
and I think it's interesting to see whether the goals are actually met and sometimes they
are and sometimes they're not… I think it's a time, even though I try to dole out praise
and criticism all year round, to reflect on last year and talk about next year. And I'm
trying to work with some staff to even career plan… (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)
Yet, what is most notable is the cautious optimism that, given all the other changes, this
too could change and become something better, as Christine reflects:
I hate giving performance reviews. Frankly, it's in part because no one takes them
seriously because they aren't tied to anything. You can get a 5.0 or 0.0 and you'll still get
a raise. It's impossible to get fired from CLP and terrible employees can linger for
decades, even with bad reviews. So there is no impetus to care about your self-evaluation
or [the] evaluation. To gain proficiency in this would mean changing a whole culture,
which is actually happening right now through our Strategic Plan workgroups. So we'll
see. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Similarly, the Senior Librarian position appears to be one that has not changed over time
organizationally but instead has evolved to fit specific department and branch situations. In terms
of this study, it means that only a handful (5) of Senior Librarians of the 24 total working in the
organization are part of the population due to the study’s definition that managers have to
supervise staff to be included. Often those in the position are unclear as to why it's classified the
way that it is, at least among those who have held or currently are holding the position. Holly,
whose former managerial position started out in the Senior Librarian classification, notes,
“officially for six months, I was Senior Librarian and then they bumped me up to manager.
Senior Librarian is a weird position; it means different things in different departments, so

161

essentially I was the manager when I started.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)
Wes, who is still in this classification, finds quite a bit of dichotomy in his role, even as to
whether it is really a managerial position:
I became a library manager when I obtained my current role in the Job & Career
Education Center in 2011. There’s a twist here, though: My title is technically Senior
Librarian. The Senior Librarian position includes some managerial duties, such as
scheduling staff and classes (which, in fact, I’d been doing for our PC Center as an LA),
but otherwise it was not meant to be a pure managerial role. But, I turned it into
something bigger. [Just before I took over, the service was] hobbling along in name but
not really in service. They put it into the Reference Department and under the manager
there, changing the person in charge [of the JCEC] into a Senior Librarian rather than
manager just to keep it alive temporarily… [Although it] was part of Reference, I was
going to managers meetings which I think was an important detail, because [the Assistant
Director for Main Library] thought I should be there since it was a department I was in
charge of even though I sort of wasn’t… It became clear over year or two that I was
essentially managing this thing and it is a department that has systemwide responsibilities
and services, but my rank as Senior Librarian was really part of the whole original idea to
roll it into another department and that's why there's that difference there. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
In the branches, on the other hand, the Senior Librarians that are included in the study’s
population have a distinct work description that encompasses three distinct areas: responsibility
over a Children's Room at a large branch and the service as a whole, supervisor of the staff of the
Children's Room who provide the service, and a provider of Children's Services through public
floor duties and programming. Elizabeth describes it this way:
The position I currently hold is not considered a library manager. It is a Senior Librarian
position with supervisor/leadership responsibilities; although some may call it a
management position. As a Senior Librarian, we’re a librarian level above a regular
librarian. My responsibility as a Senior Librarian is to manage staff; we’re also
responsible for running the Children's Room, managing it, putting out a schedule of the
staff, delegating tasks to the other staff, setting goals within our Children's Room on the
day-to-day running of it, and I'm responsible for the appraisals for those staff… [Also]
we have to do programming, both in-house and outreach, and collection development [as]
we’re responsible for own collections [and] we help our library users. …[M]ost recently
with our new Children's Coordinator, Senior Librarians [have been] put in positions as
committee chairs, so now we have committee [leadership responsibilities] within
Children's Services. (personal communications, June-November 2014)

4.4.1.2 Is There a Culture of Not Firing People?
Finally in multiple interviews, there emerged mixed thoughts on the organizational culture
around firing people. Like most organizations, it can be a long, difficult process to decide to let
someone go and then act on that decision. Certainly, many participants have had to discipline
and/or fire employees and recounted many lessons learned related to the process. Yet, others
strongly felt that part of the reason for the arduousness of the process was due to a culture within
the organization that no one should be fired. Joyce, who has been in the organization for over 30
years, best relates the evolution of the culture:
There’s an old saying here ‘we never let anybody go no matter how bad they are at what
they do.’ Ten or twenty years ago, it used to be that they could just move you around.
The thing was [that] we’ll find somewhere where they'll fit better. An organization can’t
just kept moving people around, but that was the way it was. It was like a family and if
this relative can't make it there, we’ll move him over to Aunt Sophie's house; she has a
room and she’ll work him out, and you may move that family member around and
around. I think that it's [been] very hard for us as an organization; we have such a private
way of looking at employees. Because it would be considered dirty laundry, we don't air
our dirty laundry. You would really have to do something really bad to be fired. I’d say
that it's harder now to let things go as long; there’s a level of transparency that had to
come as we recognized that we are a business and not a family. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Others still feel the pinch of working with staff who are not quite up to standard, but not
being able to get through the process to let anyone go: “In my experience, it has been a lot easier
for me to say ‘dude, get your [act] together’ than it has to actually do a corrective action, and
thankfully, I haven't really had to do that process. I've gotten close, but I haven't ever had to do
the whole thing.” (Christine, personal communications, June-November 2014)

Like the

appraisal process and the Senior Librarian position, cultural attitudes around firing people or,
more accurately, addressing problem behaviors, those not doing their jobs, and generally holding
people accountable also seems to be changing and is ripe for discussion among the
administrators’ and managers’ networks. Setting their minds to it, as they have to the other
163

organizational challenges they have conquered in the past few years, this seems to need only
attention to get everyone on the same page and any lingering issues with the disciplinary process
resolved.

4.4.2

Strategic Plan as Catylist

The primary instigator of the most recent changes has been the Strategic Plan. A few years ago,
the organization hired a consultant to facilitate the creation process over the course of a year. The
process was expansive and included discussions with stakeholders and the public, as well as
multiple meetings with staff. Thus, the process itself has had a profound impact, as Jen relates:
I [have been] through two Strategic Planning processes and by comparison, this one was
a completely different, because the last time a Strategic Plan was delivered, there were
people selected to be on the groups but no one really knew who they were or what they
were doing … This time, you have no ability to argue because you’ve been able to argue
all along; you have no right to say ‘that's a bad idea’ because every staff has had some
point in time where they have connected or been directly involved in the process of
developing a Strategic Plan and now, beyond that, the PEFAs … The administrators don't
really own it; we own it and now that they're turning to us and saying ‘okay implement
it,’ you don't have a choice. You were recruited on the team hard-core. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Because of this ownership of the Strategic Plan, the front-line managers are instrumental
in making sure the changes brought about by the implementation happen not only across the
system but also have real concrete meaning for the staff. Holly states, “…the most important
duty I have right now is leading change. There are things that need to change in our location so
that we can better serve the public and help achieve Strategic Plan goals.” (personal
communications, June-November 2014) Constant referral to the Strategic Plan seems to help
crystallize many managers’ thinking and keeps it at the forefront of what they do every day. For
Jody, it is simply that, “I have the six goals posted on the bulletin board at my desk to keep me
164

focused on the steps I need to take to promote CLP’s mission.” (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014) For Holly, it keeps her focused on the work and not the areas where she might
get bogged down:
I think having this outside entity, [of] the Strategic Plan and all the work around it, has
been really helpful to me to think about the direction that we should go in, how the work
that we do fits into it, and just moving toward it. Because if you have that as an anchor, it
becomes about community and it helps me remember that, at the end of the day, it's not
about me feeling pressured; it's about [whether] we are giving the best service that we can
to the community. I actually have a little post-it above my computer that says ‘how can I
solve this problem and do so in a way that benefits the community we serve’ and [helps
me from] getting caught up in any personal relationship issues that I might have,
positively or negatively. At the end of the day, it's about the people who use the library
and the people in our community. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
For Karen R., it means redefining the work of a manager to become the person who helps
make it more understandable for the staff: “In managers meetings, we talk about the CLP system
and about the vision and the mission of the organization, which are not concrete. It can be
difficult to get your head [and] hands wrapped around it. As a manager, my job is to take that
and interpret that to this is what this means [for] us as a staff, boots on the ground [in] our dayto-day, face-to-face contact with the public.” (personal communications, June-November 2014)
One way to redefine is to focus on common vocabulary often found in Strategic Plan documents
and discussions. In this study, many of the participants relate some of the common vocabulary
by giving examples through their own usage in the diary entries and the interviews. The two
most common were the liberal use of the word “community” and the customer service concept of
“getting to yes.” As Karen R. explains:
Hopefully those phrases [the common vocabulary coming from the Strategic Plan work]
will become internalized as people begin to think about a new program, a new outreach,
or another way of working with the public in providing services in the library. So if I'm
saying it frequently and if materials are available to people, like the customer service
standards for example, hopefully we’re talking about it every day throughout our regular
work week [and] in staff meetings [and] the connections will begin to be more concrete
and apparent to people. (personal communications, June-November 2014)

Implementation, as all staff continue to be actively involved, brings its own set of
challenges to the managers, however. One is trying to find the balance in the work. Madison has
struggled with balancing between the current work of the department and thinking strategically
about the future and understanding what that is ultimately going to mean for her staff and the
work that they do:
I don’t feel I have the background to anticipate future needs. Working to ID and
understand current needs is overwhelming enough. [As part of] leadership, there’s the
day-to-day running of a department and that is a fairly defined list of elements, but I think
the thing that surprised me was being asked to plan a strategy for the librarian in the 21st
century. That was not part of my LIS education in the least. So trying to figure out how
to make my department relevant in the new world, I'm being called upon to lead that and
that's more challenging for me than the kind of day-to-day ‘people skills,’ keeping
everybody communicating and relatively challenged and happy. (personal
communications, June-November 2014)
Holly also struggles to find a balance, this one between accomplishing the daily work of
the department and letting staff observe and work in other departments to learn:
My job has changed because the Strategic Plan and part of it is, even though I say I like
change, sometimes it’s uncomfortable for me to institute certain parts, like CLP as a
learning organization. I'm sending my staff out to other places to learn. Rather than
sending them to webinars about genealogy, they are shadowing the Pennsylvania
Department librarians, which makes me [think] ‘oh, I hate to lose that staff time’ but I
understand overall it's going to benefit our patrons and the organization. So personally I
struggle with little things like that, but overall I’m accepting. (personal communications,
June-November 2014)
Another major challenge has been the reworking of multiple front-line managerial job
titles and descriptions that existed among the heads of Main Library departments and the heads
of the branch locations. Just a few weeks after the first diary entry was sent to participants, the
organization rolled out a new position, Library Services Manager. [See Appendix F to review the
job description.] Ian, a relatively new manager, describes the evolution:
I have been working in my current role for just a little over a year and a half and the
expectations of the position have changed for managers. We received a new job
166

description several months ago; the library is a year and a half or so into its current fiveyear Strategic Plan. As part of that Strategic Plan, there has been a tremendous influx of
work to do that is for the Strategic Plan [which] is being created from the bottom and
middle up… So when I first started, my duties we’re to manage the facility [and] be the
Adult Librarian in terms of programming and reference responsibilities Now the focus is
shifting even more away from a public service role. I do spend some time doing public
service [but] it's much much less than what I first started. [Instead,] I find myself really
squirreled away in the back, in my office dealing with systemwide committee work to
improve library service or around specific initiatives that have come out of work
surrounding the Strategic Plan. It has actually changed a fair amount, just in about 18
months. (personal communications, June-November 2014)
For some, the new job description, which combined a number of branch and department
managerial positions represented in this study into one (the Senior Librarian and Coordinator
positions are still separate and active), seems to come as a relief, because it includes more about
relationship-building in the community. Megan, the manager of Children’s Services at one of
the largest and busiest branches in the system, states:
They created a bunch of positions that’s now called the Library Services Manager
position; and it's a really interesting way of looking at what we do as managers. [When] I
read it, [I] found it to be really relieving because it identifies the fact that certainly I am
the direct support for my staff on the front lines, but it also branches out into my work as
a connector, as somebody who can connects community organizations to the library and
the library to community organizations. There’s our daily tasks and what we do to
manage and supervise, and then there's this big overarching piece for how we move
forward as an organization, and that we are some of the main people that are doing that
pushing and that's how we’re moving forward. (personal communications, JuneNovember 2014)

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK CONCLUSIONS

Much of what has been discussed in the Findings sections of this chapter were also found by the
two business studies used as the conceptual frameworks. After the majority of the codes were
established following the end of phase 1 (the diary entries) and emerging themes were being
noted and explored in the researcher’s journal, the first comparison between the Provisional
167

codes and categories, which came from the Hill and McCall, et. al. studies, and this study’s
codes and categories were made. The researcher’s first reaction was how many codes and
categories were similar, even though different language was used (Provisional codes or
categories listed first/this study’s codes listed second):
•
•
•
•

Dispelling Myths/Misconceptions
Developmental Assignments, Making Sense of Work/Prior experiences, Apprenticeships,
Unofficial Manager, Lessons Learned
Role of Peers and Colleagues, The Value of Networks/Peers, Influencers
Gaining Self-Knowledge, Learning from Reflection/Reflection, Misconceptions
Following the end of the clarifying interviews and starting the first round of in-depth

interviews, as the study shifted from phase 1 to phase 2, these initial thoughts about emerging
themes became the basis for journal entries and analytic memos, some of which referenced a few
of the most apparent similarities and differences between this study and the conceptual
framework studies. The first difference noted was the amount of emotion exhibited in language
and tone, particularly in the responses regarding pride of work and love of job, seen most often
as public librarianship in general. This pride and love of job is completely absent in the two
business studies.
The second difference is a potential paradox: the participants recounted examples of a
variety of experiences that could be defined loosely as “developmental assignments” (the
language McCall, et. al. uses to describe purposeful pre-managerial company assignments and
very early managerial assignments both meant to build leadership and management knowledge,
skills, and behaviors). At the same time, there were a number of participants who, even years
later, have not made a complete transformation to management, at least as defined by Hill, not
necessarily because they did not want to do so but because of the job duties as assigned, which

168

often included being an Adult Services Librarian and having regularly scheduled shifts on the
public floor helping customers so that all open hours of a branch or department are covered.
Although not directly articulated this way by any participant, the implication of some of
the responses was that there is some tension between completely transforming into a manager
and still remaining tethered to librarian tasks and duties. For many, this tension was related more
as a fact of work life and hardly noticeable, especially by those who have been in this situation
for many years. For others, especially those with less time as a manager, it was just a matter of
becoming efficient (and proficient) enough with managerial duties as to make that balance as
seamless as it has been for their more established peers.
By the time the second round of interviews began, the emerging themes were becoming
more solidified in the data and it was clear that certain ones would need to be addressed in this
report. One of these themes was the heavy influence of others on the journey from librarian to
proficient manager. From the first diary entries through the final round of interviews, example
after example showed how these participants learned from an assortment of people, but most
often from other managers, whether former bosses, current supervisors, or other managers who
act as models. McCall, et. al. (1988) found “[a]lmost 20 percent of the events in the careers of
executives we studied featured a specific person or event rather than an assignment… These
were stories of individuals who, because of their position, or what they stood for, or what they
did, left a vivid and lasting mark on the developing executive.” (p. 67) Hill (2003) found the
same thing in her study: “If on-the-job experience was the quintessential teacher for the new
managers, the second most important teacher was observing and interacting with coworkers: past
and current bosses and past and current associates (principally peers). From these experiences

169

the managers acquired not only important competencies, but also important values and attitudes,
and instrumental and psychosocial support.” (p. 200)
As in both the Hill and McCall, et. al. studies, this research also found that these
developmental assignments, even though less planned and more serendipitous than their
corporate counterparts, and the influence of other managers and peers to be the two most notable
and impactful findings for these participants. Yet, after reviewing the intersections of codes and
themes between this study and those of the conceptual framework, it also became clear that there
were codes and related themes from this study that were not found in either the Hill or McCall,
et. al. studies, beyond the apparent incomplete transformation from producer to manager, as
defined by Hill.
The first difference, as referenced earlier, was the amount of emotion, mainly in form of
pride and love of job that came through almost universally among the participants. While some
comments focused on specific duties such as working with children or answering reference
questions, most often the comments referred to the profession as a whole, including helping
people and providing needed services, especially for those with no other resources or recourse.
Unlike the executives in the McCall, et. al. studies or the securities firm and computer company
managers in Hill’s study, the commitment to the profession seems to be an important factor on
this journey for the participants.
Relatedly, the second difference was the discussion of customers and community as not
only a motivating factor in their work but also a guide and goal for their work. Every participant
mentioned customers and the community as an important aspect of her current work, continuing
to embrace the apparent motivation behind becoming a public librarian. While each participant
discussed the community somewhat differently, the fact that all of the them mentioned the

170

community is significant, particularly when compared to the business studies where motivation
for a job or working in a specific industry does not get discussed, which implies it is not a factor
for either becoming a manager or doing managerial work in many industries. Certainly, the new
job description, which also mentions community as part of their job, has played a part in all of
them discussing it as part of their work; however, it cannot be the only reason, given how many
also discussed the love of the work they do.
As these comparisons show, the management of public libraries is complex enough that
there can be no wholesale adoption of frameworks or theories from business research. On the
other hand, the number of similarities means that all frameworks or theories from business, or
other fields, cannot be completely dismissed or ignored. Therefore, as research in public library
management grows, one major aspect, along with the collection of more data regarding
individuals’ journeys from librarian to proficient manager, should be testing out a variety of
frameworks and theories from business and other fields to find the ones most descriptive of
public library managers.

4.6

REVISITING THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS

In conclusion, a review of the research findings shows that the study is successful not only in
describing what the journey from librarian to proficient manager looks like for a group of
individuals but also in showing how the interactions with others and the organization itself helps
in the transition. Below are the ways in which each of the four research questions are answered
through the data collected.

171

Question 1: What are the most influential or impactful ways that public library managers gain
knowledge, proficiency, and/or expertise?
The majority of the diary prompts and interview questions were aimed at answering this
question to be able to describe the journey from librarian to proficient manager. While there
were an array of answers as unique as the individuals who participated, there were some
similarities, such as observing and identifying models (whether former bosses, current
supervisors, administrators, or peers), capitalizing on and learning from previous experiences,
and actively working to become proficient particularly in areas that prove to be personally
difficult. What the descriptions in this report, along with the profiles in Appendix G, show is
that finding the right mix of learning and resources is critical in the journey and while there will
be similarities with others, finding what one’s own unique mix is proves to be the most essential.
With a continued research agenda into how people become public library managers (regardless
of whether they are master-degreed librarians or have a different background of education and
experience), such a preponderance of data will allow researchers and practitioners to work
toward developing a learning framework for public library mangers as unique as the public
library institution itself.
Question 2: In their view, what are the critical knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to
succeed at being a public library manager?
This question was based initially on the researcher’s anecdotal evidence and personal
experience that managers, including those within the same library system, often have very
different views on what the components of a front-line public library manager’s job entails, even
when the job classification and description is the same. That proved to be unfounded in this
study, mainly because the new Library Services Manager job description was introduced within a

172

few weeks of launching this research study. Thus, participants’ answers elicited from diary
prompts and interview questions in this area were remarkably similar. Moreover, this new job
description was more than changing language and tasks; instead, it was about changing the
fundamental way participants did their work, which meant that there were lots of conversations,
often led by supervisors and administrators, among those now holding this new job title. While
the new job description universally focused the participants’ answers to the researcher’s
questions about what they considered the most important aspects of their job, the follow-up
questions during the interviews revealed a better idea of what this change meant for each of them
and how they were coping and working to operate differently than they had before.
Question 3: How do public library managers view leadership and what role does it play in their
work?
Likewise, questions around leadership elicited very similar responses, mostly focused on
their role in working with staff to understand the implications of the Strategic Plan for their
specific location and the community involved, whether a physical neighborhood within the city
or a particular group of users like businesses or musicians. Again, because of the new job
description, as well as staff’s deep role in developing and implementing the Strategic Plan, these
participants were relatively unanimous in what leadership meant to them and what it meant to be
a leader in the organization today. However, that is not to say that there is nothing to be gleaned
from how they view leadership in general and how they integrate leadership actions and
behaviors into their day-to-day work lives. The most compelling leadership examples can be
found in the profiles. What is most notable is that the participants themselves do not always
identify that they are behaving as leaders, but instead view their actions simply as part of what
they do and are expected to do as managers.

173

Question 4: How do managers make meaning out of their challenges and experiences and apply
the lessons learned?
Similarly, the best answer to this question is found in the profiles themselves, as well as
some of the quotes found in this chapter. For both the newer managers, who are in the process of
discovering what these experiences and challenges really mean for them, and the more
experienced managers, particularly those who have been doing this longer and are reflecting
back over their work as they near retirement, all the participants are constantly reflecting,
reevaluating, measuring their own levels of proficiency, and checking in with one another to
assess where they are as managers as compared to where they need to be. All of the managers in
this study gave examples of where they had learned lessons and how they had made meaning out
of critical, and sometimes quite difficult, experiences. A few were actually in the process of
trying to make meaning out of experiences they were currently going through or had gone
through very recently, giving the researcher an intimate view of what some of those struggles
look like so they could reach the “lesson learned” stage and put the emotion around the event or
situation behind them. Regardless of where a manager was, however, on the spectrum of making
meaning out of a variety of experiences, all articulated how important these situations were to
becoming a more proficient manager.

CONCLUSIONS

The primary advantage to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in agreeing to let managers
participate in this study is access to the data revealed in this report. Given the level of rapport
and trust that was not only built with the researcher, but also shown to be held for the current
administrators and the Strategic Plan itself (and by extension, all of the changes that have been
wrought from it), this report can provide the organization the raw materials from which to build a
working developmental framework for managers (although it would be helpful to have created
profiles for all twenty-one participants, which still could be done). Thus, taking the findings
illustrated here, the managers and administrators can create a more intentional approach to
building leaders at all levels of the organization (which they have already begun to do) to have
more people prepared not only to go into managerial positions, but also potentially even
master’s-degree positions.
For example, Daudelin’s (1996) study of 48 managers on “which of these three ways of
reflecting — along with a helper or in a small group — is the most effective in helping managers
enhance learning from challenging work experiences” came to some of the same conclusions that
seem to be exhibited in this organization. (p. 43) Daudelin’s study shows the strongest learning
about self-knowledge and awareness happens when reflecting alone or with one other person,
such as a mentor, supervisor, or peer. However, reflecting as a peer group can also be useful as
it is where much of learning about each other and the organization happens. Combining the two
175

and formalizing reflective activities, many of which are already informally taking place, could
prove useful within this organization.
As an organization that already has a strong “grow your own” culture, it would not take
much effort to make the “growth” process more intentional and organizationally-supported.
Likewise, as the peer network has grown in strength and begun to work across “silos,” (recently,
Main Library and branch managers have been meeting as a group occasionally, for example),
what started as a formal peer mentoring experience for new managers and the built-in peer
network among former Children’s Librarians has the potential to flourish into a full support
network that can continue throughout the initial years of that transformative process from
librarian to proficient manager.
Furthermore, while specific to this organization, this framework can also provide a
starting point for further public library management research by testing hypotheses and
assumptions. This study provides the basis from which an initial model framework can be
created, provide a suggested way that other researchers or practitioners can replicate the study in
their own organizations and, through sharing their own findings, continue to grow the
preponderance of data necessary to create a framework strong enough to posit theories about
how librarians become proficient public library managers. It also becomes a place to situate
other studies, most notably the leadership and competency studies discussed in Chapter 2, which
now operate mainly as stand-alone studies that, while contributing to knowledge, do not connect
with enough other studies to further the concepts of public library management in general.
The organization can also continue to contribute to knowledge of public library
managers. This study is merely a snapshot of a particular place and time. Given the number of
changes and the impacts of these changes in the last few years, it is clear that had this study been

176

conducted at the time of the strategic learning workshops, for example, the outcomes and
descriptions of the research would have been very different. As the organization was beginning
the initial pieces to prepare everyone for the changes that were to come, the snapshot would
likely have been more blurry.

Instead, the snapshot here shows both individuals and an

organization that has embraced the changes, even while struggling through many of the elements
and repercussions of those changes and grasping to understand the longer-term ramifications.
Remarkably, there was very little negativity or stress around what had and is currently taking
place. Although there was certainly some, it was not enough of a by-product to be commented
on in this report.
Thus, one additional contribution this organization could make is allowing another
similar study to be done three to five years from now to take another snapshot. Adding a
longitudinal element would only strengthen the outcomes while at the same time, continue to add
to and fine-tune any conceptual framework that comes from this study and any others collecting
similar data. Also, given the longevity of the staff in general and the managers in particular in
the organization, it is very likely the majority would still be there, strengthening the comparative
aspects of a longitudinal study further.
As in many studies, the richness and volume of the data collected create the research
conundrum of choosing which themes to discuss and which data points to use as illustrations.
Each of the quotations solicited from the participants could have been replaced with those from
others without diluting any of their supportive and illustrative qualities. Moreover, with this
amount and quality of data, there are always categories, themes, thoughts, and ideas omitted
when writing the initial report. The rest of this chapter will explore several topics that are
currently present in the data as these exist and those topics that are raised by various points

177

which are not supported sufficiently enough in these data but warrant further study. Finally, the
dissertation concludes with a review of where this study might lead in developing a public
library management research framework.

5.1

5.1.1

STUDY DATA AND ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS

Current Data

The volume and richness of data this study produced, even following the work done analyzing
and reporting for this dissertation, still holds many categories and themes to be reviewed and
analyzed. Four themes in particular were difficult to leave behind when deciding what to include.
Below are brief discussions regarding the information shared in the areas of supervision,
mentoring, creating balances, and the role and complexity of communication, especially in a
larger organization undergoing critical change. Each of these themes deserve further exploration
in the current data, as well as further study.

5.1.1.1 Supervision
Narrative examples abound in the data of how these managers have worked to become proficient
in the area of supervising staff. These examples vary greatly due to a number of factors including
whether a manager had the opportunity to supervise prior to holding a managerial position
officially, the age and experiences of the person prior to becoming a manager, the quality of the
bosses and other managerial models to whom they were exposed, the number of staff they were
required to supervise directly in their first managerial position, and whether the staff included
178

anyone who needed either corrective or disciplinary action almost immediately upon taking up
the post. One main reason for the rich data in this area is because of the definition of the
population for this study, which required managers to have supervisory responsibility to be
included. Another reason, again based on the definition of the population, is that the second diary
entry focused the inquiries on learning to supervise and becoming proficient. The researcher
logically reasoned that this would be one managerial duty that the entire population would have
in common regardless of position or department.
Even absent the diary prompts focusing on supervision, however, it is likely that a
number of learning situations shared would have included those related to supervising staff
because, as many participants noted, it is one of the primary areas in which they were likely not
to have had as much experience in the wide variety of situations that are often present when
supervising staff. It is also the one area where more than one participant responded to the
researcher’s question about what they wish they had learned in school. Thus, when discussing
learning and proficiency in general, stories related to supervising staff or being supervised
themselves most often came up as examples. Moreover, for quite a few managers, it has been the
area with the steepest ongoing learning curve even after managing for a few years. Hence, there
is a plethora of data relating to supervising that should be analyzed and discussed in future
articles or other reports.

5.1.1.2 Mentoring
Like the word “proficiency,” in discussions pertaining to peers, supervisors, former bosses, and
other influential people, it became clear that participants had slightly different views and
definitions of what constitutes a mentor. Overwhelmingly, this study shows both a group of
individuals and organization as a whole who have embraced the social nature of learning,
179

particularly in a managerial position as someone is performing the work at the same time they
are learning the job. There is literature in both the library and business fields (as well as other
fields) which should be studied and compared with the data from this organization.

One

potential comparison, for example, is peer coaching, which has been explored by Parker, et. al.
(2008) who, in their article “Peer Coaching: A Relational Process for Accelerating Career
Learning” distinguish between peer mentoring and coaching and present a theoretical model for
when and how peer coaching works. Using their model as a springboard for the study’s analysis
in this area could lead to developing deeper understanding of peer mentoring and coaching, as
well as if this model works in public libraries.
What makes these data potentially unique, however, is twofold: (1) the research did not
focus specifically on mentors per se as an influencer, but instead let the participants identify and
describe the relationships; (2) the organization itself uses the word “mentor” as part of its
common vocabulary among managers especially since beginning to assign peer mentors to new
managers. As a result, the further analysis of these data could contribute to, strengthen, or
provide a counterpoint to studies that are limited to study only mentoring, particularly in the
library management field.

5.1.1.3 Balancing Acts
The researcher posited that part of the data outcomes would likely include areas where managers
found it necessary to balance between two strong yet independent pulls on their time and
attention, and maneuverability would necessitate keeping a balance between the two to achieve
all that was required, depending on the situation. One area identified was the balance between
work and personal life, given that many managers, particularly in branches, are often "on call"
nights and weekends. Surprisingly, only a few mentioned this in particular as a learning piece
180

between librarian and proficient manager. For a few others, it was clear that no balance was
necessary as they viewed work and home life as fully integrated.
Another area that was anticipated was balancing between librarian and managerial duties.
As mentioned earlier, particularly in Hill’s study, part of becoming a manager requires a
complete transformation from being a star producer to managerial duties now focused on getting
others to do the necessary work instead of doing it oneself. Yet, particularly in the smaller
branches and departments in this organization, the staffing levels require that a manager often
operate as an Adult and/or Teen Services Librarian, including spending regular hours assigned to
the public floor and producing programs. Examples of this particular balance between required
librarian duties and managerial duties is recounted enough in the data of this study that the data
can be analyzed on its own with the outcomes reported, as this is likely to be found as a common
experience for many managers at libraries of all sizes. Furthermore, additional studies could
provide data on when this full transformation, using Hill’s definitions, takes place in the
leadership pipeline. However, the data should also be reviewed and included as part of the
overall topic of managers’ balancing acts, as it potentially influences and impinges on other
necessary areas of balance.
Depending on the role the manager plays both in a particular department or location and
participation at the systemwide level, that manager is likely to have anywhere from a few to
multiple areas to balance to lead the department or location successfully. For those participants
who are still part of the Children's Services structure, many commented on finding appropriate
balances between answering to the Children's Services needs and branch or department needs,
implementing systemwide Children’s Services initiatives that honor the requirements of
similarity across the system while tweaking them to be meaningful to their particular customers

181

and community, and helping Children's Librarians manage similar balances between the needs of
the local Children's Room and the needs of the branch or department, as well as managing their
local job duties against those of the system. Likewise, particularly in the last few years as more
and more managers are asked or required to participate in systemwide planning such as the
Strategic Plan workgroups and PEFAs, as well as any managerial work groups and committees,
the managers also feel the tug of their staff who want and need them to be present supporting and
leading the changes that have come about because of the Strategic Plan, new customer service
standards, and the push to think outside one's own department or location.
There were also smaller balancing acts that were identified. Almost every manager
mentioned at least one, if not more, balancing acts that she manages on a regular, if not daily,
basis. Thus, identifying and cataloging the various balancing acts, as well as analyzing the data,
would be not only helpful in providing more contextual evidence of the journey for individual
managers, but also potentially critical in helping to understand not only the growing complexity
of a front-line public library manager’s job but also the growing complexity of the public library
itself.

5.1.1.4 Role of Communication
As much of the data in this study shows, communication has many facets, all of which are
critically important to the ongoing success of a changing organization. As described by many
managers, “communication” seems to have become an umbrella term that encompasses many
actions and outcomes; however, these work together and are seen as vitally important
proficiencies of a successful front-line manager. One reason this topic was most likely discussed
by most managers is due to SLACK, a relatively new internal communication tool, and the
apparent love-hate relationship most of the managers seem to have with it.
182

On its own, an analysis of the data related to SLACK provides a snapshot of an
organization as it works to find the right combination of attention, technology, and skills to
tackle such a ubiquitous yet crucial foundational piece as completing an organizational change.
This is especially true when that change impacts deeply how the organization accomplishes the
work needed to achieve its mission every day and reach its vision. Further, a deeper analysis of
communication as a whole, as well as its component parts as identified by the participants, could
lead to increased understanding of the complexity of all the learning and experiential
components needed for the librarian-to-proficient manager journey and will lead, more likely, to
additional questions requiring further study.

5.1.2

Questions Raised from the Data

As with the topics to be further explored among the current data, many questions were also
raised by the data that warrant further study. Two mentioned in the previous chapter are
exploring managers who come from distinct and established work structures within a library
organization, such as Children's Services, and those who come to the library field as a second
career and how these transformative journeys might differ for those who are new to an
organization as well as new to a managerial position. As the data continue to be reviewed and
analyzed, including the topic areas listed above, it is likely that additional questions for further
study will emerge. For example, using Karaevli and Hall’s (2006) theoretical model “showing
how managerial adaptability develops from career variety over the span of a person’s career,”
along with the questions raised in these two specific areas to inform a study, may contribute to
understanding how these elements of previous experiences in Children’s Services or manager

183

work in other fields operate within the journey from librarian to proficient public library
manager. (p. 359)
Two other areas that have emerged from the data are the role of gender in the
transformative process and the influence of an experience so critical that it impacts and colors a
person's management approach and style. While both of these topics came up for a few of the
managers, they were mainly byproducts of other questions asked by the researcher or addressed
by the participants voluntarily.

5.1.2.1 The Role of Gender
The role of being female in a predominantly female profession juxtaposed against the role of
manager in general, often held mainly by men, came up explicitly for at least three managers.
Moreover, it may have also been an underlying piece implicit in several other managers’
descriptions or even in the actions they were describing. As gender was not identified as a factor
or included in the questions asked, the researcher did not probe or explicitly draw attention to the
comments when they were made. The role of gender, however, clearly exists for at least a few of
those managers and certainly deserves study to explore whether and how gender plays a role not
only in the learning aspects of the transformative process but also in how they view or approach
the concept of management and leadership in general.

5.1.2.2 Core Critical Situations
Early on, during the clarifying interviews with the eleven who did not have in-depth interviews,
a theme was identified that there is a core experiential situation or event (or more than one) that
takes place that is so critically impactful that it completely colors a person's management
approach or style. Of the stories shared that describe such a core situation, these mainly took
184

place any time from childhood to early employment, although not universally limited to these
timeframes, and most seem to be positive, although not all. At least one manager had a highly
influential negative experience early on in his/her management career. From these, the researcher
posits that potentially all managers have these experiences that form the basis of who they
become as managers, with these experiences most often taking place before they ever think about
becoming a manager. A secondary question is whether these core experiences, if they do exist as
hypothesized here, have any influence, then, on how that journey from librarian to proficient
manager unfolds.

FURTHER STUDIES UPON DATA ANALYSIS

Finally, there are two areas where there are data from the current study to analyze but it is likely
that the analysis will produce questions that will require further study to give the data more
contextual meaning. The first relates to leadership and how it is defined and how the managers
integrate these definitions into their day-to-day work and operations. While there were questions
for the in-depth participants related to this area (and a research question on the topic of
leadership, as noted earlier), an initial look at the data reveals that managers were likely
influenced by their new job description and the discussions surrounding that. Many of the
managers gave such similar responses that it is clear they were likely recently influenced not
only to give the researcher very similar answers but is also as a result of the ongoing work to
develop a strong managerial network to have a common understanding of the work they do and
the expectations surrounding that.

185

The second area relates to LIS programs, curriculum, and its role in preparing public
library managers. In this case, the participants gave a wide variety of responses to the questions
about what role, if any, LIS played in preparing them for their current positions and what they
would tell LIS educators with regard to curriculum, given what they now know as managers.
Again, upon initial review of these data, while the responses varied greatly, there were a few
common pieces, including thoughts about Human Resources, interpersonal communications,
guidelines for dealing with both difficult staff and customers, and the general process and laws
surrounding disciplinary action and firing employees. However, a second look at the data as a
whole, even though much of these data are not in direct response to the LIS questions, other data
potentially include points that could be included in such an analysis to determine where LIS
curriculum or continuing education opportunities could focus. As with the general area of
leadership, this area, too, is likely to also produce more questions than answers, which will
warrant further study.
Moreover, there is already some work being done on building reflective practice skills
among LIS students which can then be applied as a practitioner. For example, Sen and Ford
(2009) have developed the SEA-Change Model, a reflective process which consists of three
phases:
•
•
•

The situation;
The evidence; and
The resulting action. (p. 185-186)

Although hypothesized and tested with students in an academic environment, the model could be
taught to managers to see if this model works for practitioners as it does for students. Again,
using such a model could help refine what a reflective practitioner looks like in the public library
field and further develop theories and frameworks.

5.3

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

Not surprisingly, the narratives and data reveal that gaining knowledge, skills, and behaviors to
become a proficient front-line public library manager is multifaceted and complex and, like
snowflakes, no two transformations are exactly alike. The data, however, do reveal enough
commonality to lead to a few important thoughts and conclusions. The first, particularly revealed
in the ten profiles included in Appendix G, is that the narrative profiles themselves, through
recounting each unique journey, provide not only some very specific learning tools that have
been helpful to these particular participants, but also, as a whole, reveal the general mix of
learning approaches that could be made available to peers. These approaches include a wide
variety of past and current experiences, a strong and reliable network of peers and mentors, and
the opportunity to reflect alone and with others. Although this study was conducted in an
organization in an urban environment and is of a certain size, the applicability of these
approaches are not limited to like organizations. Smaller libraries who participate in consortia,
federated systems, or library associations could also operate in lieu of a single operational
organization when it comes to supporting managers.
Second, the data and the research study itself support developing a public library
management research framework that would explore both management in general as well as the
managers themselves. Both the work of public libraries and what gets managed are equally as
important as understanding the knowledge, skills, and behaviors of those who are doing the
work. Ultimately, these are two sides of the same coin, intimately intertwined with each other.
Part of creating and continuing to develop this framework requires a blend of both researchers
and practitioners being actively involved in all aspects, working together to plan, carry out, and
share studies and data. The creation of a framework, including where it resides, could take place
187

online through a university, professional association, or other support organization, as long as
researchers and practitioners have easy and equal access to add information and participate in
dialog around it. Certainly, such a long-term and unusual collaboration could also have many
other benefits beyond the creation of an eventual set of theories surrounding public library
management and managers, not the least of which is helping bridge the divide between academia
and practitioners for the benefit of the profession.
Ultimately, such a collaboration and research framework could provide a path in which to
explore the growing complexity of public libraries, the role they play in communities, and how
they must operate in today's economic and political environment. Certainly, this study provides
one of the first glimpses into the day-to-day nature of its complex environment in which
managers must learn to successfully operate. Without trying to better understand how they truly
operate today, public libraries and the people who manage them must always be, in some ways,
reactionary to events and situations instead of finding opportunities to be responsive and flexible
while also minimizing the inevitable learning curve that happens when things change. Moreover,
having such a place to share not only data and research reports and outcomes themselves, but
also a place to share lessons learned in conducting research in these areas allows secondary
learning to also take place, hopefully relieving us from each learning the same lesson for
ourselves alone.
Finally, as mentioned throughout this report, public libraries are complex organizations
requiring those who manage them to have an ever-evolving set of knowledge, skills, and
behaviors. As shown by some of the studies discussed the literature review (Chapter 2) and also
among the findings here, many of these knowledge, skills, and behaviors can be introduced, at
the very least, and start to be built while still in a LIS program. Many of the managers in this

188

study did not intend to become a manager. Some were very surprised, even just a few years into
their career, that they found management work attractive and interesting. While no one in this
study can be seen completely as an “accidental” manager, at least from the standpoint that no one
was placed into their first managerial position without some say in the matter or required to
apply for the position, many exhibited some behaviors that could be attributed to being an
“accidental” manager, such as little detailed knowledge or understanding of some of the tasks
like scheduling or supervision. Moreover, all the participants indicated that they had been or
were in the process of being successful at becoming proficient managers; the researcher had no
opportunity to talk with any unsuccessful managers.

Thus, whether “accidental” or not,

participants in this study were exhibiting success in building and maintaining their sets of
knowledge, skills, and behaviors. Yet, there is still a cost associated when a manager fails during
the journey from librarian to proficient manager, as discussed in Chapter 1. This cost, whether to
the individual, a team and/or the organization, as well as whether psychological, economic,
and/or in terms of public relations, has become too high in public libraries that are constantly
undergoing change as a result of both internal and external pressures. Working together, public
library researchers, LIS educators, professional associations, and practitioners can find the best
ways in which to stop the “accidental” approach to public library management.

CONSENT FORM

Below is the consent form as approved the University of Pittsburgh’s Institutional Review Board
on April 28, 2014. While this study was approved as an Exempt Study, and thus did not require
a signed consent form, the researcher used one upon the request of the Director of the Carnegie
Library of Pittsburgh as a requirement of access to the participants and the organization.

Why is this study being done?
As part of the doctoral course of study, each candidate must complete independent research and
write a dissertation. This descriptive case study seeks to discover and describe how librarians
become managers and work to gain knowledge, skills, and behaviors that lead to proficiency in
190

managerial work. Telling the story of managers in the same public library also allows the
opportunity for the potential role of the organization to be described.
Who is being asked to participate?
With the help of the administrators, a total of thirty-one (31) front-line managers with
supervisory responsibilities and a master’s degree in library and information science have been
identified as the population eligible to participate.
If I agree to participate, what will I be asked to do?
There are two main parts to this study. The first includes all who volunteer to participate and
involves writing three (3) online diary entries to researcher-provided prompts. You will have
approximately ten (10) days to answer each set of prompts, which should take no more than an
hour and one-half (1.5 hours) plus any thinking time prior to writing. There are a total of three
(3) sets of prompts and this portion will take place over a month (most likely late May into June)
and should require no more than four and one-half hours (4.5 hours) of total writing time.
From those who complete the three (3) diary entries, a total of ten (10) participants will
be chosen for the second part of the study. This second part consists of two (2) in-depth
interviews with each interview participant, digitally recorded and transcribed by the researcher.
Each interview will take no more than two hours and the participant will be able to review
her/his transcripts for additions, subtractions, and clarifications after each interview.
How much time will it take?
As stated in the previous section, for most participants, it will take no more than a total of four
and one-half hours (4.5 hours) to write the three (3) diary entries. If you are chosen and agree to
participate in the interviews, it will take an additional four hours (4), plus the time to review your
transcripts. For those who participate in both parts, total time of participation will be
approximately eight and one-half hours (8.5 hours).
The Library administration has agreed to allow the study to be done during work time, so
that no personal time is required to participate.
What are the benefits to me if I participate?
The primary benefit to you will be an opportunity to consciously reflect on your thoughts and
actions while learning the work of a public library manager. By stating your actions explicitly,
you have the chance to see what your patterns are when confronted with a new opportunity,
problem, or task you have not encountered before, possibly making future efforts less daunting.
Are there any risks or costs associated with participating?
There are no financial costs associated with participating in this study. Likewise, there is
minimal risk to you directly, given the topic of the study. For many of you, as long-time
managers, the events and situations you are likely to recount will be in the past. Also, the
Library administration will not have access to any of the raw data (information) gathered through
the diary entries and interviews. Finally, you will have the opportunity to edit or remove any
statements that you feel uncomfortable with or may worry about.
Is my participation voluntary?

191

Absolutely! You will make the decision whether to participate or not. If you choose not to, you
do not need to do anything (although the researcher may contact you to only confirm that you are
not participating before the study begins). If you would like to participate, please fill out the
bottom part of this form and return it to the researcher. If at any time, after filling out the
consent form, you decide to no longer participate, you can withdraw from the study. You can
withdraw at any time up until the researcher’s dissertation is published without any penalties,
reprisals, or your information being used.
Who will see or have access to my information (data)?
The researcher will have complete access to and sole responsibility for keeping your data (diary
entries, interview recordings and transcripts) private and confidential. As part of their
responsibility to oversee the conduct of researchers, an Institutional Review Board member may
review some of the data. Likewise, the researcher’s advisor or member of the dissertation
committee may also review portions of the data in an effort to aid the researcher and ensure the
study is on track. These two situations, however, do not attach your name or any identifiers to
the data. Only the researcher will have access to information that identifies which data belongs
to each participant. Except for these specific situations, unpublished (raw) data would be shared
only in the event of a court’s subpoena (which is highly unlikely given the research topic).
Will my name and where I work be kept anonymous?
In a case study where the participants all work in similar positions in a single organization, it is
very difficult to keep the participants’ identities completely anonymous, especially from others
in the organization. Further, there may be information you share which could identify you or the
library. As there are many checkpoints for you to review your information in the study, there
will be multiple opportunities to change or remove these identifiers.
Given the topic and the potential contribution to the profession, however, there are
compelling reasons to reveal the name of the library. Because of this, the participants will decide
as a group whether to keep the library name anonymous. Likewise, each participant will decide
for her/himself whether to be kept anonymous in any published works. If the participant
chooses to be anonymous, she/he will collaborate with the researcher to establish the level of
anonymity in the dissertation and any other subsequently published works.
What happens to my information after the study and dissertation is completed?
Signing this consent form and completing the study allows the researcher to keep the
participants’ information (data) for up to three (3) years following the publication of the
dissertation for the purpose of publishing journal articles and/or a book, as well as conference,
webinar, and classroom presentations. The researcher will make a good-faith effort to contact
participants for permission following this three-year (3) period or if the information is to be used
in any other way than mentioned above.
Who can I talk with if I have further questions?
If you have further questions about the study, you may contact the researcher or faculty mentor
(contact information is listed at the top of this form). If you have any questions about your rights
as a research participant, you may contact the Human Subjects Protection Advocate and the
University of Pittsburgh IRB Office at 866-212-2668.

DIARY ENTRY AND PROMPTS (PHASE 1)

Below is a list of the prompts for the three diary entries, presented as one document. Following
this list is a sample of the first diary entry as it was sent to the participants, complete with the
instructions and formatting. Diary entries 2 and 3 followed the same formatting and instructions.

B.1

PROMPTS FOR ALL DIARY ENTRIES

Diary Entry #1: Exploring how a participant initially became a manager
1. Describe how you first became a library manager. Was this a planned step in your
career? If not, what prompted you to apply for the position? Was this managerial
position at the library in which you were working at the time?
2. Describe how you prepared for this first managerial job. If it was part of your career
plan, what steps and/or actions did you take to get ready to apply for a managerial
position? If it was not part of your plan, did you take any steps and/or actions to prepare
yourself prior to applying and/or accepting the position? What steps and/or actions did
you take during your first year to learn more about being a manager?
3. What surprised you the most that first year in that managerial position (include both
positive and negative surprises)? Describe the situation(s) or event(s). How did you
handle them?
Diary Entry #2: Exploring supervisory knowledge
1. Describe what “supervising staff” means to you.
2. Describe the situation(s) or event(s) that helped you gain the knowledge, skills, and
behaviors to supervise staff as you described it above. A few areas to think about might
include providing feedback (coaching and corrective), writing and giving performance
evaluations, or deciding when to take disciplinary action.
194

3. In which of these areas that you describe above do you feel proficient? What are the
elements that led you to believe you have gained proficiency?
4. In which of these areas that you describe above do you feel you are not proficient?
Describe what proficiency will look like for you in the area you described above. What
plans, if any, do you have toward gaining proficiency in these areas?
Diary Entry #3: Exploring the work of the manager
1. Describe the most important job duties in your current managerial position (other than
direct supervision of staff which you described in the previous diary entry).
2. Choose from one of the duties in which you are proficient and describe the situation(s) or
event(s) that led to building the knowledge, skills, and behaviors for that proficiency.
Did you already possess some of the knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed prior to
becoming a manager? If so, please include these steps and/or actions in your description.
3. Choose from one of the duties in which you are still working toward proficiency,
possibly something newly assigned as a job duty. Describe the event(s) or situation(s)
that are key to helping you gain the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that will lead to
proficiency. What are you currently doing or working on that will contribute toward
gaining your proficiency?

APPENDIX C

INTERVIEW GUIDE (PHASE 2)

First Interview: The following questions were asked by the researcher to the ten participants
chosen for the in-depth interviews. The participants were asked the same questions, although not
necessarily using the exact language or order as presented below, to assure that there would be a
minimum number of topics addressed by participants so that comparisons could be made across
their answers. The interviews averaged approximately one hour each.
Managerial work:
1. How has managerial work changed since you first became a manager? Taking one of the
more recent changes, how do you approach taking on a newly assigned task or duty?
2. Prior to becoming a manager, did you have opportunities or duties as a librarian (or in
any other position) that could be classified as management work?
3. Knowing what you know now about managerial work, what (if anything) would you have
done differently to prepare yourself before getting your first managerial position? Did
your LIS education play a role in preparing you? What would your recommendation be
to LIS educators now, in order to prepare people for management positions in the field?
4. How do you view or define leadership? What does it mean to be a leader in your library
organization?
5. What are the components of an effective leader in a position such as yours?
6. How and in what ways have you integrated your views and/or components of leadership
into the work you do?
7. Many of the participant diary entries referred to the “big picture.” Define what that
means to you.
Workplace Relationships:
1. Given all the duties that you perform as a manager, where would you rank supervising
staff, in terms of job duties?
2. What are your expectations for the staff you supervise?
3. What do you think they expect from you as a supervisor?

197

4. How do you identify issues with staff performance or the quality of the work (efficiency,
demeanor, reliability, etc.)? How do you describe your standard and how do you then
measure up to that standard? How do you handle it when the standard isn’t met?
5. Talk about HR’s relationship to you as a manager. What role, if any, do they take in
hiring, coaching, correcting, disciplining or firing your staff?
6. What role does your supervisor play in your work activities? What does your supervisor
expect from you? What do you expect from your supervisor?
7. Describe your relationships with senior managers/administrators (those who are not your
direct supervisor). What impacts do they have on ability to do your work?
8. How and in what ways do you influence (or try to) decisions that impact the work of you
and your staff does but are not your decisions to make?
9. Are there others (within or outside the library organization) who have been influential or
had an impact on how you learned your management duties? If so, describe that
relationship and how these people have impacted your work and/or influenced you.
Learning Processes:
1. Give me an example of a self-identified mistake and describe what and how you learned
from it.
2. For you, what role does comfort level and confidence in your skills and knowledge play
in your measurement of proficiency? Do you only consider yourself proficient if you feel
comfortable and confident performing a certain task or role?
Unstructured Second Interview: The second interview was unstructured and focused on each
interviewee individually, based on the responses in both the diary entries and the first interview.
The follow-up questions focused on clarifying, expanding, and obtaining deeper, richer
descriptions of the ways in which the interviewees became or are working toward becoming
proficient managers. The interviews ranged from thirty minutes to an hour and were conducted,
on average, two weeks following the first interview.

PARTICIPANT PROFILES

On the following pages are the profiles of the ten participants who participated in phase 2, the indepth interviewing. The profiles use the participant’s words to describe his or her unique
journey from librarian to proficient manager as presented to the researcher through multiple
interactions and exchanges. The language of the profiles came from the three diary entries and
the two in-depth interviews, as well as email and/or in-person exchanges discussing changes,
edits, and negotiations between the researcher and the individual. Thus, the construction of each
profile is a collaborative effort of the researcher and the participant.
Because of the collaboration and multiple exchanges between researcher and participant, it
is difficult to attribute quotes, sentences, sections, or the profile itself to a specific interaction,
whether a diary entry, interview, or email exchange. This blending of all interactions between
researcher and participant also holds true for the eleven who submitted diary entries and had one
clarification interview, as they were also allowed the same member-checking privileges and had
edits and changes to their data as used in the dissertation. Therefore, to remain as true as
possible to the APA Style guidelines as it pertains to unpublished diaries, interviews, and
correspondence while still remaining committed to the participants and some minor levels of
anonymity for their editing and negotiating actions, the citations in the text and profiles do not
reference a last name nor do they cite a specific time of the interaction. Instead, the citations
provide the timeframe in which the participants were actively providing data and interacting with
the researcher about the data.

G.1

PROFILE FOR CHRIS

G.1.1 Becoming a Manager

I started as a Page; basically, we just shelved books. It was at a smaller branch [and] once you're
there for a while, you became part of the team and, even as Pages, you could check people in and
out. Then I went full-time as a clerk at the same location; I got to do registrations and check on
holds. This was in the late ‘90s, early 2000s when the Internet was exploding; [we] started to get
computer questions that we could help with because some of the people on staff didn't know
[how to answer] the computer questions. We weren't doing any reference, just basic clerical
things. From there, I went to Telephone Reference at Main where the goal was to answer
[questions] in 3 to 5 minutes or transfer the call to an appropriate department if you couldn't
come up with the answer quickly enough. Then, I went down to Humanities as a Librarian,
which morphed into, when Humanities closed, the Reference Department.

I went back to the

First Floor once the construction was finished.
As far as how each job helped prepare me, I learned to work as part of a team; I got [the]
clerical stuff under my belt because a lot of that stuff really hasn't changed, so you got good
knowledge on how to do that. Ready Reference helped me a lot too, because it gave me the
confidence in answering a question within that short amount of time. Things were morphing into
answering questions and not doing tasks; that was really great and I picked up a lot from that job.
Humanities was great because we worked as a team and I got to answer a lot of hard reference,
[which] was when book [versus] database started happening so you learned print resources and
databases side-by-side. We got a lot of school groups that would come in from all over the area
and I scheduled the tours for them so I got to know the teachers. When I went to First Floor, we
210

were all about customer service [so] I can't walk past the book display without putting another
book back. We were emphasizing friendliness and approaching people, so I learned that. I take
that with me now, if they look lost or if there's a line, you help bail people out. I was lucky
enough to get my first Librarian job while I was just finishing up my last month of grad school. I
wanted to stay with CLP and not relocate, as I’d been in the system since high school and my
family and friends were all mostly local. In the years leading up to finishing grad school, I had
applied for jobs with CLP that involved increasing levels of responsibility and was mostly
successful in achieving upward mobility within the system, going from Page, to Page Clerk (this
title no longer exists), to full-time Clerk, to Library Assistant, and Librarian in about 7 years.
By this time, I started to think that maybe I was getting the hang of this library work, and
I enjoyed what I was doing tremendously. It was, as most of us would say, the thrill of helping
people that attracted and motivated me to choose the library as a lifelong career. [Around] 2002
the library, for a reason unknown to me, began to interview professional and paraprofessional
staff to ascertain what their career goals would be. I can recall mentioning in my interview that
I’d like to become a manager of a busy branch someday. In my yearly evaluations, I began
stating that I hoped to eventually become a manager within CLP. My opportunity for small-scale
supervision came early in 2003, when my boss in the Humanities Department asked me if I’d be
interested in supervising three part-time employees at the Library Help Desk at CLP-Main. The
Help Desk was an information kiosk manned with a staff member during peak hours with the
main goal being to point people in the direction for whatever it was that they came to the library
to accomplish. I was able to hire new Help Desk Clerks during periods of turnover, prepare
schedules for the desk, submit payroll, and conduct yearly evaluations for the staff for the rest of
my time at CLP-Main, which spanned until 2005 (I worked in the Humanities, Reference, and

211

First Floor areas during this period). I was encouraged by a former boss to apply for a Senior
Librarian job at CLP-East Liberty in 2005, which I did, and I was accepted for the job. Although
I would no longer be the direct supervisor of employees, a Senior Librarian is the backup
manager when the Branch Manager is not around, so this afforded me the experience of making
decisions in absence of the building manager. You are responsible for many of the decisions that
the manager would normally make and serve as a leader to the staff. I was encouraged during my
first stint with East Liberty to apply for openings for branch manager jobs that came up. In 2006,
I applied for the vacancy at Brookline but was turned down. Later on in the year, I was
approached about an opening for a branch manager that would oversee two branches at the same
time, West End and Sheraden. I accepted the position and started in mid-July 2006.
Before I started, I can recall reinforcing the need to think on my feet, make quick,
confident decisions, and act assertively and fairly. I was determined to not seem weak or wishywashy in my decision-making process. I wanted to make an impression immediately. When I
went for an initial visit, a PC monitor at the front desk went out, [going] completely dark. I
called it in to the Help Desk and arranged for a replacement. I thought, “Wow, I haven’t even
started, and I’m already doing good things to gain the respect of my staff!” Then, the day I
actually started, I had two calloffs out of a staff of three (not including myself). I was working in
a branch without air conditioning and the outside temperature was 95 degrees. My other branch
called several times to see where I was [but] I couldn’t leave because there were only two of us
so that visit had to wait until the next day. I discovered that something time-consuming that was
to be done daily by clerical staff hadn’t been done in several weeks during the transition from the
prior manager to my start date. This took up most of our day the first day, and, quite frankly, the

212

first day was humorous when considering the fact that anything and everything that could go
wrong did. At the end of the day, I was pretty sure I acted assertively in my decision making.
I quickly discovered that not only is there no manual for library management (despite the
textbooks published to the contrary) and that I [also] would be working a different job every day.
During my first year, that was definitely the case. I tried my best to devote equal time and energy
as well as [my] presence to each branch as the weeks turned into months. This obviously wasn’t
always possible but I thought if I [could] split my time up the middle, my head would stay above
the water. As it turned out, I would keep this mindset for the next four years. I didn’t want to sell
the staff or public of each service area short. Looking back, I wish I would have done more to
maintain the libraries and made a better mark on the facilities themselves and the collections that
each housed. [But I] came out of it a better manager. The adversity that I faced during the first
year made me a better manager in the long run as I expected the unexpected, so to speak. Things
happen in this job that you can’t control. If you use good judgment in making decisions, then you
will succeed.
I've been fortunate to have the same direct manager since [becoming a manager], so that
part has stayed stable, which has been good. But I would say that the most notable changes that
I'm coming into now have been recent. From the time I started until a year or two ago, things
were how they [had always been]. [The changes started around the time] we got our new Deputy
Director. She really pushed the Strategic Plan and different workgroups. We’re seeing a lot of
change coming down through the Strategic Plan, so that's probably the most notable change that
I've noticed in eight years. I think in management now, we’re [also] finding our peers are
everybody with this new plan and it's not all the managers sitting in a room having meetings.
Now everybody's communicating with each other and I think that's a big notable change. Those

213

are the big changes -- the Strategic Plan and communication. The way things have gone in the
past couple of years, they have changed really rapidly with those two and the workgroups have
made it condensed into one big family rather than defined lines [and] areas within job
classifications and salary levels.

G.1.2 Role as Manager

[Generally, as a manager, you have to have] confidence, good decision-making, confidence and
belief in your decisions, [be] willing to admit you're wrong when you're wrong [and] compassion
with people [when] they’re going through things with their personal lives. I [have a tendency] to
think in terms of staffing rather than in terms of what the person's really going through [so I]
have to [remember] this person is really going through a lot. So you have to have compassion,
belief in yourself, belief in your abilities. I [do] think some library experience should be
necessary, [because] you [often] have to have and find all the answers within yourself. [You also
have to] have a good rapport with people and be approachable, not come off as standoffish, rude
or mean.
[Primarily, I’m] a representative of the library for the community in which I serve and in
greater Pittsburgh as a whole [which also means] being a representative for my branch [within]
the CLP community and staff that I serve/work with. [Most commonly, I’m] examining any
problems or issues in a non-judgmental manner before making a decision with confidence;
upholding policy and procedure [while] assisting staff with these policy/procedure issues; using
good customer service strategies in my day-to-day work and imparting these skills to staff in
order to ensure that the overall goal of superior customer experience is met with ALL
transactions; leading by example; setting precedent [and] communicating messages from my
214

superiors to the staff. I enjoy being a leader, and I try to find different ways where you can assert
yourself as a leader. To me, I would say [being a leader] means having all the answers even
when you don't have the answers. I know that's vague but you have to wing it a lot. You're there
[as] the point person and you're supposed to have all the info, answers and data. I also believe
that a leader is leading by example as well, so [I] try to do things the way [I] want other people to
do things.
[At the system level,] leadership now is changing too. There are no boundaries to it and I
think that's great because in the past how things were done by [staff] category, salary, and where
you worked, walls are being brought down because of the Strategic Plan. People are getting a
real chance now too, no matter what they're doing, to be a leader. People run meetings that
aren’t senior administrators, and people talk on the SLACK channel to one another [and are
participating in] the PEFA meetings [where all] people were encouraged to join one of these
PEFAs, or at least comment on SLACK, and that's giving people [the chance to] become leaders.
People usually didn’t have a voice [but] they have a voice now and are given a real opportunity
to shine.
[One of my roles has been handling issues with customers and when I first became a
manager,] one of my branches was experiencing a sharp influx of unruly children and teens soon
after I started. The behavior mainly took the form of yelling and fighting in the building and
outside of the building, which made staff and patrons feel ill-at-ease and unsafe. Several
customers approached me and expressed concerns for their safety. I can recall times where I
would have to go outside and escort elderly patrons or patrons with small children into the
library from their cars due to the kids congregating outside the library. This all came to a boiling
point in November of my first year when I was in the middle of two groups of teens fighting

215

outside the library which spilled inside. A young woman with a knife attempted to enter the
building as I closed the door and held it shut to prevent her from entering. I instructed a staff
member to call the police. Charges were filed by the parents of the intended target of the assault.
I was eventually subpoenaed and had to attend a court hearing.
It was really a tough time; I would say it was one of the darker times in my career. When
that happened, we were all on edge and even though I was going between the two locations, I
wanted to spend more time there to calm people down. I really tried to hammer home to
facilities and security [departments] and we got a guard as a result of it. First, we had a
uniformed police officer but I really wanted to try to get a security guard there. So I tried to
spend more time there, maintain a calm presence, and if things happened again, I said “just
called 911; that's what we’ll do from here on in.” I think I was only on the job for three or four
months at the time. It was probably one of the worst things professionally that I've gone through,
between that and right after this, [there was a patron who] was leering and being overly friendly
with female staff. I'm thinking at this point “what the heck did I get myself into?” I'm trying to
figure the job out and then all this stuff is happening right off the bat. Not too far in the future
from that incident, there was a shooting on the street where the branch was and one of our staff
member’s car got hit with a stray bullet; no one got hurt but it was surmised that it was a conflict
from the high school that was right behind us that had blown up and gone outside the place. We
locked down [and] we weren't letting people in. It was quiet and we had the opportunity to open
after school at 3:00 and I said “I'd rather not; I’d rather stay locked down until closing, just
because this is going to spill right into the library.” It was a volatile time there, not for just us
but the whole neighborhood. [I learned] it was always okay to call 911. It [also] instilled the
value of needing a good guard, which we did get a few months down the road. It made me think

216

we’re just there in [an] open building [that] people could come into and use however they want;
you can use it the right way or you can use it the wrong way. It really made me realize that
we’re out there [and] we’re vulnerable. I hope it never happens again but if it does, it’s what I
will take with me.
[Thankfully,] I can always lean on my supervisor [as] she is very helpful. Even though
I've been doing this for eight years, I still feel like I'm one of the new guys, possibly because
people are in the system and have been managers for like 40 years, so 20 years is your half-life.
I still feel that there are things that I need to learn and things that I don't know so I can always go
to my boss and ask her for help. I am dealing with a situation like that now, where I'm having
some staff members that are less than thrilled to do something that they were asked to do [so] it's
getting to the point where I have to do a performance plan. I tried the one-on-one [and] I talked
to my supervisor about it. We brought in a person from HR and talked about what should be the
next step. I would really like to nip this. So it's going to come down to a performance plan and
probably something on the appraisal.
[Working with my supervisor,] it’s a different kind of work setting because [she works
in] another building, but [she’s] available via phone or email and responds quickly. If I'm told to
do something by my supervisor, I make sure it's done. I have a good deal of respect [for her] and
her words, [which] to me are very meaningful in what should be done. But it is a different
situation because you don't work together and you never know when they’re going to pop in, so
things have to look pretty good. And it’s something I say to staff too; you don't know when
somebody's walking in and just came from the gym [but] it's a Board member or your City
Council person except to [say to] treat everybody the same.

Working with her has been

invaluable [and] you know that she has your back too and [she] listens to you what you have to

217

say, and if you do something wrong, there's no BS. It's been really good; it's a good experience
having a person mentor me through this. I'm finding new things out and she really has been
giving me new ways to do things. [I do think she expects] the managers [at] the bigger branches
[to] have a little more responsibility [and] you’re expected to contribute more, whether it's
SLACK or be there for your peers. You’re expected to participate more in meetings, speak up,
and help the new people. She’s given me someone to mentor, which was valuable and I really
enjoyed working with that. She expects a lot, but you should be giving a lot. You should be
giving 100%, especially as a manager of a bigger branch.

G.1.2.1 Supervising Staff
[Supervising staff means] mentoring and leadership; setting the example; observation;
discipline/STAR-ARs [feedback mechanism] when necessary; recognition and positive feedback
when necessary; putting out fires; requisite paperwork for HR (payroll, hiring, etc.); trusting;
encouragement. The staff I have is really large so you're overseeing a lot of different things at
different times [and] you do have to deal with different situations that arise. The supervision
aspect can be time-consuming… I think payroll falls in there, paperwork for new positions falls
in there, doing schedules or looking at schedules and making sure people have time to go to
meetings, making sure people get a lunch, making sure people are not are cutting corners,
emptying the book drop every day.
[In general,] I want people to come back to the library, so [staff needs to be] friendly,
approachable. One thing that's really good that’s happening now is the emphasis on customer
service, “getting to yes.” I have a person, they took the “getting to yes” literally. We have a
gentleman, this is just an example, [who is] a patron who will push you so far so he gets what he

218

wants. Everybody knows him and that he tries to get what he can to get the most out of it. [The
staff person] added a charge for prints to his library card account to be paid later. [When] he
went to another location, they didn't do that for him. He said (this is always the line) “they did it
for me at East Liberty” and it came back to us. I talked with her and she said “ I was trying to
get to yes,” and I said “well you get it; you're doing the right thing [but] you could do it in a
different way.” If it's a policy, you can bend a little bit but don't break it. You have to be able
work fast because we’re so busy all the time [as well as] represent yourself in the branch [and] in
the community well. Those are some things that I look for. If I'm interviewing a person, I try to
see where they'd make a fit and how they’d make a fit, so a people-person is an important
characteristic. And it's important that people aren't in their silos; that's a big picture thing.
Where I am, we have different service points: we have a Reference desk, Adult References,
Children’s, Circulation desk and now a Teen desk. I'm pro-everybody-chips-in; it doesn't always
work but if there's a line, you help with the line or someone is struggling, help them whether it's
something you're working with or you walk past the copier and somebody's having problems.
[The staff] want you to be present; they want you to have the right answers; they want
you to have their back and their side. People are in other people's business, so to speak, so they
expect you to deal with other staff members so everything [is] fair. They look to you be fair,
nonjudgmental, and they expect [you] to keep an even temperament with them, not fly off the
handle or be too lax, [to be] somewhere the middle. I do have a reputation, I think, for being one
of the more relaxed branch managers with my staff. I can let people do their thing. If they’re
doing it wrong or if they're doing something that's not with the program, you have to tell them,
but I don't micromanage or breathe down people's necks.

219

[If there’s an issue,] usually the first thing I'll do is take them aside (I don't do it in front
of someone else) and mention something to them like “I noticed you weren’t really friendly with
that guy; what was the issue?” Or if I have a complaint from somebody, I’ll ask them to come
into the office and close the door and iron it out, find out what the details are. I try to have a
one-on-one with somebody as soon as it happens or as soon as I find out about it and then bring
it up to them and make sure that they understand how we do it, or don’t do it. But if someone is
behind the computer, isn't attentive to patrons, like their body language is hiding, I’ll go up to
them “I need you to have your head up, turn your chair…” [I] say something to them then. I’m
finding out it's more important to mention things and document things so they don’t snowball;
even the short conversations should be written down [and] documented because then if it
becomes a chronic thing, you have that to fall back on.
[For example,] we’re doing a shifting project [as part of] getting a new expanded teen
area in my branch and some of the people that I work with [weren’t initially] on board with it.
“Why are the teens getting this and why do we have to do this?” I had to explain that it's all for
the greater good. [When explaining to staff,] you don't want to say “well so-and-so said for me
to do this.” You have to take it on as it is yours because you have to get on board with the
decision; that's the way it is; that's your job. [So throughout this process,] we had to have
conversations. I called and talked to my supervisor about how this should be handled and she
[said] “this is how I would handle it and this is what I would say” and that's what I did. No one
wants to be the bad guy but once it's made, it's made. Even if it's not your decision, you're the
person that has to break the bad news or be the bearer of bad news [but] once that’s made, you
don't have a choice. It sucks sometimes to have to break bad news to people or discipline people
because you have a personal relationship with them, not so much a friendship, but you have a

220

good rapport and a good working relationship with them [and] you don't want to lose them as
your staff, but you still have to tell them that this is the way it is. Now I know you document
everything; [when you have to,] you keep it in a file; you talk to your supervisor about it; do the
whole process with HR.
[Looking back,] I probably would make the decision to try to come in and be a little more
firm. There [are] some things that I could've avoided personnel-wise that could have [gone]
differently had I established more of a firm hand when I came in. With staff at the two places,
you always have a couple of people that are more challenging than the next; I just could've been
a little more firm with some of the things that they were doing behaviorally. Because when
you're the new person, you know going in, especially if you're a new manager, the people are
going to be testing you a little bit and I was definitely tested by few people. In some cases, it got
better and in some cases, it kept going [and] it snowballed. [But one of the most difficult lessons
was] a few years back when I was new to East Liberty. I had not paid as much attention to the
part-time budget as I should’ve, so I got a call [about how much I had used]. [At] this branch, we
were open more hours [than at my previous one] and I handed out hours out willy-nilly; I was
like a drunken sailor. I felt really bad about [this mistake] because I knew I had let my manager
down; it's a behavior that I shouldn't have been doing and that really affected me because I had to
cut hours and take money out of people's pockets because of a mistake that I made. I had to cut
people's hours drastically; it was really hard and I had a lot of guilt from my mistake and people
had no choice; really good part-timers left or looked for jobs at other branches because they had
to pay the bills and it was really jarring. [Now,] I pay closer attention to what am spending and
make sure people's hours are within what they're supposed to be. That [happened] when I was
less than a year into this job and it affected the full-timers too; people had to work more

221

Saturdays and weekends. Part of the job is to work different hours but it was exacerbated by the
fact that I had misjudged the budget.

G.1.3 Learning

G.1.3.1 Peers, Managers, Models
My boss, my former boss, my predecessor, and several other managers all [have been] great
mentors to me. I frequently leaned on these people for advice and feedback. [I also] think of
how a supervisor [might have] handled these things in the past and consider the things he/she did
right and wrong. I [often] act upon instinct and experience when faced with situations [but I
also] solicit advice from trusted colleagues.

It’s helpful to have a different outlook and

perspective on things even if your colleague’s management style is different from your own.
I think that working in the Humanities Department reinforced a lot of these beliefs. [At
the time,] I was the youngest person on staff and had a lot of mentors. Many people showed me
the way. By observing them, I got the sense of what “getting to yes” meant. It just became
second nature through observing these long-term librarians that I basically idolized and seeing
what they did and asking for tips when I needed them. This is going to sound clichéd but it was
almost as if, for the 2.5 years that I worked in this department before it dissolved, I was part of a
larger family. From the top down, everyone had your back. I felt like we were doing grass roots
work there, like we were doing something different and special because we were such a good
team. I think that I am extremely lucky to have landed this job right after grad school. It shaped
my professional attitude in a positive way. Even almost 15 years later, when faced with a
dilemma or problem, I think of what my manager or coworkers then would have done to solve
the issue. [But], pretty much anybody I have worked with in any setting [brought something]
222

and I think you take a little bit from each person, the good stuff and then the stuff that you
change to mold into your own. Everybody has an opinion, they may say “well if I were the
manager…” but when you are the manager, you get to set the precedent; it is what you make of
it. So from way back, you gain respect for people, because everybody I started working with is
still pretty much around [so you] act as a sponge and remember them.
[Now] I’m [currently] mentoring somebody [so] that's another thing that's been refreshing
for me because I get to help somebody who's new on the job and see how they do things [and]
I’m learning from that as well. [There’s also] a former [branch] manager upstairs in the Office
[of] Programs and Partnerships; she managed a bigger branch so it's been nice having her
around. I can ask for her advice [since] she's right upstairs. It's been really good support;
everybody has been a really good support network. I don't think there's one manager that I
haven't learned something from or that I haven't asked for something. It's getting better and
better as we become comfortable with each other and I get more comfortable [as I] get to know
them better. When I started, about half the managers were different than they are now and half
of us have been on at least as long as I have (that’s just a ballpark). People would go to lunch
and talk but [but not like it is now]. It’s been a cultural change. Things are a lot more open now;
I don't know if it's the people that are being brought in, coupled with the Strategic Plan, coupled
with Sue [the Deputy Director who] encourages communication and openness and dialogue, but
people are getting it and it's really improved. You could always call somebody and ask what
they did but now you [can] really have a conversation with them. It is real change because you
had some of the “old guard“ that weren't as forthcoming with things or didn't really ask if you
needed help, no matter how long you've been on the job. [Now] people are getting it and

223

people's minds are changing that we should all help each other out. It’s pretty cool; you can
support each other and talk to each other and rely on each other.
Now we have manager committees that we’re all working on. There's five or six of us
split between two committees that I'm on and it's been really good because we can lean on one
another and ask questions and talk about things that have happened, and not [just] about the
committee [work]. You can share information which you don't get to do too often in meetings;
it's a formal/informal setting where you can talk to people who have more experience [and]
different experiences than you. I'm working on one that goes around to branches [where] we
look at the physical space and tape on the walls, at the carpet. We want things to look clean and
crisp. [We] look at displays, the public space, things that you don't notice when you're used to
seeing something every day. It [also] gives me a really good chance to see how things are done
in other places. We talk about our jobs [and] that’s been great. [Also] I have recently been
charged with leading several committees made up mainly of peers and supervisors with other
staff levels mixed in in order to achieve 1. A new procedure and 2. A system-wide programming
initiative. Although I have led committees in the past, this is my first time really being
responsible for, in case 1, something that will have ramifications in each of our libraries, and in
case 2, making sure colleagues participate in a program. I am not intimidated per se, but I often
feel that I need to be quicker on my feet, so to speak, in meetings and go forward with decisions,
validate points, strike down points that are redundant or not in tandem with the mission, and
generally go about things differently than I do in the branch, where I have more time to ponder
things and think out decisions rather than rapidly determine things.

G.2

PROFILE FOR HOLLY

G.2.1 Becoming a Manager

My first managerial job was in the Teen space at CLP-Main. This was not a planned step! I was
looking to leave my position at a large urban library. I was a Humanities Librarian, and a portion
of my position included teen collections. I was allowed to have one teen program per month. I
felt frustrated as a new librarian, as it was somewhat difficult to attempt new ideas there. I
applied for a Teen Senior Librarian position at CLP-Main, and throughout the interview process
I learned the position would become a manager. I stayed the course because the interview
process had me really interested in CLP. I had no idea what I was getting into!!! After only a
year in the field as a practitioner, at age 27, I flung myself to Pittsburgh and began my journey as
a manager.
It's actually been eight years since I started at CLP. I did not prepare well for managerial
work. I did prepare by learning all I could about Teen Services in public libraries. I remember
feeling overwhelmed a lot of the time in my first year at CLP and Teen’s was so specialized and
the system was so different then because there weren't as many teen specialists; there weren’t a
lot of people who knew about teens and how to serve them. The department was only two
people; I had to hire somebody, a third person, but there were only two people in my department
which was nice [as it’s] a manageable size to start out with. So officially for six months, I was
Senior Librarian and then they bumped me up to manager. Senior Librarian is a weird position;
it means different things in different departments, so essentially I was the manager when I
started. I learned a lot from the Teen Services Coordinator. She was a Library Assistant in the
Teen Department [before] starting her role as Teen Services Coordinator, so she knew the
225

department and she also knew Teen Services. Being so “what is going on” helped me a lot
because I was open to anything and I wasn't aware of any limitations in a lot of ways. I
remember my very first meeting with the two staff members, and we said “I hate fines…I do
too… let's do something about this,” so we started the Fine Alternative program which is still
going today, just out of this first meeting and riffing off of each other; that was really great.
I really did not enjoy managing at first [but] I grew into it. I was able to add new staff
members and, in some ways, I worked with my staff to build the department from the ground up.
Luckily, we all shared pretty much the same vision, as my management style was developing
[so] this really helped me ease into it. In my first couple of years, I took management/leadership
trainings and webinars [and] was assigned a mentor, [who] was head of a successful department
at Main. Through lunches and office visits, this person gave me advice. I still contact this
manager, though they’ve moved on to another position in another location, when I really need
advice. [However,] I stumbled a lot. It's so different [here] because everything in the last place I
worked was so regimented and so by the book because it was union and librarians were literally
not allowed to shelf books there. [Since] I managed the Teen collection, [when the shelver] was
on vacation for a few weeks and the books were just building up in the basement, I went and got
them and shelved them; about three different people told me that was the wrong decision and that
I shouldn't have, but the teens needed the books and nobody was going to shelve them until she
came back from vacation. But Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh is very different; it's more handson, not just because it's not union, [but] the culture is very different for a lot of reasons.
I've had the same boss [in my] two different managerial positions here and there was a
big change between my original position and the position that I have now, in that there were less
people [when] I managed the Teen Department.

226

Now, I manage the First Floor [popular

materials], so that's a huge difference; the scope of what we do is so different now; my job is
really different. Instead of serving an age group of 12 to 18 years, we serve pretty much
everyone, so then the scope just blows up. Getting a handle on that, [because] it feels like it
spins around me, [it’s] really changed how I look at management. Also, managing more people,
[many of] whom have been in the library for really long time is quite different. It was a very
new experience for me and it took me a while to get used to it. It doesn't mean that if you've
been there for a long time that you're necessarily jaded, but you know a lot more than I do about
the history of this library because you've experienced it, and that's very different than hearing
about it. So when you say as a manager “I'm going to try XYZ” to someone that's been there for
many years, they might say “oh, they tried that in ’96 and this is how went…” Learning how to
respond to those sorts of things has been a new challenge, but then also there are so many
benefits of managing people who’ve been around for a long time, who've worked out their
organizational skills and they know everyone and they have relationships around such a big
organization that sometimes that can work toward your department's advantage because they
know the organization so well.
I was surprised at how being a manager does not mean that people will listen to or agree
with you all the time! Even though I should have known – being someone with multiple
managers before starting this job. Very early in my managing career, I had an incident where I
asked a staff member to weed their collection many times, and I felt like they ignored me, so I
weeded it myself. This caused a conflict as they did not agree with my method. When
confronted, I had to leave the department to calm down. Later, the staff member finished the
weeding job. It all worked out in the end and I believe we built a better understanding out of this
conflict. The staff member asked me to supply deadlines with requests, and this was a really

227

reasonable suggestion that I incorporated. Another thing that surprised me was the pressure. Part
of my job was and is to take the slack whenever my department does something with which
upper management does not agree. At one point, we started a program that my boss did not agree
with. This did not go over so well, as I had not cleared the program with her first, which I should
have. This was something I’d never faced, but I believed in the program so much that I worked
with staff and we created a lit-review in its support! It caused a great deal of unnecessary stress.
Now, I am more used to this type of thing. I felt that vice-like pressure of middle management,
pressure from both sides, your bosses and those that you manage. [Ultimately,] part of it's not
really having [a complete] toolkit. I started managing really early in my career; I was only a
librarian for a year and there wasn't much to have conflict about in my first professional job,
things were just the way they were. [Now,] not having the tools and then not feeling confident…
if you're raised as a woman, you're more likely to want everyone to be happy all the time and not
make waves; that plays into it, not learning how to speak up for yourself.
[One thing I regret is] when I very first started as a manager, there were only two
employees that were full-time in my department and they said they wanted to know more about
me and I sent them an email with my life story, condensed into three paragraphs, and that was
like the silliest thing ever. I should've said “let's go out for dinner after work or let's go to lunch
or come over for breakfast…” anything but that. But I was like “oh, I have to think of something
right away and respond right away” and that was a really bad decision; I wish I could take that
back. I think that speaks to a bigger issue that I've grappled with as a manager. When I first
started as a manager, I felt very guarded about what people knew about my personal life and I
drew strict lines, like I didn't want to spend time with anybody from work outside of work, and
now it's not so much. I've loosened up over the years because you can't live your life like that;

228

it's just too hard. You can't be a generic manager person. I'm not really sure why I felt that way;
perhaps it's because the experiences that I've had with managers in the past; I didn't know that
much about them so maybe I subconsciously inferred in some way that you’re a private person if
you’re a manager. I also felt like maybe if people knew a lot, I was 27 when I started so I was
really young, they may not respect me as much. But over time, I realized it’s not a feasible way
to live your life. So just being open but then being a little cautious still about how close you get
to the people on your staff, I think is important; but spending time with people outside of work,
they get to know you better [and] you get to know them better. So I do that every once in a
while with people who are interested [because] I think it helps build camaraderie. And there are
some really cool, interesting people who work at the library, and it’s fun for me to get to know
them better.

G.2.2 Role as Manager

I would define leadership as the ability to co-create a big picture and help others to see the goals
within that big picture and move toward it, and I would say “co-create” instead of create on your
own. Within our library system, there are ways for people who are not managers to take
leadership roles and to be leaders. So I think within CLP, first of all being competent at your
work so then you get respect, for that for the work that you do, and at this point, moving towards
the Strategic Plan, showing that you understand, being aware of what's going on on the
systemwide level instead of being in your silo. It's getting away from the detail day-to-day work
and thinking more broadly about the impact that you want the library to have and the impact that
your community wants from you, and then translating that into your workflow.

229

[Mainly, I’m] turning in monthly reports, attending managers meetings, living up to the
new job description that we have. Part of the new library services job description world is doing
less desk service and less programming [as managers]. [I’m] also participating in any sort of
silo-breaking [and] Strategic Plan project that's happening, [participating] on SLACK [internal
communication tool, [the] PEFAs [Patron Experience Focus Area] and inform her [my
supervisor] about what we’re doing within those PEFAs. This year we've been checking in [with
our supervisor] quarterly to talk with her [about] what we're working on. She has a very serious
“no-surprises” rule, so I try to keep her abreast of anything that might ever surprise her, because
I have [accidentally] surprised her before. I’ll copy her on emails if somebody wants to do
something that I'm not sure is allowed, if we’re doing something big, if I'm proud of something
that one of my staff members did, or something that we did as a department. [From her, I
appreciate] recognition for my work and for the work of my department. Sometimes I just need
her to call someone and tell them to do something because they're not listening to me, like fix the
lights. So that enforcer role comes in really handy and she's always really good about that. [I
also want her to] convey information from her level of the organization down to us in a way that
we can understand and then share.

G.2.2.1 Attributes, Beliefs, Preferences
[Since] they rewrote all of the manager job descriptions at my level, I'm trying to adjust within
my position. But I'm also someone who really likes change, so for me, it's feeling frustration
with us not moving fast enough. I [do] understand that it's a huge organization and things aren’t
going to change overnight, so overall I really like the Strategic Plan and once we got all this
work done around it, I'm like “okay, let's do it, let's start right now,” but it's not the way the

230

world works. My job has changed because of the Strategic Plan and part of it is, even though I
say I like change, sometimes it’s uncomfortable for me to institute certain parts, like CLP as a
learning organization. I'm sending my staff out to other places to learn. Rather than sending
them to webinars about genealogy, they are shadowing the Pennsylvania Department librarians,
which makes me [think] “oh, I hate to lose that staff time” but I understand overall it's going to
benefit our patrons and the organization. So personally I struggle with little things like that, but
overall I’m accepting.
The knowledge, skills, and abilities needed [to do this job] include strong communication
skills, confidence, knowledge of the organization’s Strategic Plan and our place in it, as well as
patience and fortitude.

[A] strong personal belief in our organization’s mission [is also

important]. [Regarding] communication skills, there are so many other departments and people
that I have to work with to make my department run, so every day [I’m] learning other people's
communication and personality styles and working within that to try to move [everything]
forward. [Then having] emotional intelligence [and] using it to communicate and move dialog
and move projects forward is really important in my position. [There must be] that good balance
between what's above and what’s below you on the hierarchy, so understanding what is coming
down from administration, communicating that in a way that's going to keep everybody positive
and moving forward and not freaking out below me, and then taking what everyone is saying and
sending that back up the chain in a way that respects everybody's position and hopefully creates
understanding [and] creates resolution to problems.
[Emotional intelligence] comes into play in direct customer service [as well as] in
relationships among staff. It is everything from being able to read body language, which gives
you lots of clues into where people are emotionally, and then knowing how to navigate a

231

conversation with respect for emotions and with a clear goal in mind, but also having tact and
respect for everyone else involved. I think if you can manage your own emotions and also be
aware of other people's emotions, it's easier to move toward a goal together, rather than being so
focused on the thing that you don't care that someone's really upset about it or that emotions just
need to be managed as part of those steps. [You have to] allow people to have their emotions. In
the book Managing Transitions, they talk about when things change, allowing people to grieve;
so if you're someone who's “let's just do this thing,” it's not emotionally intelligent to yell that at
someone who is grieving the change.
[Coming into management] I think I would've tried to become more emotionally
intelligent. [I] also [would] have found some way to be more confident, because I think [it’s the]
one thing that I still struggle with now [and] was really evident when I first started managing. I
[had] moments when other staff members would completely run me over and I let it happen just
out of sheer lack of confidence but also a lack of knowledge of what was happening and how I
could assert myself in the situation.

I think [these] soft skills are where it's at because

technology is always changing, libraries are changing all of the time, but those sorts of skills are
[always needed]… being assertive, being confident, having good listening skills, patience. I
don’t know if you can teach that in library school [but] those sorts of things are really valuable in
a manager’s toolkit and they take time to develop.

G.2.2.2 Managing and Leading Change
We are thinking of ways to institute a new culture in which we look outward and connect with
the community via organizational partnerships and outreach. [So] the most important duty I
have right now is leading change. There are things that need to change in our location so that we

232

can better serve the public and help achieve Strategic Plan goals. We also have venues for
change on a systemwide level as well through the PEFAs. I am working with staff to identify
best practices for departmental workflow AND workload and then enact said processes.
Essentially, we need staff to cut back on all work (collections, programs, non-desk services) so
that we can offer better desk service and engage the community via outreach. Staff often looks at
their computer screens more than the space of the library and the people in it. In tandem with
above, we are working on best practices for excellent customer service. Because we are the place
most customers come first at Main, our department cannot wait for the systemwide standards to
be developed. We must venture out on our own and work to create meaningful interactions that
will generate delight in our customers. We are trying new desk service models and practicing
proactive rather than reactive service. It’s been up and down, two good months and then stats
drop off, so reinvigoration is needed. I am doing my best to work within PEFAs to lead change
and exemplify PEFA work to staff.
Improving service at the desk and finding ways to measure success is something I am still
working toward. Essentially, the goal posts for service have moved. Staff has been told for years
that they offer good service, and they do. The building has not been able to maintain an upward
trend in visits. We’re looking for ways to keep our customers and get new ones. Creating service
so good that it creates word-of-mouth marketing is our intent. This means that those staff
members that are more outgoing and extraverted are having a much easier time than those that fit
that librarian stereotype of “shy and quiet.” It’s hard when people have to go outside of their
comfort zone by initiating interactions, but it must be done. I am trying to gain proficiency and
help folks along by testing methods of patron engagement on my own and sharing out what
works; reading management books and professional literature; trying new initiatives like a staff

233

RA competitions with prizes for winning teams; creating a step-by-step guide and reviewing
with staff often.
I have had this job for two years and have a good handle on day-to-day workflow from a
big picture perspective. I have learned through the years to measure the changes to be sure they
are effective, and to always keep the goal in mind rather than get bogged down in minutia. I have
a knack for big picture thinking, and I try to pair staff that are strongly conscientious. For
example, as part of this larger process, we are going to try a new way of selecting fiction books
in which one person rather than eight review one particularly time-consuming professional tool
while selecting. I have worked to discuss this new process with every staff member concerned.
Some were elated to be rid of the task, others were not. For those that were not, I did my best to
share the context and reasons behind the decision. I also shared the ways in which collection
involvement will still be possible.
I've really been thinking about the silo stuff lately; it's just been in the front of my brain
because we’re doing it and it's uncomfortable, but it's wonderful at the same time, [especially] all
the ways that we’re working together in new teams and new groups and learning. [But the
pressure of middle management] still comes up every day, and I’ve talked with my Senior
Librarian in my department about this sometimes; she’s like “I can see it; I can see you stuck
between us and them, and you're in the middle…” I think having this outside entity, [of] the
Strategic Plan and all the work around it, has been really helpful to me to think about the
direction that we should go in, how the work that we do fits into it, and just moving toward it.
Because if you have that as an anchor, it becomes about community and it helps me remember
that, at the end of the day, it's not about me feeling pressured; it's about [whether] we are giving
the best service that we can to the community. I actually have a little post-it above my computer

234

that says “how can I solve this problem and do so in a way that benefits the community we
serve” and [helps me from] getting caught up in any personal relationship issues that I might
have, positively or negatively. At the end of the day, it's about the people who use the library
and the people in our community.

G.2.3 Challenges

G.2.3.1 Navigating the Organization
[One] thing I found [is] that people outside of my department have a lot more opinions about
what I should be doing, so just learning to go “okay, they're not saying I'm a bad manager;
they’re just suggesting something… that they have this idea, so take it at face value, work it in or
don't work it in, and then move on.” It's literally the front of the library and so it’s an important
department; it's where a lot of people who come in, that's their first experience with [the library],
so it means a lot to everyone, not just those of us who work there. [For example, in working to
figure that out,] there's an assistant building manager who's a colleague who manages a
department that's very similar in size to [mine, so I’m] learning how to navigate that relationship
and do so in a way that benefits my staff and the patrons.

[While the sizes are similar,] the

scope of our respective departments are different. I really feel [more of] a kinship with the
branches and what they do because what we do is more like a branch in a lot of ways and we’re
not “serious Researchers.” For example, we have swaps where my staff goes upstairs and his
staff comes downstairs, so how to get the best out of that swap is something that I've worked on,
and so I've had my staff training side-by-side with the upstairs staff while they're on our desks.
When I first started, I might've been afraid to suggest that because I thought that maybe [the
manager] would think that I thought that they didn’t know what they were doing, but I grew
235

more comfortable in my position and saw that [it] was a need, so we worked on that. [I’m really]
learning the official and unofficial ways in which everyone has power in my building and then
working within that structure. It's something I didn't pay attention to that much before because I
was in my little niche [of Teen Services and] that's all I had to worry about.
From what I've witnessed [with regard to the changes brought about by the Strategic
Plan], it seems like the branches are taking the reins and running with them. So through the
Strategic Plan, we’re talking about breaking down the silos, which is really fun to say but then
when you actually have to do it, it's difficult. That means not only sending my staff to train, it
means bringing new people into train on top of all the other work that you're doing. It means
giving yourself the time and giving your staff the time to work on collaborative projects that will
benefit the system as a whole instead of just your area. So it takes a new understanding to be
able to work towards that. [For example,] the head of branches is also the new head of Readers’
Services PEFA which is what my department is about. Our offices are like ten feet away so I
have developed a stronger relationship with her just since the PEFA started. I'm able to check in
with her and talk to her about her ideas and volunteer myself and my staff for things. I just want
to be on top of it and also have my staff play a strong role in what happens there. [But] it’s
double-sided; I want everybody to [participate and] learn and grow, but then I also want folks to
learn from [us on] the First Floor. I really trust where the PEFA is going because Mary has a
perfect vision [and] I really trust her leadership on this project. I haven't tried to [say] “why are
you doing it that way…” because I haven’t felt that way at all.
[When I am trying to influence decisions,] I [try to do it] with data, but it depends on
what the decision is [as] to how much weight I’ll have within the organization. I've done it the
wrong way; I've thrown temper tantrums in meetings; I've been that librarian and that manager,

236

[to say] “why are we doing this; why can't we do it this other way,” but after a while you learn
that doesn't work. So you try to control your emotions and use what you have. For example,
every year the part-time budget gets metered out and you get to submit your requests and you get
to submit data, so you look at how many questions were answered, how many items circulated,
how many programs did we do, and how much time does each task take. Working through all
that [data, I find] it’s calming; it keeps you from throwing temper tantrums because you have the
numbers and the information to back you up. Then [you] hope for the best and make your
request. [Now, coupled with that] anybody can do [or influence] anything; a Library Assistant
with a great idea can take it to the top and make it happen, which really makes it a wonderful
place to work. [It means] being more hands-on and learning how the library works from top to
bottom, and I did stumble a few times because of [the necessity to] understand who works in
which department, who is responsible for saying yes to whatever you're trying to do or who
needs to get this form that you have to fill out.

[And that’s changing too because] the

administrative structure is changing.

G.2.3.2 Supervising Staff
I have a Senior Librarian and then I have Librarians and Library Assistants [including both] fulltime and part-time librarians, so it varies a little amongst the staff; but overall, the Number 1
thing is offering the best possible service at the desk and I think we deliver on that the vast
majority of the time. Beyond that, readers’ advisory skills, collection maintenance, collection
service and program evaluation skills are important.

[There are] some things that are uneven

right now as far as where I would like us to go versus where we are now. Supervising is an
essential component of all these things. It means to directly understand what your staff does

237

[and] how they complete tasks so that you can hone the workflow of your department. You
should always keep the big picture in mind as you supervise and provide that context when you
are communicating. Supervising means coaching for success (cheering on good work and
improving further) and coaching for improvement (correcting inefficient or otherwise
detrimental behavior). [I have] lots and lots of check-in's with my staff. I meet every other
month with every staff member; there are lots of informal meetings and talking face-to-face. The
way that my department is structured, we’re not ever all there all at the same time. Tracking
people down can be a work in itself, but [I] take the time to check in with everyone on their
projects and talk them through it if they're hitting any road bumps.
[In general,] I think [staff] want to be represented well within the organization [when
I’m] dealing with other managers and administrators. I think they want their story to be told;
they also expect me to be there as an ear to bounce ideas off of, as someone to support them in
new and old projects and to give recognition for good work. It takes a while to learn the
personalities of everyone in your department, so learning that and learning to find a new way to
make decisions, to move the department forward when you never have 100% consensus. I've
joked, and I mean this fondly, that you couldn't get this group of 15 people, including me, to all
agree that the sky is blue. That's just not going to happen, our personalities are so different, so
making decisions that people don't agree with, and then moving forward was something I had to
learn how to do. I also had to learn how to let go, and if I want to delegate, I have to be okay
with people making decisions that I might not have made but really aren't going to burn the
library down or anything and will actually help that person and the department grow.
Sue, our Deputy Director, came to one of our staff meetings about six months [after] we
had started this new customer service initiative. She gave us this great pep talk and talked about

238

how she sees us, with the work that we've done, moving and being at the front of the curve of the
new service standards that were just rolled out this summer. And I feel that that's right where we
need to be because we’re the First Floor, so that was heartening for me and I think it reached a
lot of people on the staff. That being said, some people were “well, I'm just not good at it; I'm
not like you; I'm not like this other person on the staff who is good at it; I'm not an extrovert, I'm
an introvert.” We created a three-step program for the process of roaming so if people aren't
comfortable immediately starting conversation, they’re job is to start simply by nodding and
smiling and saying “hello, how are you.” So finding out where people are on that three-step
scale is kind of rough. I'm finding some people are just stuck on the first level, and it's been
seven or eight months since we started. [I’m] constantly checking with people to see where they
are on that level and trying to nudge them forward to be more brave [to] take the next step.
I'm working it out with different individuals. I haven't had anyone on my staff outright
tell me that they weren't going to do it. [But I’ve had] some say “I'm just not that good at RA
and I just don’t want to do this…” I recognized that we need to keep RA and growth of RA
skills on everyone’s minds, as there have been times when we have been so overwhelmed with
other things that we let it slip through the cracks. So it's all tangled together, the RA and the
customer service. [Relatedly,] we’re trying to change the service and started to look at what
collections are, trying to institute more outreach and cut back on programs, and that's a lot for my
department to handle. I [can] say “we’re going to do it” and then I sit in my office and type
reports all day, [but] people might not understand [or] if they have questions or complaints and
they want to work through them [but] I'm not there, then that's an issue. So talking through the
process a lot with people, especially people who have different styles than I do, it's really
important right now and will be for the next year or more.

239

[So] I am always learning about supervising!

My initial gut reaction was that

“supervising” is somehow less than managing, heading, facilitating, or the leadership of a staff. I
can mentally equate it with micromanaging at times. Because I meet with staff individually on a
bimonthly basis, I [felt] forced to observe and comment on their work, so that I [could] have
something to say in the meetings [and] earn my keep as a manager. [Now] because so much
change is happening, I'm trying to find ways to make myself more [available]. I don't want to be
a micromanager, but I really want to make sure that [the] change is happening and that people
understand it and that we’re moving in the direction that we need to move. Also, it’s my job to
help people grow in their positions and push themselves to improve and try new things. It can be
uncomfortable to address something as it occurs, if it is a corrective issue. I tell myself that I like
to sit on things to think them through before addressing them, but sometimes I am just truly too
chicken to address something in the moment, if it is something that needs to be corrected. I will
wait until I have the perfect words, but that has its drawbacks, as “striking while the iron is hot”
can be a better method. With this method, folks can learn as things happen, rather than in
retrospect.
It's a big department [and] there are big personalities in the department, so sometimes
there's friction. However, I did not address conflict very well. I’ve had staff who have been
initially angry or upset by some of the changes and expressed it in a way that I’ve had to address.
While these discussions have mainly been very positive, early on I would wait a few days and I
really did not sleep much [because] I was so scared to have the conversation! But I remember
reading somewhere that conflict can bring you closer to the person that you're in conflict with, so
that's also something that I try to keep in the back of my mind; it's going to improve the
relationship if we can work past it. If you just stay quiet, then resentment builds, tension builds,

240

and that's just silly, pointless, not helpful for anyone. [So] it's been in fits and starts, not a
straight shot, [but] realizing that if I don't manage this conflict, it's going to be to the detriment of
everyone involved and [I’ve] used that as an impetus to move toward resolution. At the end of
the day, with 14 staff members, I understand that not everyone will be totally on board with
every decision. The idea is, get as many people as possible on board, and then work on damage
control – i.e. communicate and offer agency when possible for the rest.
I [may not have] settled on how I feel about supervising; maybe that's my issue. I think
so much of my focus this year has been about trying to improve customer service and without
supervision, there are only so many ways that you can measure whether or not that plan is
working. So I see supervision as an important part of customer service and it’s something I took
for granted in my last position because everyone was just naturally good at it, by and large. It
has something to do with the way the space is built; it has something to do with the proximity of
the desk to the people who are using the space; it has something to do with the informality of the
people using this space (teens); lots of things come into play. So with my new position [in] my
second year, just being close to the action, to be able to get a feel for what the space is [and how
to supervise within it] - my desk used to be behind the customer services desk, so I was
supervising unofficially all the time anyway, and now my desk is yards and yards away.

G.2.4 Learning

G.2.4.1 Encountering and Solving Issues
I think you have to have some comfort and confidence before you can feel proficient, at least for
me. Then you have to have patience with yourself if you're starting as a new manager [as you]
learn everything that you need to know. You still have to complete your job whether or not
241

you're feeling comfortable or confident, so you should do things that will make yourself feel
comfortable and confident quickly. About four years into management, I had a staff member
who asked me to provide MORE constructive criticism. This person was so eager to learn; they
wanted it all. I was able to “practice” on this staff member to hone my skills, and then expand
out and improve the way I provided constructive criticism to other staff members.

[But]

coaching for improvement is still difficult sometimes, and this is a result of lack of confidence.
The best way to improve on this is to practice by doing! I think getting more settled into a
position, gaining experience over time, will help one gain confidence too. Also, having a clear
vision for your location is important. And finally, the more one does it, the more the manager
and the staff get used to the process. I remember when I started on the First Floor, I joked with
my boss, I said “I always thought that I was a collaborative decision-maker but maybe everyone
just always agreed with me…” I had to evolve because there was less agreement, but overall that
has made me a better manager. Because the whole library is changing because of the Strategic
Plan, I think that I'm still constantly evolving and evaluating my role as a manager and what
tools I can use, what tools I should use, and how to best support the staff that I have.

G.2.4.2 Models, Mentors, and Observations
When I first started in the Teen Department, my mentor [at the time was a] manager [who] is so
positive and so good at solving problems that her style inspires me too. She doesn't take things
personally.

[Being] a model of positive behavior was one good thing I got out of that

relationship, always taking everything that's thrown at you and working with it instead of
breaking down or trying to fight against it, and doing it in a positive way. Also talking with your
staff regularly, [being] encouraging, making sure that you give recognition for good work and do

242

it often was something else I learned. I witnessed something really small but really affected me.
[At an event we were working on together,] she forgot [some]thing [that] her boss called her out
on and she said “I'm going to fix this right away.” She went and fixed it and it was done; there
was no drama; she didn't get upset at herself or the situation; she just solved the problem. And
just watching that was inspiring to me.
I [also] recently, for the first time, joined the board of an organization that's a nonprofit
[that does] social services around Pittsburgh and their executive director is a really great leader.
Honestly, I've learned from her confidence and also from her ability to not put up with [things].
[When] she talks about [the] organization [or] staffing issues, [she demonstrates] recognizing
problems and then acting on them right away and talking about them openly and not in a
judgmental way. I really appreciate it and learn from that. Just being on that board has really
been an eye-opener for me in terms of leadership.

G.3

PROFILE FOR IAN

G.3.1 Becoming a Manager

I was almost opposed to management work when I was a student in the Information Sciences
program. I did take the required management courses and a lot of my focus was on public
librarianship [where] dealing with situations that would fall under the duties of the manager
came up frequently. With a background in youth services, I was particularly interested in how to
manage the day-to-day functioning of what was happening in a Children's Room. I began my
library career as a Children’s Librarian. I felt that direct service to children and families was my
243

strength, and if asked, would have said that I would never become a manager. My very first
manager in this library system said to me, maybe the first month or so that I was working in my
position for the library, “you know, I started this job because I wanted to be a librarian and I
wanted to help people and now I feel like I'm more of an office manager.” She was managing
budgets, doing statistics [and] she didn't have time to do any of the tasks that she associated with
being a professional librarian. At that point, I had come to work for the library because of the
strength of being able to connect to 2 to 4 year-olds, to engage and inspire them and develop
those relationships with them and I saw management as the antithesis of those relationships.
There was a distancing effect that the more you moved up within the bureaucracy, the more
management began to creep into your title and your job description, that you were getting further
away from what was the bedrock of library services — interacting with customers, connecting
people with books, reading stories to four-year-olds. So that's what I saw what was really
important and I didn't want to compromise what I considered, at that time, a talent. I really
enjoyed it and I didn't want to do anything that would compromise or take me away from that.
But then things changed [and] I moved around to a few different locations. What began
to happen was that there were certain parts of the job that I still loved and there were other parts
that I began to feel less enthusiastic about. Reality sets in [and] we all change and evolve. At
the same time that I was getting less interested in certain aspects of my job, I began to become
more interested in those areas that I once saw as taboo. As time progressed, I found myself
dealing with facilities and managerial issues at several library locations and came to enjoy it. My
understanding evolved and I felt that I could use my experience to help shape the organization
and contribute to service through affecting policies and procedures, as well as mentoring staff. It
was a gradual process for me and at every step it felt like it was a natural progression to the next

244

phase of my career. Maybe I'll be in this position for 30 or more years but maybe not. Maybe
there's something else; it's impossible to say that now; I'll only be able to look back on this
moment and see where it fits into the larger narrative.
I began to talk to my manager at the time about the prospect of applying for a manager
position. My manager was supportive and encouraged me. I asked about career paths [and] how
they had handled situations over the years and what they did to get ready. I then applied for my
first position. I was not offered the position, but afterwards had a conversation with the hiring
manager about things I could work on and think about to prepare myself. I applied myself to
thinking about those situations and past experiences being managed and continued to apply for
positions as they became available. It was interesting because that was my first new interview,
that initial manager interview. By that I mean [in] my previous interviews, I knew the deal [as] I
was interviewing for Children's Librarian [positions]. Any question that was thrown at me, I
knew how to handle it. I could talk in-depth and pepper answers with anecdotes and everything;
I was totally prepared. I considered myself a somewhat talented storyteller; you’d have to
demonstrate a program or something and I had that [as] added ammunition. But there were
questions that arose in the [manager] interview that I wasn't prepared for. There were certain
questions that I had thought about, something that was trying to tease out whatever qualities. But
then there were other questions that I was more blindsided by and I knew leaving the interview
that I hadn't really [answered them well]. I remember talking with the person who interviewed
me after the interview and she seemed to think that I did a better job than I had initially thought,
which was good. One [question] was how you would handle the most recalcitrant staff member
you've ever worked with and how would you motivate this person — things that had to do with
performance feedback and evaluations and going through a disciplinary procedure, which at that

245

point I had never experienced. I had done some evaluations but at that point, they had all been
positive and I had not had to deal with a long, drawn-out situation where there was one staff
member who was poisoning the atmosphere of the branch or making things difficult; I hadn't
thought of that.
Nothing [about becoming a manager] surprised me particularly. I became a manager in an
organization that I knew well, and I knew some of the staff that I was now responsible for
managing. A small surprise would be the amount of time spent dealing with managerial issues
and tasks. In my previous position, I was on the library floor all of the time, helping customers,
and being out in the community; whereas in the new managerial position, the work was, for the
most part, behind the scenes. You are no longer the person forming the major connections with
everyone that walks in the door; that is someone else’s job now. But I anticipated this change and
was ready for it. [Prior to becoming a manager,] particularly in my last position before I came to
where I currently work, there were a lot of facility issues. It was a larger library; it had a huge
auditorium; there were many meeting rooms [so I experienced] dealing with issues that came up
[around] scheduling groups, determining whether or not groups could be using the facility. I was
the person in charge whenever my then-manager wasn't there so I had to deal with things on the
spot. I also supervised the part-time Pages at that location and so I got to schedule interviews, do
the hiring, do the firing in some cases, so I did have some opportunity to do that work. I'm
happy with the way that things transpired. I didn't realize the whole time that I was on the course
to become a manager; it was just me following the path. I think that the most important thing is
that you just need experience, just dealing with day-to-day library situations and I had decent
amount of that under my belt. [I] spent a lot of time talking to all of my managers about how
they got to be where they were, how their career path started, what had they learned in their

246

experiences as a manager and just observing them. I feel like I was decently prepared. I have
known people that have come out of an MLIS program and have walked straight into a
management job but I never could have done that; my experiences were very important.

G.3.2 Role as Manager

My vision of leadership is leading by example, upholding the standards that you want those
following you or looking to you to hold as well. For me, leadership is relational in terms of how
you’re relating to your staff, interacting with them, getting information from them as well as
giving it. My main job duties are dealing with building and facilities issues, staff development,
coordinating all branch activities and services, acting in a systemwide role on committees and
work groups, and some direct service. The direct service is the duty I spend the least amount of
time on, and the systemwide role is taking on an increasingly larger part of my overall duties and
activities. [It’s] defined [as] middle management. I talk about the big picture; I talk about all
these philosophies; I also mop the floor and pick up trash when the custodian's not there. You
are dealing with the theoretical and the practical. I am trying to steer my staff or give them the
time, ability, prodding, whatever’s needed at the time for them to be able to move more into that
role as well.
[Regarding my supervisor,] we meet every four weeks, to talk about what's going on in
the building. I communicate with her and keep her apprised of what's going on within my
location. They’re [all] really responsive; if I ask for anything, they respond. There’s positive
feedback, as well as the reverse too; its balanced, supportive. [My supervisor expects] that I
keep her informed of what's going on. No secrets is one of those things — “don’t let me find out
from somebody else about what's happening,” that’s a big one.
247

[Also] that I stay informed, I

reach out to her when I need specific things, but she has also done a good job of creating
camaraderie among the people that are in parallel positions such as mine. So we have smaller
groups, both formal and informal, that we use for sharing information, assistance [and] advice
from actual to nuts and bolts staffing (“I need somebody to work for two hours, you’re right
down the road for me, can you send someone over…”) to any of the overarching roles or
situations that we come across. She cares what I think; I'm able to ask for help if I need help.
It's a balance [because] she has X number of direct reports. She doesn't need to know that
somebody's running a little late or somebody's sick; I don't need to let her know those microlevel things. So there's autonomy for me to do what I need to do to run the branch and it is
trusted that I'm doing that; but [there’s] also a support system, advice, that I can bring issues to
her so it's a good balance of involvement.

G.3.2.1 Creating a Management Style and Work Environment
A supervising or managerial style is crafted from disparate parts and experiences, lessons learned
from past positions. There are things that I’ve learned from every manager I’ve had, and also
people that I’ve worked with. Some of these are positive (as in “I definitely need to incorporate
that technique”) and others are negative, where I’ve learned more about what not to do.
Communication typically occurred when they weren’t happy with something I was doing, or felt
that I should be doing it differently. In my role as supervisor, I want to develop a more
collaborative, dialogue-based relationship with employees. Specifically, I talk with the staff
about programs, services and situations, and invite open (and I hope, real) discussion about
decisions. I’d like for those decisions to come about as part of a process as opposed to me
making and dictating them. For the most part I believe it has worked. If discussion and regular

248

dialogue is the basis for our work, staff feels that I value their ideas, notice what they are doing
and appreciate their contributions. The feedback I give is predominantly positive, and I try to
make negative feedback part of a dialogue, with a focus on improvement and moving forward
rather than dwelling on past shortcomings.
An example from literature, there is a book that I really like, the first Dune novel by
Frank Herbert. In it, one of the characters, the Duke, is talking with his son about leadership and
at one point he says something along the lines of “if you give orders on a particular subject
you're going to have to give those orders every single time that arises, whereas if you create a
staff, if you create a hierarchy where people feel empowered to make some of those decisions
themselves then you don't need to be directly involved in every single thing because you don't
need to be directly involved in every single thing.” It was something I read and it resonates. I
can see how certain elements of that have informed my own practice or philosophy about my
practice. You want to put people in a position where, ideally, they're able to determine what
needs to be vetted through you and what doesn't and they are able to discern that difference, and
that can take time and mistakes on both ends. Ideally, I do see myself much more of a facilitator
that necessarily has to see the big picture and see how everything fits together, but I don't want to
dictate. [Ultimately,] it’s about hiring; I think hiring the right people and creating the right team
and the right environment [is what makes it work].

G.3.2.2 Supervising to that End
Supervising staff to me means giving them the necessary skills, resources, encouragement and
prodding to deliver high quality services to library users. In short, I feel that my job is to enable
them to do their jobs. I see supervising as a form of leadership and relationship-building as

249

opposed to the managing of day-to-day activities. My aim it to foster an enthusiastic
environment where staff works together to improve library services and processes. Ideally, I’d be
the facilitator in this environment giving staff the tools to work with, connecting them with
appropriate systemwide and community resources and offering suggestions and advice for
particular issues that arise. In my view, you have to interact with your staff and listen to them
and create a climate where they feel that their ideas and opinions and work is valued and listened
to, that you're not just asking for input or asking for participation, just paying lip service to it,
[but] that it is genuine. I think that's the culture of the libraries as whole right now; it's one that
I've tried to replicate in my own building.
[In terms of] the new job description, from what I've seen living it over the last few
months, [it is] acting in the systemwide role, supervising and coaching staff. I'm still trying to
work it out in terms of time spent. In terms of importance, I think that it's fairly crucial for the
groundwork of everything that comes after, like giving people the tools and empowering them to
do their jobs. [There’s] less direct supervision and management of small processes; the idea is
that a lot of these processes will become self-sustaining and you as a manager have to jump in
when it breaks down or when something deviates a little more. I have to sign the time cards, I
have to make sure the building’s open, I have to make sure people are doing all of those things.
It is critical [because] someone’s got to be there. As somebody who worked in a library said, we
still open up the door every day and at the end of the day, that's the most important thing that we
do. [In general,] I hope [I] give them more tools, enable them to do their jobs better, that's my
vision. That's what I like to think that I'm doing. I think that people that have worked with me
so far expect that I'm there to fix things, I'm there to make it all fit together, I'm there so they can

250

say “hey, I wanted to do a this… this isn’t working,” and I'm there to figure out a way to get the
people involved in the conversation that need to be involved.
[In general,] I feel that I am somewhat proficient in coaching and developing staff. I
spent years in public service as a Children’s and Teen Librarian and have that experience to offer
to staff responsible in those areas. I am easy to talk to, approachable, and have done a good job
creating good will among the staff, and instilling in them the beliefs that (1) I am here to help
them do their jobs and that (2) I am always available and approachable. This approachability,
willingness to engage in dialogue and to coordinate and facilitate activities among different
people is something that I possessed previously to my [manager] position. That said, I feel that
there is room for improvement, and that staff training is becoming a larger and larger part of my
job. The library is changing the way employees are expected to make decisions, interact with the
public, and collaborate with other staff. While I am proficient in initiating dialogue about
changes [such as] getting people to talk about issues honestly [and] come up with solutions, I
feel that I need to work more on developing the structure of specific trainings and beef up my
training component in staff meetings. I like to talk and discuss things and tend to fall back on
that skill when others sometimes need to be deployed.
[We have] unscheduled informal meetings about things that are going on [as well as]
formal staff meetings where I gather input and get people talking about things. I want the staff to
feel that they are empowered to do what they need to do and if there's something that they want
to try, they’re able to try it.

[With regard to] my Children's and Teen professional and

paraprofessional, [I’m] talking with them about what's going on in their systemwide initiatives,
making sure that they have what they need to fulfill those duties and see how we can fit them in
with what we have and would like to have going on in our neighborhood branch [as well as]

251

making sure that they have the time to do what they need to do in terms of scheduling, time away
from the desk, and coverage. I have to balance it [because] I have to have the building open
every day and I have to have people every day who can lock and unlock the door. Somebody
needs to be there to help people, turn on the computer while also allowing people as much room
as they need to grow into these systemwide initiatives, committees.
We have an established appraisal process that contains standards that staff are expected to
live up to [and] expected to embody. We do appraisals yearly and talk with people about it, but
it is more of a year-long conversation. I've been there for a year and a half, so I have gone
through that process with just about half the staff that I have now [and] that's the starting point
for the conversation about what I expect them to do throughout the year. [However,] despite all
my efforts and vision to create a smoothly functioning, collaborative staff unit, problems do
arise, and there are occasionally employees who don’t pull their weight or take advantage of
what they see as weakness. Luckily, I haven’t dealt too much with these cases in my short
managerial career, but I realize that my desire to be liked and get along with people could be a
stumbling block. As a manager, sometimes you have to be the villain by making executive
decisions and also dispense disciplinary action. I know it’s a task that I am going to have
difficulty with and never completely relish. However, I will strive for open communication with
the goal that nothing should ever be a surprise if you engage in dialogue with enough frequency.
I just try to take advantage of teachable moments; if something comes up, like a reference
question or an interaction, I immediately afterwards, when applicable, [say] “I wanted to touch
base with you about that; here's why we did what we did; here are the sources that I used; this is
the reason for this particular search strategy…” I think my strategy has been encouragement
[and] positive feedback, using those as tools like the carrot instead of the whip. One thing I was

252

thinking of after the [diary] entry is I've been also trying to be more direct and honest in talking
with them and I'm gearing myself up for that. My hope is that if I've done my job in creating as
much of a positive, team-oriented, supportive environment, if there is something negative, that
exists not within a vacuum but within that overall environment that I've helped to grow within
the branch. [Mostly,] I nudge a little bit. I’m dealing with something like that right now.
Someone's not totally living up to what they should be doing and it's tricky; they're doing just
enough, not enough to require disciplinary action or a serious conversation, but doing just
enough to get by and sometimes more than that. I'm in the process of prodding and encouraging
them. I try to use positive reinforcement. [Recently,] I started having monthly conversations
with all the people who are responsible for the programming, so it's [also] trying to introduce a
peer element to it, where that person can say “oh, we’re sitting there in these meetings and other
people are coming up with all the stuff, I want to live up to that too.”
I think in some ways, I have lucked out; I've had people that have responded to my
expectations and style. I have [had] the two extremes over this past year, where on the one hand,
I have one person who [fit that style:] she wanted to come up with ideas; she wanted to run with
it; she would ask me for what she needed; I would make sure she was on track; we would have
discussions; she would bring ideas to the table and say “hey, how can we make something like
this work” and I would find a way to make it work. Then I also have another staff member who
maybe does need a little more time and conversation and I haven't totally solved that particular
situation yet. I think having situations, having an environment where people see their coworkers
coming up with things they see me supporting rather than shooting that down, they see I trust
them to do their job, I would hope that that environment makes people more willing too.

253

[But once in awhile you have to address that] somebody ain't doing their job! I’m
thinking [of] one instance where there are a certain set of behaviors that one staff member has
where they're not doing a certain aspect of their job or they're not giving that enough attention;
and instead, they're doing this other set of [library] tasks; they’re doing other library-related stuff
to avoid doing what they really should be focusing on. I need that to stop; it's a bigger thing as
I’m bringing other [new] staff in, you don't want to have a situation where one person isn't
pulling their weight or is shirking one set of duties — either that's okay for everybody or it's not
okay for everybody because they can't say “how come I'm putting all this effort into these and I
see this other person is not putting as much into this area as they could be.” At that point, [you
have to] sit down with the person and have a conversation: “here’s what I see going on; here’s
what I am reading of the situation; what do you see that's going on; is there something you're not
telling me; is there something that you need to do your work that you don't have access to for
whatever reason, like some resources or time or some other roadblock?” And then the other
conversation is “look, there are people that want your job; do you want your job; is this what you
want to do?” In terms of running the building, I need them to want to do what they need to do
and I need them to do it. But for their own development, I sympathize with that if it's not what
they want to do. Sometimes, you get in a rut or you hit a dead end and maybe it’s not for you
anymore, and it's okay to admit that. It's not the end of you or the end of the world. We’re not
saving or losing lives here in the library; we’re not surgeons. [So] if you have to [have that
conversation], you have to do that. That's part of the job, but it's not fun. I [did get] rid of
somebody over the summer and that was a good experience and I made it. We sat down and I
said “talk to me; what's going on; I want to help you; I want to know why this is happening.” I
still tried to employ open communication in how I talked to this person while also being firm. I

254

want to be liked [but] I realize intellectually that part of your job as the manager is to be the bad
guy sometimes [and] there are going to be times when you're going to be unpopular. That just
comes with the territory and you have to accept that. You're not everybody's friend; you're not
everybody's buddy; and if you are everybody's buddy, eventually you become everybody's
doormat and chaos ensues. I'm happy with the current configuration of staff that I have and I
think I am liked and appreciated [for] the way that I do certain things, but I also haven't been
taken advantage of.

G.3.3 Managing within a Changing Organization

I have been working in my current role for just a little over a year and a half and the expectations
of the position have changed for managers. We received a new job description several months
ago [and] the library is a year and a half or so into its current five year Strategic Plan. As part of
that Strategic Plan, there has been a tremendous influx of work to do that is for the Strategic Plan
[which] is being created from the bottom and middle up. There are many opportunities to act in
more of a systemwide role that exist for all staff, that all staff are able to opt in to the degree that
they feel comfortable [and] fits into their work schedules.

It is encouraged strongly [and

sometimes] required for people in my position. So when I first started, my duties we’re to
manage the facility [and] be the Adult Librarian in terms of programming and reference
responsibilities. Now the focus is shifting even more away from a public service role. I do
spend some time doing public service [but] it's much much less than what I first started.
[Instead,] I find myself really squirreled away in the back, in my office dealing with systemwide
committee work to improve library service or around specific initiatives that have come out of

255

work surrounding the Strategic Plan. It has actually changed a fair amount, just in about 18
months.
[This] big picture, the systemwide role that I'm expected to do be a part of in terms of
committee work, Patron Experience Focus Areas (PEFAs) and changing the nuts and bolts of
how we do Reader Services, Reference Services, programming, all of those changes that are
happening for the library organization as a whole, which affect the nuts and bolts of how we do
business. But [it] also [changes] the philosophy of how we interact with customers, how we see
those relationships, what the priorities and those individual cases are. Those are all being
informed or created on this larger, overarching level which is [happening in] discussions across
email and committee work and when the leadership team meets. That kind of big picture is
something that all staff has an opportunity to jump in and out of that conversation as their
schedule permits, but for somebody in my position, we’re expected now to be simultaneously at
both of these levels: one, at the local branch talking with person front of you, but also
participating in these more abstract, ideal relationships and philosophies that the library is
creating now. Right now in this organization, to be a leader, there's a lot of opportunity to take
something and run with it. The administration wants input from people in positions such as mine
as well as those above and below the division of labor, and really values their ideas and wants
them to be involved in making the library a better place and improving service to the public.
There's real opportunities to take something and run with it and develop it and have actual input.
Having been with the library for a while now, I know that right now, there is much more of a
climate of openness to new ideas, of wanting to hear input of staff. I'm sure that there's some
things that come up where not all ideas are fully baked or all good. That was not the case I think
when I first started working at the library. So had you been interviewing someone in my position

256

10 years ago or 15 years ago, the answers might be very different; [it] was a very different, from
what my sense of it was then. It was much more hierarchical and I was insulated by several
levels.

G.3.4 Learning and Experiences

I'm a storyteller and whenever I saw somebody tell a story, I'm listening to the story but I am
also thinking “I would've paused longer there; that's not the way I would've done it.” There are
certain things that I could take from that performance, something I might see that I liked and
others that you realize that you [would] have a different way of approaching the material. And I
think the same thing is true of being managed. There are things that I've picked up from all the
people who have managed me and some of those are things I would say “I like the way that soand-so did this,” and other times the reverse where there's not something you like or, because of
my position, I'm able to see the ramifications of their actions in a way that they're not because
they affected my peers or me. So I think all of those experiences have played a part. Also just
talking with managers, when I was started applying for jobs, I spent a lot of time talking [to
those] who were already in the role, that had been in the role. You just meld it altogether. And
some of it is temperament too; I've never been an authoritarian. I think that those kinds of things
[come] naturally, like dialogue, listening to people, and those things are just ways that I have
always been. Other people might have the opposite, they think they have to figure it out; they’re
really smart [and] they have all of this other information that's going to come into play in how
they're dealing with people - that's their frame of reference; that's how they view the world;
that's how they interact with other people.

257

I tend to overthink things, that’s a big problem of mine. When I was younger, I would
think about assignments more than doing them. I had to really understand everything, all the
different parts of what was going on, and my mother was like “you just got to do it.” Sometimes,
you just have to do things and plow ahead and you can't use analyzing, wanting to be
comfortable [doing something as an excuse]. I think that can be a hindrance to doing things.
Confidence and comfort is something that is produced by repeatedly coming through situations,
that doing something over and over, and acknowledging that I can do this and I know that I could
do this because I have done this Time A, Time B, Time C, Time D. However, if you can do
something, then you're proficient. That wanting to feel comfortable and confident can inhibit
you in doing things at certain times because you’re afraid of making a mistake, afraid you don't
know how to do it, or it's not something you like to do. To me, to be proficient at something
sounds like it's more polished, like the first time you're jumping through some process, it may
not all be perfect; you’re learning through it. It’s just time… whether you're baking a cake or
becoming a manager, you have to give it time.

G.4

PROFILE FOR JEN

G.4.1 Becoming a Manager

I was a career change. I worked in human resources and recruiting [where] I was laid off from
my company with a nice severance package. At that point, I was really looking to do something
different; I was not happy in business at all and that's when I went to library school (in 2006 or
2007). During library school, I worked as a part-time clerk at Main [and] then got a part-time
258

Library Assistant job at the North Side branch. The librarian there was one of my mentors early
on [and] she hired me as a full-time library assistant working in Children’s Services and I did
Children's Services for most of my career. I left there and went to Homewood [for] my first
librarian position [but] I was only there a very brief time as a Children's Librarian. My former
supervisor at Allegheny was promoted [and] her job became available. I was a librarian for six
months [before] I was able to apply and get the Senior Librarian job. It was a very rapid
promotion but it was because she had mentored me so well and I had all the experience to do the
job; I had all the neighborhood connections, the people knew me [and] I was gone to Homewood
for [only a] very brief time so I was able to move to that position really quickly. I held that
position for six or seven years before I became a manager.
I first became a library manager in 2012 and it was a planned step in my career. This
manager position was not at the library where I was working at the time and that was part of the
appeal [since] I had worked in the former community for [many] years and was excited to move
to another community. Working in youth services prior to transitioning into a managerial role,
[I] was actively involved in many projects that impacted all of youth services. This was a great
experience leading to becoming a manager because I understood how critical it was to be active
in outcomes you are passionate about or skilled in. Toward the end of my work as a Senior
Librarian, I was working very closely with the coordinator for youth services [and] she gave me
a lot of committee leadership roles. At one point, I got the Summer Reading budget and I was
responsible for where all of those funds went; I was doing all the purchasing and all the
distributing. So logistically, I think [it helps because] when you're responsible for a committee,
you have people reporting to you [so] you have to be organized for meetings, have an agenda and
be prepared to make that work move forward.

259

[It’s also helpful because you learn] how to navigate with other departments and also how
to navigate with managers. When I was a Children's Librarian, [I thought] my job was so
important that I would never compromise it, that if I was asked to be somewhere to read for a
school group, those kids needed me so much that I would go to the mat for why I needed to be
out of the building. I really believed in that wholeheartedly. I think that some of the things that I
put my manager through when I was working in youth services was a very big eye-opener and
prepared me as a manager to understand that other staff are going to have those same values and
they're bringing that to the table [so] I need to have those negotiation skills and help them
understand that it is an important priority and I believe it's an important priority but here's why
[something else] is also important. There were some times, looking back, that I should've
accepted [a] no [from] my manager; but I would, instead, go back and figure out how I could
make it a yes; whereas now, being in the other shoe, I definitely think sometimes no is just no.
I was very fortunate to have worked for two managers who were very open to making
sure that a lot was delegated [which made] me realize, when I became a manager, were really
great things. For example, my last manager would hand me the Children's budget and I was
responsible for managing those funds. I also was responsible for managing grants related to
Children’s Services when I was a Children's Librarian, and that was a really valuable experience
because some managers come in never having seen the budget and that to me is tragic. Because
that's not my strength, not having that skill-set from Day 1 would've really been a hard learning
curve. Also my first manager in the library would be definitely more the kind of person that
would say “give me your rationale for why you want to try this; if you have a programming idea,
think it through [and] tell me how you're going to do it…” and then afterwords, would talk with
me about what was successful and what wasn’t. That is something I try to pass to my staff,

260

“come up with an idea, give me the justification the reasoning, and then if it works or doesn't
work, we can talk over why.” That was really helpful because it makes you think about the
reasoning behind doing programming and preparing to do it well instead of “I have an idea;
Tuesday we’re making cupcakes!”
The first year has been kind of a blur and I really only feel like I am improving in the last
few months. My focus during the first year was on gaining experience dealing directly with staff
on a daily basis and handling all of the related issues with personnel. I also feel that the first year
was spent getting to know the community and the important partners in the area. That was the
most difficult learning curve and I feel like it took the most time. It is also a work in progress
because this community does not have the same level of consistent established partners as larger
areas of the city. [But] the most surprising issues were related to staff. I was surprised at how
many personal issues a manager is asked to address or assist with. I had some experience with
human resources in my previous career so I felt somewhat prepared to at least handle things in a
proper way legally, but the human side of management is very challenging. You are so many
more things than just running the building. I never worked with people who I felt needed work
in their area. Maybe it's because Children's Services is [focused on] always pleasing [the]
audience [so] it's really hard to be bad at working with kids, as long as you have the enthusiasm.
So [it is about] really motivating people, keeping them on task, dealing with all the personal
issues that come up [and] the things that people will share with you [while drawing] the lines of
professionalism. I do really feel that I was very fortunate that I had some business experience
because I could see that if I was straight out of library school that there would be some issues
with professionalism that I might not know and I would cross out of ignorance. [Another] big
learning curve is that my first six months was just making decision after decision after decision.

261

Then I realized where I could make one decision and make that decision forever and I could
delegate those decisions to other people with authority in the building.

All of that kind of

minutia are things that I worked out that first year. [With] the personnel things, I think that I'm
now in a place where I recognize my deficiencies and I'm trying to improve my deficiencies
whereas before I was just figuring it out.
[Regarding the community,] I came [to my current location] from the North Side where I
was for a really long time and I had partnerships with the same people over years and years and
they were almost unspoken. Every June, you're showing up and I don't even have to ask. Then I
moved into a neighborhood that I wasn't familiar with, where I had no connections, so I was
really starting from ground zero there. The previous manager typically leaves the list of people
[and] contacts, but some of that is based on relationships and personalities. So you have to get to
know people and let people get to know you before you can build that network; they don't just let
you in. I was not from there, I didn't live there, I didn't know anybody there, I didn't know the
streets; it was all learning that from scratch. I couldn't speak to them in the language that they
understood. So it was a lot of saying yes, being open and showing up at things even though they
had nothing to do with the library. It was just “this is my face and I want you to see it.” I still
think it's very hard; it's a much harder neighborhood because the network of community partners
is small and a lot of it is faith-based and insular so they're not as inclined to let a big organization
come in and be a part of things that they might be doing. [It’s] getting to know people personally
and having them help gain entry to the people that are there, to work with you, just building trust
and relationships, and relationships take time. A partnership is really a friendship that means
that you want to work together and you can't build a friendship just because you work for the

262

library, as much as sometimes that buys you some cred. It is ultimately [whether] this person
likes you and trusts you [to] follow through on things that you commit to.

G.4.2 Role as Manager

[My] most important [role] is our participation and impact on the overall structure of CLP and
the community engagement on behalf of the library and our neighborhood location. [The
manager] is, in many ways, the person people visualize when they think of the library and it is
important not to undervalue that trust and expectation. Also, as a manager, it is critical to be at
the table and actively involved in issues that impact the customers, staff [and] buildings. To me,
it means that, although we're in our buildings and we’re dealing with all the things that that
entails everyday, we also need to be involved in the system overall and communicating what
we're learning with our employees, communicating what our employees are teaching us back up
to the administrative level, and then also coordinating when we can. What I mean by that is, if
it's one person doing a finance program [at a branch] and one person doing a finance program [at
another branch], previously it would've always been two finance programs and no one would
know. Now we need to be responsible for making sure that we're on top of our game, knowing
what's going on in other parts of the library so that we can make those efforts larger and better.
Quite honestly, it makes us look foolish the way that we had been doing it because people come
in and say “hey, what time is that house-buying program at Carrick?” [and our response was]
“there is a house-buying program at Carrick?” That's not an acceptable way to work, so I think
that it's about everybody knowing as much as they can about what everyone else is doing, but
still providing the best service you can to the people that are in front of you.

263

We have one direct supervisor and she manages all of the [branch] managers and is
available to us anytime as a resource. We have manager meetings regularly twice a month where
we all sit around a table and talk about our issues. She created a SLACK channel [just for
managers which] has been really interesting because it's nice to see that other people are dealing
with all of the same things that you feel like only happen in your neighborhood. I [also] think
that she is one of the best managers at [knowing when to get] consensus versus making [the]
decision, so if you really want to give input, the one-on-one sessions are great time to do that.
And if you need someone to back you up on a decision, she will look at it fairly and say “here's
why you're going to do it in a different way” and explain it or “I support you,” and you know that
after the fact, you will be supported. And she's the boss, too. She takes care of us, she listens to
our gripes, she make sure that we have all the information that we need, she makes sure that we
have all the money that we need. She’s really the mama hen of all of these chickadees.
I think she expects us to be able to be “the buck stops here” so that every time there's a
clogged toilet or something like that she is not receiving those phone calls, because if you don't
have somebody competent in that position, that's what happens; they go beyond you directly to
her. I think that she definitely expects to be informed so that if there's a major issue in the
community or that a customer is going to complain to her or beyond her to the Director's office,
she wants to have that communicated to her so that she can expect it. Anything with employee
issues, certainly she would expect us to be able to manage those to the end of the line, but
whenever you get HR involved, you touch base with her on it. She expects you to ask questions
when you don't know something and admit that you don't know something too, [as well as] be
willing to learn. The first year as a manager, she's the go-to person [so she is] definitely listening
and answering questions. We do have mentors but ultimately she's the judgment-maker so you

264

have a lot of questions for her. To be fair, I think that when you're dealing with a whole group of
people with differing opinions, it's easy to say “well you're the easiest person to get along with,
so I’m going to do this” and she does not do that. She’s very fair; you never feel like you got the
short end of the stick. I don't mind being told no and if it's just a “no” for no reason, I’ll take it
but I love a “no” with a reason and then I can get on board with that. Typically [she gives] it
with explanation rather than without. [I also want her] to communicate what she's learning in
senior staff and the things that we need to be in the loop on.
[The senior staff] doesn't come off as authoritative, meaning that you can talk to them
about issues and problems and things that might be sensitive, but you have a level of trust and
understand as long as it's for the common good [and] it's not about you personally complaining.
I like to think that [with] the people [who] manage me, we do have a level of trust where I feel
like I can say “I see this thing going on over here, should this be something you should be
involved in?” I see the organization moving into a team mentality, but we were very much an
institutional library where [everyone had their specific job] and we're just not that organization
anymore. So making a team environment and letting everyone understand that, although we
have assigned roles, you need to be willing to do whatever in that moment needs to be done to
create the best customer experience. And [it’s] also modeling that [so] you have to be the first
person to plunge the toilet when no one else is there, if you expect your staff to follow suit.
[As part of that change] if you want to get your way, you need to be prepared to present
[your idea] with the highest value and backed up with the facts. You don't just get things by
asking for them; you get things by asking for them in a prepared way, getting consensus from the
people on your level first. [It’s] particularly true with programming. I’ve seen Sue [the Deputy
Director] in particular push these things back when they're being discussed at large-scale

265

manager meetings: “that's a great idea but it's just an idea; I need meat if you really want me to
think about this idea; otherwise, it’s off the table,” or if it's a super great idea, “we’ll talk about it
later, once we've had time to think it over.” I think that's the same expectation of us; you need to
be able to have consensus from your staff, know how you're going to do it, know how your going
to support it and do the legwork to get people there. You have to have all that in place especially
if you expect to have money to do it. And that's another shift [where] financial resources are
going more to people that are willing to step up and go through that process for programming.
So [you have to be] understanding and [willing to] work that way, accepting that is now the
process. Because a lot of these shifts were happening right when I became a manager, I was
never behind the curve; I was like “okay, we got to start doing this now so that when they ask for
it, we’re already doing it.” Our managers, our administrators expect you to have a more meat
when you're coming to the table; they’re making you use your brain, not just your ideas.
[As I just mentioned, consensus is] critically important, which is also the lesson that I
learned [related to] personnel. What happens if you don't have real consensus is later on you
find out that someone was unhappy and didn't really want to go along with the plan to begin with
and they're just doing it because they don't want the conflict or they don't want to deal with it.
So particularly when it comes to anything public, like we’re going to do [an] event or provide [a]
service, you need to have consensus so everyone's going in supporting it and excited about it. I
think the way I went about that in the beginning is much different now. It comes back to [my]
personnel growth because I think for me, one of my faults is that I'm very Type A; I'm not
perfect, I know that, but I can't not do things, so it's hard for me to wait around for that
consensus, [but] sometimes people need more time to get there. So in the beginning, for
example, I would say “we’re going to do this community event; are you willing to do it; yes,

266

okay, good; you can do it and here's what we’ll do and it will be great…” and to me that was
consensus, but it's not. It was more me being “okay, I checked this thing off the list; it’s so great,
we’re going to be there and we’re going to have a great time” and I didn't acknowledge where
the other folks were coming from. I think that is probably my most successful area of growth
because now I really do feel like I take a breath and I repeat back to people what they're saying to
me, and I haven’t started making a decision in that moment. [Now] when we’re having the
discussion, I’ll say “okay, let's all step back and we’ll come back together Monday to confirm
that we’re all on the same page” because I noticed that not everybody can make a decision when
they're asked the question immediately. Instead of deciding for them, I'm deciding to be patient
and that has been one of the best things that has helped the staff because I do think that other
people who weren’t bringing ideas to the table are now willing to bring those ideas to the table
because they’re being given the time to compose their thoughts.

G.4.2.1 Challenges of Supervision
Supervising staff is essentially providing all the structure and support for them to perform their
duties successfully. I think that as a supervisor you spend more time serving the needs of staff,
making sure they understand the expectations. It is also having tough conversations when
necessary. [Because] the staff is the library, I think that it's probably one of the most important
jobs [as manager]. It's the most difficult certainly because [you have] all of those [requests
regarding a staff member’s life circumstances] that you want to accommodate, but you also have
to balance [it against] the rules and run the library [as] a proper business where you're not letting
people abuse the situation. It's a big nest of moving parts that you're constantly having to keep
an eye on. It's probably the thing I worry about the most. To provide the best service for the

267

community, some people get it and some people don’t, and we're moving to a model where it's
more like you have to know that's the best thing for the community and justify it and do your due
diligence. That is something that is a struggle, that we need to coax people along that path
without squashing the creativity because with librarians, if it's not “Yay!” then sometimes people
just shut down on you [and] then you end up with an even worse situation where people aren’t
really willing to do anything.
[In general, the staff] expect the buck to stop with me. I try to make them feel protected
in that, if something happens in the library, I will be sure that it's viewed fairly. For example, if
there's a really unruly customer and later on the customer says XYZ happened, we’re going to be
on the same team in terms of making sure that everybody’s story is heard and that they're not
going to be in trouble for enforcing a rule, so backing them up certainly. You have to look at the
situation fairly and not make the employees feel circumvented but make the best outcome for the
customer involved. They have a lot of questions so they expect me to know a lot. [Often it
involves] immediate needs where they'll have a question and my knowledge or experience will
be able to answer it just-in-time. [Finally,] they really expect you to be understanding and help
them achieve a work balance with what's going on in their lives, that kind of sensitivity where
you really know the people that you work with really well… sometimes better than you know
your friends or your family, and so they look to you for guidance and support a lot.
I do try to model the behavior that I want to see in my staff, so no matter what kind of
day I'm having, I'm always pleasant at the desk. I feel like I always try to go beyond, even when
I feel like the service is done, to take an extra step because I expect that of them. I think that
trying to be open to feedback, like if something isn't working — for example, where you have
the library card applications is making it too long of a process or an extra long process to get a

268

library card done, so listening to those small details that the front desk staff who do library cards
all the time know but you might not know because you're not there enough. So letting everyone
have a voice in streamlining the process, but also being decisive. I think there are moments like
when there's a security risk where you really need to create safety among your staff [and] you
have to be willing to be the authority or the bad guy. I think all of those traits [are important].
I’ve tried to implement this mantra, which is, “whatever is the best for the people in the
community” and I do it for myself, too, because sometimes you get mired down in the rules.
Whenever we have meetings and talk about these things, I say “think in your head what is the
best for people in the community that we serve and if you're answering that question well, you
know you're doing a good job.” And it's working when people really apply it and other times not
[as well]. We do try to be friendly and do a good job. Staff is having trouble just letting go of
the stuff and being okay with making it happen. It's just that letting go of the ownership and the
rules [and using] judgment. One of my biggest problems with staff overall is that we generally
serve low-income African-American families or new American populations. Sometimes there is
an ingrained lack of cultural competency when you grow up with all white people and your
family is white and your parents are professors and all of those stereotypes that come into
librarianship, to think just because this person smells like cigarettes and just because this person
doesn't speak perfect English, it doesn't mean that they don't deserve help looking for a job too;
they’re just different than you; they're not less. I think that that is probably the biggest area to
work on.
[In terms of evaluating staff,] we have a plan in place where you go through and create
goals with someone at the beginning of the year [and then] go back and refer to those goals [to]
see if they're being met. [Relatedly,] you need to be sure that, as the standards change, people

269

are aware of them [because] you can't blame someone for not doing something that they were
never told they were supposed to be doing in the first place. Because we’re developing all new
standards and changing, you have to make sure that everyone is clear on what is expected and
that those behaviors that are to the contrary are not intentional. So I try to be sure that people are
communicated to in a positive way whenever possible, like “you know, you really should have
been doing it this way; here's why; next time let's try to do better” instead of “you messed up and
here's why and you're in trouble.” [It’s also] important to be consistent, so if you warn one
person, you can't let another person slide because you know that they have a baby at home [for
example]. What I typically do is [have] a conversation about it; and then if it doesn't change, it
would be a sit-down consultation [trying to figure out] what is causing this problem. Then after
that, it would be a written oral warning. I have been a manager for two years and I have not had
to give a written warning; I haven't had to go up to that level but I do foresee that coming [at
some point]. I always felt very empathetic and sad when I had to [correct someone, but] since
I've gotten some managerial experience, I really don't anymore and I really feel that it's more
because [they’ve] been given [every] opportunity [to correct it] and [there come’s a] point there's
nothing more I can do. I don't know [whether] to be happy about it or sad about it, if that's a
natural transition.

I [do] think that having those steps beforehand [to] give people the

opportunity to improve helps because most of the time they do.
I had an experience as a new manager with two staff members in conflict. Investigating
the situation led me to the realization that there might be a misinterpretation of behavior along
side poor communication between the two. Even after addressing these kinds of issues, they can
still happen, so sitting down once and talking isn’t always the magic solution. It comes up again
because there are often deeper feelings at play and progress can be made when we can find those

270

deeper issues beyond the current disagreement. There can be multiple deeper reasons such as
generational issues, lack of respect or a misunderstanding around what someone says.
I have realized my own actions and work style can play a role as well; whereas I’m a
tackler where it's like “we can to do this; yes, let's do it,” others are more processors who have
to think and digest. I can become frustrated because it can feel like we’re having the same
conversation over and over and over again, so I have chewed issues for days and days until I
realized that most staff just want someone to listen and say “I understand what you're saying and
I'm sorry that you had that experience” instead of being in a defensive mode.
I don't like things to be in a state of dysfunction. I've had jobs where I'd been very
unhappy and I hate to see that in an employee because they're not doing anything well, and
neither am I. When I'm thinking about it on the treadmill after work, I'm not enjoying my time
out of the library because I'm worried about the next day and what the next day is going to bring.
You very rarely get fired here, I mean you really have to do something bad, so we’re stuck
together. If we’re going to be stuck together, we don't want to have dysfunctional relationships.
These types of situations are about interpersonal communication and how people are perceiving
things. So we can have very frank conversations, hash things out and everyone involved feels
respected and that’s when we can move to more solid resolutions.

Ultimately, going through

these situations have been a good thing because it brought me to a place where I can understand
and acknowledge my role.
I [didn’t] fully understand how much time and energy is required in the people piece of
managing. I always assumed that people mostly managed themselves, so I would've liked to
have prepared more in researching interpersonal communication, personal dynamics in small
workspaces, how to win friends and influence people, all of those kinds of skills that I felt were

271

natural things that you had the ability to communicate with your staff [as their] leader. But it is a
refined skill and I do think that that's been where I've had to focus most of my energy and
learning is on managing people well, communicating well, giving them the skills to
communicate well; that's the biggest part of the job. I [do] feel that I have gained people
management skills. I feel more comfortable dealing with stressful situations and am more
confident providing correction. I recently performed a review of a new hire and was able to
explain areas that I felt needed work and was prepared with the tools for making those
improvements. I have learned that thinking through these deliveries assists with feeling prepared
and confident in your conversations.

G.4.3 Changes in the Organization

I [have been] through two Strategic Planning processes and by comparison, this one was a
completely different. The last time a Strategic Plan was delivered, there were people selected to
be on the groups but no one really knew who they were or what they were doing. They had a
few meetings and then a document was delivered and no one was invested in that. Most people
didn't really even care or feel that a Strategic Plan was relevant before this go-round because it
wasn't something that they were ever involved in; it was more like the Ten Commandments
being dropped in your lap and [you’re expected to] follow suit. This time, you have no ability to
argue because you’ve been able to argue all along; you have no right to say “that's a bad idea”
because every staff has had some point in time where they have connected or been directly
involved in the process of developing a Strategic Plan and now, beyond that, the PEFAs [Patron
Experience Focus Areas]. I was involved in the Programs and Partnerships committee and you
can see the outcomes of that now with [new positions and people] hired. You can really see
272

where the idea started and where it's grown and [that] everyone has had a role and we own it.
The administrators don't really own it; we own it and now that they're turning to us and saying
“okay implement it,” you don't have a choice. You were recruited on the team hard-core.
[Part of the difference is because] traditionally there has not really been a relationship
[between the administrators and the managers]. The Director was [a] kind of figurehead and
then the other senior staff had their roles and you had your senior staff person that you worked
however many layers under and that's how it was. But that definitely has changed. With Mary
Frances [the Director] being a librarian [the two previous directors were from outside the library
field], she gets it more than other directors have. She’s not a figurehead; she is a senior library
director with experience and she really understands the staff-end of things more than anybody
really has. Sue [the Deputy Director] is wonderful too. She is always willing to have a great
conversation about something. You won't even realize it at the time, but later on you'll hear it
come up in another discussion [and] you’re thinking “boy, she really listened to me, thought
about that idea and what she could do with it” and then brought it to a level where it could be
discussed beyond just what you [thought was an] opportunity to chat with her walking down the
hallway. Now, it is realistic to believe that when something is happening down here, it can
easily make its way up to the higher level of management and they will be thoughtful about that
information and what to do with it and implement it into our practices more than it was before,
definitely more over the past few years.
[At my level,] we have always collaborated as managers, but more informally. Now
we're moving toward a more formal collaboration [where] you’ll see more managers at meetings
when there’s systemwide initiatives going on that are relevant to [specific] locations, [so] we’re a
little bit more in the loop about those kinds of things. I [also] think we're trying to begin to cross

273

boundaries more, so if there's another location that is nearby regionally, we are trying to either
do direct collaboration as managers or encourage our staff to do that. [However,] I think the
most major change is about pushing up ideas. It seems the ears are always open and it's not that
the ideas weren't being listened to before, but it seems that there is more action based on those
ideas. So if all the managers said “we need to start waiving fines for 13-year-olds,” then within a
certain amount of time, it's likely that that will go through senior staff and bounce back down in
a really reasonable amount of time. It doesn't just disappear into the abyss. I think the only thing
I would say is that over the past 6 to 8 months, we are not getting up to speed as fast as we want;
[but] in other ways, it's extremely exciting because we’re making all of this progress and it's
really fun. So you're really feeling that pain of change; it's not just all roses and sunshine, but it's
such a good thing. I would like to see all staff understand how great we’re going to be and how
much happier we’re going to be [but] I think that not everyone is there yet. We will get there;
we’re just not there yet.

G.4.4 Learning

It's been over ten years since I was in library school so I will assume things have changed. I feel
that my education gave me the skills to be a librarian but not really the skills to work in a library.
What I mean by that is the programming piece I learned on the job, managing budgets I learned
almost all that on the job, all of the refined skills that I use daily I learned through mentors or
because I've been in the system. I don't think [there] was something that I could say “in this
class we talked about this” and I've used it in the job. [Instead] I learned about databases [and]
that kind of stuff. Certainly the background of being a good librarian and knowing the resources,
knowing how to answer people's questions in detail, knowing how to develop partnerships, going
274

out into the community [and] making those connections with other service professionals or
service organizations are some things that I learned in library school. The managerial stuff was
more on the job. [But] if you want to grow beyond a [basic] library professional, which means
that you are the person at the desk answering questions, you really need to have almost a
business background too, because running a library is very much like running a Target or a Pizza
Hut. I mean, that's a lot of what managing of branches is and I think that in library school, it's
more romanticized as this academic life that you're going to have where you're going to be
touching the books and helping people learn. Once you become a manager, your job is really to
facilitate that so your staff can provide that to people; you're not really the one that is doing the
romantic piece of librarianship any longer. I think that it would be important to teach people that
they need to have a level of professionalism [and] business acumen if you're going to ultimately
be in a managerial position.

G.4.4.1 Peers, Mentors, Managers, Models
The best supervisors I have had took an interest in my future goals and provided me
opportunities to build the skills necessary to move into that role. My [supervisor and] mentor at
Allegheny taught me all of the ins and outs of this library system. She shared all of the youth
services connections with me. She's never one to hold anything like “this is my contact;” it was
always “these are our contacts,” so I was able to really almost cut through three or four years of
work experience because of [her] willingness to share and the risks that she took with developing
me that way. [Moreover,] she is an incredibly good manager. She will get you on her team
without you ever really understanding how it happened and she will give you the opportunity to
try things and fail without feeling any kind of fear of consequences. She also always made sure

275

that I felt acknowledged, so if something was my idea and she had a chance to credit me, she
always did. She was really my first mentor in the library and she's still here and doing a great
job.
When I was hired as a Senior Librarian, I eventually started working with the new
manager who was from outside the library system and he has a particularly good skill at
delegating, so he handed off a lot more responsibilities. [Although] I would supervise a person, I
wasn't the one responsible for their evaluation, [but] he [said] “you’re doing the evaluation.”
Also, [I took] more ownership of the building if he wasn't there; [I] was second-in-command.
[Ultimately,] he mentored me to become a manager because I got those background skills that I
didn't know at all as a Children's [Librarian]. [As] a manager, he is charismatic and fun, and
doesn’t take [things too] seriously, never making you feel like it's the end of the world. I [also]
think that his ability to let things go is really important because once that interaction is resolved,
you need to let it go; once that discussion with your employee happens and you agree to things,
you have to let everything before that go. His capacity to do that is definitely something that I
always respected being managed by him. If it was a disagreement, once the disagreement was
over, it was back to normal and there was never ever any ill-will harbored.
[Finally,] the best leaders that I see in this organization are people who know when to ask
for consensus [but] also know when to be decisive, and I feel like that really helps facilitate
progress. [You have to be] prepared to say “this isn’t something that we need to discuss forever
and ever amen; this will be the decision” and [then] we’ll all get on the team. But when there's
an opportunity or it's important to get the voices, you allow those voices to be heard. So that to
me is what I think is a great leader within the organization; I see several of the senior staff do it
all the time. It's almost like predetermined consensus or led discussion with a goal in mind.

276

G.4.4.2 Self-Awareness and Reflection
I was participating in this leadership program [on the South Side of Pittsburgh] and they did a
personality assessment, [meant to] point out your strengths and areas that you might need to
work on. [Through that] and doing [some] self-reflection is where I [began to] think [about]
trying to train my brain to zip my lip and thoughtfully listen, because it is a skill that you can
build. You can tell that I'm a talker, so I don't keep my opinions to myself and sometimes I
really try and I'm not able to. I will always provide input if I'm given the opportunity to do it;
I'm not going to sit quietly by. I do feel like I know my community and my customers really
well; I will do that legwork to make sure that when I'm in that room and speaking on behalf of
my staff or on behalf of the customers that I really believe I'm bringing the truth to that table and
not just my opinion. That is where I feel most empowered; it's my job to bring the information
because they're not in the branch everyday, and so it would be a disservice to not speak up. [In
finding the balance between talking and listening,] I think I'm improving, but I am not where I
would want to be. The reason I say improving is because I have elected to not say some things
and I've taken the time to think about [whether my] statement going to really add to the
conversation. Sometimes it's okay to just hear what other people say and not say anything when
it's just an idea, because when it becomes a policy or a rule, that's when you should be voicing it.
I don't have to be voicing every single opinion I have. [But] that's really hard for me; it's like the
one thing that I wish I could change. Besides the fact that I like cake, I want to be a better
listener and to be very thoughtful when I express myself instead of being reactive.
[Relatedly, when you] have [a] conversation [and] you think you're right, [but then you
find out] you’re not always. You're the one that has to own that mistake, just like you're

277

expecting the other person to do. One of the great lessons that I learned in library school and
[use] working at the library, [as] Dr. Biagini used to say, is “completion, not perfection.” That
mantra still goes through my brain because I think we have a task to do here; we all have to make
sure that it gets done. Sometimes mistakes will be made; you have to own that and be the
accountable person; but later on when you are prepared and you have the lessons learned, then
you can go back and visit [it] in a meaningful way and [try to] make sure that it doesn't happen
again. [The] decisions [we] make as managers are very situational. In terms of running a
location or department, you do have to be able to be decisive and [then] reflect on it later,
because you might not always have the chance to reflect in the moment. I always say to my staff
“we are works in progress; we are not fully cooked; we have to be willing to accept that
something is not always the same every single day, including me; I might tell you that this is
how it was decided and then tomorrow I’ll you it was decided another way, because that's how
works.”
Thoughtful reflection is where it helps as a manager. It's very easy to make a decision,
check that off your list and move on and never think of it again. Sometimes, we are so reactive
[because of] how we [have to] work. What I’ve [come to] realize is [that] to improve as a
manager, you have to go back and think why later on: [why] wasn't [that] the best decision and
what is my piece in that; I didn't think enough ahead of time; I didn't ask this resource to help
me; I didn't do the things I could've done, I didn’t really take the time to understand the full
picture and [whether] I made this decision based on having as much good information in [a]
reasonable [amount of] time. I like to think that it's for good [that] I’m reflecting on things, not
to punish myself for what I did wrong but to learn about how to do a better, but it's both. There
have certainly [been times], especially with this personnel stuff, [when] it made me sad thinking

278

about it; it really ruined days of my life because I couldn't let it go. I felt horrible and sad, like I
was a failure; and then there was the part where I was reflecting on it and thinking it's not me, it's
them and they're making me feel this way; there’s the blame shifting, [until] you come to a place
where it's a little bit of both and I can only control my part.
Like I said, I think that personnel part is really where the growth is happening the most
for me in this second year. I'm recognizing things that I did wrong in the beginning, that I did
wrong six months later, that I did wrong a year later, and now I can go back and reflect on those
and improve those areas for the future. Now it's like the fine-tuning instead of the putting out
fires as much. I can be a little bit obsessive especially when it is something I feel like is not
right, and so I'll think about it and think about it until I come up with some resolutions and
strategies. That's with anything in life; I'm not someone that's like “oh, it will sort itself out;” I'm
like “but how, how?” [But through] developing skills, I really try to look at the larger picture
instead of reflecting on the tiny thing that I can get a obsessive about and that's where I think it's
adding value to me improving. I guess a lot of the picture I’m painting is the glass half-full thing
and I am definitely that way. I really try to live extremely positively and always look at the best
side of things, even when I get down. There are definitely times where I feel like I have failed or
that I’m at a low [point] or that I shouldn't have done something. So there is all of that, too, but I
really try not to live there and I try to shake it off and do better next time.

279

G.5

PROFILE FOR JOYCE

G.5.1 Early Experiences/Becoming a Manager

I never looked at the fact that I would be somewhere 35 years; I just thought “oh I like kids…”
so I went to library school; they were givin’ out money to Black people that day; they said “come
on over;” I came on over and I signed on the bottom line. I got some money and did something
that to me was what I breathed for. But I didn't take it further than I'm doing better, I'm doing
what my parents would've wanted me to do. You do better than what your parents did; that's
their wish for you, and I was doing it. I had been in the CLP system for almost ten years, first as
a Children’s Librarian at the Main Library (part-time, 6 months), then the Young Adult Librarian
at Main (2 1⁄2 years) and at the Carrick location for 6 years as the Children’s Librarian. I had
been applying for a variety of other positions and finally got the Senior Librarian in the
Children’s Room at Squirrel Hill, where I stayed for over 2 years and [it] means that you run the
ship - I had my own staff [and] my own budget. By that time, I was a bit frustrated with my
movement through the organization, but I went ahead and applied for the manager position at
Knoxville. I had gotten training from all over the organization, attended all the conferences and
workshops required and knew that I knew my craft, but it felt like I had hit the glass ceiling and
being an African American woman, that my skills might never be recognized. But the counsel of
a colleague made me continue. He said “you’ve done everything they have asked of you. They
can’t not move you up.” It was good advice and I got the position. Although I only stayed there
for 8 months before moving to Homewood, my dream location where I stayed for 15 years, I am

280

grateful that I had all those experiences because I could bring many things my colleagues could
not.
[An] experience [as a] Children’s Librarian before [going to Squirrel Hill], I had a
manager who was ill a lot of the time and so I took over a lot of those basic duties that weren't in
my “job description” but it's in the little print at the bottom, “other things as necessary.” So you
look at those responsibilities a little differently; it’s sort of like there's a beginning and an end to
it because they're coming back. She had chronic things especially in the last year; it got to be
more me doing and I had forgotten about that until I put it into that timeframe. I think two things
worked in our favor: one was we probably were a staff of four in a teeny tiny branch that was
like a storefront, with a couple of Pages and, because we had been working together, for maybe
four years before this new boss came, we knew our rhythm. When the new manager came, we
all worked together, and then these illnesses started happening and that meant she was gone for
significant amounts of time. There was a really good Senior Clerk and [together] we just worked
it out and because there was no other alternative, we just divided up the work and got things
done. It wasn't as complicated as it is now so I could still do all my children’s stuff; that didn't
suffer. The monthly reports got done; the little bit of statistics that we did at that point got done.
It was a simpler time, there were no computers, and so we just got it done; and when she came
back, she came into whatever [we were doing] and then if she got sick again, she went out again.
It helped me understand the game, of being a part of upper management. There were people that
talked to me, that helped me understand certain things, that explained certain things to me. By
the time I [was] the Senior Librarian at Squirrel Hill, I understood the statistics, the reports that
needed to be in, how to get people to be part of a team, to have regular staff meetings, to do some
little extra things to make people believe they had value because Squirrel Hill could be [a] very

281

difficult [place] to work, to work it out as a group, to learn how to talk and share and that with
my staff. I started learning all of that at Carrick, so it was a natural carryover; there were no
classes; there were no books; it was on-the-job learning. I knew that if I went to Squirrel Hill, I
would learn everything that I needed to know in order to, if I chose to, move higher. That was
going to be feet-to-the-ground from Day 1 — you walk in the door, you're on; there is no get
yourself in, get your feet wet. No, they open up those doors at 10:00 and people are beating on
the doors [to] get in there. I wouldn’t have done it any other way.
The Knoxville position was an easy fit as I followed a manager that I had followed in
several previous positions. I knew her style and could flow right into the duties. At that time, it
was the norm for the out-going manager to work with the in-coming manager to smooth the
transition (for about a week). That way, community connections were continued, introductions
made, answers to specific questions, that person was there to work with you side-by-side. So the
Knoxville experience was very smooth. [Then] I moved to Homewood within that year. The
manager there had been removed from her position, so when I got the job, there was much chaos
and concerns over the direction the branch was to go. This was before computers so everything
was hands-on. Staff training was a must and basic routines and procedures had to be put in place.
Talk about hitting the ground running. The branch had been allowed to be non-productive and
stagnant, staff untrained, collection in deplorable condition. I really had to start at zero and make
this library, the library I grew up in, the library that I knew it could be. They [the administration]
trusted me to go in and I told them “I need a month, two months, to find out where all the [issues
are] and then I need another two months to deal with it,” [including] dealing with staff who had a
variety of issues. We also had other groups [community organizations that did not pay rent] in

282

the building who had staffs that had been functioning a certain way and I had to learn about
them.
I really did have to go from a point of I love for this building. You’ll do things out of
love that you might not do out of duty; so when you find the messed-up stuff, the love thing
carries you further than because I'm getting a paycheck. I'm supposed to do this because we are
owed it in this community, they are owed it. I remember being in the interview, they said “what
will be the first thing that you'll do if you become manager” and I said “go to that front lawn
where you have that ratty sign that looks like people have shot it and it's never been painted or
anything and I'll rip it down with my bare hands; it is an embarrassment to the organization;
particularly, it is an embarrassment to the community and why would we treat the community
this way and say that you have no value; there’s a big etched thing on the top of the building that
says Homewood Branch, that's going to have to do until we can do a little better here.” So that is
the first thing that I did.
[With regard to the staff,] there were grumbles, moans and groans, “why do we have to
do it this way,” not so much “who is she and why is she here.” But some of them realized that
when I uncovered everything, it was not going to be pretty. Some folks had to leave; some folks
got angry until they saw what I was trying to do. There was no faith that our library in
Homewood had any good books, that the staff knew anything. The collection was in a shambles;
no one knew what we had; no one knew the potential of what we had. We were like an island
and the communications weren't there. We had old stuff and things had not been weeded well;
catalog cards had not been filed for years; it was not pretty. I was given carte blanche to go in
and do, as long as I let them know what was going on, so I had the Goodwill truck pull up to the
front steps and had everybody come in on a Friday and for four hours, we cleaned out that room.

283

I didn't care what was in those boxes; we gave them all to Goodwill and the Goodwill people
came and got all the stuff. We had to start from [that day] as if I was building a new library, and
some of the staff were just so doggone happy that somebody was cleaning out the corners.

G.5.2 Role as Manager

Many believe that one African American community is just like another; that is not the case. I
had a great deal of knowledge of the Homewood community; it’s where I grew up, I have very
strong connections and feelings to that community. So when I was transferred to the Hill District
community, while not being a fish out of water, I had to remind myself and others that
connections take time. At one point, I was asked how long it would take me to turn this branch
around. My answer was 5 years. It was not the answer that the administration was looking for.
But I knew that even though I looked like the community, I was not from that community. My
roots and connections were across town and I would have to prove that I was committed to this
new neighborhood and that would take time: time to learn who I was talking to, learn who I
should be talking to and learn what and how to approach subjects and topics the Hill District
way. I knew a bit about community development, so I made sure that I got an introduction into
the premier community development group (the Hill District Consensus Group) where I
introduced myself and [gave] information about where I had come from and my vision for our
library. I attended those meetings monthly and networked, making it known that a new librarian
was in the community and working for the community. I listened to issues and toured the
community to see things for myself. These were all part of learning and finding out what made
this community tick. Year one: learn the library and the surrounding streets, meet your library
users and develop relationships. Year two: continue [Year one work] and [begin] inviting
284

businesses to use the library [and] be introduced to the collection and staff. Year three: what does
the community want to see its library be to them? By this time, plans were in order to build a
new library in the community, so I needed to continue the strong ties I had made as I asked what
the community wanted and put their needs upfront in all conversations about the new facility.
My experience in the renovation of Homewood became invaluable at this time. Talks stretched
from downtown to all parts of the community, even the children, as the plans became more than
just a dream. Things progressed and the new facility was built; the community welcomed this
new addition to the Centre Avenue business corridor and the new library has been and continues
to be a beacon in this neighborhood.
Now that we are in the new facility, it is important to go to the next level and that is
technology, getting the buy-in of the community to see the gadgets as a necessary part of their
everyday lives. My community knows that computers are important, but many do not have them
in their homes. We are the location for their technology experience. Job seekers have to put in
applications online; you must have a viable resume; you have to navigate the websites to get the
unemployment or employment information. Some things (applying for housing) can only be
done online; these things make the difference in computer knowledge [which is] sometimes
overwhelming at times. The library is a trusted place for information and knowledge-sharing,
and we must make sure that our community is knowledgeable of not only what is out there now,
but what is coming. We want to be the technology hub for the community which means that I
and my staff must be knowledgeable of what’s out there. It will require proficiencies, time and
funds to make this happen, but it is the next step in making sure that our community can compete
in the world with a better playing field.

285

I know that I am the face of this building so whatever happens here is on me; my big
picture is knowing that being the face has a lot of responsibilities and pressures that nobody else
in [the branch] has to have on their shoulders. I want my community to value and trust what we
do here. If they do that (I say getting us on their shopping list), if I can get in the first 10 items of
the shopping list, that's my big picture. The struggle is getting there; I don't mind being number
10, in with survival and life. I don't even mind being number 15 because I’m on the list. So my
big picture is getting us on that list and making it something that they've checked off. [But
there’s also] the fact that I had to make sure that we follow policy because it would be very easy
for people to say “over at that Black library, they let you do whatever.” So I've had to say “you
have to say the word ‘policy’ to people; they have to understand that we didn't get up this
morning and decide to make their day bad or that we’re making this up as we go; there are rules
and regs that we all should be following.” I would never have had to say that in Squirrel Hill; I
would not have had to say that at Carrick.
[A leader] is the person you can count on to get the job done. It is what I want my staff
to feel when they come through the door, that we’re going to get the job done and we’ll all work
together in order to get the job done, and that I can trust your decisions, if you've made your
decision to the best of your ability, which gives everybody some leadership because then they
can trust their answers. So if I'm the manager of a bunch of people and I'm giving them that
ability, credence to do their job, even down to Pages who are merely shelving the books, I'm
going to trust you. I have to trust you because we all have to get the job done. If I do that
reasonably well, then we'll all be able to see people getting the information they need which is
really the success of it. If they can walk out of the door saying “I've got what I needed, maybe

286

not what I wanted, but what I needed” then we have all done what we were supposed to do, and
we’ve all led that person to the front door again.
I know I can call Mary [my supervisor] anytime [as] another set of ears on a different
level. She's good to talk with and I feel I can go to her at any time with any issue, which is really
helpful. It helps that I've had her for years so we know each other's style. She supports decisions
that I've made, which I can sometimes use her as the leverage point, which lets other people
know that there is another voice over top of mine. Her support, her vision, where we’re looking
five years ahead, what we want to see happening in here, what's happening in this community,
trying to anticipate some of the things that are going to be happening, it’s good to talk that
through with her, in how the organization will be impacted. My expectation is that together we
can figure it out; and that’s really basically it. We are a team on that level and she sees things
because she's looking more globally than I am. If the trend is happening somewhere else, like
we have some customers that are traveling and bringing their messes with them, she can say
“you know, this is happening here and here's how we handled it there,” because sometimes it
will be this weird thing happening and I won't hear it from folks on my level. [Her expectations
are that you] get it done [and] just do your job. She doesn't want a bunch of surprises, so if you
know the mess is coming, let her know, and then we talk it out. She's never said “I don't want to
talk about this” and I appreciate that.

G.5.2.1 Supervising Staff
[My expectations as a supervisor are that you] do your job. “I'm paying you a fair wage; I need a
fair job; if you don't know how to do it, let me know; we’ll get you the training that you need,
but you have to tell me that.” I ask my staff every month to give me a monthly narrative; I use it

287

to sort of gauge their mood, the temperature of what they're doing. And I can find out some
interesting things, whether it's a good narrative or it's a bad narrative. I want you to come and do
your job because I'm coming in here everyday, whether I feel like it or not, doing my job, and I
have from Day 1; and if I can do it, you can do it. I have walked a mile in every one of their
shoes so I know what everybody's doing. I may not do it as well as they do, but I know what
everybody's doing. I have certain standards about how I want things to be and how I want things
to run and [if] I find things, I will bring it up. Some of them want me to be Mom; some of them
don't know what to do with me. This is a different staff at different times because they have
never been managed by anybody like me before. Some of them just want to know what it is they
are supposed to do, but everybody here does a little bit of everything; that helps us when people
are out sick, when somebody is at a meeting. We laugh together; we cry together; we go in the
room and curse together; and for some folks, that's really okay.
[For me, supervising] really depends on how long it takes you to learn your job, how long
you’ve been at this job and how you like to be supervised. I’ve had some staff who just “got it”
and did what was needed with very little direction. I’ve had others that needed more coaching
and some hands-on support. I’ve been fortunate to work in a variety of places, small [to] large
and even Main, so the philosophy of who is responsible for supervising staff can and has varied.
Presently I have a really good team that works with our new folks well, so I don’t have as much
supervising but more checking in and being available. Working in a small branch, you really get
to know your staff very intimately. Most of the time, I am able to see and hear about supervisory
issues that may be occurring a bit more quickly. I’ve learned to trust my instincts, read a
situation quickly and respond in a timely fashion so as not to have things linger and become

288

more than they need to be. I have regular weekly meetings with most staff and in other cases
(for Pages or part-time folks) as needed.
I do keep records on all staff; I learned that early especially in cases where staff are
struggling and/or the fit is not right for that position or our site. I keep very good records now,
especially in areas where I think there might be some problem down the line. I have found that
documentation, documentation, documentation is the mantra of a good manager. You never
know when you may have need of it. I also know that I can trust my instincts, and that can help a
lot. I have also developed a strong rapport with all my staff so that they know they can and
should come to me if anything seems off with a co-worker, a patron. They must learn to trust
their own instincts. I have let them know that I will support them in the decisions they make, if
they have made a well thought-out decision. I think the situation that really had me understand
the need to keep good records of incidents [and] conversations was with a staff member who was
misrepresenting him/herself not only in the branch, but out in the community. This person gave
themselves a title that was not accurate, wrote letters as if they could make certain library
decisions and generally created situations that made “who is in charge” muddy. Disciplinary
measures had to be taken. Information gathered to show incidences and documentation of all
conversations between myself and the staff person had to be on file. Administration was very
supportive and HR gave direction so that I had a very complete file when difficult conversations
were held and the decision made that this person needed to be moved.
I have learned not to let things stew; and if you need an explanation beyond “I really
would rather that you don't do (and fill in the blank),” I don't have a problem saying it. The buck
stops with me and I believe [in] talking it out if I have an issue. They give us these 6-week or
12-week [periods], which if by six weeks it's been an issue, it's been an issue six weeks too long,

289

especially if it's something beyond [the] time it takes to learn something. I don't have a problem
telling you the repercussions [of not learning or doing the job]. I try to address things as they
come up; if I know that they're coming up, I try to talk it over with folks. I try to address certain
things in staff meetings; I send out all-staff emails about some issues that may come up or
incidents. It's talking it through and then I go back and see if it's been remedied. My door’s
always open. I just learned to handle it because when it gets bigger, then it really upsets
everything.
[When things aren’t working,] I do a lot of soul-searching to see whether or not it's
something I'm missing in helping them. I try to have conversations, try to figure out what's
wrong, try to come to some solutions that are workable. Sometimes it's changing a schedule,
sometimes it's retraining somebody, sometimes it's they just need somebody to talk to, that there
are other things going on that I might not be aware of and sometimes it helps to tell somebody
that right now this is what's happening and I'm an impartial ear. Following protocol, you have to
have conversations and then you may have to have warnings and then you may have to write
something up. You may [also] have to have take this a little further and talk to somebody else
about it and form a plan. Then it's what I call the paperwork of seeing that the plan works; if HR
gets involved, then it's really serious and sometimes the person will say “this is just not the right
fit.” We used to have Pages that were like 14 years old; by the 12th week, if I’ve been talking to
you and it's not working, we are going to say “this is not for everybody” and it's okay to say “this
is not exactly what I want to do,” especially for that group. I did have one [person] who was an
adult who worked one day. We mutually agreed the next day that this was not working; their
expectations and our expectations in one day did not come together. It was a different person

290

than the person we interviewed; I was like “it sounds like to me like you've made some
decisions” and we agreed to dissolve this relationship within 24 hours.
For a while, people were “given” to you if there was a space. I was “given” a person who
I knew in a different framework in the organization. [When] I worked with them for a while, I
realized that their expectations and mine for the position they were hired for were not aligned.
We had a big struggle with this, to where I had to develop a plan [and] be on them about doing
what they needed to do. [This] person who started out [as] an acquaintance, a friendship, things
really got…not good. And I think it was because I didn't ask the right questions. I was given
[the person], and I said “yes I can work with this person,” but I didn't I really didn't know how
they were in this kind of work environment. It didn't go well and we are only now getting
straightened out, years later. I will say that I didn't ask the right questions, [and] it would've been
different questions than interview questions. I needed to do better [at the] beginning to find out
how their style and my style worked or didn't work, what the strengths [and weaknesses were],
and I didn't do that because they dropped them into a situation where I needed them, and we
went forward with it.

G.5.2.2 Attributes and Beliefs
Having done this for so many years, there’s not much that I have not come in contact with. I
have developed a style that works for me and while there may be surprises, I am confident that
my style of openness and decision making are working for the good of the organization and
situations that may arise. I don’t think I have all the answers, but I do know who to call and
where to find the next step. You have to like people; you have to like yourself; you have to be
willing to say no; you have to be willing to be wrong and to accept that and look for ways to fix

291

it. [You have to be] kind, compassionate and realize that this is your life. It doesn't end at the
end of the day; it doesn't start at the time you open up the door.

Sometimes things don't feel

right, and I've been doing this long enough to recognize that if it doesn't feel right, there’s
something there. They’ll [my staff] hear me say “there's something off, there's something not
quite right, I've got a funny feeling about this…” and I've learned to trust it. Usually I'm right
and I go investigate. I may check in with you and say “is everything alright?” Sometimes I get
more of a story than I want, but be careful what you ask for, you might actually get it. If I'm
totally off, I'm okay with being totally off; it could be me or I could be looking for stuff.
Sometimes I roll up on some things I don't quite want to know.

G.5.3 Cultural Changes in the Organization/Changes in Public Libraries

I guess the main thing has been in technology because when I started, literally there was one
computer. There was one computer for the customers and there was a computer at the front
desk. I think I might have had one in my office [but] didn't quite know what to do with it. But
the main thing was being able to communicate silently with colleagues because now you could
just type your question in and get responses back. It wasn't that the phone wasn't used but it was
a new toy to use. As we learned what we were to do with it and how it would work for us, that's
how managing people’s time, which was for me much more labor-intensive, [changed]. We still
had that day-to-day stuff that you did, which was very hands-on, and everything that line staff
did was still very hands-on. [There] were whole new processes to learn, and we had to learn a
different vocabulary to match all of that [new technology]. [Now,] it’s much more managerial
than it is hands-on so I have to trust my staff more; but there are more policies and procedures
292

and routines that they have to follow to get the correct end result. But I can check things much
faster, which can be good or bad depending, which [also] means that the language of it moves
much faster than I [can] catch onto as quickly, because my mind is not the mind of a 22-year-old,
so I process the information differently.
[Another change is how the organization deals with staffing issues.] There’s an old
saying here “we never let anybody go no matter how bad they are at what they do.” Ten or
twenty years ago, it used to be that they could just move you around. The thing was [that] we’ll
find somewhere where they'll fit better. An organization can’t just kept moving people around,
but that was the way it was. It was like a family and if this relative can't make it there, we’ll
move him over to Aunt Sophie's house; she has a room and she’ll work him out, and you may
move that family member around and around. I think that it has [been] very hard for us as an
organization; we have such a private way of looking at employees.

Because it would be

considered dirty laundry, we don't air our dirty laundry. You would really have to do something
really bad to be fired. I’d say that it's harder now to let things go as long; there’s a level of
transparency that had to come as we recognized that we are a business and not a family. Some
factions of it were being pulled kicking and screaming into looking at ourselves as business
managers which is different than [when] you’re a librarian. We started this whole learning how
to be a business with Herb [a former director]; it was a different conversation, a different
vocabulary, a different way of looking at how you do business in order to get money, to get
recognition, for people to take you seriously, to get to the table for conversations. We had to
learn how to do that from the top down; it was not a pleasant process sometimes, but there were
benefits: holding people accountable, having a process when there are issues and taking those 6week and 12-week [periods] more seriously, getting out there in the world and finding out how

293

the world does business, because we weren't running like a business. We had to learn and try out
new things and step out of our comfort zones to get [to the place where] that comes a lot more
naturally now, [which] can help us when we have all these difficulties.
[Regarding the future,] I do worry about the future of inner-city libraries and how they
are going to be affected as we become more of a business. What does that say about the basic
needs folks have for that human interaction and those folks that get a little deeper into their
lives? I know a lot more about my folks's lives than if we were a bigger place; this has been an
opportunity to get much closer to folks’s lives and I don't want that to go away because in
communities like ours, there has to be that non-partisan person who you can go to with no
judgment; you need that. I think I've been able to do some of that. I worry about that being
missing and I don't know what you can do about it; it's just something that I think about every
once in a while -- who will be the ear when I'm gone. Will that be as important as how many
people are on the computer; will it just be about I'm helping you with a resume instead of
listening to the story about why you need this resume now? I think is all part of being a
community.

G.5.4 Identity

For me, it's a bit of a struggle sometimes because I really love books and I love talking to people
about books and I love that day-to-day interaction with people and I love people peeking in the
door and telling me the good, the bad and the ugly. Those things are really why I come to work.
When I was a Children's Librarian, I loved and, still today, love the kids who run in because they
want to tell me something or they just want to hug or knowing that I may be the only person
looks them in the eye [and says] “have a good day” or “good job” or “I'm really glad to see you
294

on that computer finally doing some homework.” I'm never off, so if I'm in the grocery store and
you hand me three books, I take the three books, I put them in my cart, I put them in my car and I
bring them back. If you have a new baby and the first stop you do is here because you want to
get that baby a card or you just want me to see this brand-new baby on the way home from the
hospital, I pick up babies, I hold them to my bosom… that's my job. Those are all the things that
make the rest of this stuff that I have to do manageable for me. I'm getting to do less and less of
that and there is a part of me that highly resents it, but there's also the knowledge that I have to
manage this as a business; this is not just where I come to rock babies, so I've got to do what I've
got to do, and still know that it may take over my fun time. I still have to have my fun time in
order for me to feel balanced within myself. I have certain things that I do to help me get
through some of these things. I also write stuff down, I keep good lists; I try to keep on top of
everything and my staff knows that if that door is closed, unless it is really really bad, I'll be out
soon. I have to break up some of it up, so I've got my music, I've got my pictures, I have some
crochet somewhere, I've got those things that help me even out my mind and think about things
in a different way. It may be that I have to walk around the block; “I’ll be back in 10 minutes,”
but I've got to walk it out.
I do like running [the branch]; I get great satisfaction in it, to know that I am the voice,
that people look up to me, that people ask my opinion, they want me to be involved in things.
Particularly in this community, when something's happening, they now say “…and we have to
invite Joyce who is the manager at the library.” They've gotten it, like I talked about the
shopping list kind of thing, they've got it; I can't wish for more than that. People appreciate my
input and I find that humbling a lot of times. [The staff] comes to the door [with] an issue; I
come out and sometimes people are rather shocked at the person who comes out of this room. I

295

appreciate it; I don't take it for granted because I know it can be gone tomorrow, but I do
appreciate the fact that I've been able to make a difference. I think I've made a difference. I
know that at 3:00 in the morning I have opened up my eyes and thought about something that
needed to be done here. I'm a quilter; you just make it the fabric of your life; it's just the fabric
of what I do. When I retire, that is a big question [of] who am I then, as opposed to who am I
now?
Still today, people will say “do you have a college degree to do what you do?” Are you
saying that because of the system [or] are you saying that because I'm Black? Now, somebody
might say “is she any good” or at Squirrel Hill, stop the little woman who kept wanting to call
me “girl” and I'm like “I'm not your girl, but you hold that thought, I'm in the go get somebody
else to come here…” because the next thing I'm going to say to you will not be “girl” and neither
one of us will be happy, but I need my job. So I had to think about some of that stuff, what it's
like to be, what some people would say, a trailblazer; what it's like to have to be the trailblazer
on top of everything else you have to do; to know that you're being watched; and it's part of the
culture to be very careful in how you say something because people are concerned. I cut all my
hair off and people were worried that I was becoming militant. I said casually in a workshop one
day [when] somebody asked me “when you retire, what you going to do,” and my response to
that was two-part, but one was “I'm very concerned that when I retire, the person who takes my
job at this branch will not look like me or the community.” It is what it is. Before I got back to
the branch, there were calls and emails “is everything all right; do you need to talk about
anything; has something happened?” I understood what they were talking about; it led to us
having a conversation with African-American and other interested staff about diversity in the
organization. I don't want to be the diversity queen but someone had to start the conversation

296

and whether the conversation goes on, I know that we did have a bit of a conversation; that's
what I’m supposed to do and I've done what I'm supposed to do.

G.5.5 Learning

G.5.5.1 Mentors, Models, Peers, and Others
There have been throughout my life those, predominantly women, who have paved the way, and
recognized in me something that said “we need to give her as much support as we can because
A, we know she's going to need it and B, because she deserves it.” For some reason, they seem
to think I've done something wonderful and have supported what I've done and have been proud
of me, even when I am just doing my job. But they will come and say “we've been watching
you” and now I get to say that, “I'm watching you and if you ever need someone to talk to…”
I've been fortunate to have some women who just looked me in the face and said “you need to go
home and fix yourself a cup of tea and put your feet up and let it go, just let it go for a while, and
then look at it tomorrow.” [Now I get to] do that to my staff; they've got that look and [need
some time to process]. I've been given that gift and I feel it's my job to give that gift forward.
I've had women, and a couple of men, who have said “this is how the game is played and I want
you to know how the game is played” and I hope that I've been able to do that to some folks
coming up behind me. I [have also had] librarians and line staff who were willing to share
information and answer my questions. I believe that I had good outside experiences, especially
working with children and their families. I was able to engage people and work toward the goal
of great library experiences. I also continued my studies and took special care to document
events and activities to be able to refer back when I needed a little extra something to move an

297

idea or project forward. It helped especially in Homewood that I was from that community, that I
already had contacts and connections [because] help was readily forthcoming.

G.5.5.2 Reflections/Research Participation
I've had an amazing career; I really am pleased; I don't view any of it as negative. There were
some awkward moments [but] I've been able to do stuff: I’ve met the President's wife; I've met
Darth Vader; I am the librarian for Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood of Make-Believe; I have met
people who've done movies with Russell Crowe and they’re 90 years old; I've gotten up at 2
o'clock in the morning to come to the library to turn over eggs in an incubator; I've raised my
kids; I've had a home; I've taken vacations; I've ridden on a camel… I think because I'm coming
to what I consider to be the end of this part of my life, I have been spending the last few years
looking back. There is no one else around, other than a few custodians or painters [and] a couple
of library staff who were around when I started and some of the folks who were around then are
passing away. I've had some interesting experiences which I think were different than some of
my colleagues who were even here a long time [because] I came from the outside. I was not a
Page; I didn't start there. My African American predecessors were Pages and Clerks and [then]
went to library school. They grew up in the system; I just kind of appeared one day and went to
non-African American communities and worked, which was not really the way traditionally it
was done. I didn't know any better; I went where the job was, so I have had some different
experiences. I will say none really bad [but] some where I had to go and talk about racial things;
some where I felt devalued simply because the connotation that African American libraries aren't
as good as everybody else's library. Even when I have interviews now, I specifically say “we are
a full-service library; we do the same things as everybody else” because there’s still a bit of a

298

connotation that our collection isn't as good, our staff is not as trained, because we’re in a Black
community, we didn't get the same training. Am I a professional? There [seems to be] a
question.
I've been grateful that you [the researcher] asked me to do this. I'm coming to the end of
my journey and you're making me think of things that happened 30 years ago which I thought I
had put away. Some of your diary entries bubbled some things up that I thought I'd been okay
with, but it bubbled some things up which I found very interesting. I have been thinking about
what's the next part of the journey and who I am the day after [I retire]. I've decided that I'm still
a librarian; I have been a librarian since I was a child. When I was a little girl, [I] took the ten
books back to the library every week and came back with ten more, and [my] father just didn't
get it, but [my] mother said “let that girl read.” [I] read all the way to school with a neighbor's
dog who walked me to the corner two blocks down and sat and waited for the bus with me and
then walked back and [the] owner didn't know where he went in the mornings when he left for
that 45 minutes. I've always been a librarian so once I [realized] it doesn't have to go away the
day after, I was like, “okay, okay,” but it took me a minute to get there. [All my positions have
had an impact, including] Squirrel Hill and Carrick because those people still remember me; it's
very eerie. I can go back to Carrick and go into Caruso's Music Store and have Mrs. Caruso yell
from the back “oh, you’re here!” or go to the candy store across the street and say “yay! I want
some of Esther’s hardtack…” There is something about not being forgotten and people still
appreciating whatever I did: “you helped me find that book; you got my kid interested in reading;
my grandmother loves books-on-tape and you told me how to do it with the Library for the
Blind,” or the humbling things where you get a letter saying “thank you for letting me know
about this because it helped my mother and she just passed away;” you didn’t have to send me

299

that letter to let me know that, but people thinking enough of me to want me to know that they
appreciate what I did.
It does not make it harder to think about retirement [though]. I have been thinking about
retirement for a very long time. Once I realized at the core I am a librarian, regardless of the rest
of this stuff, that I've always been one, and that I will continue to be one afterwards, it made it
okay. It's not the building, it's not the job, it's not the computer, it's not all this stuff. It is a
wonderful part of who I am and people are still going to ask me questions. People's memories are
long [and] it'll be “you know that librarian, that woman who used to be [here,] ask her.” I don't
think it stops on the day you say is the last day; it will not stop that way. I think that I've always
reflected on things and I don't think I would call it reflection; it's remembering, which is easier
than reflecting because to me, reflection means that you have to look at it a certain way, but if
you remember something or you have memories about something, [then] it’s a story. I am, at the
base, a storyteller and because it's my story, I can weave it how I want to weave it. But I've
always thought back on things and I kind of like thinking back and sometimes things do bubble
up “oh I don't really want to think about that right now” but it's there [so] let’s walk through it
instead of walking around it; I'm going to remember things and it's going to be okay.

PROFILE FOR KAREN R.

G.6.1 Career/Becoming a Manager

G.6.1.1 Previous Experience

300

In a prior career in the health insurance industry, I was an office manager. In this role, I
supervised staff and developed and set up office procedures and practices for a new company.
As office manager, I received training in project management, time management and supervisory
skills. All of the skills I developed in the insurance industry were transferrable to my role as a
manager at CLP. I was lucky when I came to the library because I came from an outside world
where [after] several years, [I] got a different job in the same organization [as] the manager of a
new division that was being created. So I had the experience in the outside world of being a
manager and creating a department, hiring staff, setting up office procedures. I already had that
under my belt when I came to the library. The part that was different in the insurance industry
versus the library world is the library world is very open about sharing ideas and sharing
concepts and “let's not re-create the wheel, let’s just use what other people have already
developed.”

That was a completely different experience for me because in the insurance

industry, it's extremely competitive; you don't share anything with anybody. [There] I was really
on my own with little guidance and had to create this department with minimal help. Having
accomplished that and then moving into the library world where everything is so collegial and a
sharing environment, [it] was a real breath of fresh air and it made the work of a manager much
easier because you have a lot of support.

G.6.1.2 Library Field
[After] I earned my MLIS in 2000, I started my career at CLP as a librarian in the Humanities
Department at Main and in 2003, became the manager of the circulation department at Main
[which] was not a planned step in my career. I discovered that I absolutely loved being a
librarian, helping patrons and planning programs. With my delight in librarianship, my plan was

301

to be a librarian at [a] public service desk for my entire career. When I was [a] librarian in
Humanities, one of the projects I [was] one of the leaders [for] was Book Group Connections.
Another librarian and I put together a plan for providing book discussion kits for outside book
groups. It was [an]other librarian’s idea and I partnered along with her. We created a proposal
and led the whole project all the way through, developed a plan [and] got it approved by the
administration. That’s a program that we started in probably 2002 and it's still something that
the First Floor [popular materials] does.

That was one of my first teamwork leadership

experiences at the library.
During a reorganization of staff, a former CLP Director, Herb, asked me to be the
manager of the circulation department. My initial response was, “I have a job I love, I appreciate
your thinking of me, but no thanks.” He brought me in for a one-on-one meeting and said “why
are you saying no?” I explained all the reasons why I didn't want to be a manager and the
reasons why I did want to be a librarian and he talked me through that for about 45 minutes.
With every one of my reasons, Herb responded with questions for me to think about. After a
several days of soul-searching, I finally decided to take a big leap and accepted the position of
Manager of Customer Services. I can honestly say this was one of the best decisions of my life.
So Herb was very influential to my life, both personally and also professionally; somehow Herb
saw the leader within me that I did not know existed. I’ll always be grateful to Herb for
encouraging me to take a leap. He saw that I could be a manager and I didn't recognize that, so I
credit him for recognizing something in me that I didn't know I had. Had he not pushed me, had
he not encouraged it, I'm sure I would've been very happy as a librarian forever, but I'm really
thankful that I've had these opportunities to be a manager.

302

On my second day as manager of the circulation department, we closed the circulation
desk and moved the entire department to a temporary location that was built on an elevated
platform in the second floor stairwell while the first floor was under renovation. Staff looked to
me for direction on setting up a functioning circulation desk. Since I had never worked in
circulation, my staff knew much more than I did about the day-to-day operations. I relied on my
staff completely because I knew zero about circulation tasks and people came to me and said
“where do you think we should put the bins” and I didn't even know what a bin was. I didn't
know the vocabulary and I responded “wherever you think it's best and if it doesn't work, we’ll
fix it.” I empowered them to make decisions and do their best to set up a functioning workflow
process, while assuring them that we could certainly refine the process as we lived with it. So
right then, I 100% relied on them to make good calls; everybody was very helpful, a handful of
people were extremely helpful, and I just relied on them for the first many months. I was
pleasantly surprised at how well people worked together under [the] challenging circumstances.
It was a time of many changes; several of my staff had been transferred to Main when the branch
libraries’ hours were cut; it was a difficult commute for many who had to leave their
neighborhoods for a long commute to Main. [Also,] when I was named manager of circulation, I
replaced a person who had been manager for many years and, quite understandably, many staff
felt a strong allegiance to her. So my first year as a manager was filled with potential issues that
could have de-railed the team. To their credit, they continued to make the best of trying
circumstances, helped each other and me immeasurably and continued to provide excellent
service to customers.
It took a while to develop a really solid working relationship with my supervisor during
that time. I felt like I was so new and I was afraid about that and I was so new in my career here

303

too. I was much more afraid to ask questions; I had only been in the library [a couple of] years at
that point; I really felt like a newbie and I didn't want people to be aware of how little I knew. I
came from the outside world; I didn't come from a lifelong experience in libraries, so I really
knew nothing and I was afraid to reveal that. In my first year as a manager at CLP, I discovered
that asking questions is an excellent way to learn. Since I had never worked in the circulation
department, I had a lot to learn and I learned daily operations from my staff. I also learned from
other managers at the Main managers meetings. Now I'm totally aware of the fact that nobody
knows everything and it’s totally fine to reveal what you don't know, but I wasn’t there then, I
really wasn’t.

G.6.2 Role as Manager

[As a manager, I] ensure we deliver the best possible customer service, identify and develop
community collaborations, participate in systemwide committees, task forces, PEFAs [Patron
Experience Focus Areas], and systemwide initiatives.

[From the time] I first started as a

manager in Customer Services, it was very customer-focused, to the point that we just eliminated
children's fines and when I had customer account issues, almost everything was forgiven unless
it was absolutely blatant. It's always been focused on the very best service we can possibly
provide to customers; that has remained the same. Things that have changed would be the role
of manager as a visionary and leader and trying to embrace the concept of what the system is
doing as a whole. So it's more of managing from a higher level, I would say. I've been really
conscious of the movement from a manager who does tasks and has immediate responsibilities
that are day-to-day [to] more of an effort to eliminate some of that from the managers’ work so
we do more of the global work. I think that's the biggest trend I've seen. [That] global reach [of]
304

where the library is going, what the library is doing, what the library has identified as our
mission and our vision, it encompasses everything from our customer services standards to the
service we deliver, the resources we use, the resources we purchase, our connections in the
community. It includes how we spend our money, how we staff, how we purchase materials,
how we interact with others outside the library and inside the library.
Leadership to me is the concept of being a visionary, seeing the bigger picture and
developing relationships with people so that you’re respected and you're engaging input from
others. It's bing a good listener as well. One of my favorite quotes (it’s on my board here) is
from Gandhi: “there go my people, I must run to catch up for I am their leader.” And I think
that's how it works; if you're a good leader, you inspire people and encourage people and then
you just do your best to make it happen, to support them and encourage their work. Fairness is
certainly important to me and communication skills and just the awareness of where people are
and what their needs are and what you can do to support and encourage and still keep in mind the
vision and the mission of the library and making it all come together. [As a leader,] you have to
be able to motivate staff and understand and interact with a lot of different people in a lot of
different roles; you need to be able to work with the community and develop community
relationships. People skills and communication skills are two of the characteristics that a leader
needs, not getting caught up in the weeds but understanding what the weeds are. It's like seeing
the view of the world from 20,000 feet as opposed to 5,000 feet or on the ground; it's the view
from the balcony, that’s what a leader is for me.
That's really a challenge [and] not an easy thing to do; I still feel like I'm struggling
through that. In managers meetings, we talk about the CLP system and about the vision and the
mission of the organization, which are not concrete. It can be difficult to get your head [and]

305

hands wrapped around it. As a manager, my job is to take that and interpret that to this is what
this means [for] us as a staff, boots on the ground [in] our day-to-day, face-to-face contact with
the public. The way I do it is by engaging in dialogue in staff meetings, engaging in dialogue
one-on-one and hearing people's ideas. I’ll put something out there, then wait for people to
respond; I'll listen, guide and direct through the whole process, so that what were doing in this
location is really reflective in implementing what CLP is all about. Hopefully those phrases [the
common vocabulary coming from the Strategic Plan work] will become internalized as people
begin to think about a new program, a new outreach, or another way of working with the public
in providing services in the library. So if I'm saying it frequently and if materials are available to
people, like the customer service standards for example, hopefully we’re talking about it every
day throughout our regular work week [and] in staff meetings [and] the connections will begin to
be more concrete and apparent to people.
[As for support,] I have the world's best supervisor, I really do. It makes my life so
wonderful. I've really appreciated the fact that this year she started doing one-to-one’s almost
monthly because I can go with a list and know that I can get my questions answered, so I really
appreciate that change that she's made. One of the things that I love about working with her is
that she allows her branch managers to be independent as much as we can be. She doesn't
meddle; she doesn't micromanage; she is extremely supportive. She's also an extremely good
listener and I've learned a lot of listening skills from her. She lets people vent and then she
brings us around and says “I get that, but this is the way it is.” I've tried to model myself when
I'm working with my own staff. She wants me to manage the branch, deal with issues, come to
her when I need to, but basically just run the branch. She wants me to take care of problems as
they arise, she wants me to make sure staff is aligned with the Strategic Plan and the whole

306

customer service approach. She expects me to get the reports done in a timely fashion; she
expects me to have answers when she has questions for me. She expects me to be the public
representation of what the library is, of what the Carnegie Library stands for; she expects me to
have that persona, I think, in my branch and in the community at large. I [do] expect her to
communicate with me if she doesn't like what's going on or how I'm handling something; I
expect her to tell me that. [Overall,] she’s very supportive; she has answers for me; she also lets
me figure out answers sometimes [myself]. She's an ideal manager, she really is. I've had a lot
of managers of my career and she is ideal; it’s been absolutely fantastic working with her.
[One of the challenges I’ve had in my current position is that] I’m learning how to
determine what community collaborations are worthwhile to pursue and/or continue. There are
so many opportunities for partnerships and collaborations that it has been challenging to decide
what to pursue and what to continue. I’m learning how to decide the value of the return on
investment [ROI]. [For] example, I worked really hard to develop a community connection
[with] the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust because I thought it was really important that the Downtown
Library have a presence in the Three Rivers Arts Festival, which is this mega-event with
thousands, perhaps millions, of people attending over the course of two weeks every spring. We
finally connected enough with the Cultural Trust that we landed an invitation and I was thrilled
[that] the library [would] have a presence at the Arts Festival.

That turned into such an

enormous problem because it was six days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday and the following Friday,
Saturday, Sunday.

It coincided with the Extravaganza [systemwide kickoff for Summer

Reading]. Trying to get enough staff to participate for the hours they wanted on the days they
wanted was huge. We solicited help from everybody we possibly could and the sign-ups were
really minimal. So that was something that I wanted to do very badly and the library thought it

307

was a great thing [but] it turned out to not be something that we could do; it was a huge burden.
I was really hard on myself about it because I basically worked a lot of those hours which meant
I wasn't in the branch and I felt really responsible for making this happen. People were as
generous with their time as they could be but it was a huge scheduling problem. We did a recap
on it and analyzed it. Together we decided that the ROI was not significant enough to invest so
much staff time. This was a very helpful and informative process for me.
So then I was in a quandary, who was going to tell the Cultural Trust that we were not
going to do this? Here's where Mary [my current supervisor] really stepped in and helped me out
because, after we all systemwide decided this was not something that we were going to pursue,
she took it out of my hands and out of my responsibility and put it into the hands of somebody
higher than me to get back in touch with the Cultural Trust to tell them why we couldn't do this
in the future. That's also when we began to identify the fact that Downtown is Downtown but a
lot of the outreach that we do is really systemwide outreach and it shouldn't just be the
responsibility of the Downtown staff because our neighborhood is not like Beechview. We are
not just our own little neighborhood; we’re a huge neighborhood with people coming from all
over the county [and] Southwest Pennsylvania. Currently, I’m applying these principles with our
existing collaborations, such as the Reading Room @ Market Square and potential new
collaborations with the Pittsburgh Downtown Community Development Corporation.

G.6.2.1 Participation in the Organization
What I see in the the current administration is a lot of very open-mindedness and a very
encouraging approach. I'm very impressed with the current administration; I think that they're all
doing a really fantastic job. I think the whole Strategic Plan process was really excellent and I

308

think that they’re leading by example. I'm very impressed with the work that's happening right
now in the library; we’re really in a good place. I feel like I've got really solid relationships with
all our senior managers now [and] I’ve worked enough with them that they know who I am and
what I do and what I stand for.

I think they all understand my support, dedication and

commitment to the library.
I [have] made a real effort to develop relationships with the senior managers; it's really
important to me. I want to have an impact in the library and where the direction of library is
going. I think that you can do that if people respect you and know you’re dedicated, committed
and a positive person. I want to be consulted; I want to be asked; I want to be involved in areas
that are going to have an impact. In order to do that, you have to make yourself known and so
I’ve worked hard to make that happen. [In order] to impact those decisions, it's important to
have a role and I've tried to be involved in systemwide committees, the PEFAs, the Strategic
Plan. While I recognize that I'm not the final decision-maker, it’s important to me to have an
opportunity for impact by getting involved in whatever avenues are open, volunteer to be a part
of it.
I [also] enjoy facilitating meetings in systemwide initiatives so I actively pursue these
opportunities. I’ve facilitated many committees and work groups at CLP. Some of my strengths
include organizational and time management skills and I communicate effectively with others.
To learn these skills, I watch how others do it and learn effective ways to lead meetings,
encourage each person to participate, and keep the meeting moving forward to cover the agenda
items. Co-chairing is another good way to learn by sharing responsibilities with a colleague. I
learned a lot from Sheila [Assistant Director of Main Library] as we worked on the First Floor
project. I’ve learned a lot from Mary [Assistant Director of Neighborhood Libraries] about

309

having fun in meetings while conducting a lot of business. I’ve learned a lot from Mary Frances
[Director] as she chairs meetings. I’ve learned a lot from Nicole [consultant for the Strategic
Plan] about getting input and making sure everyone feels heard. I did have some of these skills
prior to becoming a manager because, as a community volunteer, I have had many opportunities
to chair meetings and facilitate small group discussions.

G.6.2.2 Staff Supervision
I've got a large staff of 25 people and a lot of my energy goes into talking individually with
people trying to understand where people are, what they're doing, how it's going [and] how I can
support them. Because it's a large staff, I've got a lot of time invested in my staff. The day-today split of my day may actually be a fairly small amount spent on [supervising], but in my head
it's a fairly big amount. I don't know if time spent and brainpower are an equal equation at this
point, but with 25 people there's always something going on.

[Primary supervisory roles

include] mentoring, affirming, correcting, training, re-training, guiding, directing, visioning,
consulting, communicating, leading. My expectations for staff are that people hopefully enjoy
their work, are satisfied and fulfilled by their work in an environment that they enjoy coming to
work and look forward to. Coupled with that, though, are my expectations that people really
perform at work; I want people to work hard when they’re at work. I have a very high work
ethic myself and I expect that of others; I'm annoyed and frustrated by people who are slacking; I
have minimal tolerance for that. So in that respect, I think perhaps I'm a harder type of a
manager to work for because I do have expectations that people work when they’re at work. But
my goal is that people will really feel fulfillment personally and professionally in their jobs. [For
their part,] people expect me to be here and present, listening and aware of what's going on.

310

People expect me to be the problem-solver; people expect me to put out fires; people expect me
to be the communicator with Main [and] the administration; people expect me to be fair and just;
people expect me to juggle a lot of different balls in the air all at the same time; people expect
me to pull my weight and be at the desk and be doing what they do, experiencing their lives and
what it's like to be in the Downtown Library. People expect me to have answers and solutions,
provide guidance, direction and feedback, and communicate clearly.
Fortunately, because we work in a large organization, a lot of the standards are already
established in policies and procedures and I find [that’s] helpful because then I have something
that I can implement. [Also] there are other policies and procedures and standards that I identify
as specific to our branch. Sometimes I [have to] say “this is what it is” and sometimes it's a more
democratic opportunity for people to have a lot of input as we identify standards for ourselves
[while] we make changes [and] think about our customers and their needs and how can we meet
them. So sometimes it's a group effort, sometimes it is a standard that is set by the library and
sometimes it's things that I've come up with. When measuring performance [when] people may
be falling short [of standards or expectations,] I observe people. I want to be sure that I'm giving
people enough opportunity to perform to standard, so I want to be sure I'm not jumping to
conclusions [and] try to be very measured in my approach. I spend a lot of time thinking about it
and watching and observing and seeing if I’m observing a fluke or more of a pattern. Once I've
determine that there's a pattern, then I’ll address the issue with the person. One example of that
could be someone who's arriving late to work. If this person is arriving 10 to 15 minutes late
every single day, then we have conversation and I'll explain the importance of arriving on time,
ready to work, and the impact on the team [when] other people have to pull [extra work]; it's just
not fair. When possible, I’ll make adjustments to work schedules so that we can have something

311

that meets that person's life better, as much as we possibly can. I’ll work with the person [and]
listen to their side of the story; I’ll say “this is what I've observed, what you think, do you agree,
what’s your point of view,” and then we’ll work together to try to come up with a solution that's
good for both of us. Then I monitor it and follow up on it. Sometimes you just have to draw a
line in the sand, “this is your schedule; this is what we need you to work; if you can't work it,
then I'm sorry but we’ll have to part ways.” So sometimes the person has to make a personal
choice. Then it goes into the performance appraisal. I finally feel confident doing corrective
actions and working with staff who need to work on improving in a specific area. This role had
been something I dreaded in the past and would put it off or even avoid taking necessary steps
for corrective action. I finally learned from others (Human Resources has been a huge help, as
well as my colleagues) that not addressing an issue is not helpful and no one benefits. Talking
with someone who needs to change a specific behavior gives the person the opportunity to
improve and everyone can benefit from the improved behavior or action. You do nobody any
service by ignoring deficient behavior. While it's some of the most difficult conversations we
ever have to have, it's incredibly important that we have those conversations. It takes a lot of
courage; it takes a lot of forethought and a lot of preparation, but it's a conversation that
absolutely has to be had.
[In terms of my management style,] it’s my personality to be more democratic. I am not
a top-down, autocratic manager; I'm a democratic manager. For me to succeed as a manager in
my own head, I need to get the consensus and that democracy behind me, that's just the way I'm
wired. I still feel somewhat uncomfortable making decisions without gaining consensus. [When
I decided to try a] cell phone experiment (letting patrons use cell phones on the first floor with
the lower level a designated Quiet Zone), I talked with Mary and she encouraged me to make the

312

decision to try it as an experiment [instead of working to get everyone to agree first]. [She said
to] explain to staff why we’re doing it, ask them to make observations throughout the trial period
and let them know that in 3 weeks we [would] revisit it and decide what we want[ed] to do in the
future. There was a great deal of trepidation about this experiment and a lot of justified concern
that patrons would be unruly and the first floor would become excessively noisy. At the end of 3
weeks, we decided it was no big deal and concluded it was a non-event. Taking this leap into the
unknown without a lot of staff support has given me confidence to make decisions that impact
the entire staff even without total consensus. It's been a huge success and staff [are] more
willing to try things [and] it’s not a big deal anymore. That was an enormous risk here and to see
that it worked [has] changed people's approach and people are much more open to trying new
[things]. At each of our staff meetings, we’re talking about how we “get to yes,” and people are
now very willing to try something new to “get to yes” and before it was a slower process. They
saw something that was [an] enormous challenge and a huge risk work; so it builds confidence.
It's very important that people make decisions and be encouraged to try new things and
do stimulating new things that they're excited about, Because I'm really passionate about that
whole concept, it’s natural to think how I’m going to make that happen. I make it clear to staff
that [in] trying new things, there will be no penalty; it's not going to be bad on your review; it's
not going to be [that] you’re a lousy employee because what you tried didn't work. So it's an
encouraging process of telling people and assuring people and then demonstrating and
reinforcing it, that it's good to try [and] we’ll just see what sticks and if it doesn’t, no problem. I
think since the time I've been here, the culture has been “let's try new things.” Prior to me, and
I've been here 14 years now, I do believe that there was a culture that there would be penalties if
mistakes happened. In my experience, managing people who have a long-term career here of

313

many years, it's been harder to get them to try new things and accept that there is no negative
consequence if something doesn't work out. If people aren't trusting me to fulfill my promise to
them that there will be no negative repercussions, then they’re going to get burned one time and
that will be the last time they’ll try something creative and something new. So trust is an
essential building block in this process.
[Mainly,] I try to be aware of what's going on systemwide, where the library is going,
what the mission and the vision are, [what] the Strategic Plan is, and then I encourage staff to
read the information where it's presented. We have a lot of discussion time in our staff meetings
so that we can see whether or not the work they are doing is fulfilling the big work of the library.
We tweak things; we make adjustments; we analyze things that we want to start or create in
terms of [whether it] fits the mission, purpose, vision and goals of the library. I have those
conversations individually with staff, through email conversations, [and] in staff meetings where
I'm talking with maybe 12 people. I [also] work closely with the manager of our Customer
Services [area], giving him a lot of latitude and encouraging him to have these conversations
with [his] staff so everybody in the branch is aware of where the library is going and what their
role is to help fulfill that.

G.6.3 Learning

G.6.3.1 Formal
I was extremely fortunate to be selected to represent CLP at the Executive Leadership Institute
(ELI) sponsored by the Urban Libraries Council, [which was] nationwide [with] librarians and
managers from all over the country coming together. This 2-year program was a life-changing
experience. ELI was packed with new experiences, amazing learning and networking
314

opportunities, and fascinating opportunities to learn while working on practical projects that
direct involved my work at CLP, [including working] with another colleague from CLP [to help]
redesign the First Floor [which] we were able to use this project throughout the whole
Leadership Institute. [That] was really helpful because it was such a new approach to library
services that it was helpful to have this [group] to get ideas and feedback from. In addition,
nationally-known speakers and leaders from both the library world and the outside world were
presenters at ELI so the opportunities for learning were limitless. Leaders from all over the
country came and spoke with us; there were authors, politicians, somebody I still watch on the
news giving political commentary… so many resources were brought together so that emerging
leaders would have this type of executive leadership training.

It was just a remarkable

experience; I can't say enough about how thankful I am that I was selected for it. It's even hard
to put it into words after all these years. I learned a lot about my competency and gained a lot of
self-confidence through that; we had to make a lot of presentations; we had to manage the whole
project we were responsible for. I really stretched and grew and became much more aware of
my capabilities. Just the opportunity to interact with so many people in a unique situation in an
off-site area where you were really focused and set up so that we developed really close
relationships with other librarians from around the country [was] very remarkable.

G.6.3.2 Relational
[As part of] ELI, we had an executive coach [who] was a huge influence in my life, personally
and professionally. It was an incredible opportunity to work with an executive coach who
guided and directed and suggested and asked really good questions, so that I could figure out
how to figure out answers. Just knowing the process of how to think through a situation was

315

something that was a really wonderful life skill to learn; she taught that by asking questions, so
she's had a huge impact on my life.
[Also] part of my learning process was by having good managers who taught me by
doing that for me and with me, so I’m modeling [their] behaviors; if you have a good role model,
it makes it easier. So part of the learning process for me is modeling myself after others that I
respect. [At the time,] I was very aware that I had a lot to learn and I wanted to grab as much as
I could from as many people as I could, and so I just watched other people and modeled the
behavior of people I respected and admired. It was easy for me to adapt it; I was open to it; I
wanted to do it; I wanted to learn; I wanted to improve; I wanted to grow and so I was very
receptive and very aware and tried to be very attentive. [Furthermore,] at branch meetings, Mary
had us role-play a variety of situations supervising staff, including corrective actions and dealing
with difficult employee situations. This training was incredibly helpful and I learned so much
from colleagues and how they dealt with challenging situations. [She] also took excerpts from
performance appraisals and showed us how to write effective appraisals.
I read a lot of self-help books, biographies [and] memoirs; I just like to learn about other
people. I’m [also] benefitting from our book discussions at branch meeting and appreciate that
[our supervisor] bought all of us copies of Perfect Phrases for Performance Reviews, Managing
Transitions, and Crucial Conversations. We are assigned a particular number of pages to read
by the next branch meeting and [then] we talk about it. People have been very receptive to it
[and] she chose two excellent titles. I read Managing Transitions when I was in ELI; it was a
life-changer for me. I've adapted a lot of what that said and applied it my personal life and
shared it with lots of other people. So the book discussion group is very rich; I think everybody's

316

really enjoying talking about the books and sharing our experiences, whether personally or
professionally.

G.6.3.3 Being a Mentor
As a result of [my] experience [with Herb], when I mentor, I encourage others to push
themselves, take risks, try new adventures, and ask “how will I feel if I don’t even try?” I also try
to see untapped potential in staff and encourage them to pursue new opportunities and accept
new challenges and responsibilities. I really enjoy mentoring; I like to see what people are able
to do; I like to encourage people; I like to see what people are capable of. It’s something I take a
great deal of satisfaction in. I like working with people and encouraging them to see who they
can be and how I can support people in my role. Right now I'm mentoring [a relatively new
branch manager] and that was a formal assignment that we were both given. What it means is at
the beginning, we had lunch together from time to time and I would listen [to what] she was
going through [as] a new manager. She knows she can pick up the phone and call me at any time
and I will give her 100% of my attention and do my very best to suggest scenarios [and] think
out loud. I’ll do a “what if you did this and what if you did that and how do you think this would
work and how do you think that would work.” I let her test her ideas against me; I let her vent
and talk with me; I let her explore options in a safe environment. She thinks it through and
decides how she needs to act and what she needs to do to move forward. So for me, it's a lot of
listening; it's a lot of being supportive and it's reinforcing the fact that she's doing a great job and
encouraging her and commiserating because we both have very large staffs, so there’s always
something happening. It's being empathetic [and] sympathetic, trying to put options out there

317

[and] maybe opening up new options that, when you're right in the middle of it, you can't see the
options yourself.

G.6.3.4 Self-Awareness and Reflection
I want to do it all. I really enjoy what I do; I enjoy being in the branch [and] working with
people in the branch; I enjoy helping customers. At the same time, I love being a part of what
the system does and I love getting out and going to Main and being in meetings and interacting
with people from all over the system. So it's tough, it really is, because I really just want to do it
all, but that's not realistic. My tendency is to say yes to everything and then I realize that there is
a lot of work involved, that [I’m] either not going to get it done well or I’m going to be really
stressed about it or I'm going to be working a lot longer than what I think is really the
expectations for this job.

So it's a matter of really trying to create priorities.

It's also

understanding that I have a pretty good handle on what I'm able to do in a day or in any week.
When I feel really overwhelmed and like there's no way I can get [it] done, I've learned to step
back and say “well yes, this is doable by Friday; I can get this finished by Friday,” whatever it
might be. So it's been a learning process to recognize what I'm capable of doing and then just
doing it, without stressing over the too-much-work-and-not-enough-time. Mary has also been
extremely helpful because she has helped me understand when I need to say no and what my
most important priorities are, so that I can get that done. I come to her from time to time if I
think I'm overextended and she’ll help me decide what I need to be focusing on and what needs
to be let go.
One of the things that I learned a while ago from Gladys [former head of Main] is the 8020 rule; I tend to want to have everything to be 100% perfect and I found that that's paralyzing

318

and she helped me to recognize that. So now I go with 80-20; if you get 80% of it then go with it
and the other 20 will either go away or will come into place. I tend to be a perfectionist; but I
recognize that that's not doable. Perfection becomes paralysis. So I'm letting go of perfectionism
and letting go of my expectations of staff to be perfect, because getting close is enough often.
That’s something that I still work [on and] one of those learning things that I think is lifelong; [it]
doesn’t have to be perfect; it can be close and still be called proficient.
I'm [also] thankful that CLP has had managers do various personality assessment forms
so we can identify these characteristics in ourselves and say “oh well, this is the why I feel that
way because this is who I am as a person.” [It also helps] to recognize also that others are
different. So I give huge kudos to CLP for having those assessments available to us [because]
it's important to me to be able to identify that I am managing this way and I'm acting and reacting
this way because this is who I am.

G.7

PROFILE FOR LEEANN

G.7.1 Becoming a Manager

I went into libraries to help people and because I love to read. I actually thought I was going to
be a teacher but then I started shelving books at Main when I was a sophomore and I just fell in
love with it. [I knew then] I [was] going to be a librarian. Also I never wanted to work for big
business or anything like that [and with] my people skills, [this] made sense to me. Truthfully, I
was so focused on being a Children's Librarian when I went to grad school that I didn't really
have my head in the management space, at all. I had no idea that I was going to want to move on
319

from that position four years in. I got my school library certification [and] I thought I was going
to do that. Then the economy tanked and it was really hard to get a job after grad school.
Luckily, I’d already fallen in love with the public library environment. I was so excited to work
with kids; that was my calling; I did it and I loved it for years. [So] graduating from library
school, I had no intention of becoming a library manager.
[But] I think it can be easy to pigeonhole people [who] work with certain audiences;
because I’d always worked with children and teens, I was slightly concerned that I wasn't really
getting the whole broad spectrum of experience when it comes to working in a public library.
Because of the roles that I was offered and had taken on in my career, it seemed like leadership
was something that other people saw in me and that I was excited about. I knew to move
forward as a leader, it was important for me to see the whole picture. So that's why I decided I
wanted to explore Adult Services in particular, in addition to management; most of the managers
at CLP are also Adult Services Librarians so the two of them go hand-in-hand. There is a lot of
thought right now being put into Adult Services as a whole [and] I thought I could help with that
work. I [also] feel like I did a lot of work in Children's and Teen Services to move it forward to
a certain point and once I had realized my goals there, I was ready to turn to something new. I
remember talking to someone at PaLA who was a director [who] started in Children’s Services
and she told me that oftentimes she sees people coming from Children's Services and moving up
in leadership because of the kind of skills that you need to work in that environment will serve
you well.
Shortly after I accepted the Children’s and Teen Librarian position at the Homewood
Branch, I was asked to manage the part-time staff and volunteers. At the time, it was pitched to
me as good experience. I was excited that my manager would trust me with that responsibility

320

and took on the opportunity with gusto. I had no training and only had my own manager to look
to as an example. As a manager, people told me when I got this job that the number one thing is
that you always have to remain calm in the face of whatever is being thrown at you at that
moment. I’ll never forget the first time I had a run-in with a part-time Page there. It was when I
had asked her to find some books that were on a shelf list and she said “that’s not in my job
description.” At that moment, I was not calm. I was baffled by it and I know it was because I
was inexperienced. Now I realize that is definitely something that a teenage Page might say to
you; but, at the time, I was just shocked and didn't really have any experience, training or
education around how to manage someone, how one would respond in an instance like that.
However, I do know now that it's totally within reason that if a staff member challenges you on
something to send them home for the day so you can both come back the next day and talk about
it as reasonable individuals without having your emotions up.
I didn’t take any extra steps to prepare myself to manage staff as Coordinator. I don’t
think I knew when I applied for the position as Coordinator that I would have direct reports. It
was clear to me, at the time, that those who I would be coordinating did not formally report to
me. However, after I was hired, I was charged with hiring a direct report as a part of a grant and
that was essentially my first order of business in that position. It was in that position that I felt,
for the first time, the power of having a big idea and [then] inspiring and supporting staff to be
able to achieve that big idea. After accepting the position, my manager at the time gave me two
books on how to write performance appraisals. To prepare for my current position as a branch
manager, I had heard from one of my colleagues that the managers were reading the book
Managing Transitions for a bookclub. I read that in time for the interview and found so much

321

useful information in there in regard to how to prepare and support staff through transitions like
the ones we’re experiencing here at CLP.

G.7.2 Role as Manager

[My primary roles as manager are:] holding staff meetings to be sure we’re all on the same page;
making sure our programs and services respond to community need; creating and maintaining
relationships with community organizations; managing collections; managing part-time and
programming budgets and scheduling. I’m still working on proficiency managing my part-time
budget and the overall schedule for the branch. I feel like we have the minimum number of staff
right now, as I was to hire a part-time clerk as soon as I [started]. A tricky part of the schedule is
making sure a librarian or library assistant is here at least for some part of every day that we’re
open. Admittedly, I’ve already made two scheduling errors. To be able to learn how to manage
this, I’ve talked to a colleague and learned that he uses Google calendar to organize his schedule.
This seems to work really well, so far. I’m hoping that the more I do this, the more comfortable I
will feel with creating a schedule that works for all the staff and the customers.
[Another aspect is] to be patient, be a good listener and follow through. If a staff member
brings an issue to me like “I've had the same desk for 12 years and it's falling apart,” [then] I
need to do something about it. Now, on the whole list of all of the things that I need to get done
as a manager, that is probably way down at the bottom; but for that staff person, that's really
important. They have to sit there every single day, so putting myself in their shoes and making
sure that it gets done no matter the other things that I have to do [is important]. I think
sometimes when you have a long to-do list [and] when other people add things to it, it can be
challenging to prioritize, when it's [clearly] not coming from your boss or leadership.
322

As far as management styles go, the ability to feel comfortable in delegating to people
[is] really important as a manager, specifically when you have a lot of things to get done. It's
easy for us to want to do everything ourselves so that it gets done well and right, but it's also
important for us to recognize that there are very smart, capable, creative people around us and we
need to share that work so that everybody is involved and we’re all moving forward together.
Sue [the Deputy Director] was really the one who [told me as Coordinator] “you don't need to be
running all of these committees anymore; we need to empower the other staff to do this.” It was
the most amazing thing that I've ever done in my career because so much more happened and
everyone was so happy and they were great leaders because of it. It was really amazing to see
that happen.
I am a democratic delegator; I want people to be involved in decisions. I want to know
what they think because I'm only one person with one perspective and I need everyone’s
[opinion] in order for us to make the right decision moving forward. [One thing] that I’ve
thought a lot about is [when] you have a job that needs done and [you] ask people in a meeting to
volunteer, I’ll get the same three people every time, every project. That's not fair obviously to
the group but it's also that the people who are not speaking up have great strengths that we’re not
utilizing. I’ve [also] seen managers have favorites and they choose a particular few because they
know that they can handle it. I didn't like either of those ways of doing things, so when I need to
manage a project or solve a problem, I look at the resources that I have: ie., my people. I see
what their strengths are and then I go to them individually and I say “hey, this needs done; this is
why it needs done; I think you would be good at it because of XYZ so this is what's going to
happen.” You’re complementing them while giving them more work to do, and I have found it to
be extremely successful.

323

Mary [my supervisor] is incredible. I had a good relationship with her before I got this
job. Her door is always open; I feel comfortable calling her when I need to [and] I feel
comfortable telling her anything. We meet monthly now [but] when I first started in May, we
met every week for 12 weeks. I’d have my write-up of everything that happened that week and
all the things I wanted to talk about [and] we talked through it. She [also] went through all the
policies with me again because [as] an administrator before, this was a different viewpoint on it.
I think her style probably varies a little depending on what people need from her as far as all the
branch managers. [In general,] I want her to support me, to back me up; if something's not going
to happen, be real, I can take it. I think she expects me to maintain the energy that I've had thus
far for CLP. This has been a really interesting transition for me, because as Coordinator, you're
more in the business-y role, the kind of role that I was avoiding by becoming a public librarian.
Now that I'm back in the community, I tell Mary every time I see her how happy I am. So I
would think she would expect me to appreciate that happiness and bring with it the power to do
good things. I [also] think [she] expects me to keep in mind the systemwide perspective that I
had in my last position because [as] a big system thinker, [it involved] a lot of project
management, moving people around [and] accomplishing goals.

So with the way the

organization is moving now with [much] of our work being done on that level, I think she
expects me to be leading by example being an advocate for this new work that is sometimes
uncomfortable for people who are steadfast.

G.7.3 Challenges

G.7.3.1 Age and Former Colleagues

324

When I was a Children’s and Teen Librarian, I was at a branch for four years and was in charge
of managing part-time staff and the volunteers. It was a really interesting experience for me
particularly because I was managing people who were maybe four or five years younger than me
and someone who was 30 years older than me. I had to find my place and understand how to
guide people without offending them. When someone is a teenager and you’re 22 trying to
manage for the first time, I think there were some pitfalls that I fell into because of that; whereas
managing someone who was a senior who had retired as a branch manager, I could learn a lot
from her. I'm a people person and I'm used to making friends, so negotiating that was strange.
Then moving into the Coordinator role where I was going to be facilitating and managing people
who were my peers before, other Teen Librarians, that was an interesting parallel too. It’s
something I've continued to think about.
I think I was [also] surprised the most by the importance I discovered of not being friends
with my staff and by how tough it would be to manage previous colleagues. This was difficult. It
was difficult because, before I was in my last position as Coordinator, I used to be colleagues
with the staff members who I was charged to coordinate. Additionally, I think I was also
surprised by the amount of serious detail-oriented deliberation and planning I would need and
want to put in before having a tough conversation with a staff member. Finally, I think I was the
most surprised by how fast people began to look up to me as Coordinator, how viscerally I could
feel that and how no one really wanted to sit next to me or go to lunch with me anymore. I think
most public-service librarians are people people; you want to make friends and be nice to
everyone and it's hard to step into a management role after you've already been friends or
colleagues with someone. I remember saying to Georgene ([a former] Children's Services
Coordinator) “no one wants to go to lunch with me after the meeting anymore” and she's like

325

“yup, that's how it is; we go to lunch together now.” That was really tough to get used to at first,
but then it's part of the job. I'm not here to make friends; I'm here to move us all forward in the
same direction. I'm much more comfortable with that role now.
I'm getting older [and] I'm not 22 anymore but it's [still] important for me to be aware of
[my age]. I had an interview for [the head of a] Main Library in [a southern library system] last
year. It was an amazing experience; they flew me down there [and later] they offered me the job.
At the end of my interviews, I always ask a tough question: “Is there anything about me as a
candidate that you feel reservations about that you want me to address?” The Deputy Director
said “well, you're pretty young, so how would you feel about managing people much older than
you?” So just him asking that is an example of the fact that it's always just been something that
I've had to deal with. [In general,] I feel like I’ve grown up, realized it and been aware of it. [I]
have made a concerted effort not to go to that place with people anymore. [Instead,] it’s all
about me and the way I project myself. I'm definitely managing two people who are older than
me and I'm confident [as] the leader of this branch. It’s different than when I was 22 and I didn't
know what I was doing. I have experience and I feel more confident [and] proficient [which has]
helped. I heard a TED talk once [that said] “it's not fake it till you make it; it's fake it until you
are it.” [In the past,] I think it was kind of odd being in a role of authority. I had not done that
before and it was weird.

G.7.3.1 Supervising Staff
[Elements of supervising are] monitoring, coaching, and supporting staff performance to be sure
staff are working to the best of their ability [while] ensuring their work promotes the library
mission. [In evaluating staff,] I feel pretty confident in my ability to write performance reviews

326

and off-the-cuff kudos for staff. The STAR-AR [mechanism for how to provide feedback] class
at the Leadership Institute organized by CLP helped me a lot when it comes to writing more
informal kudos to staff. The point that really came across for me was to not only say, “Good
Job!” but [also] why it was a good job. It seems so simple but it’s an easy thing to forget.
When I first started this job, [a former supervisor] said to me “what you need to do as
soon as you start is have a reverse expectations meeting.” So I had one of those with each of the
staff and it was just incredible to hear from each of them the different qualities that they were
looking for in me. [They were] general, idealistic and philosophical: “I want you to be a leader; I
want you to respect me; I want you to listen to me…” Everybody had a different list but when
you put it all together, it totally made sense. It's all about backing them up no matter what it is,
whether it's a customer or whether they need a new desk or if they want some money for a
program. I have very high expectations and I think that's because the people that I've looked up
to in the library world have high expectations. I have found it to be a challenge of mine to
maintain rapport and good standing with everyone while also making sure that people are rising
to my expectations [while] also being realistic.

So if they're sitting back and having a

conversation for 10 minutes about the hockey game last night, am I really going to be like “go
shelve those books; what are you doing?” I want them to shelve the books but also I want them
to love their job and to feel good about coming here and have a relationship with their
coworkers. Staff morale is really important to me. I've seen situations before where staff morale
is affected for whatever reason and I just don't want that to happen at my location. Everyone is
happy and they love their jobs and I want to keep that going, while at the same time, encouraging
everyone to get better. So I think what I've done so far is book end constructive criticism with
positive reinforcement.

327

Early on while learning to supervise staff, I learned that people could sometimes be
prickly or even hostile when corrected, told to do something or presented with a change in
process or approach. As a new-ish supervisor, I was floundering on how to address these types
of behaviors. Now, after reading Crucial Conversations with the branch managers, I react
differently to these challenges, but at the time I was uncertain how to proceed. So, first, I talked
to my mentors and HR about what I was experiencing to be sure I wasn’t misinterpreting
anything and to get ideas on how to have those tough conversations. I also learned to literally
write out exactly what I was going to say in the particular situation so I could be sure that I was
framing the issue in a light that showed I wanted the person to succeed in his/her goals and that I
wasn’t just damning the person and the situation.
I’ve [also] had my first surprise as a branch manager. I am finding there is a tricky
balance between supporting staff in their own decisions, interpretations of policy and “getting to
yes” in fulfilling a customer need [which can result in conflict between a customer and staff
person.] I had a manager not defend me in a situation like this before and felt hurt by it [and] I
didn’t want to do that. [In this particular situation,] I told [the customer] that I knew [the staff
member] cared about customer service and surely didn’t mean any offense, but that I would talk
to [the staff member]. I [talked with the staff person about] what happened and [heard that
perspective]. I expressed our need to “get to yes” with customers and [how to balance that] in
terms of resources. In regards to [the] attitude [the customer referred to], I told [the staff
member] that I thought he misinterpreted [the] facial cues and that he/she should take a break for
a minute. Walking to the bus stop after this interaction, I [worried] that the staff [would] think I
won’t back them up in situations like this. But, then, I think that maybe they’re pleased by how I
handled it because I helped restore peace. [So I spoke to another manager and they] made me

328

feel better about my decision at the time and was clear in expressing that this would hardly be
my only opportunity to show my staff I support their decisions. You know what’s funny? The
[staff member] emailed me that night and thanked me for debriefing directly afterward, made
clear he/she was committed to “getting to yes,” that his/her brain just “hiccupped because the
patron became so upset so quickly” and that I was “the calm in the storm.”
[Another area I’m working on is how] you have to let people figure things out for
themselves a bit. I don't want my staff to come to me with an idea and be really excited and me
say “we tried that already; that's been done before; it failed; you can’t do it because of XYZ.”
You need to give people some room to figure that out on their own [and] that can be really hard
to do. Situations managing this balance can range from programming ideas to doing work (such
as grants or marketing) that is really the role of support departments with staff input. Because of
my previous work as a systemwide coordinator, I am well-versed in these types decisions that
can have systemwide and organizational implications. [So] I have this knowledge and I want to
take their excitement and be happy about it and use that power, but I also want to temper it a
little bit because I want the staff to know it might not be the ideal situation that they think it is. I
want them to bring these thoughts and ideas to the table but at the same time, I have information
that I know may not be well-received; it's a tricky dance because I don't want the staff to think
that I am super negative and crashing down ideas.
As I’ve been learning how to handle these types of situations and manage the balance
better, there’s a part of me that feels like some of this is evident based on the fact that we work in
a large organization that has support departments. However, I have learned to take responsibility
for a situation where I have not explicitly told someone that we don’t handle X (whatever the
issue is) because I want them to know that I am not perfect in every situation either. [As part of

329

my learning curve,] I’m better at making sure that documentation is there both on what I
explicitly have told them as well as when something goes wrong. So I can’t assume anything
regarding what they know or what they do because I'm ultimately responsible for it whether or
not I was involved in their decision-making process. I do feel like I keep an open door and I
make time for each of the staff to talk to me monthly so I'm just going to maintain that rapport
and relationship and hope that people continue to bring things to the table when they need to.
Don't assume, that's my lesson.

G.7.4 Identity

[In general,] I wear my heart on my sleeve sometimes so it's hard for me to take a step back,
[but] I do take a step back and am more professional about things. I said to my staff [at] our first
meeting together that the mission of this library is really important to me -- free to the people,
engage our community in literacy and learning. That's what we’re here for, every interaction,
every time you unlock that door in the morning, that is at the heart of the work that we’re doing
and I believe in it. Having that as our guiding force, equalizing information access for people no
matter where they come from, that is powerful; that's why I'm here; that's why I don’t mind
getting up every day and going to work. I think [my staff] were really excited to hear that from
me because not a whole lot of the staff interact with [or] really talk in that big [picture] way
about the work that we’re doing -- outside of Mary Frances [the Director], Sue and Mary.
[When I was Coordinator,] I sat in an office for the last four years thinking about that, doing a lot
of the theoretical and administrative work with that goal in mind. So to move from that to
actually working with the community and managing a staff who are getting that work done, it's
incredible; that's why we’re doing the work that we do. I’m also really interested in the aspect of
330

[gender in management] because obviously our profession is mainly female and I don't
necessarily see that in other arenas of managerial work and businesses and such, so I just find it
to be fascinating. I told one of my friends recently that I manage all men (most of my full-time
staff are men) and I'm not used to working with men. I said that to him and he's in the business
world and he said “all my favorite managers were women” and I was like “really;” he said “yeah,
you listen; you actually care about how I feel about things.” I just find it to be an interesting
aspect of being a manager in a public library.

G.7.5 Learning

I've taken a couple of workshops, professional development opportunities, in meeting
facilitation. I got so much out of learning about things like the power of the pen, understanding
how important it is for you to be reflecting exactly what people are saying to you in a meeting so
that you don't offend anyone, and checking in making sure that you understand what people
mean.

[I also] observed Nicole (consultant CLP hired to manage our strategic planning

process), [along with] having a lot of practice, practice, practice. I ran at least a meeting a day for
four years in my last position. A lot of building knowledge, skills, and behaviors in regard to
running a meeting came from simply doing it so much. Reading Crucial Conversations as a
branch manager has also reminded me how important it is to set up an environment and climate
where staff feel comfortable sharing, no matter how controversial their opinions may be. [Also,
in library school] when you think about all the group work that we did, I think I started to see in
myself the tendency to not sit back but to raise my hand and speak up and lead a group. That's
100% the skills I needed as Coordinator [as well as] now.

331

I think you can be proficient and not be confident at the same time; however, you have to
fake confidence to be proficient sometimes. I have always been terrified when it comes to public
speaking, when it comes to doing a speech. I will raise my hand in class and talk for seven
minutes but when it comes to something that's really formal [where] I have a podium, a
PowerPoint, or book talking in grad school, that definitely made me sick. I had to do so much of
it as the Coordinator… I did a session at PLA [where] there were 300 people in the room; I did a
presentation for the Board; I did a presentation at the quarterly managers meeting. It was at least
once a month where I would have something I would have to do. I never loved it; maybe the last
time I spoke I was like “okay, I'm good, I can do this.” Previous to that, I was not excited about
it; I did not feel good about it. I knew that I could do it and I did it well because people told me
that but it took me a long time to get there and it was part of the reason why I wanted to move
on. Personally, I don't really feel like I've aced something unless I feel confident and if I was
excited about doing public speaking, felt super confident about it as a thing I was going to go do,
then I probably would have felt like I was proficient and wanted to keep doing that job.

G.7.5.1 Mentors, Peers, and Others
As issues came up that I needed advice on, in regards to managing, I talked to my mentors:
Georgene, Mary, Sheila and later, Sue. I found their very different management styles to be
super helpful in all the situations I brought to them for advice and feedback. I’ve [also] gleaned
the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to supervise staff by observing my previous and current
managers [and] talking with my mentors about specific issues or areas I need to address. [For
example,] when I took on Teen Services, it was a few people doing all of the work and I was one
of them. I reported to Sue at that time and she said to me “we cannot move forward like this; we

332

need to share this work out; we have some great people here” and that's when I started a number
of committees for all of the projects that I had previously been managing and I named chairs for
all of them [with] a succession plan. It was a lot more structured that way but people still had a
say and I got so much more done and I credit Sue for that because she empowered me to do it.
As a librarian sometimes, you want to be a perfectionist as a manager, as anyone, you want to do
it yourself because you know you're going to do a great job, but you have to let go of some of
that power and let people around you rise up.
I've loved all of my managers at CLP and I've also learned a lot by thinking about the
things that I wish they would have done better, so that has been helpful. Sheila [a former
supervisor] has her “no surprises,” [maxim]. She wants to know what's going on [which] is
ultimately related to the fact that no matter what, she is responsible for whatever happens in the
library so she needs to know what's going on, [as do I now that I’m the manager]. [However,] I
had a [previous] manager who [took] a customer [complaint] about me when I was right there
and [the manager] did not back me up and it hurt my feelings because I felt like I was being
completely professional. It would've been really easy for her to say something like “I'm sure
LeeAnn didn't mean anything by that” or something like that. So that's an example of something
that’s happened to me personally, professionally that I still think about today.
My formal mentor now is Chris who manages [a large branch] and he’s incredible. I’ll
go to him [for things like] “I have all this money left in my part-time budget and I’m going on
vacation; is it okay to increase everyone's hours; what you think?” And he'll say “well, I think it
would be fine but you might want to check with Mary because she might be counting on that
surplus to cover something else.” That's an example of one of things that I brought to him, so I

333

always try to touch base with him before I talk to Mary about something because then I have
someone else's opinion on my level.
In my previous role, it was a little different because there weren’t as many of us as there
are in the branch manager position. I feel like I have a peer group now. I [am having a] struggle
with the youth behavior [in my branch so] I went on SLACK (we have a private branch manager
channel) and I said “I know this is ironic, me saying this, but I'm having a real hard time with
these kids; does anybody have any advice?” Instantly three people chimed in to talk to me about
it, so I feel a lot better now than I did before.

G.7.5.2 Research and Reading
Mary had us read the book Crucial Conversations which was essentially about how to manage
those tense situations that I've already experienced as a manager. I think it relates back to how I
reacted to that Page when I was 22; it's like these books are really detail-oriented and very
intentional. It's easy when you're in a high stress situation to just shoot from the hip, but I think
books like we've been reading just help you to step back and think deliberately about a situation
and how it should be handled at a time when you're not right in the middle of it. [It] can be
molded depending on where you are at that moment, because sometimes the theoretical answer
you’ll get in Crucial Conversations isn't really going to work, but it's helpful; it's another tool.
[I also research issues I encounter; for example,] I’m in a space right now where I'm
researching more about realistic responses to negative youth behavior in the public library space.
Obviously, I talked a lot about that in my last job because that was my work. It's been difficult
because there's always a theoretical response to something and then there's boots-on-the-ground
Yes, in theory, you would get all the teens in the same room together and give them pizza and

334

talk about the rules that you want in the library to make it a safe space for all; but you know,
when there's twelve surly 16-year-olds staring at you in the library space, it can be really tense
and difficult to get that together. So I've been looking into blogs and things like that right now to
try to get real-life examples from managers.

That's definitely something that I have been

researching lately in relation to being the manager. I also don't have a security guard, so I am the
disciplinarian of this space; and coming from a children and teen background, that can be really
difficult. I've always been the one to create the relationships with the kids and someone else had
to tell them to take their feet off the chair. I walked up to a kid yesterday and wanted to say hi to
him because I [don’t] always want to be in this negative space when we talk and he said “oh, I
forgot I was in the library because you didn't yell at me today.” I’m like “great,” but it's a reallife thing (though I don’t really yell at them) and Mary is helping me through this transition,
empowering me to make decisions based on the good of everyone who uses the library.

PROFILE FOR MADISON

G.8.1 Career/Becoming a Manager

My former career included managing an independent gift store for 12 years. Most of those years,
I worked side by side with the owner in an intensely customer-service-oriented environment.
When the owner became ill, I took on more responsibility and after he died, I ran the store for a
new absentee owner. I didn't have a college degree when I had that job. After a mid-career
return to college to complete my BA, I moved across the country for [the] University of
Pittsburgh’s MLIS program, which I chose in large part because I could complete my master’s
335

degree in one calendar year. During the final semester, I interned at CLP-Main, and at the end of
the term, my manager created a part time position for me. I worked 10 hours per week for the
next year. [In library school,] I didn't know I wanted to be a manager. What would've been
helpful for me is a component in the introductory's semester class that everybody takes, just a
lecture spent on what it means, what management is, why it's important, and how you might be
interested in it even if you've never thought about it before.
[F]ull-time jobs are rare here, and I moved to Chicago a year after graduating for fulltime work.

[It] was in the Ready Reference Department where they put new hires and it was

boring; and of course, you obviously blame yourself when you're bored in a job, but I could just
see that it was going to be a while before I could move into a position that was going to engage
me more fully. After I was in Chicago for two months, two full-time First Floor [popular
materials] Librarian positions opened so I applied for both of them and I got one. My husband
and I had been very happy here for two years, and though it was enormously expensive to move
back, we did it. [I considered it a] dream job in the sense it was the city we wanted to live in and
I knew the job already, so I was confident that I would fit well.
My decision to become a librarian did not include dreams of management work. It just
never occurred to me; I didn't think about the fact that there were librarian-managers. I assumed
that management in the library meant that you completely gave up working with the public and
went to meetings all day and did strategic planning. That's not the case here at least. I would not
have applied for my management position if a staff member of the department hadn’t urged me
to. At least six months before the job became available, he told me his manager was planning to
retire. I spent those months preparing to apply. It was just a step up, better salary and I had
learned what it meant to do those jobs working under those managers, where there is a public

336

service element [and] they're still doing some librarian work. That was appealing. I worked
harder to prepare my application and get ready to interview than I’ve ever done in the past. In
order to learn as much about the position as possible, I interviewed employees within the
department as well as the retiring manager. I listened to any talk about the institution I happened
upon. I read about and studied the history of the library, practiced interviewing, and compiled a
portfolio. I dug into the department’s extensive web presence, printed pages, took notes. I began
to read New York Times management columns, checked out management books, and formulated
a management style.
[Becoming a manager] involved an element of uncertainty and leap of faith. If I had been
offered the First Floor manager job, I would have thought initially that that was going to be a
more guaranteed fit for me because that was the department in which I worked. So the fact that I
was hired to work in an entirely new department, a subject specialty that I didn't have experience
in, there's just an enormous amount of learning that I'm still working on but I feel very supported
by the staff who I manage. It's been a really good experience and a different sort of challenge
than if I had stayed on the First Floor, in a good way. Part of what's rich about my current
position is that it involves my avocation as well as my vocation [as] drawing on ties to the
Pittsburgh community in my library work adds richness to my life.
I waited to attempt applying for this position until I was 50. I had my master’s degree, I
had done all the educational groundwork, and I felt comfortable. I was ready for this job, I
convinced the people who were hiring to hire me, and I'm happy here. I don't think there's
anything else I would've done to prepare. I can't imagine being thrown into this position 20
years ago. I would not have been ready. I'm not planning to apply for a higher management

337

position at this time, though who knows. I'm learning more about what those jobs entail and
they’re more interesting than I ever expected them to be.

G.8.2 Role as Manager

[My main role as a manager is to] identify and understand current community needs as they
relate to my department, anticipate and advocate for future needs, represent CLP/my department
to the community my department serves, evaluate success of my own efforts and the efforts of
the department I manage (including collection development, customer service, programming,
outreach), PEFA [Patron Experience Focus Areas] and other committee work, allocate human
and financial resources. [Also I] provide feedback, [as well as] write and give performance
evaluations. I’m comfortable and successful in giving day-to-day feedback, in the moment as
situations arise and require my input or intervention. What’s harder for me is [the] formal
evaluation. I’m working on this by keeping written notes during the entire year. I add notes to
each staff member’s personal file. I’ve [also] started to include specific examples of positive
feedback in our department monthly reports. My manager writes beautiful evaluations. I use
them as models for mine. When evaluations season rolls around again, I’ll look for books and
articles to inspire and instruct.
[I’m also the] communication point person for my department. I’m in the middle of a
web connecting the library’s administration, my fellow managers, staff in other departments at
all levels, and patrons too. This role is at the top of my list of priorities. I spend more time than I
ever dreamed, refining information from upper management to pass to my staff. Instead of
sending an email, I often get up from my desk and walk to other departments to talk with fellow
managers and librarians face-to-face. I believe this helps knit departments together, break down
338

silos, and ultimately helps the library run more smoothly. My staff tell me they appreciate being
listened to. We have staff meetings every other week, which I started scheduling at the beginning
of this year. They love having a consistent forum for sharing highs and lows, airing frustrations,
and making plans as a group. I'm the link for my department. I get to be outside of my
department more than the others -- attending meetings with people from other departments and
branches, from clerks all the way to the highest administration. I strive to be the pivot point in
terms of communication. [One communication challenge is around a new internal tool called]
SLACK, [which has] 30 [or] more channels; if I have it open on my computer, then any new
message written pops up and that's actually helpful for me because I can glance at it and I'm
either interested or not and it helps me remember that I need to pay attention to SLACK. On the
other hand, those 30+ channels are full of hundreds of ideas flying around and I often go a whole
week without looking at SLACK, because you could spend all day reading and responding.
Coping with all these ideas flying around is a challenge. I want to be aware but I also want to get
my work done.
[As a manager, I’m] leading staff into the future. I lead a team of specialists who average
18 years of service to this department [and] they began careers as librarians in a pre-digital era.
In order to successfully expedite the change that is happening in the library world, make it
relevant, palatable, and even exciting, I plan, encourage, support, listen, and nudge. Leading
change is mostly a matter of prioritizing. It’s easy to get caught up in daily work that supports
the status quo, and harder to make time for long-range planning for innovation. It’s good to keep
a list of goals, but don’t expect to accomplish everything at once. In addition to revising the
order of large goal priorities, I’ve learned to be flexible on a daily basis. I keep my to-do list

339

handy and expect that every day unexpected demands on my time will entail a reworking of that
list.
[Occasionally,] I feel like the department Mom.

Managing seems to have a lot in

common with parenting (although I’m not a parent) -- supporting staff, cheering them on,
listening to them vent, suggesting improvements [and] being patient as they get used to the idea
of change. Because I am older than my colleagues, I naturally took on a sort of maternal role
where I'm a generation older than many of my colleagues and they look to me for life knowledge
[and], in my role as manager, I'm very much drawing on life experience.
I work the Reference Desk a couple of hours a day [and] as a subject specialist, I need to
know how to help patrons. To talk intelligently about the department, I also need to know what
we have to offer [and] the strength of our collection. I do work two or three weekend days a
month when I'm on the desk all day, or when there's vacation; our staff has a ton of vacation
because they've been here so many years, so I do work the desk quite a bit. I felt like a fraud at
the beginning, and still sometimes a library patron will walk up when I'm at the desk and ask me
a question and I know that all my colleagues know what the person is referring to and I have no
idea. I just have to be humble and tactful and ask for help; it’s a whole world that I don't have
much experience in, and so that keeps me interested, for sure.
Patrons, staff, and upper management assert their right to my time and I must be flexible.
I’ve had to change the way I evaluate my accomplishments. I serve my staff, patrons, and
superiors, and if I don’t get to accomplish everything I set out to do, I’m still successful if I
[have] connected with the people who count on me. Sometimes, though, I'm my own priority or
I would never get anything done.

340

G.8.2.1 Attributes and Beliefs
Because I have a positive feeling about my work, the thing that I value the most in a leader, and
what I try to bring to my team, is support. I am naturally inclined to care about the people I work
with. I’m a cheerleaderly sort of person, cheerful, and well-liked. I believe in modeling and
reinforcing desired behavior. This sets up a supportive environment in which corrective action is
comparatively easy to give and receive. A boss once said to me “you know, you're a quick
study, you pay close attention to what’s going on around you.” And I think one reason why I
was hired is that I talk to people in all departments, including other branches. I’m just out there,
I have my feelers out, I listen hard, I eavesdrop because I want to know. When I took this job, I
decided to make a policy for myself of being as straightforward as I can be. I'm a pleaser; I think
a lot about the fact that I'm female and what that means as a manager. I think it can be harder for
women, if they're the kind of person I am, who wants to please all the time.

G.8.3 Challenges

G.8.3.1 Navigating the Organization
CLP is a big ship and turning it takes a long time, and nothing happens except through the
institutional chain of command. I was energetic, enthusiastic, and eager to makes changes when I
began this job two years ago. I wrote proposals for reconfiguring our reference desk set-up and
location. After the first year [when] nothing came of my plan, I wasn’t sure who to ask about it.
So I asked one of the heads of facilities, who told me that he’d be happy to make the changes as
soon as he got the word through the proper chain of command. Waiting for years for change
gives ample opportunity for reconsideration. Now I’m not so sure about my plan to change
locations.
341

[Another example is] there's a big staff office with 10 desks and it had been in its
configuration when I arrived in this position for 12 years and it needed to be changed, even just
to vacuum thoroughly. I could see that there [was] a better way to arrange this office. But it
took months; it was like pulling teeth. We finally did it and it's better now and everybody's glad
that we did it; but my God, it was so hard. “Why would we want to change it? It’s working
fine…” and that's a metaphor for the entire world of librarianship.
I’m still energetic, enthusiastic, and eager for change, but more realistic now. That
transition took time -- a year, a year and a half. I felt antsy and frustrated for that length of time
and it's important to learn to become realistic and accepting, but it's also important to hang on to
the idealism and [the] dream of change. I came back [a few weeks ago] from [a] meeting of the
public service managers with my notes and then I had a staff meeting right afterward and I
reported on what we talked about. My staff, who have worked for CLP anywhere from 7 to 37
years, said “we've been talking about this forever; this is not new.”

What do I do with that

information? Okay, well on the one hand, that's kind of depressing; on the other hand, I still feel
hopeful and optimistic and I'm going to try to forget that they said that. Optimism is easy to lose
that I'm surprised when I don't see more evidence of cynicism in my colleagues who have been
here for a long time. There’s so much weight to the ship and I just wonder how can you work
here for years and years and not become disheartened, but there's got to be a way to remain
positive.
One tool I use is to carry around one notebook all the time. It's almost full and it's two
years old, but that way I can go back and see what I was thinking by the lists I made or the notes
I took so I don't forget what's important, what was important a year ago [and] I can try again,
because I still want to shake things up. [For example,] there may be a bigger overarching plan

342

for the Main Library, [so] rather than my saying “let's move the reference desk ten feet over,” I
understand that we are going to have some money to spend on a Main renovation of some sort in
the next couple of years. [Now] I can go back and see what my ideas were and think through
them again and get lots of input from staff. But it's a balancing act.

G.8.3.2 Strategic Plan and the Future
I don’t feel I have the background to anticipate future needs. Working to ID and understand
current needs is overwhelming enough. [As part of] leadership, there’s the day-to-day running of
a department and that is a fairly defined list of elements, but I think the thing that surprised me
was being asked to plan a strategy for the librarian in the 21st century. That was not part of my
LIS education in the least. So trying to figure out how to make my department relevant in the
new world, I'm being called upon to lead that and that's more challenging for me than the kind of
day-to-day “people skills,” keeping everybody communicating and relatively challenged and
happy. I feel confident about that, but how to find a new audience? That’s a huge question and
important, but I feel at times inadequate or like I need more support.
I [also] feel challenged by how to communicate the success of changes we’ve made since
I became the manager of this department. Increased outreach, for instance, doesn't necessarily
result in our circulation going up but it might eventually, and I don't know how to get the word
out that we’re doing these new initiatives. I don't really know how to evaluate that except in
terms of circulation, people through the door; it's easy to report that we spoke to 800 people at
outreach events this summer. I know how to count numbers, encounters; but how do you
evaluate or document relationships? We’re building relationships with our customers [but] that's

343

nebulous and I don't think any manager here has the answer to that yet; we're all trying to figure
that out.
The Strategic Plan has been a big focus of meeting time and effort coming from
administration, and every staff member at CLP has been invited to participate. [I try] to give
every staff member the opportunity, and push them to participate in the Strategic Planning
process, just to say “we’ll divide up the work of the Department a little differently” or even
temporarily, if that's what's required, so that each person can have the freedom, the time. [But]
as part of the library’s strategic goals, there’s often more information swirling around me than I
can act on. Pertinent information from the not-for-profit world is ubiquitous. I’ve taken on
responsibility that I'm not necessarily confident in my ability to lead because of lack of
experience, such as co-facilitating a working group in the first year of the Strategic Planning
process. It was hard and I was a little out of my element. After six months when it was over, the
comfort level that I achieved being a meeting leader was wonderful. I lead staff meetings for my
own department which I was far more comfortable doing and again, feeling like a fraud at the
beginning and then realizing, “well there's actually not that much to this, take a deep breath, you
don't have a little sign on your back that says ‘fraud…’”

G.8.4 Identity

I love working for this venerable institution, with its grand architecture and reputation as THE
Carnegie Library. This organization is old and well-respected and we've done great work for
100+ years and I don't want anyone on my staff to feel like they're not doing a good job
continuing the tradition. I feel so privileged to have the job I have. I get teary talking about it;
it's a gift and I walk around this building that was one of the first Carnegie libraries. This is still
344

an amazing building and it’s dreamy to be here, and I just want to do the best job I can and live
up to the Carnegie’s reputation. I [also] think that this process with you [the researcher] has
helped me analyze what I'm doing and will help me with my goals for next year, so I appreciate
the opportunity to talk about myself. It's not something that I like to do; I'm a much better
listener and asker of questions.

G.8.5 Supervising Staff

I want [my staff] to be really good librarians and, to me, the first duty is to our patrons with
whom we’re face-to-face. I'm trying to go slowly and lead by example, but I'm a really friendly,
smiley person and some of the people I work with are not, though they are not unfriendly, only
on the other end of the spectrum of outgoingness. I'm not going to have a meeting and say “okay
by December 31, you're going to be like me,” that's not realistic. They’re also really good at
other aspects of the job. Meeting the patron’s needs, that's Job 1 for my staff and that's my
highest expectation. [Along with] the patron “getting to yes” concept, my expectation would be
for the staff to be willing to try new things, which I am also leading by example, and it's
working.
[However,] the First Floor really is aiming for the outgoing, retail-oriented approach and
they are stepping up their act making it even more “HI!” There are other departments where the
customer walks in and no one looks up; my department, I believe, leans more toward the First
Floor than the other way. I feel pressure to change, to be more like the First Floor, [but] we have
far less traffic in our department than the First Floor does. So when we’re out working with the
collection, say, I've been instructing, encouraging [them] to engage the patrons when we’re away
from the desk. [But] I think I need to turn that into a concrete, SMART goal for 2015 [with]
345

some way to measure it, because the way I've been leading that is not producing enough change
quickly enough. I think in order to make it happen more effectively, it needs to be documented
and accountable.
I've instigated every-other-week staff meetings, which the department didn't have for
years; they had no regularly scheduled staff meetings, and we’re small enough that we all talk
amongst ourselves everyday all week long, but it’s still helpful to go to room that's designated
for an hour. They’re really happy [and] they tell me how great it is that I keep them in the loop,
that they feel like the communication is working as far as me bringing to them what I learn
outside of the department. I [also] spend a lot of time on email and expect them to read it and
they do. I try to be careful to not bombard them [and] use email as smartly as possible because
nobody wants to feel like they’re wasting their time. There have been times in the last year that
has been stressful as we try to figure out how to implement change in the department, but we
keep talking about it and trying new things.
[When] I notice a behavioral issue or a patron interaction that I wish had gone differently,
I want to address that ASAP. It’s the same strategy of not waiting until the end of the year review
to deal with problems; you’ve got to nab it right now while the issue is fresh. So I use my own
observations and then deal with things immediately so there's not a cloud hanging over the
department. Staff come to me when they have problems with each other and I say “okay, shall
we bring the third person in and we’ll all have a conversation or do you want me to talk to that
person? I'm going to have to say that you told me because how else would I know since I wasn't
there.” Immediately dealing with this sort of issue has worked very well and it's not easy, but I
think it's my age and maturity that allows me to know from experience that waiting can only
make things worse. [When things don’t go as I expect them to,] I’m not afraid to say, or maybe I

346

am afraid, but I still make myself say “look, here’s how you might have done it differently” and
sometimes the individual is completely unaware. And sometimes I'll see something that didn't
go quite the way that I wanted it to go and I'll let it go, and if it happens again, then I'll address it.
You have to judge and keep mental or actual notes. I will [also] make a point to have, in front of
that staff person, an interaction with the customer in a way that I think is better and then maybe
afterwards say something [and have] a teaching moment. I would rather [offer tips] and slowly
build [because] we’re not in a huge hurry here. Potentially we’re going to be working together a
long time, and I will [continue] to keep it positive.

G.8.6 Learning

G.8.6.1 Relational
[My supervisor] has been a great coach for me.

When I started as the manager of this

department, I not only had to learn to be a manager of a library department, but I also had to
learn to be a subject specialist. Although I had the background and the education, I had not been
that sort of librarian. She has been great at suggesting where I put my energy, saying “spend your
first year becoming a power-user of your own department.” I said “okay great, thank you,”
[because] that was extremely freeing. [She’s] also been my tutor for learning about how library
budgeting works for collections and payroll and things like that. At our yearly review meetings,
she's very cheerleaderly too, and she struggles to find something to tell me that I need to improve
on.
[Along with my supervisor, I make] full use of my network of fellow managers who I go
to whenever I am puzzled, frustrated, bewildered, or just plain stuck. Sometimes it’s easier to
learn from my peers, because I don’t feel the pressure of appearing to understand something I
347

haven’t grasped yet. I think that the Main managers meet twice a month for 2 1/2 hours is a very
bonding experience. I try to be humble; I don't try to pretend that I know things that I don't
know; I'm just willing to say “you know what, I don't know.” I'll ask any of the managers for
help [or] advice. They almost all have more experience than I do and I think they appreciate that
and it helps me tremendously. I have lunch pretty regularly with two of my fellow managers and
we remind ourselves that we can talk about things other than the library but we mostly end up
talking about the library and I find it so helpful.
[Regarding figuring out future needs], the only [other] way forward I know is to read
widely, talk with colleagues (my staff, other librarians and managers inside and outside of our
library system) participate in learning opportunities, and ponder deeply about what I believe and
intuit.

I pay attention to the work of managers in other libraries, attend conferences and

webinars, read Library Journal and other library publications, blogs and websites. I [also] read
management articles and books from the greater world of non-profits and general business. A
favorite is the “Corner Office” column by Adam Bryant in The New York Times. The piece that
is missing for me is data analysis. Perhaps a more formal learning opportunity (library school
class?) would help me gain knowledge and confidence to participate in the current trend to make
data-driven decisions.

G.9

PROFILE FOR MARK

G.9.1 Becoming a Manager

I became the manager of both the CLP-West End and CLP-Sheraden locations in 2010 [and]
becoming a library manager was a planned step in my career. I started as a Clerk a long time ago
[and] was only a Clerk for about two years. That was a college job and I left the organization for
seven years and did other jobs in totally different industries. I came back to the library because
when I was around in different parts of the country, I always went to the library and just as I was
developing career thoughts, I recalled I enjoyed my time as a Clerk, so that led me back and look
at libraries. I became a Library Assistant and then the career path became evident. I liked what I
was doing there; it was a very busy urban branch in the system [with a lot of activity]. I had a lot
of good people around me and it's obvious as a Library Assistant in our system [that] to move
ahead you have to get a degree [so] if you like what you're doing and you want to move ahead,
you go for the degree. The main characteristic of my duties before I became [a] manager was
that I would often be the manager on duty. [This] urban location often had to call on the
manager on duty for some issue [as] there were [often] security [and other] issues.
In 2009 [prior to becoming a manager,] the CLP-West End location had been under threat
of permanent closure due to disuse. I was working at a different location when I made the
transition to manage [the] CLP-West End and Sheraden locations. I became a manager after
interviewing with the Assistant Director of Neighborhood Libraries and the Deputy Director [at
the time]. I felt that my experience and former positions had been preparing me to become a
manager because [each] had increasing levels of responsibility and involvement throughout the
organization. I had also been selected to take part in [a CLP] leadership training seminar and was
349

a year into that two year program. I learned about Sheraden and West End neighborhoods,
looking up local businesses as well as demographic information to prepare for my interview.
When I started, we had a new manager orientation, where we met with our supervisor and that
was helpful. The organization has changed a lot [since I became a manager and] the position is
more supported. When I first started, I didn't have [an] assigned a mentor. I would go to my
boss or this person and that person, so that's changed because I do have people to talk to now
with specific things about my job. But even so, I feel like having someone you can speak openly
and honestly about what you don't know, what you need to learn, would be the most helpful
thing, so you don't fear being wrong [which] can result in something negative.
Prior to [becoming a manager], the single piece of experience I was most lacking was not
having the experience of supervising a direct report. I would like to lay out the million steps I
took about how I prepared for the job once I accepted the position but, when I made the
transition from Senior Librarian, there was no time. In fact, because the libraries I was hired to
manage did not have a manager for some time, almost from the moment I was hired, things
concerning the two branches began to be forwarded to me while I was still in my current
position. Essentially, I began working two jobs for three weeks, as well as managing the change
from one situation to the next. I think this is somewhat typical for an internal hire for our
organization and probably others. Once in my new position, I called my boss for advice and she
came out to counsel me a couple of times that first month. In addition, I inherited a somewhat
toxic environment at one of the two locations and had to immediately put a performance plan in
place for an employee [who] would later be terminated within the first year. On top of this, as a
condition of the position, I was tasked with writing a report about the two areas neighborhoods to
determine if a sensible spot existed for the two buildings to be relocated as one library. Mostly

350

that first year, I learned the hard way by making plenty of mistakes. We ended up passing a
referendum so both libraries got more hours and more positions [and] the upshot is I'm only the
manager of one location now.
Many things surprised me about becoming a manager. I came from a library where
people took great pride in their work and when I began at the two locations, I discovered that this
was not always the case at either location. They had been operating without a manager for quite
some time and people had developed some bad work habits. One individual was running her
nonprofit out of the branch and had been doing so for over a decade. She did this by giving the
library the look of being closed with the lights half off and the blinds pulled down. This was the
library that was same library that was slated for closure. I was also surprised to see how long it
took to dismiss this employee for this conduct [and] I learned about the demoralizing impact a
poor performer can have on all staff.
One way I would have prepared to become manager [is to] have learned the nuts and
bolts [of] clerical work much better. So much of what goes on in the libraries is circulation [and]
I had to rely on [others] a lot more and I was slower to see mistakes. The mistakes were so bad
even I could see them after awhile though. [Moreover,] dealing with employees is a major
aspect of the job; it leads to the best experiences and the most stressful, and I'm not sure how I
would prepare for that if I had to again. There were some books I read recently, like about
emotional intelligence [that have] resonated. The mistakes I made, especially in the beginning,
had to do so much with hiring and assumptions I had about what was important based on how I
felt when I was employee [but] didn't bear out necessarily that way as manager. Luckily, some
of the mistakes you make, you suffer so badly from them that you really don't make them twice.

351

My first year as manager was a profoundly stressful experience for me but it taught me so
much, [especially] about the importance of hiring and understanding what I needed for the
libraries I managed to have success and how to get them there. It also showed me a great deal
about the people [and] processes around me and the importance for getting things done while
seeking to minimize conflict. [Job-shadowing] could've helped to save time to understand some
[of the] processes that I didn't know how to do. Now, there's going to be a new manager guide, a
new manager orientation, checklist, and directions for all these people you go to for answers.
They will highlight who your mentor is, what they expect of the mentor, what's expected of the
protégé, what a good schedule looks like and all these things that are time sucks if you don't how
to do them and they add up to [you] working at home.

G.9.2 Role as Manager

[In general,] I try to lead by example; that’s something that I feel is important, [as well as] being
a good communicator [and] empathetic. I think empathy is the Number 1 leadership criteria
when dealing with people, not overly empathetic but enough that you understand people and
people understand that you care or have concern for them. I think leaders should concentrate on
having a feel for the people who work around them, who work with them, who work for them,
and above them and understand that happier, contented people make the best employees and
provide the best customer service. Leaders are often able to be clear communicators about their
needs at that moment and be adept at managing in both directions, above and below. For me, the
most effective learning came from understanding what I thought the [branch] potential [was]: A
place where employees were glad to work because they found meaning and fulfillment in their
work and where patrons were glad for the opportunity to visit because they always got something
352

out of visiting, even if it was simply to be acknowledged. I gained that understanding by
realizing that what I found was the opposite so I modeled my behaviors as an example and began
hiring differently.
I [also] try to be a big picture leader. Before we got renovated, it was easy to be a
visionary leader [by focusing on what was happening]: “the library is closing for renovations
and here's what we want to do [and] accomplish.” We [wanted to] have success in the face of
steeply declined population [and prove that] anyone could. [It was] something everybody could
sink their teeth into and believe in. Now that we’re reopened, I noticed that the day-to-day work
has taken over. But I do like having a big picture and an inspirational message to focus on for
myself and the staff.
My supervisor helps direct the organization [and] communicate what's going on
throughout the system. I talk to her as she meets with me one-on-one; that’s a new practice
[that’s] emerged here. She’ll give me advice; I’ll call and I'll ask about things [like] what the
protocol for something is. I manage a grant for the library, so she helps answer questions like
that too. She gives me opportunities to volunteer, she has meetings, she brings us together to talk
about what’s going on. Library managers have a fairly natural community of practice. I think
she has a clear expectation that managers communicate to staff what's going on in the system;
and after you work for someone for a while, you understand what's important to them. She [also]
expects you to understand policies, [like those] from HR or to understand where to go in the
organization to keep your library [running]. Her job is to help make me feel like when I call, I'm
not going to be in trouble for something [and] to have an honest relationship. I feel like I can
talk to her about stuff [and she] gives me advice about what to do, depending on the situation.

353

G.9.2.1 Challenge of Supervising
One of my most important job duties involves having a productive relationship with the people I
supervise. I do this by encouraging them and listening, having empathy, providing
encouragement and incentives, giving credit and saying thank you, communicating the initiatives
of CLP, communicating or allowing them leeway to bend policy, hiring and continually
providing training, providing professional development opportunities, maintaining an open door,
having clear expectations and giving staff ownership of their work.
[In general,] I expect them to be friendly, genuinely nice [and] have outside interests that
they can communicate about to patrons and share. I expect them to keep learning; I expect them
to have enthusiasm about the work that they're doing. We have a unique situation where we
have less population [in our library’s neighborhood], so we have to work harder to get the word
out about our events. So part of our job expectation is to market and promote library events
[and] everybody has separate jobs that they do to make that happen. But they also [need to]
personally invite people based on what's going on, [which means] having the knowledge of
what's happening in our library and inviting people to those programs because above all else, that
is the most effective way to get people to come to things. I also expect them to understand the
policies of our organization; I expect them to be flexible [with customers], that’s the major
expectation I have. I’m very flexible about fines [and] renewals, [as] part of not having that
clerical background is an inherent flexibility. And of course, technical knowledge [so] I expect a
lot. [They expect me] to be flexible with their schedules when they need it to be, to be someone
they can talk to [and] solve library problems. Because it's a big organization, they expect me to
advocate for them, to find money for them to spend, and handle everything that they don't want
to handle, in terms of difficult patrons [or] whenever it is. And they expect communication

354

about what's going on in the organization, to find educational opportunities for them and to allow
room in the schedule for that to occur, which I feel is very important, not just for the educational
opportunities but also to meet with other people in the organization and get outside once in
awhile.
[In terms of giving employees ownership of their work,] that was one of the easiest things
to learn because I didn't want to own the work and I certainly know in many cases, I can’t do the
work better than they can. I understood what I wanted and, in some cases, I didn’t understand
exactly what I wanted but I hired somebody [with that knowledge] and then learned from them
what is best for the situation. A good for instance here was after I started a local historical
group, I hired a person who came from the history museum. She has a background in that and
she understands the process for taking on historical groups [and all that entails]. So I let her own
some of that because she has an expertise there. But [occasionally,] even though they own [the
work], they fall off, so I follow up. In this case, we had a pile of historical stuff (pamphlets, old
annual reports, pictures and things) from different neighborhoods in different time periods at our
location. I gave her that ownership [but] she didn't do too much with it at first. We [met and]
came up the plan, so she got volunteers from the history group [and] scheduled times [when]
she’d have time to work on it with them. [Another example is the staff] in charge of the
bestsellers. They have to process the bestsellers [and] put them out; after they've been out for a
while, if they're not going out much, [we] send them back because they’re leased from
McNaughton. That's what it looks like when they do that job. On my end, what I do is
acknowledge that they've done that job; I thank them for doing that job. In the past, this was a
long time ago, I had a [situation where] you could build forts out of the McNaughton book boxes
that were never mailed back. In that case, I had to find out what was going on and there were an

355

assortment of issues (one was UPS wouldn't stop because of the bad part of town) but we
resolved it. [So] I’m interested in the outcome. I'm only interested in the process if something is
interrupting the process or they're having difficulty with the process, but if it's getting done, I
don't get mired in it. I want to help solve problems but not create them. It is easier said than
done, but worth the effort.
I try to hire or work with people who are self-starters and sometimes you just get lucky
and you hit that vein where people are doing their job [but] when you have a very bad employee
or two, it can take up your entire life. [Early on,] I made hiring mistakes. My learning process
there was I came into the job thinking that if someone was doing a great job at one thing and I
promoted from within, that would be an example to other people and help to motivate them to
work harder. I had tunnel vision in that regard. So, I hired somebody for the wrong position;
ultimately, the person was incapable of the job I hired them for. It was an extremely introverted
person and I hired them for an outreach position. I made a bad mistake and there were other
circumstances [where there were others also not working] so I understood that she understood “if
this person is not getting fired from these things, I can really do nothing too.” It was extremely
frustrating. She [also] put up all these roadblocks, she went to HR, she went to my boss, she
created so much stress for me; but ultimately, it was my fault for not recognizing that she was
someone [who] was not going to succeed in the position she was hired for. It was a very early
mistake for me and using hindsight, I looked at the signs for why I should have known better.
One thing I learned was I identified what I wanted in an employee; I also identified what
I wanted them to do and went from there. The other mistake I made [was] I was desperate for
employees and there was an occasional employee who I didn't work too often — when she was
one place, I could be at the other place, so I never worked [directly] with her. I posted a job and

356

for some reason (and it never happen again this way), she's the only one who applied. It was a
fairly decent part-time position too, so I don’t know what happened, but that's the only applicant
I got from HR. I was so desperate for a person just to fill the spot that I ended up hiring her.
[But] one applicant in a pool is no good. I would never do it again. I should've reposted the
position but I didn't feel like I had the time because it adds on weeks [to the process], but then
she ended up being a problem for well over a year. [So, I now really focus on] references for
employees. For this person, I used internal references who damned her with faint praise I didn’t
hear. I didn't read between the lines [and] listen hard enough. Now I really do listen. Even if it's
an employee I end up hiring, I remember their references and every time what that reference told
me, I see what they were talking about. I really listen to references and chase them down
relentlessly.
I feel I am getting proficient at hiring and listening to references. I have gained [this]
level of proficiency by applying extra attention to this process because initially I got it wrong and
each time I did, I traced it back to the fact that the fault was largely mine. I believe I have
become somewhat proficient at hiring because my location gained the highest usage and program
attendance in many years in large part because of the staff that [works] here. I know this has
everything to do with hiring motivated people. The other area that I didn't really have a lot of
experience with before becoming a manager was interviewing, which is such an important job
for a manager [as] you’re hiring people into an [entire] organization. As the library changes and
develops the philosophy of customer service, it’s important to get the right people. Another part
of leadership in supervision is trying to find out what people want out of their jobs. I like to
think that that's an impact I can have. I can say I made a difference in this person’s life because I
helped to coach them along or encouraged them to do something that they wanted to do but were

357

afraid to do or helped them get a promotion they deserved. I take pride in that and I don’t think
hiring is [always] treated with the importance it deserves, especially in an organization where
[people can stay for] 40 years.
After those and other mistakes, I think it would've helped to understand [staff better] and
be prepared for different personalities and the stress of dealing with [some situations]. [Again,]
the best thing that would've benefited me the most would've been to have somebody I really
trusted as a mentor who I could bounce some things off of, who could save you from going over
the cliff, even though you're driving the car. [I think it] would’ve helped me to have supervising
[experiences too]. It obviously would’ve helped me with things like understanding how to write
performance evaluations and maybe understand myself and what I look for in people because
that's really something I learned on-the-fly; I was going by one standard, but then as I made
mistakes, I started to understand what I needed the person [and] the jobs to be, what I needed the
personalities to be like [and] what I respected and admired in an employee.

G.9.3 Issues of Communication

I really feel I could be a better at communication, although I feel like I am improving. I am
conversational and I do digress but I always try at least keep the goal in mind and move it
forward. I have [branch] communication issues in the traditional sense; it’s not really trouble,
it’s just the way it works. I have a small branch [so] there's just no way to get a meeting together
[because] not everybody can make it. What I ended up doing is having meeting with people oneon-one which isn’t the best way either because one area I've recognized [is] I need to take more
notes [so everything gets covered]. What ends up happening is the script gets flipped and then I
have to think what we said that meeting. So that's the area where I feel like my communication
358

could be improved by taking notes [but it also led back to] having more branch meetings. So I
started having branch meetings again and I did it at a totally non-traditional time for us. I have
one employee work the desk because it's a time when everybody's there, except the one
employee at the desk, and I rotate that employee each meeting, and then after the meeting,
everyone goes to fill in that employee.
How I communicate things has evolved a little bit. I used to always talk to them
[because] I’m a very personal kind of person, and one-to-one is the best [and] easiest way for
me. But [it’s] not the [always the] best [in general], because sometimes you [should] email so
you don't get any other noise in there [and can be direct]. I [do] try to be fairly direct; if
something is not working for me, I'll just say “that's not going to work here.” [Also] there [have
been] moments when getting things in writing was important [as a record but that’s not
necessarily why I use email] but sometimes you will have staff who might say a communication
issue is a reason something isn’t being done so e-mail helps prevent that from becoming an
excuse. For [me], it's timely also. If I'm there and I think about it, I want to do it to get it out of
my mind, not just that I want to get it done, but I also want to be not thinking about it or
deliberating about it internally. [Also as] you may have noticed from this interview, it helps me
to be more clear to write it down. I'm not necessarily documenting all the time.
[Overall,] the organization has become better at communicating but it’s almost going the
other way now. One thing [we are using] is the SLACK channel [but] it was started in a nondeliberate way and now it’s [overwhelming]. I don't even open it half the time because I feel that
I don't have time. I'll call people and say “don't @name me” because then you have to answer
them, but it is a good tool and, in truth, it is a better organization with it. The Pulse, which is our

359

internal [newsletter] for communication, is required reading. [This information comes] from the
top [and] that's important [to help all of us know] what’s important.

G.9.4 Participation in the Organization

I feel my most important job duties at this moment involve being a part of the conversation in
CLP which helps move the library forward in a way that robustly enables its future. In this way, I
feel I have a voice in the evolution of the library system. I do this by working as part of various
groups like on the Patron Experience Focus Areas (PEFAs), the Accessibility work group, this
research, Places and Spaces committee and by coordinating the Garden Thyme grant. This in
addition to managing a CLP location.

[So] the big picture for me is understanding what the

community wants and needs, trying to deliver that, trying to know the community by going to
community groups, being around government people, reading their Facebook pages [and]
understanding what's important to the community, [then,] interrelating that to the organization as
a whole. The branch is in an area where there was heavy population; even up until the ‘90s,
there were buildings that aren't there are now. I guess because of its proximity to the city,
developers thought that if they removed all this property, then it can't attract any riffraff and we
can attract giant hotel chains or [others] to buy land (but it was in a flood plain [and had] lots of
[other] problems). So the net result of that is the population declined so I have to pull people in
from all over, not just [from this specific neighborhood, so it can impact other locations].
I was asked to manage a [systemwide] grant [related to our] community gardens. I really
believe in it [and the impact they have]. A grant opportunity came along so we [decided to] do
it. [When] the third [year] came along, my boss didn't want to manage the grant anymore [and
we thought it] would be a good experience for me. It’s a ton of work [but] I said okay. [At the
360

same time an] argument was made to me that the gardens aren't really important, that staff is
wasting their time on the gardens, [so there was talk about] taking out the thirteen gardens and
use any grant money for garden programming. That's the argument and it's a fairly solid
argument; we can use money for library programs instead of building gardens or raise beds, or
deliver dirt, which is so much hassle. [But] I'm really against it. In anticipation of those
arguments, I started to talk to people who have gardens about what they are doing and how they
feel about going forward. What I've come to find is not everybody is of the same opinion as me.
But I'm trying to develop some kind of consensus because there may be a meeting or two where
this comes up. [So] I have people define for me what's important and start thinking about
gardens in terms of what would it mean to not have it. What people describe to me, and what I
[have] experienced too, is it's a great community connector.

This year, we had 11-foot

sunflowers in three beds. It was really something to see, people absolutely loved them [and]
talked about them all the time. We harvested the heads of them for sunflower seeds [and] that
was a program. And now it’s so easy to spread that far and wide with pictures online. It’s [a]
quality-of-life improvement for staff and patrons. [This process has helped me] understand the
arguer [and] understand there's a way to argue [and have influence in those system decisions].
[So] in this organization, I've been lucky because I've had opportunities that maybe other
people haven’t had. When my library was [being] renovated, I asked for some special projects
[and] was given them. It happened at a time when the library was working with 21st Century
[Libraries] and ACLA [Allegheny County Library Association], and [I was able to] work among
the administrators [while] that communication was happening. [Those conversations brought me
to] this place where I'm [thinking] “who’s going to use us with the Internet?” But instead, we
have the highest use [at the branch] in over a decade and we’re pulling people in all the time as

361

the library evolves toward recognizing what the community wants. [It’s clear] that the library
does have a viable future; but I do worry about the future still. I do because one major part of the
library component is computer use; people use the library to use the computers and I think that
it's a matter of time before they’re ubiquitous, like McDonald's has them in the table at the
restaurants. They have wireless everywhere, so [at some point] they will start siphon that need
away [systemwide].

G.9.5 Culture of Staff Supervision

[In the past,] if there was an opening, it would occasionally not be posted [and] people got put
into jobs. It wasn't a standard [but] there were a few appointments for good jobs in the system
that really should've been posted, so there was a sense of unfairness. [Also] sometimes people
were just promoted from one level to another, [like] Librarian to Senior Librarian; [but] for me, I
had to interview for every job I ever got here. So there was this sense of unfairness that has
totally changed. Now that I'm a manager, [I’m not sure I totally agree with the change]. A
recent example is I just internally promoted one of my staff members from Clerk to Clerical
Specialist, but I had to post the job and it was really pointless [because this person had earned the
job]. So I'm conflicted [because] at the same time, there was a spectacular management job open
and somebody was just placed in it and it really put them into a position to apply for [other highlevel] jobs. It’s just the way it used to happen.
I [also] think HR could be more clear about a timeline for letting someone go. In most
cases, when you're putting a performance plan in place, that person is not going to change and
everybody knows it [including] that person. What I feel is happening is you're trying to force
them out the door; if they leave on their own, well then, no harm, no foul, no unemployment.
362

[But] if you hire a bad employee, you should be able to correct that quicker and there is some
vagueness on that process. When you don’t, it’s a negative for everybody, except for that
employee who benefits from that [situation].

Just [to] understand that [better] would be

beneficial to me because I had to terminate two employees since I've been a manager and in both
cases, they were the most egregious non-performers; they should've never have been here. As a
manager, it would help me to understand what these barriers [are]. What happened to me [was I
needed to] fire somebody who was an egregious offender [who was] running a nonprofit out of
the library from the main circulation desk, on the phone all day, mean to people who came up to
her, door shut, I mean the worst. It impacted the organization to have that person any longer that
we had to have them, and it impacted the morale of the staff. At the time, I had two staffs and
some of them worked both places and everybody knew and they would [say] “why should I do
this if this person can do that?” I was so reluctant to try to fire anybody else [but] I had another
terrible employee. [I had to override] the HR individual [who] was giving the person another
chance; I interjected “there are no more chances.” It was destroying this place [and] this person
was absolutely killing us over [the] six months. So just understanding how can you go through
the process quicker if you have to. It is so hard, it is the hardest thing… I just want to apologize
and write them a check.

[But] I think in the big picture, the library's image is much more

important in terms of the future and how the community sees [us] and funding. Protecting that
image has grown in importance.
[Finally,] I don't like the appraisal process. What I don't like about the process is that
nobody likes the process; the employees don't like the process either. In fact, I had a branch
meeting [where] an employee was openly denigrating the process and it's an employee who is a
little higher up, who's been here a while, and I have new employees there [so] I'm forced into a

363

position to defend the process, and I'm coming off as insincere. The point I talk about is “it’s
communication between me and you to see what you're doing; sometimes I forget all the things
that you do here and it's an opportunity to brag about what you do.” I make an important point to
tell them that's what I want to see; I want to see all bragging on there [and not to] send me just
three sentences. But then I try to tell them other people look at this, my boss will see it and
[those hiring for] jobs the system could go look at it [too]. It's just a way to take into account
what you're doing, communicating so we can maybe tweak some things, or maybe you're doing
some things you hate doing and I have the ability to change them or move you into something
that better suits you, as long as it meets the needs of the branch and the needs of the customers.
[Unfortunately,] the thing is the evaluations are primarily a tool for negative and I only
know that because I went to court and they pulled this person's evaluations for a long time and
that was what they were looking for, that pattern to argue against unemployment. I don't know if
they're always for that but that's definitely one thing that I [now] understand about them. At one
point, they were used to give merit raises, and I think that that's a way to improve them or at least
give them some more meat or resonance with the staff. [But] I don't see it changing. People
work in small environments with a group of people who [they] are trying to hold together as a
team, motivate and inspire. Occasionally people are terrible, but if somebody's borderline and
they may need improvement, you probably wouldn't give them “needs improvement”
necessarily. They would really have to need improvement, because I guess at the end of the day,
you're going to be working with [that] person in a small environment [and] you're going to rely
on that person [so] you need them to be on board.

And “needs improvement” is not a

designation that lends itself to team building in the current evaluation environment.

364

You know how I’d change the process probably? In the process of termination if you
do[it], there is plenty of paperwork; you're taking notes, you’re documenting things, so train
people to do that, to document more [and write] a performance plan. If [appraisals] went away,
there is something that is better and that is the monthly one-on-one meetings with staff, which
are hard to do consistently because we have a lot to do. But if that was the mandate, each month
you have a 30-minute meeting with everybody on your staff, it [would help because it] is more
than a once-a-year thing.

[Also] the timing is bad; we have short memories [and] this is

supposed to take the whole year into account.

G.9.6 Learning

G.9.6.1 Challenge of Supervising
When I started, I didn't know my management duties. I loosely knew them, but there was no
“here [are] your management duties” [so] I had no idea everything that it entailed. What ended
up happening, in fact, is I worked at my old job and once I was hired, I had three weeks to go
because my manager at the time needed me still, but you become a target and they start sending
[everything] your way, so all of a sudden you're a manager overnight. So I started calling other
managers and asking them advice, [focusing on] who you have a rapport with, who you trust,
who you're safe with, so I learned a lot that way. Basically, I didn't know anything so I tried to
get people who did. At the time, I called the manager at Woods Run. I trusted her and I asked
her a lot of questions.

She help me to interview occasionally; it wasn't really a mentor

relationship; I just called her a lot with questions.
We [also] have a clerical [supervisor] at Main Library and she interviews a lot of people
so I asked her come and interview with me. What ended up happening [was we] had two people
365

no-show [their interviews] and during the time that those people didn't show up, she told me so
many things I still use. [So] just interviewing with people who had experience helped me. Then,
interviewing with people that I trusted to not steer me, because I made bad decisions
interviewing with people who were trying to push me toward a decision based other interviews
they had and it pushed me into another wrong decision. I [also] talk to the Deputy Director quite
a bit now [and] she's had a lot of experience with a lot of different people and understands what
motivates people so I say “I experienced this” and she says “that's because…” That is very
helpful and I am grateful for it.
[I’ve] learned much from the example of previous managers I had as well, applying both
good and bad examples from some of the behaviors I witnessed from them. [For example,] I had
one manager who was adept at taking credit. It would be like this person's name and staff, so in
an organizational newsletter [it would say], “a kudos to blankety-blank and staff at this location.”
They’re small things and they don't ever lend themselves to pay increases to have your name out
there, but I felt they impacted the morale. [I came to] know the difference, having someone who
didn't do that, and not knowing when this [manager] came along [that] they were very good at
getting their name out there, [as well as] controlling where you could go in the organization[or]
not taking any extra work on your behalf. In other words, if you [needed] to go to a meeting and
they could work your shift, that wasn't going to happen; you wouldn’t be going to that meeting
or you wouldn't be on that committee because it might take away from something that they
would be able to do. That's one thing I did learn from a negative to a positive because credit
doesn't cost you anything and to give it is easy and important especially in a non-merit-based pay
system. It does have value, even to just say thank you and acknowledge the work that people

366

did, I feel has a great benefit and it's very important and it really lends itself to their job
satisfaction. I feel [that way] because I felt that satisfaction from a thank you myself.
One recommendation [I would have for LIS educators is to have opportunities] to work
with real-world professionals in management and maybe offer some HR courses, like dealing
with interpersonal employee [issues] or mock interviews. [In library school,] mock interview so
often deal with the interviewee [as students are looking for jobs] but [to be] the interviewer, what
to look for, what to ask, what to read between the lines [would be helpful]. Learning to work
productively with people to achieve common goals is difficult. I feel I am becoming good at it
[but] I became good at it by being not so good at it. I realized that I was not getting what I set out
for and I learned to concentrate on the goals I wanted to achieve. I read a lot of articles and
continue to read books to keep up with philosophies of management and try to integrate what I
read with what I have picked up from the school of hard knocks, [but covering it in library
school could have helped some].

G.9.6.2 Organizational Support and Relationships
[Basically,] I learned a lot from doing the job. Actually being in the job has helped me to learn
who to ask questions of and where to get the answers I need. It was and still is through building
and maintaining relationships with people in various departments within our organization that I
am able to often get my work done while continuing to learn and improve as things change. I
received much assistance throughout my learning (and still do) by asking people in different
departments many questions. The Deputy Director of our organization [has a] very open door
and [helped] remove the hierarchical standard that was in place. You can say things to her
without fear of reprisal [and she’s] good for advice. And then the Director, I get along [with]

367

pretty well; she was one of the people who interviewed me for the job I have now [and] without
her in the interview, I feel like it would [not have] gone the way it did. I can talk to either of
them. In terms of relationships, I feel like I can joke with them [and] I stop in both their offices
once in awhile; they're both pretty amenable and congenial to discussion and give me advice.
I was lucky I worked at Main [for] six months and I got to see a lot and ask them
questions about things that were going on. [Because] I want to gain more responsibility in this or
another organization, I recognized there were some areas in which I perceived I was lacking; so
when my location closed for renovation, I asked for special assignments. In this way I was able
to work with the various departments throughout the organization and learn the hows and whys
of what they do. I was also able to visit each location throughout our organization and see first
hand different iterations of the library theme. Another way I did this way, upon the advice of the
Deputy Director, was to sit down with leaders from these departments and interview them about
how they got where they are and what motivated them. I have continued to learn a ton this year.
We are reading management books like Managing Transitions and Cultivating Communities of
Practice and Crucial Conversations and, in addition, I have asked for some recommendations, so
now I am reading Start with Why recommended by Deputy Director. I am also attending
conferences and am a member of nearly every conversation on the library’s SLACK channels.
These readings, trainings and conference attendances have really contributed toward gaining
proficiency.

G.10 PROFILE FOR MEGAN

G.10.1 Becoming a Manager

In 2009, my manager took a new job in Kentucky. At this time, CLP was going through a
funding crisis so a replacement wasn’t hired for several months. While we were in-between
managers, I handled a lot of the day-to-day tasks and supervisory functions, since I was the only
full-time librarian in the Children’s Room. When the position was finally posted, I decided to
apply because I was excited about the opportunity and thought I had been handling the
supervising well. I did not expect to be offered the position, however. I had just turned 30 and
although I felt very confident in my work as a Children’s Librarian and even my experience in
supporting a manager, I did not have much experience in managing a space. My plan was to
apply for the position [to] get some interview experience for a management position as I worked
towards my goal of moving into a supervisory position that had one or two staff members to
manage. When I was offered the position of managing the busiest Children’s Room at CLP, I
was quite honored and excited that the branch head felt that I had the qualities necessary to
handle this position. I felt at the time that I would have a lot of growing to do as I explored the
best way to manage a large staff and busy location. Even five years later, I continue to learn new
ways to work with my staff and deal with the challenges of middle management.
I never intended to start with managing a team of 10 to 15 people. I think I would've
liked to have started out managing just two or three people and been able to have a lower
learning curve. I think it's worked out okay but it was and continues to be a challenge to have
gone from not really doing tons of direct management to jumping in and having a staff of,
depending on the year, 10 to 15 folks. Preparing for this position tended to happen on the fly. I
369

would realize that something wasn’t working and then investigate what to do. I have been lucky
to have wonderful managers who are willing to talk through challenges and trouble-shoot how to
handle situations. I have also had a few managers who have taught me what not to do – and in
some ways these lessons were equally valuable.
When I was first hired for this position, the manager had been at the branch for a chunk
of time and had been with CLP for a long period of time before that. So she was really
instrumental in [showing me] what being a supervisor looks like within the organization as a
whole. When I first met with her as a new supervisor, one of her recommendations was to do
reverse interviews with my staff as a way to transition from being somebody who was at the
same level as the people that I was going to supervise to being the person who was supervising
them. It worked out nicely to be able to sit down with every single one of the people who were
now my staff and say “what are you looking for from me; what are your challenges; what do you
think is going great; what can I do to keep supporting you; what other things are you looking at
now that I'm your supervisor?” That was a really great piece of advice. The current branch
manager is [relatively] new [and] wonderful and is very interested in knowing what's going on in
Children's and Teen Services. She's very supportive of the work that we do. She has an opendoor policy so I know that I can go to her at any point and we're working things out together.
When I was hired for this position, my supervisor was specifically looking for somebody
who was going to be comfortable and that she was going to be comfortable taking on the role [of
being second-in-command of the branch]. But I was really shocked that I received the position
and it was very interesting because that was the piece that I was really least confident about. It’s
very interesting to have that deliberately called out [in the new job description] and the staff view
it as that. [In terms of new duties,] I think I've been lucky in that the roll out was a gradual

370

implementation of those different aspects. I immediately became second-in-command here and
became the manager who was working on my team, making sure that I was available and
supporting them in the work that they do on a day-to-day basis. So those two pieces were
[developed] early on. I was really careful when I first became second-in-command to watch the
people who also have supervisory roles and who have been here longer than me; at the very least,
I wanted to make sure that I had buy-in from the people who have been here longer than me,
particularly on the Adult Reference side because I don't really know what their lives exactly look
like and how all of their pieces exactly fit in. In Adult Reference, I feel like I generally don't
have as much of the background so I'm trying to glean as much of the background as I possibly
can from people to figure out where they're hoping to go. [A duty that has grown is] the support
for Children’s Services for the whole of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh; I was already doing
a lot of work as one of the lead librarians for Squirrel Hill Library [and] then it gradually got
bigger. Part of the reason why it's as big as it is now is because we have a new-ish Coordinator
of Children’s Services and she relies on those of us who were on the transition team before she
came in. That kicked in maybe two or three years into being the manager here [so] it was a more
gradual addition.
I feel very lucky that I started out in libraries as a volunteer and then worked my way up
to manager. I’ve been a Page, Clerk, Library Assistant, Children’s Librarian and now manager.
This has allowed me to have a very good idea of what each of these positions feels like and how
it fits into the big picture of what we do as a library. Working as a librarian, [I did some]
supervising of the part-time staff, particularly the part-time pages. [I was also] doing committee
work and some other pieces that weren't necessarily direct supervising but had those kind of
organizational pieces that became [the] things that I do as a manager. I miss being “just” a

371

librarian. Being a manager can be draining and stressful. Sometimes, the best thing that I can do
is leave my office and work the desk or do a storytime. This is a great way to recharge. I feel
successful as a librarian in a way that I often don’t feel as a manager.
[I have had to] give up things that I really enjoyed; sometimes, it still is giving up a lot of
things that I enjoy. I think this is pretty common, particularly for Children’s Services folks. We
all say the same thing, which is we have this handful of things that we continue to hold onto
because we enjoy doing them and it reminds us what we absolutely love about our job, even
when we’re having that particularly crazy week where all we do is handle all of the management
challenges and crises. Particularly during that transition period, [there] was a lot of trying to do
what I had been doing, as one of the lead Children's Librarians for this location, plus being the
Manager of Children's Services here. Every time a whole bunch of balls fell on the floor, I
would relook at everything that was on the list of things that I was responsible for and give up
one of those lead librarian pieces. And it keeps evolving in that way, where I'd like to say that it
was a natural “okay, this is who I am now” but it was a lot more awkward and a lot more “oh my
goodness, I have all of these things on my plate and there's no way I can do that anymore.” I still
get to be the sub person for things which is nice [because it] keeps my hand in it [and] makes me
feel like I still know what type of challenges and successes are going on and what our customers
are looking for, but [also] recognizes the fact that my role is not lead librarian anymore and those
lead librarian pieces need to go to other people.

G.10.2 Role as Manager

[Overall] in this library organization, being a leader is something that we hope that everybody
feels they can do. At my level, it has a lot to do with empowering the people who are my direct
372

reports and encouraging people who are peers, in addition to working on figuring out how to
stretch myself and continuing to learn. [Accomplishing that] has a lot to do with supporting
people, [then] recognizing what people's strengths are and recognizing what your strengths are
and leveraging that. One of the interesting things that's happened really recently was a new
definition for my position. They created a bunch of positions that’s now called the Library
Services Manager position; and it's a really interesting way of looking at what we do as
managers. [When] I read it, [I] found it to be relieving because it identifies the fact that I am the
direct support for my staff on the front lines, but it also branches out into my work as somebody
who connects community organizations to the library and the library to community
organizations. There’s our daily tasks [of] what we do to manage and supervise, and then there's
this big overarching piece for how we move forward as an organization.
My position is very much “middle management” [and a] Communication Hub. I work to
make sure that my staff are aware of the goals, objectives and current projects not only for the
Children’s Room, but also for our branch, Children’s Services as a whole, and systemwide
initiatives. I also send feedback from my staff, back up to our branch manager and to other
systemwide coordinators and managers. All of this requires managing information shared
through emails, meetings and in-person conversations to appropriate folks both up, down, and
sideways. [I also need to be a] Job Knowledge Wrangler [which] is often an aspect of my job
that I feel proficient [and] comfortable in. I especially like the community aspect of this [work]
and how it allows me to collaborate with colleagues in the learning process. For example, when
we started to explore the upgrade to our ILS [Integrated Library System], I enjoyed seeing the
differences and exploring the changes. I encouraged my staff to explore the new software by
creating sticker charts with various tasks that needed to be done in the new system. This allowed

373

me to track which staff had explored the new system while also giving folks time to explore on
their own or in groups. [Relatedly,] time management is a constant challenge. I went from
generally getting things done on time or early to losing track of projects and continually trying to
figure out how to prioritize things I need to get done. I’m still searching for a good system for
handling this, but the book Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity by David
Allen has been useful as I work through finding a way to manage time and projects.

G.10.2.1 Manager of a Service at a Branch
[In general,] we know that we want to move forward in a way that highlights community
engagement and recognizes that people want to use libraries, both as a place to access
information and a place to create information. Children’s Services is pretty well defined in what
our goals are: to provide whatever support we need to for our communities to have kids and
teenagers that are lifelong learners. That’s our really big picture; but that's such a huge vision
that we are continually, within that framework, trying to figure out what colors we’re painting
that picture [and] to figure out where we’re going. We are [also] recognizing [it] is not defined
just by us; it's defined by what our local schools are doing [and] what our big local organizations
doing. So, it’s always changing and moving and I'm not even certain that the people at the very
top know what the full big picture is; we just know what that would feel like, and the philosophy
behind that would be, but not what the specifics are.
[As part of defining that, I am a] Community and Local Culture Explorer. In Children’s
and Teen Services, we are continually exploring how we can share literacy and learning in
formal and informal ways with our community. Having good connections throughout the
community allows us to go into the schools for programs and presentations and to provide the

374

best services both in our location [and] outside of our walls. Over the years, we have developed
some wonderful collaborations that we are always fostering and new opportunities are being
evaluated and initiated throughout the year. In addition, since I am well known in the
community, I work to be a positive presence throughout the community. Many of our regular
families have known me for over nine years as one of their librarian. I also try to bridge the
quirks of our community with new staff as they slowly integrate themselves into our vibrant,
diverse community.

[However, I also have to be the] Local Flexibility vs. Systemwide

Consistency Navigator. As one of the few mangers [with] a large staff [in Children’s Services],
I not only work with my staff to navigate how we will implement systemwide initiatives and
projects with an understanding of what will work best for our community and location, but I also
act as a sounding board for our Coordinators of Children’s Services and Collections on projects
and initiatives. For example, I am currently working with our Coordinator of Children’s
Services, the Department Head of Children’s Services at CLP – Main, and the Coordinator of
Children’s Collections to update and revise our Children’s Services Manual. [Ultimately, I am a]
Project Manager/Coordinator [because] all of the programs, processes, initiatives, and daily tasks
in our Children’s Room are ultimately my responsibility. Although I delegate out many of these,
I work to make sure that my staff is well versed in my expectations and the expectations of our
organization.
[The way] I manage our Children's Librarians and Teen Librarian [requires] a lot of selfmotivated work [from them]: it's creating programs from scratch or revamping programs that
either they've created or that have been created by Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, it’s making
individual contacts with the community organizations that we serve [and] it's being prepared to
pick up pieces of information relatively on their own. I try to provide a platform for learning

375

new skills or taking things in another direction, but at the end of the day, they are going to be the
ones that are going to have to implement it. When ALA switched over to Every Child Ready to
Read 2.0, that was certainly something that there was lots of training [and] support; but at the
end of the day, making sure that they were looking at both the original way that ALA was doing
things and the new way ALA was doing things became the responsibility of my staff. I observe
what they're doing and provide tips and tricks and we talk things over, but at the end of the day,
that’s all their responsibility. They’re also all on committees, so they all have committee work
that they're responsible for as well, and that's all on top of just the day-to-day interactions with
customers and being able to make sure that customers are feeling satisfied that they're getting the
things that they need to get. They have a lot of things on their plate and I try to give them support
and time off the desk. When people are feeling overwhelmed, whether there's something that
they didn't think they could let go of for a little while, but it’s something they really can, or
talking over how we evaluate how much time [something takes, I help them figure out how to
manage the work]. We've done a lot of looking at how we can share similar types of programs
we do, so the outreach that we do is pretty streamlined; everybody uses the same theme for a
month, recognizing that I'm going to probably pull a different set of books than a different
librarian because we each have our own styles. But at least having that similar framework helps
us feel like we are not re-creating the wheel [because] five of us all creating our own storytime
plan to take out to outreach doesn't seem like a very good use of time.

G.10.2.2 Supervising Staff and Being Second-in-Command
[For my staff,] I expect people to look up from the desk and to greet people; I expect people to
rove and pay attention to what's going on in the room; I expect people to be forgiving of each

376

other and of the community when something really quirky happens, particularly with working
with families and teens. There's going to be days that teenagers drive you absolutely crazy and
some days they get kicked out and that's fine. But the flip side of that is the welcoming them
back the next day. For families with younger kids, we try to be welcoming and recognizing that
we have absolutely no idea what 2:00 a.m. looked like at that household, so if there's a way that
we can very gently help people out [we] do it but [we] also know when to back off. And all of
that is really hard to quantify but it's something that I've been really lucky that I have a staff that
came across in their interviews (I hired most of my staff) that they were willing to be flexible and
they understood that we are a community. I think that being forgiving of each other and the
community situations are probably the most important qualities that we look for and try to foster.
I think that throughout the organization there's an expectation that managers are going to
be accessible. But I also think that it's something that's very valued by staff, that they are able
come with problems and talk through situations and that I'm going to be available and around
when they need me to be, so I make that one of my top priorities. I think other expectations are
that I'm going to keep working on things also, and that I have my own stretch goals, and I try to
make [it] obvious that I have my own stretch goals. I try to make it noticeable that these are
things that we’re all going to have to work on, that it's something I'm working on as well, that we
really are in this together and that it's not me just expecting them to do things and handle things.
[I’m also] making sure that everyone is on the same page and that communication flows; [getting
information to] part-time staff is definitely a huge piece of supervising that happens both at the
management level and among coworkers. As a manager, I may have more clout in how much
staff pays attention to the information I share and training I provide. I am always working on

377

how to balance my own styles and personal preferences for how things are completed with an
understanding that other ways of completing a task may also work fine.
Training and encouraging my staff to learn and explore new procedures, processes, and
technology involves learning the skills myself and creating an environment that supports
exploration and learning. I encourage staff to attend trainings and try to provide them with
opportunities to utilize the new skills and information. Having worked in a variety of positions
over the 12 years that I have worked for CLP makes me an important source of information for
my location beyond Children’s and Teen Services. In addition, as the second-in-command at our
location, I work with our manager and head of customer services to think through policies and
procedures, streamlining processes as much as possible. I also interpret and explain policies and
procedures to staff and customers. Often this is much more about being willing and able to find
an answer than actually knowing the answer.
I feel reasonably proficient in providing evaluations of staff. I also feel comfortable
coaching staff in how to handle situations and tasks. I am most comfortable when I am coaching
on projects or situations that I’m very familiar with and used to handling. Correcting staff and
handling disciplinary situations continues to be a challenge. I find this particularly difficult
because [of] how each staff member handles recommendations for improvement. I am especially
surprised by staff members who tend to passively listen to my coaching on policies and
procedures and then proceed to continue to handle things in the way that they would prefer. For
me, it is easier to handle direct confrontation and questions about why we do something than
passive resistance to following the procedure.
I try to handle [corrections] as soon as it's happening. As a manager, it gets tricky
because very often it happens when I'm not around, and so then I have to figure out how to bring

378

up a situation that I wasn't around for. The first thing I do is try to get that person's version of the
story and then go from there to troubleshoot. [I look for whether they] are they being reflective
on their own; very often they are and they say “oh, I wish I would've done this” or “this flew out
of my mouth and the minute it did, I realized that I should of said something completely
different.” Everybody has those moments so if I see that reflectiveness, that is usually a sign that
there's going to be some good growth out of that situation.

When I'm not seeing that

reflectiveness, I try to push them to be more reflective about what they're doing and how they're
saying things. When that still feels like it's missing, then I start looking with my supervisor, with
the help of HR, on how we can create an action plan to start paying attention to what piece is
missing and [what] kind of support we can provide. I’ve had folks where I've written an action
plan for them and they have looked at the action plan and they've resigned the next day.
Communication is a constant ongoing challenge. It's just so amazingly tricky because
people learn different ways, people process information in different ways, people have different
ways that they prefer to receive information.

Anyone who processes information in a

significantly different way than I do has the potential to be difficult to manage. Remembering
how different staff process information and handle new situations is important to making sure
that I communicate with everyone on my staff in the best way possible. Everybody runs into this
at this level of a position, trying to figure out how to meet with and talk with everyone on your
staff. Whether you have a small staff or a large staff, you have the same issue which is the fact
that everybody's not working at the same time. We are open seven days a week and there is not
any one time where all of my full-time staff are all available for a meeting. In order to get my
full-time and part-time staff on the same page, I often have two meetings so that I can get at least
most of my staff at a meeting to brainstorm and discuss procedures and initiatives. Getting that

379

information out in a way that's accessible to folks, whether it's putting notes on a whiteboard,
sending out group emails to everybody or trying to track down every single person on your staff
and make sure that everybody's feeling comfortable with whatever is happening [becomes
crucial]. The communication piece is ultimately the piece that all of the other parts of my job
hinges on, so I’m not sure I’ll ever feel completely proficient.
[Ultimately,] coordinating people is both rewarding and frustrating -- often at the same
time. I have some days that are entirely talking to various people who have an vested interest in a
project or situation and trying to resolve an issue or complete a task. It's the one that if it goes to
the wayside, everything else falls apart. When everybody's feeling really good about where
they're going and what pieces they are doing, it means that I can back off and work on other
projects. So it's always a goal to make sure that anything that's a big chunk that needs to be
addressed is addressed because if you let those things pile up, it's just going to become a train
wreck at some point.

G.10.3 Managing in a Changing Organization

I feel like we're doing such amazing and interesting things [in] how we’re trying things out, how
we're building our team and how we’re doing our Strategic Plan and working really hard to
figure out how to get everybody involved and invested, which has a huge management
component to it. [A few years ago] it was really interesting because a lot of things were shifting;
we had just added our Deputy Director and [then] added a new Coordinator of Children's
Services. I had been part of the interim [and] transition team for Children's Services when our
Children's Services Coordinator retired and we were in the process of hiring a new Children's
Services Coordinator. One of the things that we recognized as a system was Children's Services
380

just can't stop dead for several months while we figure out who the new coordinator is and
there’s no way that one person can be the backup person for that coordinator. So there were four
of us that are in managerial positions within Children’s Services and we became the people that
were in charge of various pieces. I was responsible for making sure a grant got finished being
spent, so that involved making sure what we were buying was okay with the Assistant Directors
and all that got taken care of properly. I was doing the planning for Summer Reading so a lot of
[those] pieces got done as we were in the interim. We [also] put together the annual report. It
was a very interesting way to get the new Coordinator of Children’s Services on board. She
started in January and one of her first tasks was putting together the annual report for Children’s
Services for the year prior, which I think was fabulous. It was really useful to be able to walk
into that position and see this really big picture and know what that big picture looked like the
year previous, but it meant that she relied very heavily on those of us who had been doing the
work. She knew a lot of what we had been doing because she came from our system but she
didn't know all of the details of what we had been doing, so we did a lot of pulling that together.
I think [the big picture has] become really elusive. I'm not sure if the people who were
supervisors 10 or 15 years ago knew the big picture better, but right now, it feels very much like
a moving target. [For example,] I just had a staff meeting and one of my staff said “did I make
this up or were we interpreting this as X a couple years ago” and I said “oh yeah, we were
definitely interpreting in this as X a couple years ago; I think we're recognizing that that is a
component that we no longer need to be paying attention to and now we’re going this way…”
It's very important [to be] an evolving organization whose goal is to continue to be vibrant and
nimble and relevant, but it's so tricky when people are like “no, we were going this way; we
knew that way” and [I’m telling them] “now, we’re just going to go two clicks that direction…”

381

One of the nice things about a more vague big picture right now is that there is a lot of
opportunities for input on the details of how we do things. I've been in the system long enough
that my opinion is valued and that I feel pretty comfortable talking to a lot of the people who are
administrative. This summer, I started pushing really hard for the fact that Summer Reading
should try to morph into something different next year and that we should start planning that in
September. Children's and Teen Services are really close to being similar sides of that same
program, and if we could get Adult Services on that same side, we could have a really
streamlined Summer Reading. We’ve been doing Summer Reading forever in libraries and
we’ve been doing it really well, and it feels like we could take this to the next level looking at
those [system-level] things and particularly push it in a direction that matches with our Strategic
Plan in a really nice way. In July, in the middle of Summer Reading, I started advocating to
absolutely everybody I could find about the fact that we should do this. I started with the
Coordinator of Children's Services because I have a really good relationship with her. (I should
also say, in a lot of ways, she is also a supervisor; I have a very interesting position in that I have
my direct supervisor in my location but I also have the Coordinator of Children's Services as a
supervisory figure, [which] sometimes it feels like a tug-of-war but oftentimes, it feels like were
just dovetailing how we support one another.). Then, we were in the process of hiring a new
Teen Coordinator, [and] I knew who the top two picks were for the Teen Coordinator so I got on
board with them. We [also] have a new communication tool that we’re trying out called
SLACK, so I advocated it through SLACK. I just made a nuisance of myself for a while but it is
having the desired effect of really getting people to start thinking about “wow, what would
happen if we started to do that?”

382

G.10.4 Learning

G.10.4.1 Formal
Early on when I first started in this position, I was really lucky that CLP [was] doing a big
management training push [the Leadership Institute] so I was able to jump into the second cohort
that they put through that workshop-style training. It was really helpful [because it] allowed me
to start thinking through the challenges of middle management. I was brand-new to this job, I
wasn't exactly sure what I was doing, I was pretty sure I had bit off more than I could chew, and
it was really nice to be able to interact with a bunch of folks that were in similar management
positions to mine. Some people had been doing it for a while but a lot of people were relatively
new to it, at least at their locations. That gave [us] a good place to talk through different
personalities, different styles, different motivations, how you handle [things] when you're
dealing with so many different people, what you do when you don't have any time to do any of
this [and] how you figure out communication. [With regard to the cohort,] I think that the best
thing that happened out of that was a comfort level networking with all of those folks. I don't
rely on them for management support necessarily, but I absolutely rely on the fact that we know
each other [and] we’re relatively comfortable with each other. I at least know what their faces
looks like, I know who they are and I'm comfortable walking up to them and saying “so there's
this thing that we’re trying to figure out…”
A lot of the stuff that [training] was focused on was relationship-building, not just with
customers but how you’re build relationships with your team and with the people [who] are your
peers and the people that you supervise. All of those pieces are tremendously useful. I tend to
use them less in the shiny, directly-out-of-the-box form [to] try to make sure it feels like it's
coming in the natural way that I would talk. A lot of the tips and tricks that came out of that
383

have been relatively easy to remember [and] keep in mind. One of them was SAMs, which is
people’s styles, abilities, and motivations; that's a really useful one for me when I'm dealing with
absolutely anyone, but particularly when I'm working with my team. Remembering that people
have different styles than I do, have different abilities than I do, and they have different
motivations than I do [is important]. That motivation piece is particularly one that is, I think, one
of the hardest ones to wrap your brain around. My motivations are not necessarily somebody
else's motivations for why they're doing what they're doing, so that's a really useful piece when
you're dealing with people who tend to deal with things the same way you do, and it's a useful
thing to keep in mind when you're dealing with people who do things in a different way.

G.10.4.2 Peers, Models, and Mentors
I have learned from my current and previous supervisors. On the side of where things that
remind me where the line might be, I had a supervisor at one point who didn't work the desk area
very often [but when she did,] she was so frustrated with the type of scrap paper we were using
that she put a note on the scrap paper container outlining the exact size that the scrap paper is
supposed to be. That's one that is always in the back of my head, not so much as don't regulate
scrap paper, more as there is a line on where your personal preferences need to be set aside.
That's the one that I try to check in with myself periodically, “okay, are you distressed by this
because there is a legitimate situation or are you distressed because it isn't the way you would've
done it and you're not thinking about the fact that this will still work fine?” If this works for the
other person, you need to just butt out because it doesn't effect the performance, efficiency,
ability to serve customers, ability to work on projects, ability to complete things properly; just let
it go. I think that's one of the ones that I’m just always thinking about because it's like “am I

384

regulating the size of the scrap paper; have I gone completely overboard in my personal
preferences?”
From a positive perspective, I've been really lucky to have some really good managers
who are good at looking at a policy and procedure and explaining [them] but also do a really
good job of talking out loud that process. It's been tremendously useful in how I talk that process
out with my staff, particularly now because we have a new [customer] service standards
document and it feels a lot looser. It’s relationship-based and I think that we, in general, do a
really good job at being relationship-based, particularly at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.
But as we’re feeling out what that looks like, when you're looking at policies and procedures,
looking at every situation as being a unique situation, it takes some things that felt cut and dried
and makes them a lot more nebulous. I've been lucky to have a lot of managers that really talk
that process out. Our head of customer services is really good at [what] we call the let’s-make-adeal game, where we sit down and pull up whatever we’re looking at and say “these are the
things to keep in mind; this is what the customer’s requesting; this is how we feel about how this
scenario is working out; this is what we feel about what were being told; this is what's going to
be the best thing to make this relationship move forward in a positive way; this is the thing that's
going to make sure that we’re not knocking down any load-bearing walls of policy and
procedures that, in the long run, are going to work well for us.” That's a lot to hold together all
at once and it's definitely something where you want to have somebody who has more
experience with those types of scenarios, because the more experience you have as a manager,
the more likely it is that you've run into something that's similar that you can pull from [and]
hopefully not have a knee-jerk reaction.

385

I've had some really good former managers that weren't in libraries that were really
influential [too]. I worked food service for a period of the time and the manager that I had was
great at promoting and supporting us as a team. Even when things were kind of crazy and hairy,
she was good at supporting that. I [also] had a good manager when I worked in a bookstore [who
was] good at being accessible and thinking through things out loud, admitting when she wasn't
sure but talking through something with you [as to] what would work and doing that kind of
trouble shooting on-the-fly. That is a huge part of what anybody does as a manager.
[With regard to peers,] there are some of us that are now Library Services Managers that
don't feel like we necessarily match up with anybody else; we don't have anybody else in the
organization that does something that feels like our exact position. The closest I have is the
manager of Children’s Services at the Main location and she's absolutely a mentor [and] a peer;
she's one of the people I call when I'm trying to work something out. We make it a point to have
lunch with each other a couple of times a year to check in, because of the proximity (we’re down
the street from one another) and knowing what each other's locations are doing and feeling like.
But she is also a [Main] Department head and that is another [thing] entirely and I’m at a branch
location, which means that my life looks different. But the other people that are similar are
Senior Librarians instead of Library Services Managers. They’re positions are very similar to
what I do but just not at the scale. [For example,] I was at a meeting with a group of people and
we were talking about on-boarding the staff [to] the new customer service standards and I
brought up a couple of really specific things [related to challenges around] one of our goals,
“getting to yes.” When [the staff] comes to me with a situation where they’re like “this very
specific thing seems to be keeping us from saying yes; what can we do,” I don't always feel like I
have somebody I can brainstorm with. Certainly I have my direct supervisor [and] I have a lot of

386

peers. But at the end of the day, I don't always feel like there's a group that I can go to where we
can reach a consensus and decide something, even if the decision is [we can decide locally]. In
the process of having that conversation with a group of people, one of my good friends who is a
branch manager said “your problem is that you’re not at branch manager meetings; I think that
you're actually probably the only person who has that specific problem and it's because of what
your job is.” So that actually tells me when I need to be pushing harder on my supervisor to
check back in after a meeting and say “okay, what was decided; was something decided; what
should I be coming back and telling my staff?”

G.10.4.3 Knowledge of Self
A lot of the mistakes that I think about tend to be ones where I misinterpreted somebody else's
personality and styles and motivations for why they're doing what they're doing. That's just a
continual attempt to learn that the way that I process things is significantly different than the way
other people process things. One of the [things] that's hardest for me to remember is that
somebody may come at something in a completely different way than I was expecting but [it]
could still work fine and to let it be if it's working fine. Certainly question it if it's not, but let it
be when it is… [Relatedly,] I am a perfectionist and one of the things that [I’m continually]
learning is when to let something go for me personally and for the people around me and the
world at large. It’s recognizing that things aren’t ever going to be perfect [and that] you don't
have that type of control. I usually say that I'm a recovering perfectionist because I have gotten a
lot better at recognizing that if I try to do every project to the point that I believe is going to be
perfect, it's never going to get turned in, whether it's an assignment or anything else. So [I’m]
living with the messiness.

387

If I have a good day it's because I feel like I did things the way that I wanted, that things
were accomplished in the way that I wanted. If I have a bad day, it is inevitably because I didn't
feel like whatever I was doing passed whatever internal score I had set for how something was
supposed to work. [So] I’m always working at that reflective piece of “what's good enough,
what's okay, what is nobody noticed that this wasn't as good as you wanted it to be except you.”
A former supervisor actually wrote on my yearly review at one point “you could honestly do
things a lot less than what you currently do and you would still be going higher than most people
are going and you'd be fine.” I think that's actually really good feedback to have from a
supervisor [because] I have some staff [who] are also very perfectionist who give 120% on every
single project and sometimes that's my feedback to them: “Wow this is amazing and you can
tone it down 20 notches and still be fine, and if you're feeling completely overwhelmed, I'm
giving you the right to do that.”
This has been an interesting time to have these conversations [with the researcher]. It's
been interesting to have more reflection and to have somebody who's bouncing back “it sounds
like you're saying this.” It's been very interesting, particularly as I've come back from maternity
leave to have somebody that bounces back “so it sounds like this is how you generally deal with
things;” it’s like “yes, that probably is how I generally deal with things.” That's a good thing to
think about, particularly because everything feels especially magnified in how I deal with things
right now because of not having as much sleep as I'd like to have, and all sorts of things in my
life, both personal and professional, feeling really up in the air. Things like being a perfectionist
that I don't think were as magnified before I came back from maternity leave feel a lot more
magnified and it's useful to be able to take a step back and do a very deliberate moment of

388

reflection and go “oh, I should think about that; this is a part of you and you need to pay
attention to that.”
