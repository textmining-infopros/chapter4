Abstract
This study focuses on the process of transitioning a traditional high school library to the
learning commons service model. The study identifies the requirements of the model and the
factors that either promote or undermine the success of the transition.
A general inductive approach based on qualitative research was used to collect and
analyze data obtained from three high school librarians who self-identified as having
successfully transitioned a high school library to a learning commons. The two research
questions for the study were: (1) What factors determine a successful transition? (2) What factors
undermine or threaten the transition? Data was collected through multiple methods including:
field notes from site visits, review of participant created websites, as well as interviews
conducted in person, by telephone, and by video conference. Coding was used to sort and
evaluate data that identified categories and themes that influenced the success of the transition.
The transition to a learning commons is analyzed in the context of the tragedy of the
commons scenario (Hardin, 1968). The tragedy scenario has its roots in pre-Roman England
when farmers grazed their livestock in communally held fields. The growth in demand for the
common fields led to increasing herd sizes with no corresponding incentive to maintain the
shared resource, leading ultimately to overuse, depletion, herd starvation, and collapse. The
tragedy scenario has been applied to analogous issues such as over-fishing, deforestation, and in
this study, the highly demanded resources of a modern learning commons.

Transitioning a high school library to a learning commons: Avoiding the tragedy of the commons
Chapter 1: Introduction
School libraries are iconic, and this is their strength as well as weakness. Everyone has a
clear image of the high school library as a place of hushed silence where no food or drinks, or
cell phones are allowed. The librarian rules over all from the circulation desk, and acts as a
gatekeeper of resources.
In their pre-Internet role, libraries served as repositories of human thought, and as a point
of public contact to access the trove of print resources. Between the years of 1993 and 2003
academic librarians noted a shift in usage (Beagle, 2009). This shift coincided with the advent of
the Internet and search engines such as Google, traditional print sources were replaced by digital
sources, and the library was no longer the only point of public access. Libraries began to respond
to the shift by installing computer workstations, and the creation of community work areas that
supported the integration of technology and the acquisition of the digital skills required in this
new information environment. Libraries have been steadily evolving over the past three decades,
and today provide patrons with skilled staff and services that range from technology instruction
to assistance and instruction in information retrieval, processing, and presentation in a variety of
formats (Beagle, 1999).
In response to dramatic changes in digital information and the new skills associated with
the to access and synthesis of diverse resources, many academic libraries have transitioned to a
new service model called the “learning commons” (Beagle, 1999). A learning commons is a
technology rich environment where students can access material in diverse formats, engage in
individual and collaborative work to synthesize and share their learning (Loertscher, Koechlin, &
Zwan, 2008). The learning commons service model has migrated from colleges and universities,

12
and is now growing in popularity at the secondary school level. In high schools the learning
commons offers traditional library services and instruction, but is also designed to promote
enhanced support in accessing digital resources and diverse technologies. Additionally, it also
serves as a place for community gathering, professional development, and media production
(Diggs, 2009).
The Tragedy of the Commons
The seminal article The Tragedy of the Commons describes the unique challenge of
maintaining a community-shared resource (Hardin, 1968). The “tragedy of the commons” was
identified by Hardin as a phenomenon rooted in pre-Roman English agrarian tradition (Hardin,
1968). This phenomenon is centered on the tradition of common pastureland shared by village
residents for the communal grazing of herds. For centuries herd sizes were naturally kept in
check because of disease, predators, theft, and war. With improvements in animal husbandry and
stabilization of society, herd sizes began to increase. Each farmer had incentive to increase herd
size, but no obligation to contribute to the maintenance of the common pasture. Over time the
pastures became overused and depleted, leading to their collapse and the destruction of this
common asset. Hardin’s tragedy of the commons has been applied to other examples of
commonly held assets such as the Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic fish stocks (Crowe, 1969).
As described by Hardin in his description of the tragedy, there was an evolution in the
nature of the shared resource, and this evolution brought new demands and needs (1968). In
1989 Robert Lucky wrote, “Now we are too many for a village commons, and our issues are too
complex for the few who govern. It knows no political boundaries, and will soon be available to
everyone. Perhaps a new degree of human wisdom will eventually be enabled” (p. 125). Just as
there were too many animals for the village commons, so, too, there are new categories of

13
demands and needs that threaten to overwhelm the traditional school library and undermine its
effectiveness. This vision of networked access to digital information has come to pass, and now
library patrons needed more than access. They require skilled support professionals to teach them
the skills to access and use digital forms of information in an environment designed to support
information gathering and production technologies. This evolution resulted in the learning
commons.
The Problem
The problem addressed in this study is a lack of understanding of the various elements of
the learning commons that are required for a successful transition and implementation of the
model (Crowe, 1969). High school libraries are responding to changes in digital information and
media literacy by moving away from the traditional service model towards a learning commons
model that supports 21st century learning goals for students (Loertscher, Koechlin, & Zwaan,
2011). This transition involves systemic changes and a different approach towards long-term
strategic planning, pedagogy, collaborative planning and teaching, budgeting, student
scheduling, library technology infrastructure, ongoing technology support, and curriculum
leadership (Koechlin, Rosenfeld, & Loertscher, 2010). Unless there is appropriate planning for a
learning commons there are challenges that can undermine the success of such a transition.
Through the application of a post-positivist theoretical framework it will be possible to gather
multiple perspectives from school librarian participants and through data gathering and synthesis,
identify the potential challenges presented by a transition (Creswell, 2012). This knowledge will
help school librarians and school principals develop communication and understanding of the
challenges and needs of the learning commons model and prepare appropriately for a successful
transition.

14
This research seeks to apply the phenomenon of the tragedy of the agricultural commons
to the high school learning commons, which is also a shared community asset that can suffer
from over use, poor maintenance, and collapse. Determining the requirements of a successful
transition, and the factors that can either support or undermine the transition, will assist school
librarians in avoiding a tragedy scenario.
Problem Statement
Due to a lack of understanding between high school principals and high school librarians
regarding the transitional and ongoing requirements of the learning commons service model,
many schools may face unexpected challenges when they attempt the transition from the
traditional library service model to a full implementation of the learning commons model. The
problem of practice suggests that preparation for the transition needs to involve community
stakeholders in all aspects of the change, and adequate planning for the various service and
support domains required by the model, ranging from technology, systems, administration, and
enhanced employee training and professional development (Baily & Tierney, 2002). Community
stakeholders include the school librarian, students, principals, vice principals, teachers,
technology specialists, other school specialists, support staff, volunteers, parents and community,
and district administration (Koechlin, Rosenfeld, & Loertscher, 2010, p. 3). For schools that
value and promote global connections and learning, stakeholders may also include experts and
partners from around the world. To transition from traditional services to a learning commons
model requires consideration across a range of issues that include changes in staff training from
book-centric skills to technology based skills, changes in floor plan, changes in budgeting,
administrative areas, and potentially other unidentified areas. A general inductive approach will
be used to the explore the experiences of three participating Massachusetts high school librarians

15
who have engaged in a transition process, and thereby discover categories from the raw data that
will indicate the most important themes for a school librarian to consider when planning a
transition (Thomas, 2011).
Significance Statement
The evolution of the traditional library to the information or learning commons has
created new paths of scholarly inquiry, and requires students to develop new information seeking
skills (Labaree, 1996). School libraries have always been a common resource in schools, but as
technology has increased the abundance and accessibility of information, it has also increased the
speed and demand for space to work and digitally produce material that provides evidence of
learning (Larabee, 2003). The conditions have increased pressure on school libraries to perform
new services and provide new domains of support defined as the learning commons (Holmgren,
2010). If the new demands that are placed on the learning commons are not recognized and
properly provisioned, this shared resource will not function properly and will fail to effectively
support student learning.
The learning commons model is based on establishing a school-wide approach to
teaching and learning for both students and teachers. This learning partnership revolves around
the creation of shared goal of improving the learning and achievement of each student (Koechlin,
Zwaan, & Loertscher, 2008). The model consists of a physical space that serves as a showcase
for the best teaching and learning in the school. This may take the form of the display of student
work, student presentations, and innovative professional development for teachers as well as
students. It is a place where classroom teachers can gather to work collaboratively on new
curricula and make use of the technology and the rich resources to “collaboratively design, build,
implement, and assess knowledge-building learning activities (Koechlin et al., 2010, p. 10). The

16
learning commons values collaborative work, and the noise that accompanies this type of
engagement. It also provides the technology tools required by such work in the form of a
wireless network, access to computers, laptops, scanners, and printers. It also provides
technology and skilled support for students engaged in video production and the associated tools
and platforms required by such activities. The physical learning commons is also where
educational and technology specialists gather for professional work, and to also work
collaboratively to reduce professional isolation and increase communication, employ cooperative
problem solving, explore innovative practices. It is a busy, dynamic area of school life, and an
essential part of a student’s educational experience.
The learning commons is more than a physical space, but is also a virtual learning center.
Student learning is ongoing and occurs in school, at home, and in other off-site locations. By
providing 24/7/365 support, students can access the resources and digital tools made available by
the learning commons to engage in learning and knowledge creation wherever they may be
working.
In addition to the instruction, services, and supports provided by the model, the mandate
of the learning commons is to prepare students for life long learning via four learning literacy
keystones (Koechlin et al., 2008). The knowledge-building keystone focuses on inquiry skills
that begin with establishing background knowledge and expand to questioning, finding and
evaluating information, reading/viewing/listening to gain understanding, drawing conclusions,
and sharing and assessing their inquiry process. Through this process student develop personal
qualities that include positive attitudes toward learning, responsibility, ethical behavior,
creativity, and self-assessment. Students are not only information-literate, but have the skills to

17
be life-long learners, and people that are ready for advanced education and problem-solving in
the real world.
By serving as the center for school-wide efforts to improve teaching and learning, the
learning commons is the center for collaborative work and serves as a learning laboratory. This is
where innovation, experimentation, and learning strategies are developed, and action research is
employed to evaluate progress and effectiveness. This focused, goal-oriented collaboration
results in school-wide improvement (Koechlin et al., 2008).
The technology keystone features access to technology tools and platforms, but more
importantly, the learning commons provides an environment that supports students in developing
the digital skills to participate effectively in the digital world. The construction of personal
information environments where they can organize and store information and resources, as well
learn about ethical social networking skills, are part of the technology keystone domain
(Koechlin et al., 2008)
Taking the physical and virtual learning commons, and the learning keystones, the model
provides students with a comfortable environment to relax, learn, and create. It provides 24/7
digital-access to content and resources curated by the school librarian to support curricular and
student needs. Assistance is readily available from skilled staff and technology is current and
abundant (Koechlin et al., 2008). It is also a center of activity, display, student productions, and
serves as the cultural heart of the school. Teachers view the learning commons as an extension of
their classrooms and also utilize the 24/7 digital resources that support their curriculum. Teachers
also turn to the learning commons for assistance for their students as well as for themselves, and
value the cultural role that values and showcases student learning and achievement.

18
The benefits of transitioning to a learning commons include changing attitudes toward
technology in education and learning, new information seeking behaviors, the acquisition of
digital and media skills, and more opportunities for collaborative work in an environment that
supports new types of student learning. Digital resources also provide increased accommodation
of text-to-speech functionality for students with reading disabilities, and an overall increase in
the vitality of the learning commons as an effective resource for students (Malenfant, 2006). The
benefits of the transition are numerous, but also require new administrative considerations, new
budgeting strategies, and staffing considerations that were not applicable in the traditional school
library (Heitsch & Holley, 2011).
An example of an area of stress that threatens the viability of the learning commons is
overuse by students who want to use the space to socialize, leaving no room for students intent
on scholarly use (Schilling & Cousins, 1990). School librarians and administrators need to
understand that transitioning from a traditional service model to a learning commons does not
imply a transition of the space to a social area. Collaborative work and learning in a social setting
are elements of the learning commons, but new policies need to be created that guide students in
appropriate use, and protect the rights of all students.
Identifying the categories and themes that either contribute to a successful transition, or
that undermine a successful transition, will be helpful to school librarian practitioners and their
stake-holder partners embarking on implementing a learning commons service model in their
own schools.
Research Question
The research questions are designed to explore the factors that positively or negatively influence
the transition from a traditional high school library to a learning commons model.

19
What are the factors that influence a transition from a traditional high school library to a learning
commons service model?
•

What factors determine a successful transition?

•

What factors undermine or threaten the transition?
This exploratory design allows for an “in-depth analysis of complex and layered issues”

and a hypothesis on the requirements for success (Butin, 2010, p. 80).
Positionality Statement
A challenge faced in public high school libraries today is that while school librarians and
school administrators understand that the world of information has changed from being bookbased to digitally based, they are unsure how they should address these changes within their high
schools. The learning commons is an established model that incorporates the 21st century digital
information environment, and there is great curiosity as to what makes it different from a
traditional high school library (Loertscher, Koechlin, & Zwann, 2008). While the literature is
abundant on the benefits of the learning commons model, there is less information available on
the specific requirements of a transition.
I transitioned my high school library to a learning commons in 2008, and in the years
since have had numerous calls, emails and site visits from school librarians and their
administrators seeking information on the model, and what it might look like in their schools.
Ideally, visits involve the school librarian, principal, and an inter-disciplinary team who have all
been briefed on the model, and are clear about the goals of the site visit. Their questions are
specific and focus on topics such as the impact on curriculum, the integration of digital and
media skills into student work, the role of the librarian as a collaborator, and the impact on
school culture with regard to student use of the space, study halls, and student accountability.

20
Team visits indicate a school-wide interest in change, and a need for organizational planning
based on specific student-based goals and outcomes. The discussion is rich, and the team leaves
with a new level of understanding of the possibilities offered by the model, and questions and
considerations for implementation in their own school.
Not all visits are as productive. When the librarian comes by him/herself, or with a
principal or one cooperating teacher, there is less likelihood of a full, organizational response
that includes curriculum and technology leaders as well as the administrative team. As the model
is one designed to support schools in developing more collaborative practice, whole school
change focused on technology rich, collaborative learning requires a shared vision (Koechlin et
al., 2010). Team visits signal broader discussions within the school and increases the likelihood
of a successful transition paired with the school goals. The problem addressed by my research
topic has manifested itself repeatedly during the solo or small team visits; school librarians
explain that their principal or superintendent has requested that the library “change” into a
learning commons. These requests are frustrating for school librarians who feel they are unable
to institute a transition for various reasons such as their library serves as a study hall location and
there is no room for visiting classes, or they have no budget for technology or databases, and
more commonly, that they have no voice in curriculum or school leadership. They may be able to
change the name, but without understanding the changes in function and service, they cannot
effectively address 21st century student learning outcomes, and will be unable to successfully
transition to the new model. Exploring the categories and themes from school librarians who
have engaged in the transition will increase understanding and awareness of possible barriers to
implementation, and the conditions required for a successful transition.
Professional Context

21
In 2007 I was hired as the head librarian of Concord-Carlisle Regional High School
(CCHS), in Massachusetts. CCHS is located about twenty miles west of Boston, and based on
results from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS), is a high achieving
school.

Note. Data obtained from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education

CCHS has participated in the Metropolitan for Educational Opportunity (Metco) program since
it’s founding in 1966. The program is the longest continually running voluntary school
desegregation program in the US. The mission of Metco is to “give students from Boston’s

22
under-performing school districts the opportunity to attend a high-performing school and
increase their educational opportunities and to decrease racial isolation and increase diversity in
the suburban schools (Metco Program, 2014).
The Concord-Carlisle core values, beliefs, and learning expectations statement says that
the “CCHS community believes that it is our mission to inspire the students of Concord, Carlisle,
and Boston to strive for and meet high levels of personal and academic achievement. We believe
that the respectful, supportive, and engaging learning environment at CCHS instills intellectual
curiosity, a passion for learning, as well as an understanding of one’s role in the local community
and in a diverse global society”(Concord-Carlisle Regional High School, 2015).
This was an in-district move, and after eight years as a K-5 school librarian, I was well
known by our school and district administrators. This strong foundation provided me with an
enormous amount of trust and support as I considered changes to the existing high school library
program. In October of 2008 an article was published in School Library Journal that gave voice
and structure to my vision of what a dynamic, 21st century high school library could look like,
and the vocabulary and outcomes I needed in order to communicate my vision (Loertscher,
2008). The article, Flip this library: School libraries need a revolution by Dr. David Loertscher,
described the high school learning commons as having domains of service, of existing as a
physical space as well as a virtual space, as an experiential learning environment designed to
support students as well as faculty and other learning specialists. As a technology rich hub it was
also described as a place dedicated to the school community, and ownership of the program is
described as shared, dynamic, and evolving. The article also contained a table that described the
elements of the paradigm flip that the shift from library to learning commons required
(Loertscher, 2008). Dr. Loertscher is a widely recognized leader in the field of school

23
librarianship, and the author the many textbooks used in school librarian certification programs.
His article stated that the paradigm of traditional school library had been broken by disruptive
technologies, such as Google and other online search tools. A revolution was required to meet
the new learning goals for students in the digital era, and the new learning commons was the
service model that would meet these new demands (Loertscher, 2008). This vision became the
road map for change that I was able to share with my administrative team, and their enthusiastic
support created a strong foundation for success. At the time I didn’t realize how crucial this trust
and support would be to the transition process. As a scholar-practitioner this is important because
it highlights the necessity of professional trust when implementing institutional change. When I
shared the vision of the learning commons for CCHS my administrators responded with
enthusiasm and offers of support, and that gave me the confidence to institute change. Not all
school library practitioners have this exceptional level of support. Providing my fellow librarians
with more detailed information and data will help them establish the conditions required for
success, many of which I took for granted, and avoid the tragedy of an unsuccessful
implementation of the learning commons service model.
Unsuccessful transitions are difficult to identify. At this time there are no state
requirements for reporting on school libraries. The New England Association of Schools and
Colleges (NEASC) accreditation standards include school libraries in Standard 6: School
Resources for learning, and require that:
Library/media services are integrated into curriculum and instructional practices and have an
adequate number of certified/licensed personnel and support staff who:
•

Are actively engaged in the implementation of the school's curriculum

24
•

Provide a wide range of materials, technologies, and other information services in
support of the school's curriculum

•

Ensure that the facility is available and staffed for students and teachers before,
during, and after school

•

Are responsive to students' interests and needs in order to support independent
learning

•

Conduct ongoing assessment using relevant data, including feedback from the
school community, to improve services and ensure each student achieves the
school’s 21st century learning expectations (New England Association of Schools
and College Committee on Public Secondary Schools, 2011)

Accreditation does not depend on the state of the high school library, and it is possible for
a school to be reaccredited with a sub-standard library. A school may be put on warning status in
that standard, but there is no other consequence. This library data is not collected by the state,
and is not aggregated by NEASC, so it is difficult to obtain data on school libraries with
unsuccessful transition experiences. Those with positive transitions are eager to share within the
professional community of school librarians, and self-identify as having successful transition
experiences.
Bias
In order to be successful, it is important for me to thoroughly examine the potential for
bias. If I do not adequately identify my bias, it is possible that my research will be compromised
(Machi & McEvoy, 2009). While conducting this study, it was important for me to avoid the
marginalization of the “other”, specifically with regard to school librarians who work in districts
with constricted budgets and fewer economic resources, or those who have other systemic

25
barriers to their ability to enact the transition (Briscoe, 2005). Some school districts are more
progressive and amenable to change and others more conservative and distrustful of change.
There are also potential issues of privilege in the form of economic disparities, with schools from
well-funded suburban towns better able to fund a transition than poorer urban and rural districts
(Moser & Rubenstein, 2002). In gathering data, I tried to avoid assuming a universal perspective
of privilege, because it can threaten to marginalize and disenfranchise others, identified as school
librarians with barriers in understanding of the learning commons model, or who have barriers to
implementation of the model. Another potential for bias lied in my enthusiasm for my topic, and
preconceptions about what is “right”. These preconceptions are rooted in both my privileged
background as a middle class white woman, and in my privilege of having experienced a
successful, well-supported transition to a learning commons.
Participants
Potential participants are three professionally certified Massachusetts public high school
librarians. The participants in the study were identified through professional membership to the
MSLA, and participation was voluntary. Membership to the Massachusetts School Library
Association (MSLA) indicated that the participants had a shared value for ongoing professional
development in their field, as well as an interest in collegial engagement with fellow school
library practitioners. This served as a commonality between the three sites despite potential
differences in school building cultures.
Conclusion
In conclusion, my positionality was aligned with that of the study participants through
our common roles as public high school librarians, but needed to be sensitive to the reality that
conditions in school libraries vary greatly. I was careful in my data gathering not to assume

26
privilege, and I constructed questions that effectively probed the perceptions of the participants
with a broad range of understanding, and different budgetary realities. I took special care not to
allow my enthusiasm for my topic, or my preconceptions about the requirements to successfully
transition from a traditional school library to a learning commons, influence the study.
Theoretical Framework
For this qualitative analysis the interpretive paradigm was used as it allowed the
researcher to gather diverse sources of data and uncover patterns and themes that address the
questions of factors that promote and undermine a successful transition (Burrell and Morgan,
1979). Through research into the experiences of the participating high school librarians it was
possible to investigate their frame of reference as a participant in the transition process, and gain
greater understanding into the dynamics and critical aspects of the process. Using an inductive
approach, the researcher collected diverse forms of data that included documents, observed
behavior, and interviews with participants (Creswell, 2012). In this way themes and categories
were developed that identified the factors that either promote or undermine an effective
transition.
In Ponterotto’s discussion of qualitative methods and research paradigms the importance
of everyday language and situating the participants within the context of the research question is
central to the collection, analysis and interpretation of data (2005). A general inductive approach
builds upon the constructivist-interpretivist paradigm and lays the groundwork for a qualitative
study that places the reality of the participant in the center of the inquiry (Thomas, 2011). The
gathering of data through general inductive analysis allows the researcher to generate a theory
within the context of the paradigm (Anfara & Mertz, 2006).

Chapter 2: Literature Review
This literature review establishes the learning commons as a shared resource, and
identifies the unique considerations and needs required to establish it as a robust service model
that supports student learning and school goals. It also covers the history of high school libraries
in the U.S., and the influences that contributed toward the evolution of the learning commons
model. The summation provides the requirements of the learning commons model, and the
relevance to student learning.
The Learning Commons
In order to understand the requirements of the learning commons it is helpful to review
the history of school libraries in the U.S., and how the learning commons evolved. This history
also tracks the shift from libraries as repositories for print material to centers that facilitate and
support access to purely digital resources. The shift in associated digital literacy skills and digital
production skills are also part of the evolution.
School libraries are in the middle of massive and disruptive change. With the traditional
role of libraries as storage spaces for books eroded by the shift towards new digital delivery of
information in diverse formats, and new emphasis information and digital skills for students,
librarians and school administrators are looking into new service models for libraries.
The strongest new high school model to emerge is the learning commons, based on the
information commons, which has been widely implemented at the higher education level
(Heitsch & Holley, 2011). There are profound differences between traditional school libraries
and learning commons, and simply switching the name is insufficient to achieve the new mission
(Beagle, 2009). These changes include increased technology, wireless access for mobile devices,
new floor plans and furniture that support collaborative work, increased budgets for databases

28
and digital resources of information, increased professional development for library staff to
manage the technology, increased administrative power and a role in school leadership for the
librarian, and a commitment to collaboratively planned lessons that promote information and
media literacy skills throughout the curriculum. School librarians and administrators are not
always aware or appreciate these requirements for a successful transition from a traditional
library to a learning commons (Koechlin, Zwann, & Loertscher, October 2008). Unless the
learning commons is adequately provisioned to provide the new services required, there is the
potential that student services will not be improved, and there will be a failure of the model
(Hardin, 1968).
A clear understanding of how the learning commons benefits students is also the
foundation for a successful transition. The literature indicates that libraries need to remain
relevant and support learning in new ways (Todd & Kuhlthau, 2004). The challenge for school
libraries is recognizing that because of the Internet and Web 2.0 applications, students have new
powers and abilities that facilitate independent access to information (Watstein & Mitchell,
2006). Librarians no longer serve as gatekeepers and custodians of information, but facilitators
who instruct independent users to access and evaluate resources for themselves. The commons
model provides a way to consolidate diverse student support services such as writing centers,
tutorial services, collaborative work spaces and computer labs, and also offers a space that
supports students in multitasking between their digital work, and the work that occurs in
classrooms (Spencer, 2006).
The circumstances that have created confusion about the current role and relevance of
traditional high school libraries lie in the rise of Internet technologies that transformed the
information landscape. Today information is central to every aspect of life, and because of

29
perceptions of ubiquitous access it is considered much like air in that it is pervasive, considered
not to have cost associated with it, and taken for granted (Melody, 1987). Information is
essentially a societal good, and a shared asset. The “broad information structures” upon which a
national economy is built are also an information commons (Melody, 1987, p. 1317). The
institutional changes this evolution has had on society and economies reverberate throughout the
informational landscape, with profound implications for high school libraries.
The History of U.S. High School Libraries
School libraries have always served as a communal resource in schools, but as
technology has increased the abundance and accessibility of information, it has also increased the
speed and demand for space and the resources to work and digitally produce material that
provide evidence of learning (Larabee, 2003). These conditions have increased pressure on
school libraries to perform new services and provide new domains of support defined as the
learning commons (Holmgren, 2010). If the new demands that are placed on the learning
commons are not recognized and properly provisioned, this common resource will not function
properly, and will fail to effectively support student learning.
Dewey’s Model School
John Dewey’s model school placed the library at the heart of the physical structure,
positioned at the crossroads of all wings of the school. The mission of the school library was to
support students in pursuit of their learning in order to better understand and make connections
between the theoretical work of the classroom and, by facilitating connections with the broader
community, assist student in establishing practical applications with the world at large (Dewey,
2001). Dewey perceived the high school librarian as a facilitator for students to acquire
information to pursue a wide variety of interests, and he describes the library as the place

30
students turn to with problems, questions, and facts in order to discuss them with others through
collaborative work, and in this way develop new understanding (Dewey, 2001). Dewey’s vision
of the library as a collaborative hub of inter-disciplinary engagement was replaced by the library
as a storage facility for curriculum support resources, and reflects the changes seen in the
standardization of US educational system during the same period.
Establishing School Libraries
The National Council for Education (NCE) was established in 1857, with the mission to
develop common standards for schools in the U.S. In 1892, committees reported on accreditation
requirements and established the first standards for secondary schools. Between 1883-1892, the
National Education Association (NEA) formed sub-committees to establish standards
specifically for secondary school curriculum. The subcommittees for history, civic government,
and political economy mentioned the essential need for school libraries, specifically in order for
students to have access to reference materials and additional books beyond the class textbook
(Cornelius, 2009). The sub-committee for English also recommended the establishment of school
libraries to house literary masterpieces to supplement teacher assigned textbooks.
The school library at this point is focused on supporting curriculum and providing
students access to various sections of the collection of books curated to support the school
learning expectations. This paradigm of use led libraries to be book-centered, designed to
prioritize the efficient organization of books rather than prioritizing the needs of the studentpatrons (Heitsch & Holley, 2011). At this point, Dewey’s vision of a student-centered library that
facilitates connections with the broader community is institutionally lost.

31
The Great Society and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik, the first orbiting
satellite. The US was shaken by the technological achievement of the Soviets, and the result was
a widespread call for the government to take action. Overcoming long-held resistance to federal
aid in education, the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was passed, and focused on
funding targeted towards improving instruction in math and the sciences ("United States Senate
History"). In 1965 the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) followed, and the focus
shifted from defense to the goals of President Johnson’s Great Society programs. The Great
Society represented a legislative strategy to eliminate the underlying causes of poverty and
promote educational opportunity (McGuinn & Hess, 2005). These programs were designed to
allocate federal funding for primary and secondary schools, establish a national curriculum,
establish methods to hold schools accountable for their performance, and increase educational
equity across the nation ("Education," 2013). Title II of the ESEA of 1965 provides federal
funding to stock school libraries, and for the first time establishes the role of school libraries at
both the secondary and elementary levels (Bureau of School Systems, 1965). This act was a
central component of President Johnson’s war on poverty and was the first significant federal
initiative into what had previously been the sole domain of state and local authorities (McGuinn
& Hess, 2005). This was a critical time for school libraries as it established the necessity of
school libraries throughout the K-12 educational system in the US.
The Standards
The Certain Standards
The American Library Association (ALA) published their first school standards in 1920
in a report titled Standard Library Organization and Equipment for Secondary Schools (National

32
Education Association of the United States Department of Secondary Teachers Committee on
Library Organization and Equipment, 1920). The report provides guidelines for state high
school library inspectors on standards the library collection and equipment, qualifications for the
school librarian, information on the instructional use of the library and maintenance of the
collection, and collection size guidelines based on the number of students enrolled in the school.
That same year, the Chair of the NEA English sub-committee, Charles C. Certain, authored the
Certain School Library Standards that focused on collection development and library
management (Cornelius, 2009). In 1925 a companion report was issued establishing standards
for elementary schools. The 1920 and 1925 Certain School Library Standards remained
unchanged until after World War II. The standards were quantitative and focused on facility
management issues such as reporting per student budget allocation and books per student
(Cornelius, 2009). The Certain Standards were valuable because for the first time they call
attention to the need for a professionally trained school librarian to maintain and manage the
school collection, and highlighted that the specialized skills of a librarian were required to
transform what was little more than a study room into a fully functional library focused on
student inquiry.
The educational standards for school libraries were revised in 1945 to reflect the
introduction of audiovisual equipment into the school library, and also broaden the role of the
library as having the distinct purpose of helping students develop the skills and habits of using
books and libraries to achieve goals throughout their lives. The 1945 standards also state that the
school library falls under school board jurisdiction and must be part of district and school
budgets, and that a school library does not exists without a librarian, a book collection, and
library quarters (Roscello, 2004). The ALA published new standards in 1960 and again in 1969.

33
The 1969 standards changed the name of the school library to the media center, the school
librarian was re-named the library-media specialist, and schools across the US widely adopted
the new naming conventions. The standards published in 1975 focused on library design,
consultation on curriculum, information skills instruction, and media center administration.
Information Power
Information Power was published by the American Association of School Librarians
(AASL) in 1988, and revised again in 1998. These standards addressed the integration of digital
information and media, and increased computerization. They represented a shift in objective
from teaching students to find information, to teaching them how to use it more effectively, and
present their learning in diverse formats (Cornelius, 2009). In 2006 the AASL published
Standards for the 21st Century Learner, and focused on information, media and digital literacy
skills for students, across a number of domains. In 2008 the AASL published a three-to-five year
national implementation plan called Learning4Life (AASL Standards and Guidelines
Implementation Task Force, 2008). The plan was designed to create a share vision for the 21st
century learner based on the 2006 standards, and identifies strategies and tools to achieve the
goals of the plan, and also build an evaluation process to assess school library programs for
effective instruction and identify program exemplars that could be shared locally and nationally.
The Emergence of the Learning Commons
In the 1980s academic libraries saw a shift toward a more patron-friendly and learning
centered service, generally described as the “library as a place” movement (Spencer, 2006). This
“library as a place” emerged as a result of academic libraries experimenting with new uses for
their library spaces that reflected the unique needs and interests of their communities (Freeman,
2005). Librarians became increasingly involved in creating new programs and services that

34
promoted the library as a social space devoted to supporting student learning outside the
classroom. During the 1990s, the information commons developed to provide a technology rich
environment for users to easily access digital resources, described as “a cluster of network access
points and associated IT tools situated in the context of physical, digital, human, and social
resources organized in support of learning” (Beagle, 2006, as cited by Heitsch & Holley, 2011, p.
65). The learning commons built upon the “support of learning” value, and enhanced services
and skills instruction to create an environment that supported knowledge creation and selfdirected learning (Heitsch & Holley, 2011). In this evolution library work was no longer
primarily about information retrieval, but about assisting patrons in building a broad context of
understanding, developing digital skills, and making connections, and through that process
transforming information into new knowledge (Beagle, 1999).
Recognizing that the role and function of the 21st century school library had evolved
because of advances in technology, the traditional school library as a warehouse of books was no
longer a relevant service model (Heitsch & Holley, 2011). The transition to learning commons
would also entail a focus on client-centered programs, access to global resources, and deep
partnership with teacher technologists and other learning specialists (Koechlin et al., 2010). The
first documented implementation of the learning commons model at the high school level
occurred in 2009, in Chelmsford, MA. The transition involved a substantial renovation, new
furnishings, investment in new technology, an active campaign to re-orient the school library
program as being student-centered, and that built community within a social context, and the
creation of fresh collaborative relationships with the academic departments (Diggs, 2009). This
implementation was highlighted in school library publications and began to spread via articles
and state and national conference presentations by the school librarian. Other researchers in the

35
field such as Dr. David Loertscher and Dr. Ross Todd also actively promoted the model in
academic and professional publications and referenced the Chelmsford transition as a successful
example of implementation of the learning commons model.
Impact on Student Achievement
The Student Learning through Ohio School Libraries research study was conducted from
October 2002 – December 2003. The Ohio Educational Library Media Association (OELMA)
conducted it in collaboration with the Ohio Department of Education, and designed the study to
demonstrate the impact of school libraries on student achievement (Todd & Kuhlthau, 2004).
This study validates the findings of a series of other statewide studies of school libraries
conducted in Colorado, Alaska, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Oregon, Massachusetts, Iowa,
Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, and Texas.
The Ohio study involved 3000 schools with school libraries that provided service to over
3 million students, and focused on student perceptions of the help they received from the school
library. It also assessed these perceptions against how the school library was provisioned in
resources, information technology, space, information-learning leadership and informationlearning initiatives. The aggregated data indicated that irrespective of socioeconomic indicators,
academic success as measured by standardized test scores validated that the presence of a school
library was a consistent predictor of academic achievement (Todd & Kuhlthau, 2004). The
findings of the study were clear, that in schools with adequately provisioned school libraries
(defined by the study as being staffed by a professional certified school librarians and as having a
book and supply budget appropriate to the school size) students learn and achieve.
Educational Equity

36
The Internet has turned research into a more independent activity, and students require
instruction in the information skills required to search effectively across diverse formats and in
evaluating their search findings. Access to technology to learn these skills and gain practice and
fluency is not available to all because of socioeconomic inequalities. Students from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds, many of whom are students of color, are not developing Internet
skills at the same rates as their white and more economically advantaged peers. More advantaged
students have access to technology in their homes, or own personal devices, and this exposure
gives them more opportunities to practice skills, participate in social media, and experience
content creation. Student with less exposure to technology are at a disadvantage when applying
to colleges and for jobs. Known as the “digital divide,” this gap is characterized by barriers to
access, formal skill development, and a general lack of daily access to technology experienced
by other students (Hargittai, 2010). This domain of inequity is one that can be uniquely
addressed by the learning commons, and the technology rich environment designed to foster and
support access and skill development for all (Loertscher, Koechlin, & Zwann, 2011).
Studies of Internet access and usage by young people in North America, the United
Kingdom, and Europe show quickly increasing integration of information and communication
technologies that indicate the digital divide is closing (Asselin & Doiron, 2008). However, a
“participation divide” has emerged, based on socioeconomic status (Hargittai & Walejko, 2008,
as cited by Asselin & Doiron). Students from higher socioeconomic classes are engaging in the
creation of web content in greater numbers, and building the associated skills, at greater rates
than students from lower economic classes. In what is referred to as the “era of
informationalism” higher economic class students are developing communication skills, gaining
experience in navigation across multiple platforms to engage in creative activities and problem-

37
solving, are making connections with people and content from global sources, and are generally
more empowered and optimistic about their future potential as workers (Castells, 2000, as cited
by Asselin & Doiron).
The digital and participation divide impacts people of color at higher rates than whites. In
2006 a study was conducted on the digital divide and academic achievement and explored the
relationship between access to technology and academic achievement (Huang & Russell, 2006).
The findings of the study showed that there was a digital divide that corresponded to
socioeconomic factors, and that students from disadvantaged families with limited access to
technology also had lower achievement rates than their financially better off peers. At the time of
the study, Blacks and Hispanics had the lowest household Internet penetration rates of 23.5% and
23.6%, respectively. These rates were below the national Internet penetration rate of 41.5%
(Huang & Russell). Another finding of the study was that school libraries, public libraries, and
other public access points served those groups that did not have home access.
The high school library is a primary place for students to access the Internet and learn the
information and digital literacy skills required to become proficient users, and close the
participation divide (Asselin & Doiron, 2008). In Canada, school library researchers developed a
study for a pedagogical framework for school library programs in an Internet 2.0 environment.
The framework was based on three questions:
1. Who are the new learners of the Net Generation?
2. What literacies do today’s students need to live and work in the world?
3. How do we teach the new learners?
Data was gathered from an extensive literature review that focused on the three questions
and involved national and international sources. Videotaped interviews of fourteen teenagers

38
were conducted to enrich the findings from the literature review, and small focus groups were
held with students about their technology usage in school and at home (Asselin & Doiron, 2008).
The study revealed that despite claims that technology was embedded in schoolwork, in
fact students did not get much exposure to the skills and platforms identified as critical for the
Net Generation. Most students gained experience through home use with personal devices. Those
students who had the most exposure to technology during school hours identified their school
libraries as the source for engagement in social media and web-based creation platforms. School
libraries provide students with access to technology to gain experience with technological
literacy skills defined by the study as inquiry and problem solving, critical thinking and source
evaluation, ethics and social responsibility, and creative representation (Asselin & Doiron,
2008).
Identifying the Elements of the Learning Commons
Physical Space
A learning commons values flexible space that is not dominated by either books or
computers, but rather by collaborative groups engaged in a wide variety of activities. There are
two simultaneous functions that coexist and also extend into a third, virtual realm. The first is the
“open commons”, which is student-centered. In this wireless environment students and faculty
engage in both collaborative and independent activities, with flexible access to the facility
throughout the day. It is a collegial, social environment that is owned by the school community,
and is one where people flow in and out, working in diverse ways, with unencumbered access
(Loertscher, Koechlin, & Zwaan, 2011).
The second space is the experimental learning center that supports faculty in achieving
their goals for their students, showcasing achievements, and facilitating professional

39
development in ways that range from locating scholarly resources to organizing and hosting
professional development events, and serves as the heart of school improvement initiatives
(Loertscher et al., 2011, p. 14). The third function is served by the virtual learning commons and
supports both the open learning commons and the experimental learning center with access to
digital content, librarian generated curated content in the form of pathfinders and customized
information portals, tutorials, and librarian-facilitated virtual discussions in the form of blogs,
wikis and other collaborative platforms. Together, these three domains constitute the learning
commons (Loertscher et al., 2011).
A challenge is adapting traditional school libraries to accommodate the new services and
functions of the learning commons. Pre-Internet libraries provided access to print and traditional
reference services. The decline in traditional services was noted as occurring between 1993 and
2003, and is attributed to the increased use of online search engines like Google (Beagle, 2009).
The learning commons staff supports this evolution in patron behavior by providing wellequipped work stations where students can engage in information searching, data gathering and
analysis, activities that synthesize learning, and media presentation activities to share knowledge
(Beagle, 2009, p. 16).
The learning commons model involves more librarian-student interaction that occurs
around computers, so the design of the traditional, monolithic circulation desk with the librarian
stationed behind it needs to evolve to desk spaces designed to provide side-by-side help for
students (Whitchurch, Belliston, & Baer, 2006). It also requires a reassessment and deep
weeding of the print and periodical collections. Spaces used for warehousing print collections
crowd out other potential activities and must be reassessed. By reducing the print collection
space can be reassigned and given over to collaborative work areas (Malenfant, 2006).

40
Staffing
Nonprofessional staff
The diverse service and resource demands of the learning commons require a technically
proficient staff. When supporting students with information tasks, non-professional employees
(library aides) must have basic proficiency in various database platforms, core software
programs, and technology hardware in the form of desktop computers, laptops, tablets, scanners,
and print stations (Whitchurch, Belliston, & Baer, 2006). This degree of engagement and
support, and the associated skill sets, go beyond those required of traditional non-professional
library staff. The challenge of staffing a learning commons lies in the ability of the school
librarian to inspire and motivate support staff to undergo training to improve their ability to
provide a range of services that go from new technologies, media and digital formats. Support
staff is also required to facilitate the research and knowledge production goals of students and
faculty (Beagle, 1999, p. 86). Not all library support staff members are resistant to change, but if
there is resistance it can result in barriers to a successful transition to the learning commons
model. In order to provide effective support for students, an effective high school librarian needs
to develop the skills required to overcome staff resistance to change and improve staff
technology skills.
A trained support staff is a critically important aspect of an effective learning commons
because the librarian must be able to leave the facility to participate in various leadership
activities (Everhart, 2007). Principals who see the school librarian engaging in curriculum
collaboration and school leadership projects are more likely to have positive perceptions, and are
more likely to support ongoing funding for adequate staffing, which in turn frees the librarian to
increase participation in leadership activities within the school (Loertscher, 2009).

41
Professionally Licensed Staff
Data from a report from the National Center for Education Statistics provides estimates
on staffing levels for school libraries during the 2003-2004 school year (US Department of
Education, 2006, table 43).

Note. This table focuses solely on public secondary school data.

The national data indicates a worrisome trend in shortfalls in providing US public
secondary schools with school libraries, and shortfalls in staffing those libraries with
professionally licensed school librarians. At the time of this study there is no data on
Massachusetts staffing levels in school libraries, nor the percentage of school libraries staffed by
professionally licensed school librarians. While a case can be made for the need for support staff
with strong information and technology skills, they cannot replace the specialized training of a
professionally licensed school librarian. The same report indicates that in all schools (the data in
this instance was not dis-aggregated by grade level) the percent by student enrollment that
employed professionally licensed librarians is similarly worrisome (US Department of
Education, 2006, table 43).

While it falls outside the parameters of this study, the librarian/student ratios revealed by
this data are insufficient to meet the standards of effectiveness described in this literature review.
This is noted as an area for future research and study.
Librarian Leadership Attributes
Spillane defines leadership as “a relationship of social influence” based on the various
activities that drive the work central to the organization (2006, p. 10). Applying this relational
definition, the work of a school is designed by the administration and faculty to motivate and
develop the effectiveness of the other members, and ultimately improve professional practice.
School librarians are typically solo practitioners in their schools, and some even provide services
to multiple school libraries in a district. It is a common problem of practice to experience
frustration regarding leadership opportunities within the organization (Belisle, 2004). After a
review of school library leadership literature, themes emerged that identified barriers and
strategies toward building leadership capabilities among school librarians.

43
Using distributed leadership theory Johnston conducted a study on opportunities for
school librarians to assume leadership roles through technology integration, and identified
specific enablers to successful leadership, as well as barriers (2012). The most frequently
identified enablers were the presence of a supportive principal, opportunities for leadership roles
and responsibilities, a desire on the part of the school librarian to make a positive impact on
student achievement, ongoing professional development, and a personal sense of obligation to
become more deeply involved in the school organization. The most frequent barriers were lack
of leadership opportunities, lack of funding, and lack of support staff (Johnston, 2012).
Perceptions
The perceptions of building principals were found to be influenced by four forces: their
own childhood experience with librarians where the library was peripheral to the classroom, lack
of professional training in the role of the library in curriculum, the nature of the work of school
librarians to enhance the skills and empowerment of others, and the low profile of librarianship
in general education literature (Hartzell, 2002). The nature of the work of school librarians is to
empower and increase the skills of students and teachers, and as a result these achievements are
often viewed as part of overall teacher effectiveness, and tend to disappear as evidence of the
concrete contributions of the school librarian. These forces contribute to an increase in the
occupational invisibility of the school librarian within the school.
The perceptions of school principals and administrators regarding school librarians and
their programs are overwhelmingly influential with regard to leadership opportunities and
decisions on funding and staffing (Castiglione, 2006). Developing and implementing
transformational leadership skills is the single most important act a school librarian can
undertake in order to influence those perceptions (Shoaf, 2004). Advocacy as a strategy for

44
changing the perceptions of school administrators was identified as an important strategy for
changing perceptions of the school librarian (Haycock, 2012). By educating principals and
administrators on the impact of successful programs on student learning, improving
communication between the school librarian and the principal, and increasing awareness of how
administrators can effectively support their school library media programs, it is possible to
improve perceptions, and thereby increase leadership opportunities for the school librarian
(Levitov, 2009).
The demonstration of a forward thinking vision was also identified as a practice that
positively influenced the perception of the school librarian. Principals who identified their school
librarians as professionals who stayed current with research and trends, and who were able to
articulate a vision for the future, were held in professional esteem that resulted in positive
perceptions that also crossed over to favorable impressions of the school librarian as an effective
instructional leader, and as effective in staff management (Shannon, 2009).
Pre-service training
Pre-service training in technology and instruction improves the level of professionalism
in school librarianship, and increases the successful transition of traditional school libraries into
learning commons (Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2008). In their 2008 study, Hanson-Balduf and
Hassel determined that while the majority of teacher education programs required three or more
credit hours of technology instruction, “pre-service and beginning teachers do not use technology
significantly more than their more experienced colleagues” (Evans & Gunter, 2004 as cited by
Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, p. 4). This is attributed to the fact that most teacher preparation
programs focus on basic computing skills at greater rates than they address integrative
technology uses. Conversely, the same study determined that because school librarian programs

45
are rooted in the twenty-first century information and digital literacy skills outlined in
Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (2006), school librarians are uniquely
skilled and situated within schools to fill the skills gap that exists in general teacher education
training (Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2008; Valenza, 2004).
In preparation for their 2008 study of pedagogical frameworks for school library
programs, Asselin and Doiron determined that while technology was being used in schools the
research tasks being assigned were primarily geared towards fact-finding and did not meet the
criteria of meaningful inquiry (National School Boards Association, 2007). In this same study,
teachers reported using the Internet in school assignments and also reported that they had no
specific training in the skills of finding, locating and evaluating sources. Teachers had not
received pre-service training in the specialized information and search skills designed to build
meaningful inquiry (Asselin & Doiron, 2008). The study determined that typical use of the
Internet in school assignments was as a virtual reference library for fact retrieval. This identified
an instructional gap that leaves students with a deficit in the acquisition of these skills (Todd,
2008, as cited by Asselin & Doiron, 2008). School librarians learn how to teach search skills in
pre-service training as well as the attitudes and behaviors students need to be successful users of
information. These student information and research skills and attitudes include: engaging in
prior search to establish knowledge context on the inquiry topic; employing search tool strategies
that go beyond Google; identifying holes in their research; strategy development that include
source evaluation for credibility, bias, accuracy, relevance, and reliability; advanced searches; an
attitude of inquiry; a plan for success that includes a timeline for the work with time for refining,
organizing, drafting and conclusion; and persistence (Valenza, 2004).

46
Technology training is an integral part of the pedagogy for pre-service school librarian
training, and is also identified as a self-perceived attribute of transformational leadership (Smith,
2009). With appropriate pre-service training school librarians are able to assume technology
leadership roles because they interact with all members of the school community. Through such
specialized training, pre-service librarians learn to create staff development programs, model the
ethical uses of technology for faculty, and advocate for equitable access to information and
technology for all students (Everhart, 2007). Training also prepares them to be instructional
leaders who have the skills to build strong collaborative relationships with teachers to integrate
information literacy into the curriculum, and serve on critical curriculum development
committees (Montiel-Overall & Hernandez, 2012). Pre-service technology training situates
school librarians to be instructional leaders who facilitate school curriculum to move away from
the “notion of covering the curriculum to the challenges of developing a transformative approach
where students uncover the curriculum” (Asselin & Doiron, 2008, p. 13). By providing
collaborative input to instructional goals and sharing instruction with teachers, all students
benefit (Everhart, 2007).
Administration and procedures
High schools typically have leadership teams that include domains in learning and
leadership, administration and organization, learning literacies, and technology (Koechlin et al.,
2010, p. 24). Establishing partnerships with these various teams can improve communication
with school leaders about the goals of the learning commons, and establish an understanding of
how the model can improve student outcomes across the leadership domains. By establishing
critical partnerships the school librarian is positioned to educate leaders and teachers on the

47
mission of the learning commons within the school organization, and the benefits for students
and the broader school community.
The ability of the librarian to set procedure for the learning commons is important, and
must feature a degree of autonomy from school-wide policies. Administration of a facility that
supports diverse activities and goals requires specialized responsibilities. An example of
autonomous procedure control is in the student use of cell phones. There may be a school-wide
policy banning the use of cell phones, but as an informational technology device their use may
be appropriate in the learning commons (Watstein & Mitchell, 2006). The effective school
librarian can demonstrate that as a technology tool, web-enabled mobile devices can be used to
access the library catalog, e-books, web-based audio books, MP3 audio books, and can also be
used by students in the collection stacks as they search for print resources. Database apps can be
accessed, as well as calendars and important notifications for school and home. Students
involved in teams, clubs, study groups, and other activities can use cell phones in the learning
commons in productive ways that can add to their productivity and organization. While a phone
could pose distractions in the classroom, it can be a very useful tool in the learning commons.
Through such a demonstration that showcases the benefits of cell phone use an effective case can
be made for allowing a change of procedure to the school policy, and permit their use in the
learning commons.
Another aspect of librarian control over the learning commons procedure is control of the
calendar and scheduling. The librarian has administrative power and oversight of the diverse
activities and events that occur within the learning commons, and in the digital space. This
control is to maintain a collegial balance of student/faculty/community use that treats all
constituents fairly, and focuses the use on student learning goals (Loertscher et al., 2011). If a

48
high school fills the library with study halls the possibility of flexible access for collaborative
work or group instruction is crowded out, making it impossible to have a learning commons. An
example of effective administrative control is the implementation of virtual calendars to facilitate
and document the diverse demands of the learning commons, and increased understanding for
the need for flexible scheduling (Koechlin et al., 2010). To create the appropriate environment
the librarian requires the authority to influence school-based procedure to meet the needs of the
learning commons model. This is accomplished by establishing a leadership role and an effective
voice in school procedure and the decision-making of guidelines set within the school.
Implementing a Successful Transition to a Learning Commons
The learning commons improves student achievement by providing structured support of,
and instruction for, the teachers in information and digital literacy skills in a student-centered
environment, facilitates professional development in new skills, and also provides a collaborative
space for faculty and students (Loertscher, Koechlin, & Zwann, 2011). As a common resource in
the school, the learning commons is used extensively by a variety of student and faculty
stakeholders, and is vulnerable to over use and under-provisioning. Failure to adequately
provision the learning commons with an adequate budget, adequate staffing, and adequate
autonomy in policy-making undermines the potential of a successful transition and
implementation, and may foreshadow insufficient gains in student learning outcomes.
The requirements of the learning commons are adaptations to the physical space that
prioritize collaboration over print collections, non-professional staff skilled in technology and
information and media production platforms, and librarian leadership training in instruction,
technology, and administration. Through effective advocacy, strong leadership, and collaboration

49
with administrators, the high school librarian can obtain the necessary resources for a successful
transition (Castiglione, 2006).
Attributes of a Successful Learning Commons
The demands of the digital information environment require new methods of instruction
and support for high school students. Traditional high school libraries need to transition to the
learning commons model in order to help the school meet the learning goals of the 21st century,
and to do so requires more than a simple name change.
The history of the school library in the U.S. has been one of continuous change, reflected
in the evolving standards that shift away from a book repository, to a technology enhanced
program that actively instructs and supports students and faculty in acquiring the digital literacy
skills required in the new information age. Studies conducted by various state school library
associations and state education departments reveal consistent findings that irrespective of
socioeconomic factors, students in schools that have adequately provisioned school libraries have
better achievement rates on standardized tests, the common measure of school effectiveness
(Todd & Kuhlthau, 2004).
As a common resource that serves students and faculty both within the school and
virtually, the learning commons has different requirements from a traditional school library. As
part of the transition process a systemic overhaul is required. The overhaul will resituate the
learning commons librarian as a key partner in curriculum and instruction, and will include
establishing collaborative practices. Improvements in non-professional support staff training are
necessary to provide motivation to learn and provide consistent quality support to students as
they work in the learning commons, integrating new skills into learning activities (Shoaf, 2004).

50
There must be space changes to accommodate the collaborative learning groups and
independent student work. Print collections must be evaluated and weeded to make room for
collaborative groups and diverse school community activities. In order to meet school goals for
improved student learning, the librarian must be available for student instruction, faculty
collaboration, and faculty professional development.
Implications of the Tragedy of the Commons
As outlined by Hardin (1968), when a community shares a common asset there is
tendency for members of the community to use it in their own best interest, with disregard to the
impact on the overall health of the common asset. The implications for a scenario of the
“tragedy of the commons” are that by failing to establish the necessary conditions and resources,
the learning commons has the potential to fail as a service model. Failure would take the form of
a space that is underutilized and irrelevant to students and staff, an overall lack of instructional
integration, a lack of professional development for faculty, and ultimately a lack of information
and digital literacy skills for students. The mission of the learning commons is to provide a
dynamic, technologically rich space for students to gain the skills to be proficient users and
creators of information. As a common resource it requires thoughtful planning during the
transition and implementation stage to ensure that the resources are there to serve students
(databases, books, technology, trained support staff) and transform instruction (collaboratively
planned curriculum with embedded technology, aligned with the school learning expectations).
To achieve this goal requires an appropriately trained school librarian and support staff with
access to the resources to achieve 21st century student learning goals.

Chapter 3: Methodology
Problem Statement
This research seeks to reveal the experiences and challenges faced by school librarians
who engage in transitioning their traditional high school libraries to the learning commons
service model. In order to succeed, this transition requires new responses from school
administration, faculty, school culture, and stakeholders (Bailey & Tierney, 2002). The learning
commons model features shared resources such as open access to wireless Internet, technology,
databases, printing, collaborative workspace, and serves as a community gathering space
(Loertscher, Koechlin, & Zwan, 2008). The model also relies on the establishment of critical
partnerships between the school learning leadership team, organizational leadership team,
learning literacy team, and the technology leadership team (Koechlin, Rosenfeld, & Loertscher,
2010). In serving so many diverse needs, if there has not been adequate planning for the various
components required by the transition, the learning commons is at risk of critical
underperformance. The failure to thrive and subsequent collapse due to poor provisioning and
overuse is known as the tragedy of the commons (Beagle, 1999).
The Paradigm
This research is guided by the interpretive constructionist paradigm that will allow an
exploration of the experiences of the school librarian participants as they plan and implement the
transition (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). This paradigm supports the exploration of the experience
and reality of the school librarian who endeavors to implement changes, and identifies the factors
that either support or undermine those efforts for a successful transition and implementation of
the learning commons model. By looking at a variety of transition experiences comprised of
diverse perspectives, it will be possible to identify patterns that address the research questions

52
(Butin, 2010). This interpretive approach recognizes that there are no set plans or strategies for a
transition in service models, but that through study of the experiences of school librarians it is
possible to identify commonalities that can be identified for further study, as well as provide
guidelines for those considering implementing a transition in their own high schools.
Research Design
The interpretive constructionist paradigm is the most appropriate design because it relies
on the participant’s view of the situation in order to gain understanding of the world in which
they work, and is suited to learning about the experiences of the participants in their transition
process; therefore a qualitative project is the most appropriate (Creswell, 2012). The descriptions
and analysis obtained from three high school librarians on their experience with the process of
transition is best served using a qualitative, general inductive approach.
Research Tradition
Qualitative research
This study fits well with the characteristics of qualitative research and the four associated
philosophical assumptions (Creswell, 2012, p. 21). The researcher reports on the different themes
as they emerge from the findings (ontological), relies on quotes and evidence obtained through
collaborative time with the participants (epistemological), openly discusses researcher values and
interpretations with the participants (axiological), and also uses inductive logic that featured
revisions based on the findings in the field, and had an emerging design.
General inductive research
Using a general inductive approach this study reveals the factors that most influence a
successful transition, and those that undermine the success of a transition. This represents a
complex, contemporary phenomenon that consists of multiple variables (support from school

53
administrators, instructional technology, curriculum development, budgets, staffing, student and
community, etc.). From the raw data the researcher identified themes and categories that revealed
a model for key requirements for a successful transition (Thomas, 2006). By taking a general
inductive approach the researcher focused on one issue, in this case the transition of a high
school library to a learning commons, and then focused on three bounded cases (the participating
high school libraries over a one month period) to research, analyze, and establish assertions
based on diverse data collected during the study (Creswell, 2012).
Statement of Positionality
A general inductive analysis depends on close reading of raw data to “derive concepts,
themes, or a model through interpretations made from the raw data by an evaluator or
researcher” (Thomas, 2011, p. 238). The researcher allowed the themes to emerge from the raw
data, described the actual results, and did not tie them to the expected results. This “goal free”
evaluation took into account unanticipated results (Scriven, 1991, p. 56; as cited by Thomas). In
considering positionality, it was important for the researcher not to be influenced by anticipated
results, or by unexpected data.
As a high school librarian who has experienced a transition, I knew that it was important
to be aware of preconceptions based on personal experience. This prior experience did not
influence the themes and categories that emerge from the raw data.
Participants
In a qualitative approach the focus is on understanding the meaning of the phenomenon
as experienced by the various participants, from their multiple perspectives (Creswell, 2013).
Using emergent design, the plan for this general inductive study was not tightly prescribed and

54
was adapted based on the unique characteristics of each school site, and the personal experiences
and perceptions of the various participants.
Participants were recruited from the Massachusetts School Library Association (MSLA),
the professional association of licensed school librarians in Massachusetts, in order to establish a
purposeful sample (Creswell, 2013). The participants self-identified as working at a
Massachusetts public high school level and as having experienced transitioning a school library
into a learning commons. In order to maintain consistency of state educational frameworks and
other state regulations between case studies, the participants experienced this transition in a
Massachusetts public high school.
The confidentiality and anonymity of the site and participants was ensured through the
use of pseudonyms and general indicators such as student population numbers, scheduling
practices, technology integration, and administrative responsibilities. Within these general
ranges, the experiences of the participating high school librarians on areas that either supported
or undermined the successful implementation of the learning commons model was explored.
Pseudonyms were used in order to protect the identities of the participants and their school
districts, and to protect the participants from the possibility of supervisory consequences
(DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). Participants were advised that they were free to withdraw or
opt out of completion of the study at any time.
The objectives of the study was made clear to participants through a description of the
purpose of the study, the anticipated time commitment of the survey and interview components,
and how the conclusions would be shared. Accuracy of the data was ensured through rigorous
adherence to interview protocols as well as regular member checks to verify the credibility of the
findings (Thomas, 2011). When the researcher is the sole coder, member checks increase validity

55
by engaging the participants in the thought process behind some of the coding decisions
(Saldana, 2013). In this study member checks were especially clarifying in exploring the
leadership codes with each participant, and uncovering nuances in the school librarian and
principal relationships. To ensure transparency, the sharing of the aggregated interview data will
be included in a final report of the study distributed via the MSLA professional publication, The
Forum. As a courtesy to the MSLA executive board, a formal copy of the results of the survey
and interview data will be presented for their use and records.
Researcher bias was avoided through thoughtful construction of neutral interview
questions that did not influence responses. The questions established ranges across general data
points in order to draw conclusions relating to impact of population, budget, scheduling,
technology integration and administrative duties, on the experiences of the participants
perceptions of factors that supported or undermined the successful implementation of the
learning commons model. The results of the study add to the literature by identifying categories
and themes that contribute to success, and perceptions of the attributes of a successful
implementation.
The Call for Participants (Appendix I) stated the criteria and included the statement:
“Selection for the study is not guaranteed, but will be determined during a brief 5-10 minute
intake call.”
During the intake call the researcher gave a brief overview of the project and then asked
criteria-based questions (self-recording the participants answers). After determining if the high
school librarian was an appropriate candidate, the researcher stated whether or not the school
librarian qualified for the study.
Limitations

56
Because this study focused on three high school librarians and their experiences
transitioning to the learning commons service model, it was not possible to capture a truly broad
cross section of understanding. Every school is unique in terms of factors like school culture,
budgets, community support, and leadership, and all of these influence the process of a transition
in ways not addressed by this study. The three participants and their school communities had
similarities, but there were many differences in school culture that yielded useful insights into
the wide range of factors that must be addressed when planning a transition.
The study revealed commonalities in the transition process, and identified themes and
categories that serve as a jumping off point for future research. This study was not designed for
in depth analysis of the individual themes and/or categories.
Recruitment and access
Recruitment was via the MSLA electronic E-mail list serve and the MSLA Facebook
group. Recruitment outreach included the goals of the study, participant requirements of
professional licensure by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and employment in a
Massachusetts public high school along with the prior experience of transitioning the school
library into a learning commons.
Data collection
Data comes from a number of sources including interviews with participants, review of
documents related to the transition process, and discussions regarding budgets and the
institutional position of the high school library. Site visits and Skype interviews provided data on
the organization of the library and space utilization, technology inventory, as well as collection
and circulation data. Digital resources such as the library website, databases, web traffic data,
and media resources also informed the study.

57
Interviews
The participants were questioned in a series of two interviews, either in-person or via
Skype or telephone. The first interview included a general audit of resources designed to
establish baseline information on each learning commons (Appendix II). The first interview
protocol also included a series of open-ended questions designed to prompt the participants to
share their thoughts and experiences of their transition process through a narrative (Creswell,
2012, p. 164). In this role, the researcher observed as a complete participant who was fully
engaged with the school librarians involved in the study (Creswell, 2012, p. 166). This
engagement established a collaborative and collegial relationship, and this was helpful when it
came time for member checks to determine accuracy and trustworthiness of the data and
conclusions (Thomas, 2011, p. 243).
The second interview included a review of the baseline data for accuracy. It also included
a review of the raw data obtained from the transcripts of the first meeting. The second interview
was comprised of open-ended questions generated from the raw data, and was designed to elicit
reflections on the emerging categories and themes.
Informed consent
The most important area of protection in this proposed study of Massachusetts’ public
high school librarians was their privacy and the identification of their schools. If the participant
shared information that reflected negatively on a district or administrator it was possible that the
participant could face retribution in the form of a poor evaluation or, potentially, termination.
Establishing trust through careful management of data and assurances of privacy was necessary
for the success of the study.

58
Consent was required from the identified school librarian participants as well as their
building principals. In order to gain access to the various school sites it was necessary to get
consent from principals who serve as gatekeepers (Creswell, 2013). The consent form included
the right of the participant to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time, the protection and
confidentiality of the respondents, the purpose of the study, data collection methods, data
storage, the benefits of participation, and the potential risk of the study results being perceived in
a negative light by school administrators. The school librarian, the school principal, the school
superintendent, and the researcher all signed the consent form outlining these factors (Appendix
III).
Ethical Considerations
This study did not include high school students so there was no need for the protection of
minors. In order to protect the privacy of the participant and school site identities, the data was
protected by the use of pseudonyms for the participants and school sites.
Data Collection
Data was collected through interviews and documents and artifacts provided by the
participants that detailed the transition process. The data was digitally recorded using Audio
Note and written field notes.
Data was collected during an initial interview and site visit. Audio Note was used to
record the interview using the researcher’s iPad. The audio files were transferred to the
researcher’s laptop computer and stored in a password protected file format.
Validation
Lincoln and Guba (1985; as cited by Thomas, 2011) describe the general types of
qualitative trustworthiness as “credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability”

59
(Thomas, 2011, p. 243). Validation occurred through debriefs with the participants in the form of
member checks throughout the process. Since the participants are professional high school
librarians, checking conclusions also provided consistency checks (Thomas, 2011).
Data Storage
Data was stored digitally on the password protected personal devices of the researcher in
the form of documents, transcripts, and PDF files. Audio recordings were destroyed after
transcription. Backs up copies of all the documents are stored in Dropbox, a password protected
cloud storage platform.
The data was used for the completion of the researcher’s doctoral thesis project and
potentially for future journal publications and conference presentations. Participant
confidentiality will be maintained in all future use. Once the thesis is complete the data will be
removed from Dropbox and destroyed, removed from the researcher’s personal laptop and iPad,
and stored on a USB drive that will remain in a locked safe deposit box in the researcher’s home.
After a period of five years the data will be permanently destroyed.
Data Confidentiality
The data and documents that included the names of participants and school sites have
been destroyed. Electronic data was deleted, and paper documents were shredded. The remaining
data and documents refer only to participant and school pseudonyms. This is consistent with
Creswell’s guidelines on protecting participant confidentiality (2013, p. 175).
Data Analysis
The strategy that was used in analyzing the data in this general inductive approach was
multiple readings of the raw data to identify emerging patterns (Thomas, 2011, p. 239-240). This
strategy was selected because it allowed the raw data to be condensed into a brief, summary

60
format. From this point, links between the summary findings of the raw data and the goals of the
research were established, and the development of conclusions derived from the experiences of
the participants was revealed (p. 237). In analysis, the general inductive approach was beneficial
in the development of multiple categories and category descriptions that allowed the researcher
to identify links and relationships between multiple categories. This allowed research findings to
emerge from the themes embedded in the raw data without structures and protocols imposed by
other, more structured methodologies (p. 238). Another benefit of using the general inductive
approach in this study was that it provided the researcher with a straightforward option for
analyzing qualitative data that reduced the risk of the researcher invoking expectations or
specific findings, and supported the research goal of establishing a basic framework for
transitioning to a learning commons model.
The collaborative feedback from participant member checks improved the overall
trustworthiness of the findings. The researcher ultimately determined the most important themes
from the data.
Data Coding
The data was coded and analyzed using MaxQDA, a qualitative data analysis software
platform. The researcher used descriptive coding for data analysis as it was effective at
categorizing data to provide the researcher with an understanding of the organization of the study
(Saldana, 2013).
Features of coding
There are five key features for data coding in a general inductive approach (Thomas,
2011, p. 240). Coding in this research study will follow the protocol outlined by Thomas.
1. Category label: a word or phrase that briefly describes the category.

61
2. Category description: a description with key characteristics.
3. Text or data associated with the category.
4. Links: a diagram indicated relationships between categories.
5. Model in which the categories are embedded: the hierarchy of the school and the
learning commons within the school. This is generated as a result of analysis, and
occurs at the end of the research process.
The process of inductive coding
Coding featured close reading of text and the careful consideration of meanings contained
within the text (Thomas, 2011, p. 241-242). The researcher identified meaningful text segments
and created a label for a category to assign to the text segment. Pre-coding took place during the
close reading of the raw data. The pre-coding was comprised of marking of the texts in various
ways to indicate important comments or rich themes (Saldana, 2013). The researcher used
procedures for coding the data that include:
1. Data cleaning in the form of common formatting (font, text size, etc.), the creation
of back up copies and data files.
2. Close reading of text so the researcher could become deeply familiarized with the
content and themes.
3. Creation of categories based on the close reading of the texts. In vivo coding was
used during this stage. Analytic memos were kept in the researcher’s journal in
order to facilitate reflection and generate meaningful connections between
categories (Saldana, 2013, p. 42).

62
4. Identification of overlapping codes and un-coded text: identification codes that fit
in multiple categories, as well as outlier text that contains codes that didn’t fit in
any clear category.
5. Continued revision of categories: generation of sub-categories for additional
insight and nuance.
The coding process was designed to generate between three to eight categories that
identified the principle themes from the raw data.
Data Management
Data was coded and analyzed using MaxQDA, a qualitative data analysis software
platform. The researcher used descriptive coding for data analysis as it was effective at
categorizing data to provide the researcher with an understanding of the organization of the study
(Saldana, 2013).
Trustworthiness
In order to establish the trustworthiness of the researcher and the integrity of the research
process the following steps were taken:
Clarifying researcher bias: The background of the researcher (white, middle class,
middle aged woman, licensed school library media specialist, member of the MSLA executive
board, experienced in transitioning a school library to a learning commons service model) was
made clear in the initial Call for Participants. In considering positionality, the prior experience of
the student researcher did not influence conclusions regarding the transition process of the
participants.
Member checks: Participants were provided with the opportunity to review transcripts
and data for internal verification in order to increase the trustworthiness and credibility of the

63
study (Creswell, 2013). Participants had the opportunity to provide feedback during debrief
sessions, review the research and conclusions and, if necessary, provide additional feedback and
clarification. Utilizing the skills of the school librarian participants with frequent member checks
increased the trustworthiness and reliability of the study (Thomas, 2011).
Rich, thick description: Using a theoretical approach, the researcher included extensive
discussion on the major themes that emerge from analysis of the data. Quotes and rich details
that support the themes informed existing learning commons theory based on the views and
experiences of the participants (Creswell, 2013).
Additional Considerations to Ensure the Protection of Human Subject
Before data collection a Doctoral Thesis Proposal (DTP) and an ‘Application for
Approval for Use of Human Participation in Research’ was submitted to the Northeastern
Institutional Review Board for evaluation. Acceptance demonstrated ethical research practices
and the protection of all human subjects.
Confidentiality
Each participant study began with a statement of the purpose of the research, an
explanation of steps to preserve confidentiality, affirmation that participation is voluntary, and
that the participants were free to withdraw at any time. Participants also signed the Consent to
Participate in Research form (Appendix IV), which contained the same information and
indicated the willingness of the participant to participate in the study.
Validation Strategies
Multiple validation strategies are recommended in qualitative, inductive research in order
to assess the accuracy of the findings (Creswell, 2013). Triangulation of data was used to assess
codes from multiple sources of data and themes for comparison and cross-validation of findings.

64
Member checking was also included, and the researcher sought the input of the participants to
verify the findings and interpretations of the study. This was done by including the participants
in review of rough drafts of the research and input on language, insights, and conclusions. Rich,
thick description also served as an additional validation strategy that allowed the reader to
“transfer information to other settings and to determine whether the findings can be transferred”
(Creswell, p. 252, 2013).
Potential threats to internal validity
To minimize potential threats to internal validity and increase reliability, the following
steps were taken in the research design. High quality recording devices (researcher’s password
protected iPad) and the Internet transcription service (Rev Transcription Service) were used
(Creswell, 2013). An inter-coder agreement with Rev Transcription Service was completed prior
to the uploading of audio files to verify the protection of the data.
The general inductive study was bounded by location (three high schools) and time (1
month) so maturation and subject attitude did pose a threat, however participant illness,
mortality, or other unforeseen complications that could impede access to the participant or site
presented a potential threat to the study. To minimize this threat back-up school locations and
participants were identified in advance, so the study could have been conducted elsewhere if
required.
Researcher Bias
The potential for bias existed because both the researcher and case study participants are
currently employed, licensed high school librarians and professional peers. It was important that
the researcher’s expectations did not influence the “conduct and conclusions of the study” and
that negative conclusions were avoided (Maxwell, p. 108, 2005). This was addressed through

65
regular and ongoing member checks so conclusions were shared and understood within context
and through protection of participant and site identity, decreasing the potential for bias in the
analysis of the data.
Conclusion
This study addressed the components of a methodology for a qualitative general inductive
study that asked, “What is the process of transitioning a traditional high school library to a
learning commons service model? What factors determine a successful transition?
What factors undermine the success of a transition?” The participants, three high school
librarians employed in the Massachusetts public school system, are all professionally licensed
and working in accredited schools.
The methodology of the study, research design, paradigm and tradition were addressed.
An overview of the methods used in data collection, management, storage, analysis, reliability
and trustworthiness, along with the plan for the protection of human subjects have been
provided.

Chapter 4: Report of Research Findings
Introduction
The objective of this general inductive qualitative study was to develop greater
understanding around the process of the transition from a traditional high school library to the
learning commons service model. The research focuses on the school librarian practitioner and is
designed to identify factors that either promote a successful transition, or undermine the success
of the transition. The first section will provide an overview of the domains identified in the
literature review, and situate the experiences of the participants within those domains. The
second section will provide an overview of the themes that emerged from the data, and will
identify new domains not previously identified. The final section will present a summary of the
research findings.
The data was collected and analyzed to answer the two research questions developed at
the start of this study:
•

What factors promote a successful transition?

•

What factors undermine or threaten a successful transition?

Participants of this study consisted of three high school library media specialists from three
different Massachusetts public high schools. The five domains that were explored with the
participants were:
1. Professional background (education, years as practitioner, previous work
experience)
2. School description (demographics, school culture)
3. Learning commons (personal perspective, position within school culture)

67
4. Administration and leadership (school district and building-based, position within
school culture)
5. Changes made for transition (administrative changes, curricular changes)
Professional background
The three participants come from very different background experiences. Jane, in her
fourth year at South Meadow High School (pseudonyms are used for all participants and school
names) came to the professional of school librarianship after working in business and obtaining a
Masters of Business Administration. Jane switched careers and obtained a masters degree in
Library Information Science as well as her teaching license and immediately gained employment
at South Meadow High School. This year, with the endorsement of her principal, Jane anticipates
that she will move from non-professional to professional teacher licensure status. Rose, from
North High School, worked previously in marketing and sales, and is in her seventh year as a
professionally licensed school librarian. Rose has also received a certificate in advanced graduate
studies in education, media, and technology. Rose worked previously in a district where she
transitioned the high school to a learning commons, and is in her first year in a new district
where she will be conducting another transition from library to learning commons. Karl is also in
a new position at Atlantic High School, and is transitioning to a learning commons. Karl was part
of a team that successfully transitioned his previous school library to a learning commons, and is
actively transitioning his new school. Karl has been a professionally licensed school librarian for
seventeen years.
School Descriptions
Enrollment data obtained from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education indicates that all three public high schools have a lower percentage of

68
African-American students than the Massachusetts state average. South Meadow High School
has a far higher average of Asian student than the other two schools, and with 20% enrollment
they far exceed the state school enrollment of 6.1%. All three schools fall well below the state
average for Hispanic students, but match or exceed the state average for white students. South
Meadow and Atlantic High Schools both exceed the state average for students identified as
multi-race, non-Hispanic.
South Meadow High School has 11.7% of students identified as low income, and 4.2% as
English Language Learners (ELL). Atlantic High School has 11.5% students in the low-income
category, and 2.3% ELL. North High School has 12.5% low-income students, and 0.4% ELL.

Analysis of the school demographic and performance data shows that the three schools
have a lot in common in that they are all overwhelmingly white and have similar percentages of
low-income students, while North High School has the lowest percentage of ELL students. All
three schools outperform the state averages on MCAS test results. In assessing the process of
transition from school library to learning commons, all three sites are well matched and provide a
firm basis for comparison.

The school librarian as a solo-practitioner who never leaves the library is at odds with the
collaborative requirements of the learning commons model, and adequate support staff is
identified as an important administrative obligation (Shoaf, 2004). Support staff can play an
important role in developing an energetic environment in the learning commons, and can have a
profound impact in meeting school goals, and positively influencing student achievement and the
perceptions of administrators (Castiglione, 2006). While all three schools have support staff,
when compared to South Meadow, North High School is comparatively under-staffed given the
size of their student census. There are no state guidelines for the recommended or suggested
numbers of school library support staff for Massachusetts school libraries.
Learning Commons
This domain encompassed the perceptions of the participants with respect to the
transition, and how they managed the transition with school administration, faculty, and students.
The library collection and floor plan
The data revealed similarities in the starting point for each participant, which featured a
traditional school library that prioritized books over flexible space for students. One of the first
steps of each transition process was to decrease the size of the collection, refocusing the print

71
collection away from reference and informational nonfiction, and prioritize high interest fiction
and narrative nonfiction.
In the state of Massachusetts many school districts subscribe to the Massachusetts
Association of School Committees Online Policy Manual (MASC) ("Massachusetts Association
of School Committees Online Policy Manual"). A review of the online policy manual for
districts across the state indicates consistent use of the same Library Materials Selection policy,
and Library Resources policy. These policies are based on the American Library Association
(ALA) Bill of Rights and are “guided by the goals of public education as defined in the
Massachusetts Common Core of Learning and by the needs of the individual Education Reform
Act” ("Massachusetts Association of School Committees Online Policy Manual"). While not
every participant district subscribes to the MASC Online Policy Manual, all participant districts
have the MASC Policy Manual available on their School Committee Policy websites,
demonstrating consistent adherence to policy regarding collection evaluation and weeding. The
re-evaluation of library collections is necessary in order to maintain a relevant and active
collection. Criteria for weeding features the following guidelines:
• Curricular changes have rendered superfluous some materials (or multiple copies of
materials) formerly used but no longer in demand.

•

Some materials contain factual material that is no longer accurate nor current.

• Some materials intended for recreational reading have become dated or unattractive
and are no longer in demand. (Some such books, which are deemed “standards” or
“classics”, will be retained even though they rarely circulate).

72
• Some materials have become worn out, damaged or physically deteriorated and have
lost utility and/or appeal.
• Some materials have been superseded by newer items, which present the same
information, but in superior format.
Withdrawn library/media center materials are processed in one or more of the following ways:
• Made available to be used as resource or supplementary material by teachers.
• Offered to other media centers in the District, as it is possible that a material, which
lacks utility in one building, may have some usefulness in another.
• Contributed to appropriate charitable or educational agencies.
• Discarded, when warranted.
All study participants adhered to their school committee policy regarding library resource
selection, evaluation, and weeding.
Karl reported that on his first visit to Atlantic High School that he “walked in and it was
just like a warehouse of books. It was like stacks of books. At least half of the library was filled
with stacks.” The predominance of books, and the priority of the library collection over other
types of student-based activities were also reported by Jane and Rose. Jane stated that it was a
matter of “shifting the emphasis, this physical impression of the library away from large
reference resources and towards reading for pleasure, whereby we’re highlighting the fiction
collection front and center.”

73
The process of weeding, or removing books from the library collection, has been
extensive and ongoing at two of the sites. Over the past four years, following school committee
guidelines, South Meadow High School has reduced their collection by approximately 50%,
going from a collection size of approximately 20,000 volumes to approximately10,000. This
reduction allowed them to remove the tall, built in wooden cases that filled the space, and
increase student seating with an innovative approach of café style counters and stools that look
out over the school grounds. The new, low-profile bookcases provide “a much better vantage
point and line of sight throughout the whole library for supervisory purposes…and also allow us
to do a lot more display of books than we could with the tall shelves.” The new shelves also have
built-in wheels that allow them to be moved when needed, and to experiment with different floor
layouts.
The shift towards high interest fiction and narrative nonfiction in collection development
has resulted in increases in circulation statistics, indicating increases in student use. In South
Meadow:
Circulation has risen, especially circulation of fiction since we rearranged the library and
focused not only just displaying our fiction and putting it front and center, but also our
purchasing has skewed much more towards popular young adult, popular fiction, whereas
when I arrived a lot of the fiction was either outdated or traditional classic literature and
not as much young adult stuff, and not as much popular fiction. Since we’ve changed
what we’re buying and now we’re displaying it, circulation has increased.
With the re-focus of the collection towards pleasure reading and new genres, such as graphic
novels, South Meadow has seen an increase in requests from English teachers for

74
recommendations and titles to update class lists and projects “because we’re able to satisfy the
demand for what kids like.”
At Atlantic High School Karl said, “It was pretty easy to know what to do first…the first
few months were just weeding. Lots of weeding.” Karl was concerned about resistance from
within the school towards getting rid of so many books, but after he engaged in discussions with
faculty and explained his reasons for reducing the size of the collection, he found that the school
community was willing to listen. Following school committee guidelines, Karl reported that it
took half a year to reduce the size of the collection from almost 27,000 to approximately13,000
volumes.
The North High School Library had a traditional collection that took up most of the floor
space, and as was the case at South Meadow, blocked light from the windows. The previous
librarian (who left due to retirement) had aggressively weeded, and the collection size is a
manageable 13,000 volumes. Rose described the reaction of the faculty to the changes she made
in floor layout and her reorganization of the collection:
All of the space that was right here, that’s now all tables and one row of computers, were
all bookshelves, all the way up to the windows. What I’ve heard is that everyone felt that
it was very dark and didn’t leave much room. Now, opening up the space allows them to
do so much more. Right in the front area I pulled several of the comfortable seats. There
are seven chairs up front that they can use as their reading area. The fiction and
nonfiction books were both together in that large section of books, but now the nonfiction
and reference section are together on the other side of the room. We also got one of the
schools to donate the shorter stack shelves. That opened up a line of vision.

75
Previously, the North High School collection had been dispersed across all the floor-toceiling shelves and took up much of the floor space, so Rose moved shelving to the sides of the
area and condensed the collection, allowing her to get rid of a number of the tall shelves and
create more open space for students. Future collection development will focus on independent
pleasure reading and increasing online resources for nonfiction and research.
Changes to the physical layout have been critical in the transition process, and reducing
the collection size in order to create more flexible and open space was seen as a priority in all
three schools. All three sites had positive student, faculty, and administrative feedback as a result
of the physical changes to their libraries.
The virtual learning commons
In addition to physical changes to the site, South Meadow High School also overhauled
their digital space. Previously the library platform was Dreamweaver, and one librarian served as
a gatekeeper who was responsible for curating all the online resources and updates. As part of
the transition process, two years ago they shifted to the platform LibGuides, and “all three
librarians became facile with that tool.” Because it is “a more user-friendly platform we could
make a lot more resources available to our teachers 24/7 than we previously had done.” Jane lists
the social media activities and interfaces now available (Twitter, Facebook, a student book
review blog) and reflected that “All of those things we sort of had going on in the background,
but having a user-friendly tool for the site allowed us to put it all in one place and have that 24/7
access…to communicate with our community, whether it be faculty, parents, or students.”
The priority given to developing a robust digital learning commons is also seen on the
Atlantic and North High School websites. Karl and Rose are in the early stages of their

76
transition, but their websites already offer robust access to curriculum and student support
resources.
Student use
Study halls
The system of study halls was different in each school, yet had an enormous impact on
how students used the learning commons. In South Meadow High School there is open campus
for second semester sophomores and the upper grades, with parental permission. Freshmen do
not have open campus. Students with open campus can access the learning commons at anytime
they have a free block. Also, South Meadow has a policy of not hiring short-term substitute
teachers, so if a teacher is absent those students are dismissed, and if they have open campus
those students can go anywhere within the school or off campus. Jane reports that “The library
happens to be a very popular destination for students to come to do school work, to meet with
their friends, usually both at the same time, hard to distinguish what they’re doing, to access
technology, to use their own technology, to read, research, create, etc.”
At North High School, Rose describes a traditional study hall practice where students are
scheduled, and there is no open campus. Study halls are scheduled in classrooms, have about 30
students per study hall section, and teachers are assigned study hall duties. Studies are not
scheduled in the learning commons, although students are able to get a pass to leave their study
to go to the learning commons. Passes are available in the morning, and are limited in number.
The learning commons staff can control and reduce the number of passes available if there are
instructional classes already booked into the space. Student use consists of socializing, gaming,
reading, studying, and research activities. Rose recognizes that the study hall system is part of
the culture of the school, and “that’s what works here for now.”

77
Students at Atlantic High School are fully scheduled with what are otherwise known as
study halls, but which they refer to as “learning centers.” Approximately half the students at
Atlantic have scheduled learning center time, and it is designed for independent project work.
Students are allowed to obtain a pass to the learning commons during this time. Teachers may
bring students to select books for class reading assignments, and to conduct research. There is
also an active mentorship program with area businesses, and senior students establish strong
connections and work study programs that may keep them out of school for up to two days per
week. It is otherwise a closed campus.
The ability of students to roam the building is very different in each school, and is driven
by school study hall and open/off campus policies. South Meadow provides students with a great
deal of latitude in moving around the building or leaving campus, and North High School
provides very little student freedom in moving around the building. Rose is able to effectively
monitor and control student access through the pass system, ensuring that classes are not
crowded out or negatively impacted by casual student use. At Atlantic, Karl is also able to use
the learning center pass system to maintain a productive environment for learning.
Procedure
Managing student use of the learning commons required a shift in procedure from the
prior library practice. In South Meadow, Jane states:
When I first arrived I think they had a maximum of four students to a table. Maybe five.
That’s crept up to six per table. We have a very defined and much more clearly labeled
quiet study area because with a learning commons approach we’re recognizing that
learning is often a collaborative and social process. We want to have space for that, but

78
we don’t want to totally lose the opportunity for quiet, reflective individual study so the
space over there is the quiet, as best we can, study space.
At North High School, Rose also eased up on procedures and allows students to talk
without worry about being shushed. The volume in the learning commons has gone up. She
believes that the learning commons “should be a place that they’re collaborating and
communicating with teachers and students.” The change had been popular with faculty as well
and Rose reported that recently she showed a faculty member the quiet staff area in the back, and
was told, “No, I want to be in the middle of the students.”
When he began at Atlantic High School Karl felt some general resistance to the library
from students, and that it was not a popular destination. He began by saying “yes to almost
everything just to flip the expectations around. Now we have students working in the library,
and there is a book club started. We have a couple of kids that come behind the desk…and
they’re actually allowed back there. They’re allowed to do a lot of things they didn’t used to be
allowed to do.”
Karl noted that there were risks to opening the space to students and loosening
procedures. At his previous school they “wanted to highlight that this is a student-centered
library. It’s not the librarian’s space. This is a double-edged sword.” His previous school did not
have the students fully scheduled, had open campus, and during free blocks students “would
come in and attack it, and sometimes not in good ways.” By “amplifying the attractiveness of
the space” they became overwhelmed with students who weren’t allowed to congregate in
hallways because they could disturb classes. Nor were students allowed in the cafeteria unless it
was during a scheduled lunch, and freshmen and sophomores couldn’t leave the building. The
learning commons was one of the few places students were allowed to be, and “we were just

79
getting inundated with kids.” From this experience Karl noted that a social learning environment
could be supported only if the number of students doesn’t get too high. At his previous school he
described times where there were so many students that there were large groups sitting on the
floor, and “even the most well-intentioned, focused kid is going to be either distracted or not able
to concentrate.” In this set of circumstances, Karl said it was key to have strong administrative
support.
If the library is the heart of the school then it’s basically like you’re having a heart attack.
If it’s being overwhelmed with stress then the school needs to do something to address it.
It gets beyond the ability of just the librarians working on their own to really address that
in a systemic way.
Karl has kept in touch with his former school and reported that, while there have been
improvements in the situation the issue is not yet resolved. “I think it is a function of the
schedule, which is a monster, as you know, and to a lesser degree, the culture of the school, the
way that the campus is, whether it is opened or closed, that type of thing.”
Faculty use
Faculty use of the learning commons varies between the three sites, reflecting the
different stages of transition at each school. Jane is four years into the transition, and has seen a
rich and vibrant increase in collaborative relationships with faculty. Rose and Karl each
completed the transition at their previous schools, and are in the very early stages of transition in
their current positions.
At South Meadow High School, Jane describes having “a large number of very
committed collaborators” in the History, English, and World Languages departments “because
their resource needs and project types tend to work well with what we can offer.” There is

80
collaboration across all the academic departments (Science, Family Consumer Science, Fine
Arts, and Math), but not to the same high level of the Humanities and World Languages.
Managing the increased collaborative faculty use was an area of change for South
Meadow as they transitioned to the learning commons model. Historically, the library maintained
a paper calendar and scheduling system where teachers would come to the library to book a time
for their class to visit. This provided the opportunity for a face-to-face discussion where the
librarian could ask about the project, and offer advice or generate a collaborative opportunity to
insert information skills to the project. Jane insisted that as part of their overall transition to a
digital, 24/7 philosophy that the scheduling system also be digitized, whereby teachers could still
stop by and book a time in person, but would “give the opportunity to teachers who thought of
this at night or on the weekend, to be able to book it right away.” The calendar includes an online
form that requires the teacher to provide information about the project and describe their
technology needs, and teachers can also attach a document with the lesson plan or assignment.
The South Meadow librarians get an email notification and can review the calendar request, and
the teacher gets an email confirmation when the request is approved. This provides the
communication venue, and also documentation on the curriculum work being conducted in the
learning commons. By receiving the lesson plan and goals ahead of time, the librarians are able
to make suggestions on ways to enrich the experience with lessons in things such as more
advanced search skills, source evaluation, and citation. Jane says that this allows them to “be that
gatekeeper, not in a negative way, but to make sure that they’re using us as a collaborative
opportunity for teaching, and not as a lab.” Teachers who want to book space purely for
keyboarding are allowed to do so only on a last minute basis. This keeps the technology and

81
collaborative opportunities available for higher-level curriculum work, and minimizes richer
activities from being closed out by less demanding activities.
At North High School, teachers are reserving space primarily for students to access the
laptops and desktop computers for students to write papers. At this time their personal use of the
learning commons is greater than curricular use, and includes grading papers, accessing the
printers, using the laminator, and checking out AV equipment, although this last activity is
becoming increasingly rare. Rose described faculty use of the learning commons at North High
School as very service oriented.
The Atlantic High School the faculty uses the learning commons for accessing
technology because many do not have computers at their disposal, or have offices in areas of the
school with a poor wireless connection. Faculty can also be found using the learning commons as
a space to do grading and write progress reports. The technology department is located upstairs
in the learning commons, so teachers looking for technology support generate a certain amount
of foot traffic through the space. Karl described a recent afternoon when there were two teachers
who brought their classes for instruction and to conduct project work, and three teachers doing
their own professional work.
Karl’s vision for supporting teachers through the introduction of project-based learning
via the learning commons model is still in the formative stage. While he actively supports
teachers interested in project-based learning, he has recognized that this is not the norm with all
teachers. He identified a level of teacher anxiety about “feeling like they would be admitting that
they didn’t know something, or didn’t understand a skill,” if they asked for Karl to collaborate
with them to teach the skill. An example Karl cited was the lack of teacher requests for lessons in
citation, an area that had been a very active jumping off point in collaborative planning in his

82
previous school, and that Jane also indicated as a primary starting point in establishing a
collaborative discussion around project planning at South Meadow High School.
In his previous school Karl described rich, collaborative projects where it was a
partnership of learning and experimentation between him, the teacher, and students. An example
he cited was the re-envisioning of a biology project on the human system. He worked with the
teacher to use a wiki platform for students to create an online resource that would grow and
iterate over the years. At Atlantic High School he has made progress with technology-related
projects such as video creation and tools like Voice Thread, and uses these opportunities to teach
both the students and the teacher.
Curriculum leadership
Collaborative curriculum development is practiced at all three school sites. Jane describes
collaborative planning at South Meadow as occurring on a case-by-case basis, with individual
teachers. Evidence of this is provided in the extensive list of individualized resource guides
developed for each assignment. Three years ago Jane purchased a subscription to the citation
platform EasyBib. Prior to this, there was no district-wide citation platform, and “students were
pretty much on their own.” The acquisition of the EasyBib platform has been transformational
for the collaborative development of curriculum at South Meadow.
Just having that tool and introducing it to the staff and getting them on board to use it for
all their projects and having a consistent tool for creating citations and for taking notes
has gotten us into these projects on a more consistent basis now because the teachers
recognize the value of their students using this tool.
Presentation tools have also provided collaborative opportunities, and Jane is working
with teachers to shift away from traditional paper posters towards digital tools. This support is in

83
the form of helping teachers identify appropriate digital alternatives, and troubleshooting when
students encounter problems. Jane doesn’t classify this domain of collaboration as truly
curriculum, but rather about increasing student engagement and satisfying different student
learning styles.
At North High School, Rose is working on shifting teacher practice away from the
traditional library lessons that focus on overviews of resources and introductory lessons on
databases, and towards developing a more individualized, one-to-one collaborative approach
within the parameters of scheduled class visits. At this point in time scheduled classes are
coming primarily to learn about the various resources available in the learning commons, and
how to locate them. Rose envisions this shift in approach as key to the learning commons model,
and more effective at delivering a higher level of instruction and skill development that is rooted
in curricular activities. With a 1:1530 teaching ratio this is an ambitious and long-term goal.
When he was hired, Karl found that Atlantic High School did not have a strong
collaborative culture. He described a fairly recent situation with a former assistant superintendent
who demanded that teachers submit their detailed curriculum plans, and the plans would become
part of the teacher evaluation process. In a culture where teachers did not open “their classrooms
in general to each other, or to outsiders,” this was not a policy that was well received by the
faculty. Since that administrator has left the “whole district is moving towards a more open,
more collaborative, more of a supportive environment.” However, many teachers are still reticent
about working collaboratively. Karl is actively working to increase a more collaborative culture
by initiating guided discussions between students and teachers. He described facilitating a mixed
teacher-student discussion session about the use of Twitter in an English classroom, and having a
student design some tweets that helped the group develop a vision for how the platform could be

84
used to enrich the study of a recently assigned novel. Another example Karl provided was a
teacher-only professional development session on the merits of the flipped classroom. In this
way he is demonstrating curriculum leadership through the introduction of innovative practices,
and at the same time modeling the benefits of a more collaborative professional environment
within the school.
Karl has identified a potential problem in that he is designing the new learning commons
to support project-based learning in a school that hasn’t widely adopted this practice. “One
concern I have is…if I design it and it’s too far ahead of where people are, the last thing I want to
do is have people come in and take over the space and use it for what it is not designed for, but
you also want a lot of people to use it.” The tension between his vision and the current practice
of the faculty is an area that he has identified as a priority in addressing and moving forward.
Administration and leadership
Building trust
Rose, who is implementing the learning commons transition for the second time, provides
a vivid illustration on the power of building trust with her administrators. In 2009 Rose attended
a one-day conference sponsored by the American Library Association, in collaboration with the
New England School Library Association. The focus of the conference was the future of the
school library, and the learning commons model. She began to research the model, and began to
talk to teachers in her school (her first school) about what their school needed, where they
wanted to go, and what would work best for them as educators. “I put together a team of
teachers. We created a plan of everything that we wanted to see and looked at what we currently
had that was working well, and what wasn’t working well.” Rose had assembled her team at a
time of change in principals. The new principal was “completely on board with making changes.

85
He pushed us forward to go to the School Improvement Team. The School Improvement Team
agreed. Then the next step was to go to the superintendent. The superintendent said that if we
hadn’t come forward with the idea, that the library would have been forgotten.” The
superintendent was actively making plans for large-scale renovations and changes for the school,
and those plans did not include a re-envisioning of the library. Rose’s proposal placed the
learning commons renovation at the center of the vision for the future of the high school.
At her current school, North High School, Rose was hired in a climate of change. During
the hiring process the North High School principal insisted on speaking to Rose’s former
principal. The trust Rose had built through her work with her previous principal transferred to
her current principal, and has provided the strong base of administrative support required for a
successful transition. “I am very, very fortunate that I have an unbelievably supportive principal.
He is completely onboard with everything I do. I started off my first day here with the words ‘I
trust you.’”
Use of data
South Meadow High School has developed a strong culture of collecting data, and has
leveraged it to build trust and support with their building administrators. Jane’s annual report
over the past four years is data-driven, with no narrative. This is a conscious decision that Jane
made, and she describes the narrative as “the voice over if I got a chance to sit down with the
principal. Half the time we do get a chance to sit down with him live, but it’s charts and year
over year information on patrons, circulation and classes.” Jane’s belief the data is valued by the
principal is evidenced “when he is advocating or bragging” about their work, and “he spouts off
the statistics when we’re talking to the Parent Teacher School Organization (PTSO), so he must
have read it somewhere.”

86
Another example of the value the South Meadow High School principal places on the
data collected by the librarians is highlighted by this anecdote:
Just the other day an administrator from the district happened to be in the building. It was
an assistant superintendent. He loves the fact that we do custom research guides for all
our classes. He likes to show them “Look how many they’re doing right now. Look,
every department. Look at all the departments.” Then he goes, “Oh, where is that list of
the ones you’ve ever done?” We say, “Oh, you mean the archives,” and we click on that
page. We say, “Okay, these are all the ones we’ve done in the last three years in each
department.” He goes “See? See what they’re doing?” He knows it’s there and he knows
that we’re doing a lot of work.
When asked for an example of her use of data that resulted in an increase in trust and
advocacy from her principal, Rose recalled that at her previous school it was generally accepted
that the collection was old and not very relevant to the school curriculum. When she generated a
collection report that quantified the age of collection and provided specific evidence on areas that
needed updating, the result was a much-needed increase in the library materials budget. This use
of data formed the basis upon which Rose continued to establish perceptions of her leadership
qualities, and built administrative advocacy and trust that would be critical when she presented
her plan for transitioning to the learning commons model.
Karl’s use of data is ongoing and part of his general practice. He shares quarterly reports
with his principal that describe and/or highlight various aspects of the program at the time, and
as he is in a phase of grant writing for the renovation of the learning commons his data gathering
includes various surveys on current usage of the learning commons, technology usage and
requests, and focus groups on what the school community would like to see for Atlantic High

87
School in the future. This regular and ongoing data-driven practice has had an impact beyond
that of the learning commons, and has situated Karl in a leadership position within the school at
large.
I think outside of any of the results of the data, I think that taking initiative to collect data
on your program shows that you’re adept at data collection in general. I think that that’s
something that a lot of school leaders are looking for. I just participated in an exclusive
round of interviews with superintendents and principals, and that comes up in every
interview. They talk about how their decisions are informed by data, and the get excited
about schools that are using data to make their decisions…So when administrators, when
they discover that some of their staff is a bit of a data person [sic], I think if they’re smart
they look at them as a partner in school leadership. So I think if it’s outside of whatever
results you’re getting from your data, just accomplishing that data collection goal will,
for good or ill, put you in a leadership position.
Funding the transition process
Administrative support has been key in acquiring the funding for all three sites to
implement their transitions. At South Meadow High School, Jane describes how four years ago
the library staff wrote a white paper describing the learning commons model, the request for a
renovation for their space, and a wish list of items such that would facilitate the transitions
(Chrome books, iPads and an iPad storage/charging cart, new shelving, and furnishings). The
white paper and wish list explained why these requests were necessary to implement the new
model. The list, budget, and rationale provided the principal with a clear understanding of the
vision behind the model. An initial request for grant funding to the community education fund
was declined, but Jane stated “a year later the principal was undeterred, and decided to go to the

88
Parent Teacher Support Organization (PTSO) instead.” There was initial reluctance as the South
Meadow PTSO traditionally funded projects that served the entire student community, such as
proms, and they expressed concern about funding something they perceived as potentially
serving a minority of students in the school. The principal had the library staff update their
original white paper, and the data collected on patron counts provided the evidence that the
library was a heavily used by the majority of the students in the school; the PTSO agreed to fund
the request. Data on patron statistics shows that since that time there has been continued and
ongoing growth in student usage.
North High School is at a crossroads as the district and community are engaged in
deciding whether the school will undergo a sizeable renovation, or seek to rebuild. While the
decision process continues Rose is seeking community grant funding to develop an Innovation
Center that will include a refurbishment of the open-plan television studio that is also located in
the learning commons. She is developing a wish list and plan, similar to the South Meadow
white paper, that will outline the vision, rationale, and costs associated with the project.
One of Karl’s early changes at Atlantic High School was to establish a Library
Improvement Committee, comprised of the assistant superintendent, two teachers, two students,
two parents, another school librarian and the building principal. In implementing the transition to
a learning commons, Karl is working with his committee, and the goals outlined in the Atlantic
School Improvement Plan, to earmark funding of about $18,000 to bring in architectural
consultants and design a learning commons based on the recommendations of the committee.
Karl has identified a potential architectural firm based on the writing of one of the principal
architects who prioritizes the need for school learning spaces to reflect 21st century learning. One
of the aspects of this particular firm that Karl finds compelling is that after the space is designed

89
the firm will bring in trainers to provide professional development to teachers on how to
effectively use the space. By leveraging the opportunities for professional development provided
by the newly designed space, school pedagogy and practice within the school can also evolve.
This will also address Karl’s worries about designing a space that is coopted for other uses
because of a lack of a common vision between him as the librarian, and the faculty.
Leadership
The transition to the learning commons model has not provided the same leadership
opportunities in each site. At South Meadow, Jane recounted that five or six years ago (before
she was hired), the librarian was considered a department head that participated in school
governance with other academic department heads. The position as department head was
eliminated due to budget cuts and has never been reinstated. “We lost our place at the table and
that’s unfortunate, and it does make it harder to participate in things like developing curriculum
because we’re just less aware.” Jane and the other South Meadow High School librarians try to
compensate by visiting each department once or twice a year to share resources or tools with
teachers, and promote the collaborative opportunities available through the library.
In her previous school, Rose was a member of the School Improvement Team, and at that
time the focus of the group was on changes to the school. This was an important role for Rose
and it placed her plans for the transition to a learning commons at the center of the overall plan
for systemic change. She also met regularly with department directors in identifying and
procuring new resources as part of the changes planned for the school. In her new position she
does not yet have a defined leadership role. However, the school uses professional learning
groups (PLC) for ongoing faculty professional development, and Rose is grouped with the school

90
technology integration specialist. She is also in the early stages of reaching out to department
directors to begin the process of building relationships and improving communication.
At Atlantic High School, Karl was hired to replace the retiring librarian. Karl was told
that the administration had been waiting for this change and planned for a transition of the library
to a new model as a central responsibility of the new librarian. The transformation was a clear
goal in the School Improvement Plan, described as “transforming the library into a 21st century
learning program.” Karl questioned what was meant by the term 21st century skills and felt it was
appropriate to learn more about how the Atlantic High School community defined the term, and
learn more about how their perceptions informed their goals.
Because that’s a buzzword, so I needed to get into my head what people were thinking
when they said that. I saw myself defining it for people. I think a lot of people have an
idea, and in order to make over the plan we needed to come up with a common definition
of what we meant by that…it’s one of our jobs. It’s to really define what the vision was.
Through his formation of the Library Improvement Committee, the mission of
transformation has become more focused. The committee spent the past year articulating a set of
recommendations for the future of the library, and this has been incorporated into the new School
Improvement Plan for next year.
Karl reflected that being hired as someone who would implement change has thrust him
into a number of leadership positions, such as membership on the new superintendent search
committee. In thinking about this unexpected role, he said,
I don’t know why, because all I’ve done is reach out to the community to ask questions
so far. We have made a lot of good changes, but that helps. The transition period has put
me in the middle of things. It is good for the library because I think we are all starting to

91
see the culture change now. The library really is the central part of the school. It’s a
lightning rod for a lot of things that are going on.
Changes made for the transition
Buy-in
All three participants discussed resistance to change, and their experiences with
recognizing that change is hard for some people. Rose has encountered resistance to the
transition in both her buildings. In both schools she had the support of her administrators, but
recognized this wasn’t enough.
I want to say that the school that I was at before, there were a lot of people in the building
who wanted to make change, but then there were others that were very resistant because
they wanted a traditional library. They didn’t want anything to change. Here, some things
were already changing. I want to say that there was a lot of trepidation because they
weren’t changing they way they wanted them to, but then now they’re happy.
Rose credits the increase in what she refers to as “happiness” about the transition to her outreach,
“openness of listening to ideas, trying to get information from people about what they’re looking
for.” She states that the outreach should involve “as many people in your building as possible to
make sure that the vision for what you’re doing specifically relates to that of the school building
or the town. Each school and each building is different in what their needs are. It’s got to be very
flexible as to plan for future changes.” Of all the constituents in the community, Rose identified
the support and buy-in of the building principal and superintendent as essential.
Student buy-in is also a key aspect of Rose’s transition planning. In her previous school
she conducted student surveys and engaged in one-to-one discussions. She is currently
conducting one-to-one interviews in North High School, and is planning on student surveys to

92
find out more about what they would like to see changed. She wants to specifically learn more
about student opinions regarding changing resources, an example being the reduction in
magazine subscriptions. “I need to find out if they are still reading them and what they’re reading
so that I’ll be able to order magazines that work for them, instead of just ordering the ones that
we currently have.”
Rose already had a successful transition to a learning commons in her old school. One of
the markers of success she noted was a change in student and teacher behavior. Before the
transition “they were just talking to each other socially.” After the transition “the conversations
between the students changed, even down to the ELL students, whose language was not
proficient. Intellectually it was really stimulating watching those little groups of students, just
everything that they were talking about for their classes.”
Similar to Rose, Karl’s use of surveys with students and faculty provided his school
community with an opportunity to reflect on their use of the library and technology systems
(specific attention was given to the need for improved wireless technology), and to think about
new options. Given that Karl was hired to implement a transformation, he has seen his role
leveraged to introduce other transitions. His practice of using surveys has expanded to video
interviews.
This year we we’ve actually been filming interviews, for a couple of reasons. Those have
been a little bit more broad, about their impressions of the school, what they’d like to see
different about the school. Interviewing alumni about what they would have liked to see
different [sic], now that they’ve had a couple of years behind them.
In Karl’s practice of using surveys and interviews to gather information he has seen discussions
about the library “turn into conversations about the entire school, in the way that we teach and

93
learn, and how we need to adapt to somebody’s ideas that are floating out there that are good,
that people might not be aware of. And then, how does that translate into our own local
situation? There’s always unique things that effect those decisions.”
Branding
While all three sites clearly identify their transition as a shift towards a learning commons
model, not all have adopted the name within their school. Jane did not feel it was necessary to
change the name from “library” to “learning commons” because the motivation for the transition
felt like a natural evolution to “what a library should be.”
I believe every high school library should be a learning commons so I’d rather have
people think of library in this vibrant way than to think of a library as a stuffy old
warehouse for books. I’d rather have them transition their idea of what a library is by
continuing to call it a library. It didn’t seem a battle worth fighting. I want to change what
the place really is.
Rose was very clear in her first transition that the library be re-named as a learning
commons. She had educated her administrators, faculty, and students in the new model, and there
was widespread buy-in and support for the new name. On her second transition at North High
School, she is less wedded to the name.
I’m very indecisive about what I want to do with the name. I mean, a lot of people have
asked me, this is definitely not the same, what are you calling it? I would say learning
commons, but the name is like all over the place with what the principal is going for, but
I think he might be on board…he might be will to call it the learning commons.
Rose stated that while she likes the term, she “doesn’t think anymore it has to be that way. It’s
that model but it doesn’t need the name to run that way.”

94
In his previous school Karl also recounted the transition as stemming from the creative,
collaborative work they were already doing, so the change was “sort of a natural progression of
things.” The decision to re-brand and formally change the name from library to learning
commons reflected the transition, but also coincided with a move to a new building. In designing
the new space Karl recalled “it was almost like we were in a pilot project period without really
planning it that way. A lot of it was we realized was [sic] just reacting to opportunities that came
up, and a lot of us felt like it matched the learning commons.” Changing the name was also a
way to highlight the new activities and skills being taught, and reposition the learning commons
philosophy in the “public and community consciousness.” When the new building opened they
had a ribbon cutting ceremony to open the learning commons, attended by members of school
committee, the board of selectmen, and members of the community.
At Atlantic High School, Karl is clearly transitioning to a learning commons model, but
at this time it is unclear whether he will re-brand with the term or choose another naming
convention.
I think it’s really political, more than anything. If you’re doing it but by renaming and
you’re highlighting what you want people to think about what’s different about the
library, because, hopefully all libraries are different now…It’s however you want to enter
peoples consciousness with that idea. The learning commons is really well suited to that,
I think because it highlights the active, collaborative, community aspect of it, which is all
the new stuff.
Another name Karl is considering is “Global Learning Center.” The idea of being
connected to the entire world, through the library, resonates with his planning. To break down
the isolation of learning through greater technological connectedness is a powerful idea to

95
introduce into the school and community consciousness. “The Global Learning Center would
highlight that. This is a learning space for the community to access the world…I haven’t really
decided what we would call it, but I think I feel the weight this time, and so we re-designed the
library in a more dramatic way to open up in a different name.”
Looking ahead
As they reduced their print collections, all three schools plan on increasing their
collections with digital materials and databases. E-book purchasing is planned to support
research and inquiry activities. South Meadow has been implementing a platform called
Overdrive, developed more for pleasure reading, and found frequently in the public library
sector. Their goal over the next year is to heavily market the new digital resources, and then
collect data on usage to evaluate whether or not usage is increasing or not. Student and faculty
surveys are being developed and will be implemented at the start of next school year and again at
the end of the school year. They surveys are being designed to gauge shifts in attitudes towards
e-books and digital resources for both research and pleasure reading.
Ongoing changes to the physical space and increased services are planned for all three
school-sites. At South Meadow there are two major projects in the early stages of development.
Jane and her library colleagues are writing a grant to take a portion of their space and develop a
“Creation Studio.” This space will include a green screen, lighting and audio equipment that will
enhance the capabilities of their iPads, and video recorders for students to use to create videobased projects for both curricular and extracurricular projects.
The South Meadow principal is also seeking a way to embed the instructional technology
specialists within the library-learning commons to increase their visibility, and incorporate their
expertise into the learning commons services for students and faculty. Additionally, an

96
administrator in Information Technology has begun discussions about creating a Genius Bar,
staffed by students, in the learning commons. This is an example of the vision of the
administrators dovetailing with the vision of the learning commons, and together meeting the
improvement goals for the school.
At North High School, Rose has been looking at other learning commons programs, and
is actively planning to replace the computer lab with her vision for the Innovation Center. The
plans for the Innovation Center include a refurbishment and expansion of the open-plan
television studio, and will be designed to provide students with instruction, technology, and
support to engage with more video production to share their learning.
In addition to the planned renovation of the library, Karl is working toward his vision of a
school-wide transformation of teaching and learning. Since he was hired there has also been a
change in principals, and the new principal is interested in “taking risks that are in the best
interest of what he feels are for the students in the school. He is very open to suggestions from
the staff. He’s a really good listener.” Karl has developed a proposal that would strengthen the
learning center program at Atlantic, and will require that students articulate a project and present
the work to the school community at the end of each semester. This is an early step in his vision
of an overall transition towards project-based learning. He describes his proposal as an
aggressive way to institute the change he believes is best for students, with the library at the
center of the shift and serving as the hub for resources, as well as the venue for student
presentations that serve as the formative assessment of the work.
Themes
Through inductive coding, the researcher developed categories that emerged from close
reading of the raw data. Subsequent In Vivo coding revealed themes indicating areas of over-

97
lapping codes. This section of analysis focuses on the primary attribute codes that were identified
as essential to the areas of change. With all three participants, the coding process revealed
clusters around areas of change in the initial core codes, overlaid with the attribute codes of
vision, data, and trust.
Vision
In all three sites, school administrators looked to the librarian to articulate the change in
vision and mission for the school library. Each participant had a great deal of autonomy in
developing the vision for a re-imagined library, and a great deal of latitude in the implementation
of the transition. Jane, at South Meadow, wrote a white paper that clearly described the vision of
the learning commons, and mapped the steps and budget to implement the change. With the
white paper in hand, the principal “was undeterred” and advocated with two different granting
organizations to obtain the funds required to initiate the change.
Rose was hired in her current position based on the success of the transition at her
previous school. Her practice of outreach to faculty and students to learn about their needs, and
sharing her vision for what could be accomplished, has built the trust of both administrators and
the faculty in her previous school, and she is working to establish that trust in her current school.
In her previous school she was able to communicate her vision embedded in the work of the
School Improvement Team. Rose’s vision became central to the School Improvement Plan, and
changed the future direction of this school. Her current school is in an environment of change as
they discuss renovation options, and whether they want to rebuild. It remains to be seen how
Rose will integrate her vision into this process, but her outreach strategy has been effective in the
past.

98
Karl was hired as an agent of change, in a period of significant administrative turn over.
His ability to clearly articulate his vision for the learning commons has placed him in the center
of all change-related discussions. This clear articulation placed him on the hiring committees for
the new superintendent, the new principal, and was the basis of his creating of the Library
Improvement Committee. The work of this committee has now placed plans for a substantial
renovation of the learning commons as a high priority of the School Improvement Plan. His
vision extends beyond the learning commons and aspires to transition the entire school towards a
more project-based learning practice, with the learning commons serving as the hub for
resources, performance assessment, and global communication.
Data driven practice and clear reporting, attributes of all three participants, increased the
effective communication of vision. Jane’s annual reports and regular practice of data collection
enable her principal to provide powerful advocacy for the learning commons program. Rose
provided the research and data needed to successfully embed the transition to a learning
commons into the School Improvement Plan, the renovation of the new facility, and the vision
for the school. In her new position she is actively laying the groundwork for her school and the
transition to a learning commons by preparing a plan for the Innovation Center and renovated
television studio. Karl’s Library Improvement Committee and data-driven planning have
generated the plans and cost estimates required to put the renovation of the learning commons
into the School Improvement Plan. The renovation discussions are being leveraged to launch
broader discussions about project-based learning that will influence the entire school.
The ability to clearly and concisely articulate a vision is a critical feature in a successful
transition process. It builds confidence in the professionalism of the librarian, and establishes a
base line of trust in future innovation and ongoing change. The school administrators of all three

99
participants looked to the librarian practitioner to articulate a vision, and provided the necessary
support to achieve the goal of transitioning to a learning commons.
Communication
The ability to communicate effectively emerged as a strong attribute code, and
manifested itself in different ways.
Data
Jane’s practice of data collection inspires the confidence of her principal that the work
being done in the learning commons is rigorous, ongoing, and effective. Basic statistics such as
gate count, circulation, and class bookings show steady growth. Jane provides the data in an easy
to read format, and saves the narrative for more meaningful face-to-face discussions. To
compensate for the loss of “a place at the table” with department directors, Jane reaches out
directly to departments to share updates and improve awareness of all the resources available to
faculty and students. The online calendar system developed and implemented has proved to be
effective at facilitating communication between teachers and librarians around project goals, and
provides greater opportunities for collaborative planning. The online calendar also provides the
data that feeds the reports so valued by the principal.
In her first school Rose used data to provide her principal with insight into the state of the
library, and establish a preliminary round of change. She cited an early report on the average age
of the library collection as a key moment in building trust and advocacy with her administration.
It was generally perceived that the book collection was aged, “but they didn’t actually realize it
until they actually saw the numbers.” By clearly and definitively communicating data about the
age of the collection, Rose inspired confidence in her principal for her broader vision for the
transition to a learning commons.

100
While Karl has provided evidence of data-driven practice, he does not generate many
formal reports. Instead, he distributes quarterly reports designed to provide his principal with an
update on the changes being implemented, and how things are going in the transition. He is also
applying the information he gathers to local grant applications. This flow of updates keeps his
principal informed and part of the dynamic process of change in the learning commons, and
situates Karl in the ongoing school-wide discussions of change.
When asked about his perceptions about how his practice of data collection has
influenced his relationships with his administration, Karl was careful to separate the practice of
data collection from the results of the data. “I think outside of any of the results of the data, I
think that taking initiative to collect data on your program shows that you’re adept at data
collection in general.” As a member of the hiring committees for the new school principal and
assistant superintendent, Karl recounted that the use of data came up in every interview. “They
talk about how their decisions are informed by data, and they get excited about schools that are
using data to make their decisions.” Karl noted that his practice of data collection marked him as
a faculty member adept in data gathering practices, and that this has evolved into an active
partnership with his school administration leadership team as they plan for school-wide change.
Consensus
For the purposes of this study, consensus is defined as a general agreement about
something. Consensus was an attribute that appeared most often in relation to teacher and student
buy-in with the transition. A necessary element of a successful transition, consensus is achieved
by creating an atmosphere and academic program that is valued by faculty and students, and that
generates positive feelings within the community. This study does not include a formal metric
for establishing consensus. In this study, consensus has been based upon participant reports

101
across the following measures: gate count, scheduled classes, circulation statistics, and a general
sense of appreciation for the changes that accompanied the transition.
At South Meadow consensus can be measured by the steady increase in collaborative
lesson planning with academic departments, and by steadily increasing student usage as a result
of the diverse changes instituted in the process of the transition. This was accomplished by
working within the study hall and open campus systems to tailor the learning commons space to
honor the diversity of student usage. There are areas for quiet study, social working groups, and
areas within the social footprint for students to sit at café seating and look out the windows. The
two classroom spaces provide the instructional areas required by teachers, and the planned
additions of a Genius Bar and Technology Specialists help area will add to the broad range of
services and support for the community.
In her previous school Rose demonstrated consensus for the transition through her acts of
sharing what she learned about the learning commons model, and establishing a practice of
discussions with faculty, students, and administration to seek their thoughts and input about what
benefits the model could bring to the school, and reflecting that feedback into the School
Improvement Plan and the implementation plan for the transition. Through her practice of
outreach and communication with faculty and students, Rose is working to establish consensus
for the learning commons vision in her current school. In the meantime, she has changed the
layout of the library to increase light, increase comfortable seating, and establish the value placed
on social learning for students. The shift from dark and quiet to noisy and bright has shown
immediate benefits with increased usage. This positive shift in perception is the foundation for
obtaining broad buy-in and long-term consensus for later evolutions in her vision for the learning
commons.

102
Karl was hired with the expectation of implementing change. In this role Karl, has
established consensus for his vision from administration, and while he has some buy-in from
faculty, he still has more work to do if his goal for school-wide project-based learning is to
become a reality. Karl is in the process of creating focus groups and surveys to solicit feedback,
and also to create consensus for the goals of the transition and renovation.
By opening the space and making it more welcoming to students he has established
effective buy-in, and has repositioned what was formerly a very dark and quiet library into a
bustling, early-stage learning commons. Karl needs to establish broader consensus among the
faculty as he moves forward with his planned renovations, or his fear of the newly designed
space being co-opted for other uses could be a real concern, and potentially undermine the
success of his vision.
Summary of research findings
The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that promote or undermine a
successful transition from a traditional high school library to a learning commons service model.
The findings of this study are based on the experiences of three school library practitioners who
have each successfully implemented a transition. Two of the participants have moved on from
their original transition school, are in new positions, and are actively engaged in transitioning
their new schools. The findings of this study are based on the experiences and words of these
participants, in different school communities, and include reflections on their experiences from
across a period of years. The data indicate that there are factors that can promote a successful
transition, and factors that can undermine a transition.
Vision

103
The ability of the school librarian to clearly articulate a vision, and provide data and a
plan to achieve the transition, are essential to success. In the experiences recounted by the
participants, their school administrators demonstrated openness and enthusiasm for a clear vision
for their school libraries. When provided with documentation, such as Jane’s white paper, the
principal developed the confidence to become an enthusiastic advocate and supporter for the
learning commons model.
Data
An ongoing practice of collecting data in diverse ways and evidence of data-driven
practice and decision-making are identified as a key component that supports a successful
transition. The school librarians in this study all recognized the value in providing a road map
with cost analysis in making their case for a transition to the learning commons. In this context,
data also included research on the model and examples from other communities that have
engaged in the transition process. Evidence of data collection of traditional services such as gate
count, book circulation, and classes taught, all foster administrative confidence in the
effectiveness of the learning commons and the school librarian practitioners. The confidence
inspired by data-driven practice has resulted in administrative support, advocacy, and leadership
opportunities for the school librarian. It also bodes well for ongoing support for the learning
commons to continue to evolve and diversify services that support student and faculty learning.
“I trust you”
This statement made by the principal of North High School on Rose’s first day
encapsulates the core factor that will either support or undermine a transition. Trust provides the
librarian the freedom to make the decision that pave the way for school change and the ongoing
evolution of the school learning commons. In the early stages of each of the school transitions,

104
administrators demonstrated trust in their school librarians when they gave approval to reduced
the size of book collections in favor of creating new spaces for students to gather, learn, and
create. Had this trust not been established, and approval to weed and reduce the library collection
(in accordance with school policy guidelines) withheld, the first goal of the transition would have
been undermined, threatening the success of the rest of the transition.
The trust was demonstrated when the librarians introduced new floor plans, re-organized
space, ordered new technology and furnishings, and as they continue to pursue new changes in
the form of Innovation and Creativity Labs, Global Learning Centers, and Genius Bars. If
administrative support was withheld, that would have undermined access to funding, advocacy
for grants, and support for systemic and school-wide support in the form of the staffing and
budget changes required to support the changes and proposed innovative services. This domain
of trust is critical to a successful transition.
Trust is also important in addressing problems that may arise. In his previous position,
Karl spoke of being “too successful” in making the learning commons a popular location for
students. Being inundated by students began to undermine the environment designed to promote
social learning, and negatively impacted the mission of the learning commons as a place for
academic pursuit. Karl highlighted the need to recognize that the problem was systemic and
rooted in the open campus system and the lack of viable options for students when not in a
scheduled class. The problem was not one that could be solely attributed to the learning
commons or solely solved by the learning commons. Having a trust-based relationship with
administrators allows problems to be addressed more effectively by looking at the issue from a
school-wide perspective, and not in the isolation of the learning commons.

105
This trust is paramount as these school librarians demonstrated when they introduced new
practices such as digital creation tools, social media platforms such as Twitter, and new
pedagogy such as project-based learning. By trusting their school librarians, administrators are
also communicating trust to their faculty that innovation and experimentation are valued and
supported. This helps promote a school-wide culture of trust for teachers to participate in
exploration and innovation of new practice and pedagogy. Without this trust it is not possible to
achieve the goals set for school-wide student achievement, and the transition to a learning
commons would be tragically undermined.
Conclusion
A successful transition requires that the school librarian have a clear and well-articulated
vision supported by data and research that will build enthusiasm and advocacy for the transition
with school administrators. Strong communication skills in the form of out-reach to faculty and
students to articulate the vision and change process, and a practice of ongoing data collection and
data sharing, all help build consensus among the school community to embrace the change.
Without these attributes the fate of a successful transition process can be undermined and not
fully implemented, or not implemented in a manner that allows for ongoing evolution and
change. With these factors in place, the newly transitioned learning commons has an excellent
chance of continued growth, and of taking a central role in school change and student
achievement into the future.

Chapter 5: Discussion of Research Findings
Revisiting the Problem of Practice
Successfully transitioning to a learning commons service model requires new approaches
and systemic change within a school. The problem of practice focuses on the need to increase
awareness of these requirements for school librarians and the administrators who will provide the
necessary funding, leadership, and collaborative curriculum planning opportunities that are
features of the model.
Review of the Research Questions
The research questions were designed to discover the factors that positively or negatively
impact the transition process.
•

What factors determine a successful transition?

•

What factors undermine or threaten a successful transition?

The open-ended interview questions provided the three participants a great deal of
latitude to reflect on their experiences and identify aspects of their experiences that went well,
that did not go well, and the impact on the success of each of their transitions.
Discussion of Major Findings
The major finding of the study is that the most important factor in a successful transition
is the trust of the school principal in the school librarian. The school librarian establishes this
trust through:
•

Data driven practice

•

The ability to communicate a clear vision

•

The ability to provide a detailed plan on how to implement the vision

•

The ability to generate positive consensus for the transition

107
This administrative trust is the foundation for a successful transition because it is the
basis for decision making on budgets, advocacy for additional funding, vision for the school in
general, the role of the learning commons within the school community, and for the role the
learning commons will play in future. Trust is the basis for the autonomy required for the school
librarian to set procedure for the learning commons, and also for the systemic, school-wide
policy changes that may be required to support the learning commons as a central part of the
school environment and culture.
Lack of trust undermines a successful transition by isolating the learning commons from
leadership discussions that situate the program at the center of innovation and school change.
This isolation can also be seen in low levels of collaboration with other teachers, and low
integration of information and technology skills in the school curriculum, as seen with the initial
lack of citation skill integration at North and Atlantic High Schools.
Discussion of the Findings in Relation to the General Inductive Approach
Using a general inductive approach allowed for the raw data to be condensed into a brief
summary that established links between the experiences of the participants. The research
findings identified “trust” as the primary factor for predicting success. This theory emerged from
the data through experiences of the participants, as revealed by their practice and the successful
outcomes of their transition processes.
The coding process of the raw data revealed common categories between the three
participants in terms of their process. These included reduction of the size of the library
collection, creation of more open and collaborative space that included renovation and the
introduction of diverse seating options, changes in procedure that provide more flexible access

108
for students (within the parameters set by study halls within each school), increases in
collaborative practices with teachers, and data driven practice.
The coding process also revealed common themes between the participants that included
vision, communication, and consensus. These themes proved to be influential in establishing the
trust of their school administrators, and ensuring the acceptance of the transition by the school
community.
Member-checks were conducted with the interview transcripts and draft of the initial
findings. The member –checks allowed the participants to reflect and clarify or expound on their
experiences, and reaffirmed the category coding decisions made by the researcher.
Discussion of the Findings in Relation to the Literature Review
The findings of this study correlate well to the literature review. The themes identified in
the literature review were:
•

The learning commons model situated within the history of school libraries in the
United states

•

The elements of the learning commons model

•

Attributes of a successful learning commons

History of School Libraries
The service model for school libraries in the US has continually evolved over time. The
research indicates that in order to stay relevant, school libraries must adapt their service models
to support ongoing changes in digital information and diverse technologies (Beagle, 1999). The
participants each reflected that their school library programs had been evolving, and that the
formal switch to the learning commons model was in recognition of the changes that were
already underway.

109
During their first transition, Rose and Karl had formally changed the name from “school
library” to “learning commons.” They each indicated that they felt that re-branding was an
important strategy to signal the importance of the new mission of their programs to the school
community. Jane did not feel the same way. She kept the label “library”, and chose to focus on
shifting the perceptions and attitudes of her school community about what a library was, and
what it could offer.
In their current schools Rose and Karl are committed to the learning commons model, but
less committed about maintaining the naming convention. Karl believes that the name should
communicate the goals of the program, and is a useful strategy in guiding long-term goals for
school change. Rose is aware of her principal’s goals for school change, and expressed the desire
of choosing a name that reinforces those goals. At the time of the study she was unsure whether
or not her principal would keep “learning commons” or choose another name for the school
library.
The last time there was a widespread change in the naming convention was 1945, when
the term “media center” was added to the school library mission. It remains to be seen if there
will be a widespread shift towards the use of “learning commons” in the naming convention
within schools. Looking ahead, it is possible that the program and service centers we currently
identify as “libraries” will embrace the learning commons model, but with a diversity of names
that reflect the long-term goals of the school.
Elements of the Learning Commons Model
The transition process of all three participants aligned well with the elements identified in
the literature review. All three de-emphasized their print collections in favor of creating more
open, flexible, and collaborative work areas, and described the new areas as no longer being

110
“owned” by the school librarian, but as being “owned” by the school community and available to
all for diverse forms of work. This open-access, wireless environment is identified as a core
attribute of the learning commons model (Loertscher et al., 2011).
The learning commons as an experimental learning center is also identified as a key
feature, and this attribute is seen in all three sites (Loertscher et al., 2011). At Atlantic High
School Karl has initiated a practice of showcasing student work, as well as facilitating
professional development in student/faculty exploration of Twitter in the English classroom, and
for the school faculty in learning more about the strategies associated with the flipped classroom.
Karl has situated his learning commons in the heart of the school change initiatives, and is
deeply involved with discussions on long-term change. Jane and Rose value this aspect of the
model, and through expansion, renovation, and grant writing are building these aspects of their
programs in the form of new and upgraded video production services, Genius Bars, and
Innovation Labs. These innovations will bring a variety of specialists into the footprint of the
learning commons, and is consistent with the experimental learning center element.
The third element is the virtual learning commons, which supports both the open learning
commons and the experimental learning center with access to digital content, and curated content
aligned to school curriculum. The curated content is in the form of pathfinders, LibGuides
developed for lessons that contain embedded database widgets and other digital resources,
tutorials, and other collaborative productivity and presentation platforms.
Jane is furthest along in this domain of the transition process, and has embraced and
promoted a shift towards more digital systems and practices. The virtual learning commons is
seen through the active promotion of a core, school-wide web-based citation platform that
ensures consistent instruction for all students, as well as the shift to an electronic calendar that

111
facilitates collaborative planning with teachers and also generates the data she uses to provide
evidence of impact on student learning. Both Karl and Rose have developed robust web portals
that signify the importance of this element of the learning commons model.
Attributes of a Successful Learning Commons
The study findings are consistent with the attributes identified in the literature review as
key to a successful implementation of the model. The primary attribute was leadership, described
as social influence that drives the work of the organization (Spillane, 2006). The librarian
leadership attributes identified in the literature were the presence of a supportive principal,
opportunities for leadership roles and responsibilities, a desire on the part of the school librarian
to make positive impacts on student achievement, ongoing professional development, and a
personal sense of obligation to become deeply engaged with the school organization (Johnston,
2012). Based on these leadership attributes, all three participants have provided evidence of
strong leadership within their schools.
Rose and Karl have been able to effectively communicate the vision and plans for
renovation and construction projects centered on the transition to the learning commons model,
and have leveraged these plans into positions of leadership within their schools. As members of
school improvement committees, the learning commons model has been central to the change
driven goals of their principals.
Due to budget cuts before Jane’s arrival, the school librarian as a member of the
department chairs leadership team was cut. Jane recognizes that when they lost that seat, they
lost an important leadership role in the life of the school. Loss of that seat makes collaboration
more challenging, but she and her colleagues work hard to compensate through outreach during
regularly scheduled department meetings.

112
The autonomy of the school librarian to set procedures for the learning commons, as well
as maintain control over scheduling, are attributes that promote a successful implementation of
the model (Koechlin et al., 2010). All three participants clearly have a great deal of autonomy in
setting procedure, managing their calendar and class schedules, and control over their virtual
space. This allows them to manage student use and crowding and balance the diverse needs of
students and faculty. Karl articulated the challenges faced when student use becomes
overwhelming, and the need to respond with a systemic, school-wide approach. At his first
school the open campus and school culture of free movement of students around the school
resulted in over-use of the learning commons. This stress was a factor that undermined the
success of the model. Since leaving for his current position, he reported that his previous school
has created a new student lounge for students not in a scheduled class, and this alternative space
has taken some of the pressure off the learning commons. He is aware that over use by students
is a factor that can undermine the success of the transition, and is planning carefully as he moves
forward with his current transition.
The tragedy of the commons serves as a cautionary tale for school librarians and
administrators in considering a transition to the learning commons model. Examples of the
factors that, if absent, can undermine the success of the transition include:
•

Student over-use

•

Lack of curricular collaboration because of lack of faculty consensus

•

Insufficient collaborative space

•

Insufficient technology resources

•

Lack of librarian autonomy in setting procedures

113
•

Lack of administrative support in creating systemic school-wide policy to support the
learning commons model

Limitations
The results of this study show similar themes between the participants that reflect the
findings of the literature review. However, a limitation of the study is the similarity of the
participant schools. All three schools have a majority of white students and low levels of
African-American or Hispanic diversity when compared to state averages within Massachusetts.
All three schools come from communities that range from middle class to affluent. Additionally,
all three participants self-identified as having a successful transition experience, and had positive
feelings about the process.
The study may have been strengthened by the participation of a school librarian who was
disappointed with the outcome of his/her transition process and investigate the reasons why the
transition was less than successful. Is there an example of a supportive administrator but inability
to provide necessary funding for technology, new furnishings for casual seating, shelving, or a
renovation? What is the impact of faculty resistance or rejection on the success of the transition?
Will the transition succeed if there is rigid curriculum that undermines the potential for
collaborative curriculum planning? How would a transition be impacted by poor school
technology infrastructure? A participant with these challenges may have introduced further
insight into the factors that promote or undermine a successful transition to the model.
Future Research Considerations
Attributes
To expand on the factors that promote or undermine a transition to the learning commons
model, more research needs to be conducted on each of the individual attributes, and how

114
successful school librarians develop these as areas of professional strength. Research would
include pre-service training, professional development experiences, and access to professional
development focused on leadership attributes within school organizations.
Inputs
Longitudinal research is needed on the relative impact of the inputs that come as a result
of the leadership attributes (opportunities for curriculum leadership, collaborative leadership,
funding, support for change, technology, space renovation) and how they impact the long-term
success of a transition.
Specific Requirements
A study of successful transitions that includes staffing levels based on school size,
collection size and budgets, database budgets, technology infrastructure, and other quantifiable
inputs will clarify the requirements of a successful transition, and provide school librarians with
guidelines as they develop their own strategic plans for change. These guidelines would be very
useful to school librarians as they develop their vision for a transition, and the implementation
plans that would build trust with their principals.
School Librarian Staffing Ratios
At this time there are no guidelines or recommendations for staffing ratios for high school
librarians. National data on school staffing ratios obtained from the US Department of Education
indicates very high ratios for school librarians. As seen with Rose at North High School, a
teacher ratio of 1:1,530 makes it very difficult to achieve the goal of personalized instruction. A
study that evaluates ratios and makes specific recommendations would be invaluable to the field
of school librarianship.
Consensus

115
Further research into establishing measureable benchmarks for school-wide consensus on
the learning commons model would be very useful for school librarians to establish progress,
potential growth areas, and impact on student achievement. In addition to familiar statistics (gate
count, circulation, scheduled classes) new categories of data can be identified that could provide
evidence of richer activities such as collaboration, communication, presentation, and creativity.
With greater insight into the activities and events that generate consensus it will be possible to
more broadly and consistently position the learning commons at the center of school change.
Significance of the Study to the Field
The findings of the study indicate that the school librarian is the primary driver in
motivating change in the vision for the school library. Administrators who want change need to
rely on the school librarian to articulate the change, and tailor it to the needs of the school
community and culture. The responsibility for building consensus within the school community
also lies with the school librarian, and is a key component in a time of school-wide change.
Through her outreach and use of surveys to determine what faculty and students valued and
wanted, Rose was also able to effectively communicate the value of the learning commons
model, and allay more general fears caused by the climate of change initiated by the North High
School principal. Karl is also using surveys and interviews to build consensus for the transition
to the learning commons, as well as increase communication about the goals for broader schoolwide change. Jane has already situated the South Meadow Library within school-wide plans for
innovation and change, clearly establishing the learning commons model as a core component of
on-going change within the school.

116
Conclusion
Through analysis of the transition experiences of the three participants, the trust of the
building principal was identified as the primary hallmark of success. The attributes of the school
librarian that positively influence the trust of principals are identified as vision and an
implementation plan, data-driven practice, communication, and consensus building skills.
Based on research relating to the learning commons service model, a successful transition
includes a reduction and reorganization of the book collection to increase space for collaborative
activities. An integral part of the shift in the mission of the library collection is a de-emphasis on
print reference and a transition to e-books to replace print reference, and a priority given to
purchasing high interest young adult fiction and narrative nonfiction to promote curriculum and
pleasure reading for students.
The revitalization of the former school library to a learning commons requires diverse
seating, working, and production options for students, as well as access to technology for equity,
learning, creation, and sharing. The virtual learning commons is a space that promotes curated
access to curriculum content as well as communication and scheduling for students and faculty.
In conclusion, the learning commons is a model designed to support student learning and
achievement in a period of evolving and dynamic change in curriculum and digital information
and presentation technologies. This study situates the learning commons as central to school
change, and identifies the factors that promote a successful transition. The tragedy of the
commons scenario represents a transition process that is undermined by lack of support in key
domains. Without the trust of the building principal, the school librarian faces challenges in
implementing the model, and positioning the learning commons at the heart of student and

117
faculty work within the school. With trust, the learning commons can play a central role in
school goals, school change, and student achievement.

Appendix A Call for Participants
Are you a certified high school librarian in the state of Massachusetts who has implemented a
transition from traditional school library to the learning commons service model? Please
consider participating in this study to learn more about the requirements of a successful
transition.
A study is being conducted to gain insight into the factors that promote a successful transition to
the learning commons model, and the factors that can undermine a successful transition.
Potential high school librarian participants must hold Massachusetts teacher certification and an
active membership in the Massachusetts School Library Association. Potential participants will
have engaged in a transition from school library to learning commons service model.
The study consists of two interviews, which may be conducted either by phone, Skype®, or in
person. The first interview focuses on the participant’s experience with the transition process
(approximately 60-90 minutes); the second interview will allow the participant to reflect upon
the transition based on the first interview, and provide additional detail or reflection
(approximately 60 minutes). Participants who complete both interviews will receive one $25
gift card to either Amazon.com or iTunes.
If you or someone you know would like to participate in this study or learn more, please
email cicchetti.r@husky.neu.edu or call 978-371-9819. Selection for the study is not guaranteed,
but will be determined during a brief 5-10 minute intake call.
Confidentiality is guaranteed, and participants’ names or school names will never be
shared with others or used in the published results.
This study is conducted by Robin Cicchetti, an EdD doctoral candidate at Northeastern
University. This study has been approved by Northeastern University’s Institutional Review
Board for research ethics (IRB# 12-12-27).

Please answer each of the following questions using non-technical language. Missing
or incomplete answers will delay your review while we request the information.
D. What are the goals of this research? Please state your research question(s) and related
hypotheses.
The goal of this research is to examine the process of transitioning from a traditional high school
library service model to the learning commons service model. The research focuses on the school
librarian practitioner, and is designed to identify the factors that either promote a successful
transition, or undermine the transition.
The following question guides the direction of this study:
The research questions are designed to explore the factors that positively or negatively influence
the transition from a traditional high school library to a learning commons model.

130
What is the process of transitioning a traditional high school library to a learning commons
service model?
• What factors determine a successful transition?
• What factors undermine or threaten the transition?
This exploratory design allows for an in-depth analysis of the complex factors related to the
transition process, and a hypothesis on the requirements for success.
E. Provide a brief summary of the purpose of the research in non-technical language.
This study addresses the lack of understanding of the various elements of the learning commons
that are required for a successful transition and implementation of the model (Crowe, 1969).
High school libraries are responding to changes in digital information and media literacy by
moving away from the traditional service model towards a learning commons model that
supports 21st century learning goals for students (Loertscher, Koechlin, & Zwaan, 2011). This
transition involves systemic changes and a different approach towards long-term strategic
planning, pedagogy, collaborative planning and teaching, budgeting, student scheduling, library
technology infrastructure, ongoing technology support, and curriculum leadership (Koechlin,
Rosenfeld, & Loertscher, 2010). Unless there is appropriate planning for a learning commons
there are challenges that can undermine the success of such a transition.
By identifying the factors that promote a successful transition, or undermine the transition, the
study will provide useful guidelines for school library practitioners and their administrators. The
study has the potential to reveal domains of the transition process for future study.
F. Identify study personnel on this project. Include name, credentials, role, and
organization affiliation.
*Principal Investigator – Dr. Kristal Clemons Ph.D; Northeastern University faculty located in
Northeastern University College of Continuing Studies – will have minimal access to data
*Student Researcher – Robin Cicchetti, M.LS; Head Librarian of Concord-Carlisle Regional
High School and doctoral (EdD) student in Northeastern University College of Continuing
Studies.
*Professional Transcriptionist – To be confirmed. Each time interview transcription is
mentioned in the study, the possibility of utilizing a professional transcriptionist is also
mentioned. If used, the professional transcriptionist will be asked to sign a “Transcriber
Confidentiality Statement in a Research Study” Form (Appendix A).
G. Identify other organizations or institutions that are involved. Attach current

Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals or letters of permission as necessary.

131
The Student Researcher (Robin Cicchetti) is a board member of the Massachusetts School
Library Association (MSLA). The Call for Participants (Appendix B) will go out through MSLA
Listserve and Facebook group. A letter of permission can be found in Appendix C.
H. Recruitment Procedures
Describe the participants you intend to recruit. Provide all inclusion and exclusion
criteria. Include age range, number of subjects, gender, ethnicity/race, socio-economic
level, literacy level and health (as applicable) and reasons for exempting any groups.
Describe how/when/by whom inclusion/exclusion criteria will be determined.
Potential participants will be three professionally certified Massachusetts public high school
librarians. Potential participants in the study will be identified through professional membership
to the MSLA, and participation in the study will be voluntary. Membership to the MSLA
indicates that the participants have a shared value for ongoing professional development in their
field, as well as an interest in collegial engagement with fellow school library practitioners. This
will serve as a commonality between the three participants despite potential differences in school
building cultures.
The Call for Participants (Appendix B) states the criteria, and includes the statement: “Selection
for the study is not guaranteed, but will be determined during a brief 5-10 minute intake call.”
Participants will be recruited from the Massachusetts School Library Association, a professional
association of certified school librarians in order to establish a purposeful sample (Creswell,
2013).
Potential participants will self-identify as working at a Massachusetts public high school level
and as having experienced transitioning a school library into a learning commons. In order to
maintain consistency of state educational frameworks and other state regulations between case
studies, all potential participants will have experienced this transition in a Massachusetts public
high school. Employment in a Massachusetts public high school also confirms professional
licensure and state certification as a teacher.
During the intake call, the Student Researcher will give a brief overview of the project, and then
ask criteria-based questions (self-recording the participants’ answers). After determining if the
individual would be an adequate candidate, the Student Researcher will state whether or not the
individual qualifies for the study.
Describe the procedures that you will use to recruit these participants. Be specific. How
will potential subjects be identified? Who will ask for participation? If you intend to
recruit using letters, posters, fliers, ads, website, email etc., copies must be included as
attachments for stamped approval. Include scripts for intended telephone recruitment.
Recruitment will be in the form of snowball sampling, whereby the researcher will reach out to
school librarians who have shared via professional networks (MSLA listserve and MSLA
Facebook Group) that they are engaged in a transition Creswell, 2012). The researcher will ask

132
the potential participant if they know of other school librarians who are engaged in the process,
and thereby expand the pool of potential participants.
School administrators of potential participants will receive an email (containing the CfP) from
the Student Researcher, informing them of the study and the participation of the school librarian
in their school. The Student Researcher will request permission from the building principal to
conduct the study, and visit the school site with the specific goal of interviewing the school
librarian and reviewing materials and artifacts specific to the study.
The Call for Participants gives a brief explanation of the purpose of the study, participant
criteria, compensation, and contact information.
What remuneration, if any, is offered?
A $15 gift card to either Amazon.com or iTunes (participant’s choice) will be offered to
participants who complete the study.
I. Consent Process
Describe the process of obtaining informed consent*. Be specific. How will the project
and the participants’ role be presented to potential participants? By whom? When?
Where? Having the participant read and sign a consent statement is done only after the
researcher provides a detailed oral explanation and answers all questions. Please attach a
copy of informed consent statements that you intend to use, if applicable.
If your study population includes non-English speaking people, translations of consent
information are necessary. Describe how information will be translated and by whom.
You may wait until the consent is approved in English before having it translated.
Interviews will be only with English speaking people.
As stated in section H (Recruitment Procedures), the researcher will give a detailed oral
explanation of the scope of the project and the role of the participant during the intake call.
Participants will receive the unsigned consent form prior to the interview. We will review the
form at the start of the interview. Participant questions will be answered, and they will be asked
to give their verbal consent on the recording.
If your population includes children, prisoners, people with limited mental capacity,
language barriers, problems with reading or understanding, or other issues that may make
them vulnerable or limit their ability to understand and provide consent, describe special
procedures that you will institute to obtain consent appropriately. If participants are
potentially decisionally impaired, how will you determine competency?
N/A

133

*If incomplete disclosure during the initial consent process is essential to carrying out the
proposed research, please provide a detailed description of the debriefing process. Be
specific. When will full disclosure of the research goals be presented to subjects (e.g.,
immediately after the subject has completed the research task(s) or held off until the
completion of the study’s data collection)? By whom? Please attach a copy of the written
debriefing statement that will be given to subjects.
N/A
J. Study Procedures
Provide a detailed description of all activities the participant will be asked to do and what
will be done to the participants. Include the location, number of sessions, time for each
session, and total time period anticipated for each participant, including long term follow
up.
Qualitative data will be collected through interviews conducted by the Student Researcher either
in person, over the phone, or via ‘Skype®’ (an online program which allows people to converse
remotely, similar to a telephone conversation, but also offering the ability for individuals to see
one another).
After the initial intake call (approximately 5-10 minutes), each participant will be interviewed
two separate times. The first interview will focus on the participant’s experience transitioning
from a school library service model to a learning commons model. The questions in the first
interview are rooted in five domains established in the literature review. The second interview
will allow the participant to reflect upon the their experiences (lasting approximately 60
minutes), and determine if there are other factors that impacted their experiences. The second
interview will occur one month after the first.
The transcripts and initial data codes/interpretations from both the first and second interview will
be emailed to a secure email address provided by the participant within one month after the
second interview. This review will constitute part of the member check process. The participant
will then have one week to review the information and provide any feedback in regards to the
validity, or make requests for alterations.
A thank you card and the $15 Amazon.com or iTunes gift card will be mailed to each participant
two weeks after the second interview is complete (and the member checking period has lapsed).
Who will conduct the experimental procedures, questionnaires, etc? Where will this be
done? Attach copies of all questionnaires, interview questions, tests, survey instruments,
links to online surveys, etc.
The interviews will be conducted by the Student Researcher (Robin Cicchetti) either in person,
over the phone, or via Skype®. When done over the phone or Skype®, the Student Researcher
will conduct all interviews in the secure settings of either her work or home office, and the

134
participant will be asked to also be in a location where privacy and concentration can be
maintained. If there are any instances where an in-person interview is possible, these would also
be conducted in a private setting to ensure confidentiality and the ability for both the researcher
and interview to concentrate on the interview.
The script for the Intake Call, Interviews #1 & #2 (which include the interview questions) is
attached (see Interview Protocol Form, Appendix D).
K. Risks
Identify possible risks to the participant as a result of the research. Consider possible
psychological harm, loss of confidentiality, financial, social, or legal damages as well as
physical risks. What is the seriousness of these risks and what is the likelihood that they
may occur?
Appropriate measure will be taken to ensure confidentiality (see Section L: Confidentiality).
Participants will be discussing their professional experience, and potentially identifying factors
that reflect poorly on their school organization such as poor administrative support. To protect
participants from retribution from administrators or professional evaluators pseudonyms will be
used for the participants and their schools.
Describe in detail the safeguards that will be implemented to minimize risks. What
follow-up procedures are in place if harm occurs? What special precautions will be
instituted for vulnerable populations?
Participants will be informed that if they feel uncomfortable replying to any of the questions that
are asked, they are free to decline from answering. They will be also told both verbally and in
the Consent Form (Appendix D) that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time.
Every effort possible will be made to protect participant confidentiality, and no other risks
(financial, social, physical, etc.) seem likely based on participation in this study.
L. Confidentiality
Describe in detail the procedures that will be used to maintain anonymity or
confidentiality during collection and entry of data. Who will have access to data? How
will the data be used, now and in the future?
Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with an
individual will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with the participant’s expressed
request/permission or as required by law. No names will be associated with any interview
information; any information that could be used to identify a participant will be altered to protect
their confidentiality; the recording of the interview will not be labeled with the participant’s
name, but rather a pseudonym; should a professional transcriptionist be used, a Transcriber
Confidentiality Statement (Appendix A) will be used; all data files will be encrypted and

135
password protected, and only the Principal Investigator (Doctor Kristal Clemons) and Student
Researcher on this project (Robin Cicchetti) will have access to the files.
The data will be used for the Student Researcher’s doctoral thesis project, and potentially for
future journal articles, books, presentations, or research. Even in these potential instances,
confidentiality will be kept for all participants.
Information regarding confidentiality will be shared with all participants prior to the interview
process, both in the Consent Form and verbally.
How and where will data be stored? When will data, including audiotapes and
videotapes, be destroyed? If data is to be retained, explain why. Will identifiers or links
to identification be destroyed? When? Signed consent documents must be retained for 3
years following the end of the study. Where and how will they be maintained?
Each interview will be audio-recorded by an electronic application called “AudioMemos” on two
separate devices (the Student Researcher’s iPad and iPhone) to ensure the audio is captured.
AudioMemos has no limit to audio-length, and electronic recordings can be transferred to a
computer as mp4 or .wav files.
The electronic recordings of the interviews and all other electronic documents will be
downloaded and then saved to the Student Researcher’s personal USB flash drive, and personal
external hard drive. All files will be encrypted and password-protected.
Interviews will be transcribed by one of two methods:
1) Directly by the student researcher, or
2) By a professional transcriptionist who will be required to sign a “Transcriber
Confidentiality Statement in a Research Study” (Appendix A).
Transcripts will be saved in the same secure manner as the electronic recordings. The only other
person who would have access to original files and actual names would be the Principal
Investigator (Dr. Clemons), should there be a need.
Any written documents will be kept in the locked desk drawer at the home of the Student
Researcher (994 Old Rd. to Nine Acre Corner, Concord, MA 01742) during the period when the
investigation is taking place. After the thesis project is complete, any hard-copy materials
containing confidential interviewee information will be destroyed. All remaining electronic data
stored on the student researcher’s USB flash drive and personal external hard drive will remain
untouched, and kept in a locked safe in the home of the Student Researcher. These remaining
data and documents will be destroyed 5 years following the completion of the study.

Transcriber Confidentiality Statement in a Research Study
I am asking you [name] to take part in a research study. The research collected will be one-onone interviews. Every interview will be audio recorded using the AudioMemos application on
the Student Researcher’s Apple iPad and iPhone (two separate devices are being used solely for
backup in case of error) to capture accuracy in recording the responses. The use of a recording
device is justified in this study because the details of thought and language used by the
participants are critical to data analysis.
I am responsible to transcribe the audio-tapes to ensure accurate reporting of the information
provided. You will not discuss any item on the tape with anyone other than the researcher. No
one’s name will be asked or revealed during individual interviews. The audio-tapes will be
stored in locked files before and after being transcribed. Tapes will be destroyed within 2 weeks
of completing the transcriptions.

Appendix C Interview Protocol General Audit
Part 1: Introductory Protocol
Thank you for participating in this study. You have been selected because you meet the criteria
of being a Massachusetts certified high school librarian who has transitioned a school library to
a learning commons service model. You also satisfy the criteria of being an active member of the
Massachusetts School Library Association.
This research project focuses on the experience transitioning from a traditional school library
service model to the learning commons model. This study will help identify the factors that either
promote or undermine a successful transition.
Your responses are important and I want to make sure to capture everything you say, I would
like to audio tape our conversation today. I will also be taking written notes during the
interview. Only I, and possibly a professional transcriptionist, will have access to the audio files.
If a transcriptionist is used, that person will have signed a confidentiality statement, and will
also only be provided with the recording labeled by pseudonym, meaning they will never even
know your name, to maintain confidentiality. The audio files will be destroyed within two weeks
after they are transcribed. I can assure you that all responses will be confidential and only
pseudonyms will be used when quoting from the transcripts. Only your pseudonym will be
attached to the transcript.
I would like to begin recording this session now. Are you ready? OK, the audio recording has
begun.
To meet our human subjects requirements at the university, participants have to read and
verbally agree to the Consent Form that I sent you. I’d like to go over this form with you now.
The Consent Form for this study, titled ‘Transitioning a high school library to a learning
commons model: Avoiding the tragedy of the commons’ states that all participants must be
certified to teach in the state of Massachusetts, and hold active membership in the Massachusetts
School Library Association. You are being asked to participate in two interviews focused
around your experience with the transition of your library into a learning commons. There are
no foreseeable risks or discomforts to you for taking part in this study, and there are also no
direct benefits to you for participating in the study. Your part in this study will be handled in a
confidential manner. As part of this process your school administrator was asked for permission
for me to engage in this study within your school district. Your privacy will be maintained
through the use of pseudonyms for you and your school district. Only I, as the researcher, will
know your identity. Any reports or publications based on this research will only use pseudonyms,
and will not identify you or any other participant as being part of this project. The decision to
participate in this research project is up to you. You do not have to participate and you can
refuse to answer any question. Even if you begin the study, you may withdraw at any time. You
will receive a $15 gift certificate to Amazon.com or iTunes upon completion of the two
interviews. If you have any questions about this study, contact information for me as well as the

141
Principal Investigator is listed, and contact information is also listed for the IRB Coordinator of
Human Subject Research Protection at Northeastern University should you have any other
questions about your rights in this research (and you can call that person confidentially, if you
wish).
Do you have any additional questions or concerns about the interview process or this form? Do
you give your verbal consent? Thank you.
This is the first of two interviews. We have planned for this interview to last between 60-90
minutes. We will then do a follow-up interview approximately 1 month from now, which will last
approximately 60 minutes. Today, I have a series of questions that I would like to cover. If time
begins to run short, it may be necessary to interrupt you in order to push ahead and complete
this line of questioning. Do you have any questions at this time?
Part 2: Interview Introduction
This study is designed to get a better understanding for the various factors involved in
undertaking a transition to the learning commons model. The approach to this qualitative study
will be a series of questions designed to gain insight into various aspects of the transition, and
finally to ask the participant to reflect upon the process and possibly identify factors not
previously identified.
Today’s interview will cover factors identified by the researcher as influential in the transition
process.
The second and final interview will cover your reflection on the transition process, and will
occur one month from now.
Are you ready to begin?
Part 3: Questioning
I’d like to start by asking you some questions in regards to your experience with the transition to
the learning commons service model. We will cover five domains: your professional
background, school description, the context of the learning commons, administration and
leadership, and changes made for the transition. This should take about one hour.
