ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION

Chief Librarians: The Leadership and Administration of Community College Libraries
by
Pearl Ly

Professor Jennifer Jeffries, Chair

College and university libraries are facing numerous challenges and need strong,
effective leadership to meet student needs. Higher education is in crisis and restructuring
of organizational structures is commonly utilized for cost-saving purposes. Academic
libraries are not exempt from organizational change due to limited or reduced funding.
Library budgets have been severely reduced and these cuts impact library resources and
personnel.
Community colleges are an overlooked segment of higher education and there is
a wide gap in the library and information science literature on community college library
administrative models, leadership, and librarianship practice. Using a combined multiframe leadership model and competing values framework, this study examined library

xii

administrative practices in the California Community College (CCC) system and
explored the experiences of community college library leaders, or chief librarians.
The research design of this study was a mixed-method convergent parallel study
that used quantitative and qualitative methods to answer two main research questions.
Extant data on chief librarians and content analysis of CCC library administrative job
advertisements were used to review library administrative practices. Furthermore, semistructured interviews and document analysis were utilized to examine what it means to be
a chief librarian and their leadership perspectives.
The study revealed a wide variety of administrative practices in the CCC libraries
by chief librarian titles, roles, duties, education, and external reporting. Extant data
analysis indicated that more than half of designated chief librarians have a faculty role
such as department chair or director. Traditional library manager positions, dedicated
deans and directors, have been or are being combined with other college functions such
as technology/online education and/or academic/college programs. Job ad content
analysis indicated growth in additional library administrator duties in the areas of staff
development, tutoring, distance education, and instructional technology. Furthermore, six
main themes emerged from chief librarian participant interviews: (1) supervision, (2)
collaboration, (3) shared governance, (4) lack of resources, (5) marginalization, and (6)
credentialed librarian managers.

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION
“Restructuring is a powerful but high-risk tool for organizational change.”
– Bolman and Deal (2003)
Restructuring has become commonplace in higher education often citing cost
savings and increased collaboration as the desired outcomes of the reorganization.
Academic libraries are a microcosm of the institutions they serve and are greatly
impacted by organizational change on the college level. In the last few years, there have
been many visible library reorganizations at research institutions including the libraries at
Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California, Los Angeles,
and University of California, San Diego (Goldberg, 2012; MIT Libraries, 2010; Strong,
2011; UCSD Libraries, 2012). Facing reduced collection budgets and smaller staffs when
not replacing those who retire, college and university libraries are examining their
administrative practices and organizational models.
The person “in charge” of a library can have various titles. At college and
university libraries, or academic libraries, the most commonly used terms include library
director, library dean, head librarian, or chief librarian (Born, et al., 2000). In the
California Community College (CCC) system, a chief librarian is designated at each
college as a statewide representative to the Chief Council of Librarians (CCL), a selfgoverning association that actively engages in state-wide issues that impact CCC
libraries. The primary purpose of CCL is to “…represent, promote, and advance libraries
in public California community college education and to provide a vehicle for

1

2
communication among chief librarians, other community college personnel, and state
agencies (CCL, 1993).”
Chief librarians in California have traditionally had the title of library director or
dean as evidenced by the annual CCL Deans and Directors Meeting. Gregg Atkins,
Executive Director of CCL and long-time chief librarian, provided anecdotal evidence
that during the formation of CCL in the 1980’s, chief librarians primarily held
administrative roles with the title of library dean or director (personal communication,
March 7, 2014). However, when examining the Council of Chief Librarians (CCL)
Directory (2014), it is evident that many chief librarians do not have the title of library
dean or director. Faculty librarians, often with the title of department chair or librarian,
are listed as chief librarians and participate in the annual CCL Deans and Directors
Meeting.
At a CCL Deans and Directors Meeting in March 2013, a roundtable discussion
about changing administrative practices took place (CCL, 2013). Concern about library
dean and director positions being eliminated and replaced with department chair positions
was expressed during this meeting. In October 2012, there was active email discussion on
the CCC chief librarian listserv, CCL-Libraries, about the highest ranking librarians at
each college (A. Costa, personal communication, October 22, 2012). Many library
leaders and librarians shared that their libraries had a faculty department chair in charge
of the library and raised concerns such as inadequate time for administrative duties and/or
lack of formal authority for supervision of library faculty and staff.
In libraries and many other organizations, typical administrative or management
responsibilities include the hiring and supervision of personnel, budgeting, strategic

3
planning, and setting the mission and goals for an organization. In addition to these
duties, the leader of a college library represents the library in a variety of forums on
campus, the community, in professional organizations, and on a statewide or national
level. Representation of library at a state level, such as the Council of Chief Librarians,
and taking an active role to shape community college libraries, has typically been
associated with administrative positions.
Restructuring, reorganizations, mergers of community college and other higher
education administration have become commonplace in California and nationwide (Fain,
2011; Kiley, 2011). Although many non-administrators are becoming the designated
chief librarians at the California Community Colleges, the reason for this emerging trend
is unclear. In light of these internal external factors, this study seeks to explore the
changing nature of the chief librarians, their leadership perspectives, and to analyze the
diverse administrative practices in the California Community College (CCC) system.
Statement of the Problem
The use of college and university libraries has rapidly changed with information
technology advances. Although the dependence on academic libraries for physical
information has sharply declined (Martell, 2008), the demand for learning and
collaborative spaces on college campuses is high. Moving away from the development
and maintenance of massive physical library collections, many academic libraries are
purchasing electronic content and creating comfortable and safe physical spaces to study,
work on assignments, socialize, or even pass free time (Applegate, 2009). Libraries no
longer have a monopoly on information sources as they did before the explosion of the

4
digital format; however, the library can continue to be a place or service supporting
student learning and scholarship (University Leadership Council, 2011).
The significant increase in students’ directly accessing information through the
Internet has greatly impacted the role of the academic librarian. This role has changed
largely due to the growing digital landscape, as well as the changing information seeking
behavior of students and scholars (Lynch & Smith, 2001; Rice-Lively, 1997). Despite an
abundance of electronic information, students continue to struggle with research
assignments and going “beyond Google” (Gilchrist, 2007; Raufman et al., 1990).
Academic librarians are in demand to teach information literacy skills 1, actively
collaborating with disciplinary faculty to guide students through the research process
(Gilchrist, 2007; Mundell et al., 2003). In addition to the newer role as teachers,
academic librarians still act as information brokers and curators but in a different
capacity: purchasing access to more and more electronic content that is not freely
available on the World Wide Web.
Academic libraries are actively engaged in re-defining their purpose and services
in the context of digitization, budget cuts, on-demand expectations of library users, and
uncertainty (Anderson, 2011; Bennett, 2007; Drake, 2000; Sannwald, 2007). The role and
responsibilities of the traditional academic library is being challenged in today’s dynamic
higher education environment. In order to address the changing needs and expectations of
library users, academic libraries must re-evaluate the physical spaces, collections,

1

Information literacy is defined as the ability to “recognize when information is needed and have the
ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information (American Library Association,
1989).”

5
organizational practices, and leadership (Applegate, 2009; Forest & Hinchliffe, 2005;
Ross & Sennyey, 2008).
Although much library and information science literature focuses on the decline
of college and university libraries with decreasing use of physical collections and
reference transactions (Ferguson, 2000; Ferguson & Bunge, 1997; Martell, 2008), there is
a growing body of literature on innovation and leadership to address the challenges
within the academic libraries field (Arnold et al., 2008; DeLong, 2009; Hernon, 2011;
Quinn, 2008). Academic library restructuring and administrative practices are topics that
need further examination during a time of continued technological advancements,
changing library user expectations, and uncertain economic conditions.
Community colleges are an overlooked segment of higher education and there is a
wide gap in the library and information science literature on community college library
administration, leadership, and librarianship practice. Literature on library leadership and
administrative practices are available for four-year university libraries, especially those
with Association of Research Libraries (ARL) affiliation. However, there is very little
written on the community colleges that serve a majority of the total number of students in
higher education (Goldrick-Rab, 2010; Reed, 2011; Townsend, 2009).
Libraries at community colleges are integral to student learning by providing
research help, teaching information literacy skills, providing study and social space, and
often computing hardware and support (Gilchrist, 2007). Although all of higher education
is currently facing budget cuts, community colleges serve the most diverse population of
underrepresented students (low income, ethnicity, age, first-generation, veterans, etc.).
Community college provides access to non-traditional students that may not otherwise

6
achieve their educational goals. Community college libraries support student learning
through its collections, staff, facilities, and equipment.
Academic librarians and library administrators need research on effective college
and university libraries in order to re-envision their services and practices to increase
student learning and achieve campus goals. Community colleges serve a large segment of
adult learners in the United States and support a large percentage of underrepresented
students. Library services, staff roles, and physical library buildings are rapidly changing
within the largest community college system, the California Community Colleges (CCC),
and nationwide. Characteristics and factors leading to successful libraries, such as library
administrative practices, need to be identified and described in order to inform
practitioners, library administrators, and college/university administrators.
Purpose of the Study
This research aimed to explore the different library administrative practices within
the California Community Colleges and understand the experiences of the chief librarians
within the statewide system. Administrative practices, which include hiring, supervision,
and evaluation of staff, can greatly impact day-to-day functioning of libraries, as well as
future planning for organizations. Higher education restructuring is common and impacts
the leadership and functioning of academic libraries.
As a new CCC library administrator and chief librarian, I am curious about the
variety of administrative practices statewide that currently exist and how these practices
impact the ability of libraries to meet their mission and goals. There is a great deal of
interest amongst community college libraries about recent changes in administrative
practices, especially with administrative positions, such as library director or dean, being

7
eliminated or drastically changed with the addition of more responsibilities and/or duties
(e.g. academic programs, student services programs, etc.). A growing number of faculty
department chairs are being designated as chief librarians in California (CCL Directory,
2014). It is important to consider whether the role of a chief librarian, or library leader,
helps or hinders a library and to examine the challenges facing current chief librarians.
Research Questions
This study addresses the following research questions:
1) What are the administrative practices in the California Community College (CCC)
libraries?
2) What does it mean to be a chief librarian in a CCC library?
A better understanding of the experiences and leadership perspectives of CCC
chief librarians may impact the restructuring decisions that are widespread in higher
education. Community colleges serve a majority of students in higher education and the
most diverse segment of the student population in higher education settings. Community
college libraries are crucial for student success: supporting student learning with
information literacy instruction, print and electronic collections, facilities, equipment, and
other library services (Cohen & Brawster, 2003; Gilchrist, 2007).
The Community College System as the Research Context
Community colleges, which mainly rely on state and local funding, serve a large
percentage of post-secondary students in the United States, many of which are minority
and low-income students. Community colleges struggle to increase student retention and
transfer rates nationwide for a very diverse population of students at various levels of

8
preparedness. In addition to funding instability and decreased resources, community
colleges also face relentless technological and instructional change.
The California Community College System has 72 districts and 112 community
colleges that serve over 2.9 million students, or approximately 63% of higher education
students in the state (Lorenzo, 2011). CCC students have diverse education goals
including Associate’s degrees, university transfer, vocational certificates, and personal
growth (California Community College Chancellor’s Office, 2013).
Community college libraries 2, including those in the California Community
College system, are a microcosm of the institutions they serve and are greatly impacted
by organizational change on the college level. The community college library has been
recognized for its importance to student learning process (Cohen & Brawer, 2003).
Community college libraries must be prepared to serve a wide range of programs
including college transfer, career and technical education, workforce development and
community education despite ongoing financial issues in a dynamic environment.
Arnold (2010) and Fradkin (2003) observed that it is challenging to provide the
library resources and services that are needed to very diverse student populations that
pursue various goals with traditionally high librarian 3 to student ratios. Restructuring of
community college library administration may impact a library’s ability to support
student learning. Very little research exists on community college library administration,
leadership, and organizational change.

2

Community college libraries are called many different names including library/media center, learning
resource center, educational resources, and others.
3
Community college librarians are typically classified as faculty. Throughout this study, they will be
referred to as librarians. The term faculty will refer to non-library faculty.

9
Conceptual Frameworks
The administration of community college libraries varies widely, even within the
state of California. This study utilized a combined organizational change and competing
values frameworks to examine the library administrative practices in this large, higher
education system. These conceptual frameworks were chosen for this study because they
provide a well-rounded lens for assessing leadership orientations and organizational
culture from multiple perspectives.
Organizational Change Framework. A multi-lens conceptual framework
offered by Bolman and Deal (2003) includes four organizational frames: structural,
human resources, political, and symbolic. The structural frame relies on policies, mission
and visions, and organizational practices for leadership. The human resources frame
focuses on employees as the core of an organization and relationships are used to
approach issues. The political frame centers on power dynamics, strategic planning, and
coalitions when resources are limited. The symbolic frame focuses on rituals, traditions,
ceremonies, and storytelling to inspire members of organizations.
Competing Values Framework. Cameron and Quinn (2011) developed a
Competing Values Framework (CVF) that assesses type of organizational cultures
focusing on four variables including: (1) flexibility and discretion (clan culture), (2)
stability and control (hierarchy culture), (3) internal focus and integration (market
culture), and (4) external focus and differentiation (adhocracy culture). The competing
values framework helps managers carefully analyze their organizational cultures and to
develop strategies to change.

10
The Organizational Change Framework and the Competing Values Framework
will be discussed at length in the literature review. These conceptual frameworks provide
a relevant structure in which to examine the experiences and leadership perspectives of
chief librarians. With these frameworks, current administrative practices that exist in the
California Community College libraries were analyzed.
Research Methodology
Since community college library administration has not been well studied, mixed
methods design was used “to explain initial results or because one data source may be
insufficient” (Creswell 2008, p.556) in answering the research question in this study. The
research design of this study used different methods to answer two main research
questions. The research questions in this study focused on exploring the administrative
practices in community college libraries and the experiences of chief librarians. The
study explored one unique unit of analysis, the chief librarians within the California
Community College system.
The general design and rationale for a mixed-method convergent parallel study
will be presented in the following section. The design of the study will elaborate on
context/background, extant data collection as well as participants and recruitment for the
qualitative portion of my study. In addition, data analysis techniques are discussed.
Methodological approach. In this study, a mixed-methods convergent parallel
design were utilized as outlined by Creswell and Plano Clark (2010) to collect and
analyze data. In convergent parallel design, the researcher conducts quantitative and
qualitative research strands at the same time, keeps the strands independent during

11
analysis, and then mixes results during the overall interpretation (Creswell and Plano
Clark, 2010). A triangulation design was also employed to verify data and to determine
whether the results support or contradict each other (Creswell, 2005).
In this study, the quantitative strand presented in Chapter III relied on extant
demographic data on the California Community College (CCC) chief librarians (n = 112)
and content analysis of job advertisements in the CCC libraries (n = 17). The qualitative
strand presented in Chapter IV used interview data from a sample of the CCC chief
librarians (four of the total 112). Convergent parallel design is useful for confirming
results with one type of data with those of another or to develop a multi-faceted
complementary picture of a phenomenon (Stentz et al., 2012). This study sought to
understand both the community college library administrative practices and experiences
of chief librarians in the California Community College (CCC).
Chief librarians and community college library administrative practices in the
CCC system were explored with (1) extant data on chief librarians, (2) semi-structured
interviews with four chief librarians in libraries with different administrative practices,
and (3) organizational documents including job advertisements and organizational charts.
Tools, recruitment, and selection will be discussed at length in the Methods section.
Because there is very little research in community college library leadership, exploratory,
yet in-depth types of methods are needed.
Significance of the Study
In California, the composition of community college library leaders designated as
chief librarians is changing. Although faculty librarians are essential members of a library
organization, they often lack formal authority by design and support for administrative

12
duties when in the role of department chair. For example, a faculty department chair may
not have the ability to take disciplinary action involving another faculty member as
outlined in the faculty union contract. As chief librarians represent, promote, and advance
community college libraries, strong leadership is needed in each college and across the
state. Furthermore, there is a dearth of literature on community college library leadership
and administrative practices.
Restructuring in academic libraries is a topic that needs further examination
during a time of continued technological advancements, changing library user
expectations, and uncertain economic conditions. Organizational change in libraries can
be very challenging, requiring effective leadership, dedicated time and resources, and
collaboration among all levels of the library. Many academic libraries are changing their
organizational structure to better meet the needs of their patrons, leverage emerging
technologies, and improve their efficiency.
Reviewing the literature on academic library restructuring can help develop best
practices as well as address common pitfalls to anticipate or avoid when organizational
change is needed. Academic libraries no longer have the intrinsic value that was afforded
in the past when information resources were not readily available through electronic
databases and the open web. Libraries that maintain a traditional academic library
structure without analyzing the current environment and 21st century user expectations
may become irrelevant to students, faculty, and administrators. This demands serious
analysis of the current state of the chief librarian role in community college
environments.

13
Positionality
It is important for researchers to acknowledge any bias they may bring to their
study. I am passionate about academic libraries and student success in two-year
institutions. I have a library background with a Master’s in Library Science (MLS) and
have served as a faculty librarian. I have worked at community college libraries with
different administrative structures, serving as chief librarian at two of them. I am a
dedicated library administrator and this could impact my interpretation of information. I
also recently participated in a year-long mentorship program in which I observed and
reflected with a non-MLS chief librarian to develop my administrative skills and
knowledge.
My position brings context knowledge which can be a strength in understanding
the context in which chief librarians do their work. However, my lens could have
impacted my ability to see beyond my own experience. In order to maintain my
objectivity, I frequently thought about the research questions posed and talked with many
chief librarians about this topic. I worked to be conscious of my biases while conducting
my research, being open to new information and noting any information with which I
disagreed. Furthermore, I employed the strategy of member checks in order to
corroborate my findings.
Definition of Key Terms
Administrator An individual employed in a supervisory or management position.
Education Code §87002 and Title 5 §53402. Administrators are not part of faculty
bargaining unit and may be employed in an academic position or a non-academic
position (Academic Senate for California Community Colleges, 2004).
Chief Librarian. The administrator or professional employee in charge of a library or a
library system for a community college. The chief librarian may have numerous titles

14
including director, dean, head librarian, coordinator, or department chair (Born et al.,
2000). In the California Community Colleges, there is a designated chief librarian at each
college.
Department/Division Chair. Also known as department/division head or academic chair.
An individual “who carries out certain organizing functions for a department, most
commonly a faculty member (Academic Senate for California Community Colleges,
2004).
Faculty. Instructional, classroom, or disciplinary faculty.
Information literacy. The ability of a library user to “recognize when information is
needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed
information (American Library Association, 1989).”
Librarian. Although many community college librarians are classified as
faculty, this study uses the term librarian in order to differentiate between library
faculty and instructional, classroom, or disciplinary faculty.
Library. Community colleges sometimes refer to their libraries as
learning resource centers (LRCs) which tend to encompass a library, a learning
assistance center, audio and video learning laboratories, and a center for the distribution
of audiovisual (Cohen & Brawster, 2003). This study uses the term library synonymously
with LRC, library/media center, instructional resource center, learning commons, and
information commons.
Library dean/director. Most urban community colleges use the title, dean or director, to
designate the administrator in charge of a library, several campus libraries, or supervision
of other campus activities (Born, et al., 2000)
Library staff. It is not uncommon for those outside of the library
community to refer to everyone working in a library as a librarian. For the
purpose of this study, library staff or classified staff refers to all library employees except
library managers and librarians (as defined above). This represents a broad group of job
classifications and includes employees with diverse educational backgrounds.
Organization of the Proposal
Chapter I provided an overview of the current fluid state of library administration
in the California Community College (CCC) libraries and the rationale for this research
study. Chapter II will include a literature review on academic library change, community

15
colleges, administrative practices, and conceptual frameworks guiding this study. Chapter
III will discuss the quantitative portion of the mixed methods study focusing on
administrative practices in the CCC libraries. Chapter IV will discuss the qualitative
portion of the study, describing the experiences of chief librarians and their leadership
perspectives. Chapter V will integrate results from the quantitative and qualitative phases
of the study to shed light on the two research questions and discuss implications for
leadership in the CCC libraries.

CHAPTER II: LITERATURE REVIEW
There is a great deal of literature on the organizational changes, leadership, and
practice in academic libraries in response to technological changes and evolving student
needs in the last few decades (Drake, 2000; Poole & Denny, 2001; Warnken, 2004).
Numerous library case studies document the internal and external forces that have
spurred organizational development or restructuring of academic libraries (Boykin &
Babel, 1993; Rankin, 2000; Stoffle & Cullier, 2011; Strong, 2010). However, there are
few empirical studies on community college libraries in general and a specific lack of
literature on community college library management and leadership.
This literature review will address the changing role of academic libraries,
academic library restructuring trends, and California Community College libraries.
Furthermore, the Organizational Change Framework and Competing Values Framework
will be examined as they relate to these topics. As there is little research on community
college libraries, organizational change approaches utilized by research libraries and
common restructuring trends in four-year university libraries will be examined.
Changing Role of Academic Libraries
The metaphor that the “the library is the heart of a university” is attributed to
Charles Eliot, President of Harvard University from 1869-1926 (Grimes, 1998, p.4). The
heart metaphor invokes the central role that the academic library played in creation of
knowledge and scholarship in higher education. Before the proliferation of the World
Wide Web, students and scholars relied solely on physical library collections and a

16

17
librarian to help them find information. Many of today’s library services, such as
reference and access to journals, are available remotely without visiting the physical
library. It is not uncommon to hear that libraries are no longer relevant and there is a
serious crisis in librarianship. However, the roles of the academic library and the
academic librarian are not necessarily obsolete, but instead are rapidly changing with a
dynamic information landscape and different expectations from students and faculty
(Stoffle & Cullier, 2010).
Since the inception of American academic libraries in the late 1800’s, technology
has been a catalyst for change in libraries, especially with the introduction of computers,
telecommunications. and increased library automation (Warnken, 2004). These recent
innovations have transformed academic libraries from being a repository or warehouse of
print materials to an access provider to an increasing amount of digital content. Library
automation has simplified or changed many library processes such as moving the print
catalog to an electronic catalog and electronic delivery of interlibrary loan items.
Centralization of library technical services such as purchasing books “shelf-ready,” precataloged and processed, allow books to go from a loading dock directly onto a library
shelf and reduce the need for in-house cataloging and processing. In addition to internal
library changes, library public services have also been transformed with current
technology.
Library users that once needed to work with a librarian to access information
resources in the physical library building can now access scholarly works and other
library materials from school offices or home at any time regardless of library hours.
Students and faculty can get synchronous online research help through virtual reference,

18
instant messaging, or video chatting with librarians. To keep up with technological
developments and changing library users, the role of academic librarians is also very
different than in the past. Rice-Lively (1997) found that librarian functions were evolving
from “keeper of books” to “network navigator” and that new information professionals
needed to be flexible and tolerant to ambiguity. Many traditional functions of academic
librarians, such as providing reference service and access to information, are still utilized
by students and faculty. However, with the shift to a digital medium, this work may not
be as visible to library users and campus administrators.
Academic librarians still act as information brokers and curators, purchasing
access to more and more electronic content that is not freely available on the World Wide
Web. However, traditional librarian roles such as circulation, cataloging, acquisitions,
and reference have changed dramatically with the technological innovations in the last
few decades. In a job advertisement review, Lynch and Smith (2001) found that the
expectations for academic librarians included technology skills and teaching skills, in
addition to an American Library Association (ALA) accredited Master’s degree in
Library Science. More academic librarians are working directly with users through
reference or library instruction services and utilize emerging technologies such as web
editing, instant messaging, and designing digital learning materials for students.
Many colleges and universities value the role their academic libraries play in
supporting student success and have invested further into infrastructure, collections, and
staff. However, the perception of libraries as warehouses for print repositories persists
and many scholars and students do not recognize the role of the library in negotiating and
providing access to journal and other periodical literature electronically (OCLC, 2010).

19
The amount of open-access, or freely accessible through the web, literature is growing
with federal grant open-access requirements and the creation of institutional repositories,
digital collections of a campuses’ scholarly output often maintained by the library.
However, there remains a large amount of scholarly literature that is not freely available
through the open web. Simply put, Google or other search engines will not fulfill all
information needs. Library users often do not realize the library has paid subscription fees
that allow them access to literature that is also selected and maintained by library subject
specialists.
Utilizing the Oxford English Dictionary definition of library 4, Sennyey, Ross, and
Mills (2009) argue that the role of the academic library is now defined in three distinct
ways: library as place, library as collections, and library staff. The physical library
building, the print and electronic collections, and the library staff are intertwined.
Although the majority of new library acquisitions are electronic, there would be no
collection without staff and a physical building to house the staff. Each of these concepts
and how they have changed will be discussed in the following section.
Library as place. Many academic libraries have responded to user needs and
habits by remodeling their physical spaces to feature more study areas, private study
rooms, and even cafes or coffee bars. Food and drink policies, often touted to protect
library collections and buildings, are increasingly disappearing from libraries nationwide
in favor of creating welcoming and “home-like” study space (Foster, 2008). Many
libraries are studying how students use its spaces for study and have increased the

4

Sennyey et al. (2009) define a library as 1. A place set apart to contain books for reading, study, or
reference. 2. The books contained in a ‘library’ a great mass of learning or knowledge 3. A scribe.

20
availability of electrical outlets, carrels, and laptops for checkout (Applegate, 2009).
Moving away from a building with massive library collections, academic libraries are
creating comfortable and safe physical spaces to study, work on assignments, socialize,
or even pass free time.
There is a great deal of literature on the design and renovation of academic
libraries that have often been dubbed “information commons,” “knowledge commons,”
or “learning hubs (Forrest & Hinchcliffe, 2005; Held, 2009).” These new library interiors
are often designed with many flexible learning spaces that can be reconfigured, many
electrical outlets, and undergo usability testing. Information commons often include a
computer center, group study rooms, presentation rooms, and tutoring areas.
Many community college libraries have utilized a similar “one-stop shop” model
supporting student academics since the 1980’s. Many of these community college
libraries were named “Learning Resource Centers (LRCs)” or maintained the traditional
“library” name (Cohen & Brawster, 2003; Person, 1985). Although some community
college libraries remained intact, most community college libraries underwent a major
transformation when they became LRCs with facilities added for tutoring and other
learning assistance services. Many totally new LRCs were built to encompass a library, a
learning assistance center, audiovisual learning laboratories, and a center for the
distribution of audiovisual materials (Cohen & Brawster, 2003).
Library as collections. As previously discussed, library collections have
dramatically shifted in format with the introduction of technology such as computer
networking and digitization. Prior to the proliferation of personal computers, print and
microfilm collections of periodicals (newspapers, magazines, and journals) comprised a

21
large majority of academic libraries holdings. Today, libraries are spending a higher
proportion of their collection budgets on electronic materials such as full-text periodical
databases and indexes and even electronic books, or e-books. Print and microfilm
periodical titles in many libraries have been discontinued and in renovations, these
sections have dramatically shrunk in size which has allowed for the reconfiguration of
library space as discussed in the prior section.
At the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the library collection
shifted in 2004 from primarily print to digital in format (Higa et al., 2005). This shift in
library material formats greatly affected individual library staff and department
workloads, leading to a library reorganization effort. Networked electronic resources
through library databases and the Internet have dramatically decreased the use and
availability of print sources although library gate counts, measuring the total number of
patrons entering the physical library, are increasing in many libraries. A study of
academic library use from 1995 to 2006 indicated declines in the circulation of print
materials and high usage of library electronic materials (Martell, 2008). Information
seeking behavior indicates clear user preferences for electronic information over print.
However, information literacy instruction and reference remain core library services to
help students and faculty find and access the information they need.
Library staff. With dramatic changes to library spaces and collections, it is not
surprising that the role of library staff has also evolved. Traditionally, library
organizations have been divided into technical services: acquisitions (purchasing) and
cataloging (processing); and public services: circulation (lending and borrowing),
reference (one-on-one research assistance), and instruction (information literacy skills in

22
class setting). With computer networking and less of a focus on print collections, most
academic libraries have shifted their emphasis to high-quality service in reference and
instruction (Ferguson & Bunge, 1997). Lynch and Smith’s 2001 analysis of librarian job
advertisements supports this service shift with an increase in reference and instruction
librarian positions, also known as subject specialist librarians, over technical services
positions.
In a survey of expectations, realities, and perceptions of subject specialist
librarian duties, McAbee and Graham (2005) found that they are expected to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Provide reference assistance to patrons
Provide classroom and individual instruction in the location, use, and
evaluation of information
Act as a liaison with academic departments
Manage collection development
Serve on library and university committees
Attend appropriate conferences and training sessions in area of specialization.
(p.21)

Subject liaison librarians perceived that their most valuable activity was reference service
followed by library instruction; the lowest ranked tasks were serving on committees,
supervising and training support staff, and publication/scholarly activity. With a greater
emphasis on public service in academic libraries, current librarians may be changing
roles in internal restructuring.
Dramatic changes to the physical spaces, collections, and staff have been
occurring in academic libraries nationwide. In order to manage and implement change,
many libraries are utilizing organizational change frameworks and theories. When
shifting from an emphasis on print collections to providing more home-like study space,
the mission of libraries is also shifting. With a de-emphasis on technical services and a

23
greater focus on public service, professional development and culture change is necessary
among librarians. Organizational change frameworks can provide a blueprint for library
leaders and higher education administrators in setting up, introducing, and assessing
change efforts in academic libraries.
Academic Library Restructuring Trends
Largely spurred by technological advances and decreased budgets, much
restructuring of college and university library organizations has taken place since the
1980’s. Common trends are library mergers with information technology (IT)
departments and internal restructuring including work teams and matrix management.
Many examples of library restructuring in research libraries and other four-year
universities are readily available (Goldberg, 2012; MIT Libraries, 2010; Strong 2010;
UCSD Libraries, 2012). However, there are few empirical studies on reorganizations
within community colleges in the library and information science literature.
Library and Information Technology (IT) mergers. In the last two decades,
many higher education institutions have integrated their library and IT organizations and
there is renewed interest with the current economic crisis. A recent article in Inside
Higher Ed, reports that Southwestern University will be combining the library and IT
office into one administrative unit, citing $250,000 in savings and better serving students
and faculty (Kiley, 2011). Merging libraries with IT is a polarizing issue that provokes
“…both enmity and enthusiasm, determination and distrust (Oden et al., 2001, p.24).”
Much has been written on library and IT mergers including rationales, implementation,
and impact on the organizations and users. There is anecdotal evidence for community

24
colleges in California following this trend of library/IT mergers. Although there may be
many institutions considering Library/IT mergers, this model is currently rare among
academic libraries overall.
A study of the degree of library and computer centers mergers at American land
grant universities (n = 50) was conducted by Bolin (2005). Land grant universities are
federally designated as agricultural and technical arts institutions and they are distributed
across the nation. Survey results on the organizational structure of libraries indicate that
88% (n = 44) of the institutions have the traditional library organization pattern with
separate library and computer centers (p. 8). Of the non-traditional patterns, four libraries
had a professional librarian responsible for both the library and computer center. In two
libraries, a non-librarian was in charge of the library and computer center. The study by
Bolin supports that the library/IT mergers are uncommon amongst academic libraries
however, only a specific cross-chapter of libraries was examined and the study could be
expanded and repeated for current trends.
There are various reasons that colleges and universities have merged their library
and IT organizations. Ferguson, Spencer, and Metz (2004) argue that benefits include:
“ …reducing the number of service entry points, sustaining currency in
design and delivery of new services, avoiding some costs and achieving
greater fiscal efficiency, and creating opportunities for individuals and the
new organization to more creatively meet the needs of a rapidly changing
intuition (p.40).”
With student and faculty dependence on computer networking to access information
resources, they may be confused by the role of IT for technology help and the role of the
library in getting research help. Combining the library and IT may also lead to cost
savings with fewer administrators and staff in the new merged organization. However,

25
Ferguson (2004) et al. found that merging primarily to reduce operating costs will lead to
a decrease in service quality and staff morale. Furthermore, Cain (2003) argues that
significant cultural differences exist between technologists and librarians including
customer service approaches, instructional support roles, and credentials required. For
instance, librarians must have at least a Master’s degree in library science whereas there
is no such degree requirement in the world of IT. As with any dramatic organizational
change, culture and communication for changes are necessary for a successful library/IT
merger.
In a case study from the Washtenaw Community College (WCC) in Michigan, the
partnership between the learning resource center (LRC/Library) and IT is discussed
(Blain, 2000). After much dissatisfaction with information systems or service planning at
WCC, the learning resource center and information technology collaborated to create a
new organizational structure. In this structure, IT and LRC/Library retained individual
functions but added new “tech teams” with members from both groups and planning
councils for technology support across campus. The WCC LRC/Library and IT
collaboration was deemed as successful for WCC as evidenced by high-quality services
and user satisfaction. However, the new model was not a true merger since IT and the
LRC/library remained disparate in administration. In addition, cost savings where not
realized as the partnership required much time, new staff, and outside consulting.
Examples of full integration between libraries and IT are available for various
four-year institutions. A case study by Oden et al. (2001) documents one of the earlier
library/IT mergers at Kenyon College in the mid 1990’s. Initialized by the college
president, a new Library and Information Services organization was created. The budget

26
for both groups was integrated into one and it was considered an administrative benefit to
have less campus infighting between the two groups for resources (Oden et al., 2001). In
contrast to the WCC library/IT case study, Kenyon College completely merged the two
organizations under a new Vice President position but the overall staff numbers remained
the same.
In 2004, Dickinson College merged its library and IT department under the
leadership of a new administrative position, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and
faced many challenges with leadership, organizational structure, and culture clashes
(Renaud, 2006). The roles of the librarians and technologists continue to evolve within
their organization. Although library/IT mergers may not be common practice, it is clear
that they are attractive to campus administrators because of long-term salary savings and
overlap in function. However, Library/IT mergers are difficult to implement successfully
and may require a heavy commitment of resources during initial implementation.
Internal library restructuring. Although not as controversial as library/IT
mergers, other restructuring efforts have occurred internally within many academic
libraries. Traditional academic library organizations are led by library director/dean with
a Master’s in Library Science and consist of hierarchical departments that operate
relatively independently. In response to technological advances and the changing nature
of libraries, many college and university libraries have tried to transform their
hierarchical and compartmentalized organizations into flexible and flat organizations that
can adapt to new challenges. Work teams, matrix management, shared leadership models
will be discussed in the following section.
Work teams. Utilizing organizational development (OD) concepts, many

27
academic libraries have implemented teamwork and team management to address budget
cuts, staffing shortages, and rapid growth of technology. Team-based practices can foster
collaborative decision-making and problem solving across all levels of an organization.
As previously discussed in the learning organization and systems thinking section, the
University of Arizona Libraries converted their entire organization into teams in the mid1990. Other case studies of team work are from Purdue Libraries (Fosmire, 2008) and the
University of Maryland Libraries (Baughman, 2008).
Although teams may allow for wider input on library services and new projects,
many competencies for teams must be developed such as effective and efficient
communication, consensus building, and effective participation and collaboration
(Fosmire, 2008). Creating teams and establishing a culture of teamwork is challenging
and requires dedication of resources and time. Baughman (2008) argues that assessment
of team work is necessary to optimize the likelihood of success and utilized the
Individual-Team-Organization (ITO) survey to measure library staff perceptions in a
teamwork structure.
Matrix management. The matrix framework that utilizes project management and
task forces is commonly seen in the corporate sector, especially in the technology field.
In this flexible organizational structure, a project group may be comprised from different
functional units and led by a project manager. In traditional library practices, functional
units are comprised of permanent members. In matrix management, project group
members are flexible and may be shifted between projects; project managers have
authority and responsibility for project completion (Johnson, 1990).

28
Bloss and Lanier (1997) discuss matrix management implementation the
University of Illinois Chicago after the elimination of two associate university librarian
positions and more responsibilities were assigned to library department heads. This
“flatter” organization was successful because it increased innovation and problem solving
however utilizing team responsibility required a “high tolerance for ambiguity and
change (p. 507).” Because matrix management is very different from traditional library
models, culture change and staff buy-in is crucial. Despite many academic library
transitions to less hierarchical organizations, matrix management has not spread widely
and more permanent work teams are much more prevalent.
Community College
The majority of post-secondary students in the United States now attend
community colleges, also known as junior or technical colleges. California Community
Colleges serve over 2.9 million students, which makes up approximately 63% of higher
education students in the state (Lorenzo, 2011). These two-year institutions were created
as add-on colleges to high school or university in the early 1900’s to increase access to
higher education (Bock, 1985). The number of community colleges in the United States
rapidly grew from 1960-1980 with the creation of 662 new colleges (Cohen & Brawer,
2003). Reed (2011) notes that community college libraries were often created after the
establishment of a college often in response to pressure from accreditation feedback.
Community college libraries. Libraries, or learning resource centers (libraries
combined with tutoring centers or other student support services), exist at each campus to
support student learning and the curriculum on each campus. Community college

29
libraries evolved from small repositories in the early 1900’s to comprehensive learning
resource centers by the 1980’s (Bock, 1984). With a rapid expansion of community
colleges after World War II, library organizations became larger and much more
complex. By the mid-70’s Dale (1977) reported that the “person in charge” of most
community college libraries was a library administrator with the title of dean or director.
Traditional library administrative practices have consisted of a full-time library
administrator with the title of Library Director or Library Dean and the library is a
separate college or unit, reporting to a Vice-President (Born, et al., 2000). A newer
administrative model for community college libraries is to not have a full-time library
administrator and with library staff reporting to a non-Library Dean or the library as a
department within a college with a faculty librarian and rotating department chairs (CCL
Directory, 2014).
With large budget cuts throughout the state of California, many college
administrators are utilizing restructuring to cut and combine administrative positions,
including library directors/deans, as a way to lower operational costs. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that many libraries have lost their full-time, dedicated library administrator
positions and many chief librarians are now faculty department chairs or other librarians.
Other chief librarians may be a full-time library administrator that also oversees other
divisions or departments (including Distance Education, Behavioral Sciences, Social
Sciences, etc.) and/or an administrator without the terminal degree for librarians, a
Master’s in Library Science (MLS) from an American Library Association (ALA)
accredited program.

30
Community college library standards. Standards of practice have developed
specifically for community colleges through the state of California Educational Code
(Title V), the statewide Academic Senate, and accreditation. The regional accrediting
body for the California Community Colleges is the Accrediting Commission for
Community and Junior Colleges, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACCJC
– WASC). These standards and regulations provide benchmarks for library practices and
evaluation. There are standards from the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL), a chapter of the American Library Association, for libraries in higher education
(ACRL, 2011). However, these are not specific to community colleges and do not address
administrative structures.
Standards of Practice for California Community College Library Faculty and
Programs were developed and adopted by the Academic Senate (AS) for California
Community Colleges in 2010. These standards address the role of library faculty and
provide guidelines for library resources, facilities, instruction, and other library services.
In addition, recommendations for the organization and administration of library
community colleges are recommended. The AS argues that the organization and
administration of the library has significant impact on its effectiveness and provides
specific standards (p. 11):
•

Administrator role: The library should be under the leadership of an instructional
administrative director or dean who is responsible for the daily operations of the
library.

•

Required education: The administrator should possess the minimum
qualifications of the library discipline in addition to having experience and
training in management or leadership.

31

Despite all of the existing regulations, standards, and guidelines, administrative practices
for community college libraries vary widely and need further study.
Organization of community college libraries. Crumpton and Bird (2013) argue
that organization structures and reporting role within college can be important to the
overall success of a library. The typical organizational structures of libraries are focused
on three areas: academic programs (instruction or academic affairs), information
technology (IT), or student services.
•

Academic programs – library mission is tied closely to the mission and goals of
college academic divisions and student learning

•

IT – supervision of campus computer labs, electronic resources, and information
delivery

•

Student services – includes library in the array of services offered to students
(counseling, financial aid, etc.)
A nationwide study was conducted by Born, Clayton, and Balash (2000) on the

organization of community college libraries (n = 268). Relevant findings included:
•

Surveyed libraries were organized very differently and this reflected in
organizational charts.

•

60% of the community college libraries had a change in organizational
structure in the previous 5 years.

•

Reporting structures for respondents varied widely and there were 37 titles of
administrators the library reports to.

•

Libraries offered a variety of services including AV/Media, library
instruction, computer classes, credit courses, distance learning, public
computers, web development, instructional technology, staff development,
and more.

32
The Born et al. (2000) study highlights the complexity of community colleges across the
United States and offers insight on the organizational practices, external reporting, and
library services offered.
Reed (2011) conducted a multi-case study of library deans and directors at large
comprehensive community colleges and their advocacy for instructional and
technological innovation. In her interviews with six library deans and directors, the
organizational practices included:
•

Multi-campus district/ multiple libraries / one director

•

Multi-campus district / multiple libraries / one director per library

•

One campus / one library / one director
Diablo Valley College (DVC), a large, comprehensive community college in

California, conducted a study of administrative practices in CCC libraries to inform the
development of a chief librarian job opening at the college (Diablo Valley College,
2013). The survey was shared on the CCC chief librarians listserv (CCL-Libraries) to
library administrators and department chairs (n = 34 unique institutions or 30% response
rate). In addition to demographic data, the survey instrument asked respondents to
evaluate their current administrative structure and asked individuals what they would
change about their position or library managerial/administrative structure.
The most common titles for chief librarians were department chair/division chair
or chairperson (faculty role); library/LRC director (faculty or administrative role); Dean
of Library and/or Learning Resources. Deans that have non-library assignments were
reflected in titles (e.g. Dean of Library and Educational Technologies) or the term
“library” was not in their title (e.g. Dean, Liberal Studies and Language Arts).

33
•

82% of respondents thought that their current library administrative structure was
effective (13 strongly agree, 15 agree)

•

74% of respondents thought that they can effectively advocate for their division or
department (13 strongly agree, 12 agree)

•

62% of respondents disagreed that they have enough time to devote to
management of the library (16 disagree, 5 strongly disagree)

The results from this study will be further discussed in Chapter V.
Conceptual Frameworks
With rapid technological change and shrinking library budgets, many academic
library managers are applying organizational change approaches to reshape their libraries.
Commonly utilized organizational theory in the academic library literature includes the
competing values framework and organizational change framework.
Competing Values Framework. Many frameworks exist to assess organizational
culture and effectiveness. Cameron and Quinn (2011) developed a multi-dimensional
model called the Competing Values Framework with four distinct culture types and
action verbs: clan (collaborate), adhocracy (create), hierarchy (control), and market
(compete). As illustrated in Figure 1, these culture types can be applied to the process of
organizational change and take into account flexibility and focus of an organization.

34

Figure 1. The Competing Values Framework. Adapted from Diagnosing and Changing
Organizational Culture. Cameron & Quinn (2011), p. 39.

The University of Saskatchewan Library applied CVF to assess their types of
organizational cultures and determine change strategies (Shepstone & Currie, 2008). At
the Ohio State University Libraries, Schlosser (2011) utilized CVF to identify culture
change targets including: a “culture of no” that stifles innovation, sheer size of an
organization, and elements of distrust or resentment between library faculty and library
staff (p. 156-157). The use of this framework in prior library research indicates its
appropriateness for use in studies, such as this, where changes associated with
organizational structure and leadership roles are being explored.

35
Organizational change framework. An organizational change conceptual
framework is offered by Bolman and Deal (2003) that includes four frames: structural,
human resources, political, and symbolic (Table 1). The structural frame relies on polices,
mission and visions, and organizational practices for leadership. The human resources
frame focus on employees as the core of an organization and relationships are used to
approach issues. The political frame focuses on power dynamics, strategic planning, and
coalitions when resources are limited. The symbolic frame focuses on rituals, traditions,
ceremonies, and storytelling to inspire members of organizations.
In Hernon’s 2011 study on library directors that recently accepted a directorship,
Bolman and Deal’s four frames were used in semi-structured interview questions for
participants to analyze their new organizations. Interviewees were asked which of the
four-frame leadership styles (structural, human resource, political, and symbolic frames)
they thought their organization and their institution needed. This study reveals the use of
Bolman and Deal's framework to be an effective tool in exploring the perspectives of
library administrators.
Bolman and Deal’s organizational change conceptual framework, combined with
Cameron and Quinn’s competing values model were utilized in this study of chief
librarians to analyze organizational insights. With similarities between the two
frameworks, a combined conceptual framework was developed as a lens for this study
and is depicted in Figure 2. There are few studies on the administration of community
college libraries in library and leadership literature and the proposed research sheds light
on the leaders and administrative practices in the California Community College system.

In this literature review, the changing role of academic libraries, restructuring
trends, and community college libraries were presented. Additionally, the conceptual
frameworks for this research, the competing values framework and organizational change
framework were discussed. Chapter III is a quantitative study of library administrative
practices in the California Community Colleges (CCC) and Chapter IV is a qualitative
study on the experience of chief librarians in the CCC system.

CHAPTER III: LIBRARY ADMINSTRATIVE PRACTICES IN THE
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES
Libraries at community colleges are integral to student learning, providing
research help, teaching information literacy skills, providing study and social space, and
often computing hardware and support (Gilchrist, 2007). Although all of higher
education is currently facing budget cuts, community colleges serve the most diverse
population of underrepresented students (low income, ethnicity, age, first-generation,
veterans, etc.). Community college provides access to non-traditional students that may
not otherwise achieve their educational goals. Community college libraries support
student learning through its collections, staff, facilities, and equipment.
In the California Community College (CCC) system, a chief librarian is
designated at each college as a statewide representative to the Chief Council of Librarians
(CCL), a self-governing association that actively engages in state-wide issues that impact
CCC libraries (CCL, 2014). Chief librarians in California have traditionally had the title
of library director or dean as evidenced by the annual meetings that are called “Deans
and Directors Meeting.” However, when examining the Council of Chief Librarians
(CCL) Directory (2014), it is evident that many chief librarians do not have the title of
library dean or director. Faculty librarians, often with the title of department chair,
coordinator, head librarian, or librarian, are listed as chief librarians and participate in
the annual CCL Deans and Directors Meeting.
With large budget cuts throughout the state of California, many college
administrators are utilizing restructuring to cut and combine administrative positions,
including library directors/deans, as a way to lower operational costs. Anecdotal evidence
38

39
suggests that many libraries have lost their full-time, dedicated library administrator
positions and chief librarians are now faculty department chairs or faculty from
departments other than the library. Other chief librarians may be a full-time library
administrator that also oversees other divisions or departments (including Distance
Education, Behavioral Sciences, Social Sciences, etc.) and/or an administrator without
the terminal degree for librarians, a Master’s in Library Science (MLS) from an
American Library Association (ALA) accredited program.
In libraries and many other organizations, typical administrative or management
responsibilities include the hiring and supervision of personnel, budgeting, strategic
planning, and setting the mission and goals for an organization. In addition to these
duties, the leader of a college library represents the library in a variety of forums on
campus, the community, in professional organizations, and on a statewide or national
level. Representation of a library at a state level, such as the Council of Chief Librarians,
and taking an active role to shape community college libraries, has been typically
associated with administrative positions (Born, et al., 2001). Many non-administrators,
faculty librarians are becoming the designated chief librarians at the California
Community Colleges and the reason for this emerging trend is not clear.
Restructuring, reorganizations, and mergers of community college and other
higher education administration have become commonplace in California and nationwide
(Fain, 2011; Kiley, 2011). Restructuring and reorganizing has been a constant theme in
higher education as colleges and universities strive to reduce operating costs and increase
efficiency. Academic libraries are a microcosm of their parent institutions and their
staffing and other resources are also impacted during budget cuts. As the information

40
technology landscape continues to alter the way students, faculty, and staff access library
and information resources, college and university libraries are competing with other
entities for funding.
Community colleges are an overlooked segment of higher education and there is a
wide gap in the library and information science literature on community college library
administration, leadership, and librarianship practice. Literature on library leadership and
administrative practices are available for four-year university libraries, especially those
with Association of Research Libraries (ARL) affiliation. However, there is very little
written on community colleges that serve a majority of the total number of students in
higher education (Goldrick-Rab, 2010; Reed, 2011; Townsend, 2009).
California has the largest community college system in the United States and all
of the 112 colleges operate under California educational code, have professional
guidelines from the Association of College and Research Libraries, and are evaluated
under the same regional accreditation body standards (ACCJC, 2012). The California
Statewide Academic Senate Despite developed and adopted standards of practice for
CCC library faculty and programs that also include recommendations for the organization
and administration of libraries. Despite all of these regulations, standards, and guidelines,
administrative practices for community college libraries vary widely and need further
study.
This research examined administrative practices in the California Community
College (CCC) system libraries drawing on the structural and human resources multiframe leadership conceptual frameworks (Bolman & Deal, 2003). In this study, extant
data from the California Community College Chief Librarians Directory was analyzed to

41
determine administrative practices across the state in March 2014. The Council of Chief
Librarians (CCL) maintains library profiles, including demographic information on chief
librarians and administrative practices listed on the CCL website. The study analyzed
self-reported data of chief librarians including (1) chief position titles, (2) role of chief
librarians (faculty or administrative), (3) chief librarians possession of Master’s in
Library Science, (4) chief librarian areas of supervision, and (5) chief librarian external
reporting.
In addition, content analysis of job advertisements was performed to determine
trends in hiring of administrators that oversee the library. A total of eighteen job
advertisements, or postings, were collected within the CCC system for administrators
responsible for the library during the sampling period (January 2013 – April 2014). Job
postings were analyzed for similar criteria as the CCL Directory extant data including (1)
job titles, (2) education requirements, (3) areas of supervision, and (4) external reporting.
All roles were administrative and job ad results were compared to CCL Directory results.
Through analysis of CCL Directory extant data for chief librarians (n = 112), this
study found a wide variety of titles for chief librarians in the CCC system. However, the
majority of chief librarians have traditional library titles such as dean or department
chair, library and/or learning resources and/or learning resource center/LRC. More than
half of current chief librarians had a faculty role. The majority of chief librarians (55%)
had a Master’s in Library Science degree or equivalent (77%). Areas of supervision or
responsibility differed greatly from only the library/LRC to technology/online learning
components and/or academic/college programs. Most of the chief librarians reported to

42
Academic Affairs/Instruction (79%); some reported to Student Services (8%) or a
combined Academic Affairs and Student Services executive administrator (8%).
Through analysis of job advertisements for administrators responsible for libraries
in the CCC system (n = 18), this study found a wide variety of position titles in each
recruitment and the majority of positions were not dedicated library managers but
administrators with academic/college programs or technology/online education duties.
Only 17% of the job advertisements required a Master’s in Library Science (MLS) and
29% listed the MLS as a preferred degree. More than half of the job posts listed a
requirement of any Master’s degree without a preference for discipline. The areas of
responsibility listed in the job advertisements varied widely with a few dedicated library
managers and most administrators overseeing in addition to the library, multiple areas as
well as academic or college programs. Over half of the positions had responsibility for
LAC/tutoring, distance education, and instructional technology. The study also found in
external reporting that the majority of library administrators reported to Academic
Affairs/Instruction (83%).
Academic librarians and library administrators need research on effective college
and university libraries in order to re-envision their services and practices to increase
student learning and campus goals. Since community colleges serve a large segment of
adult learners in the United States, it is important to focus on community college libraries
that support a large percentage of underrepresented students. Library services, staff roles,
and physical library buildings are rapidly changing within the largest community college
system, the California Community Colleges (CCC), and nationwide. Characteristics and
factors leading to successful libraries, such as library administrative practices, need to be

43
identified and described in order to inform practitioners, library administrators, and
college/university administrators.
Context and Background
The California Community Colleges (CCC) is the largest system
of higher education in the world, providing educational, vocational, and transfer
programs to more than 2.5 million students annually (CCC Chancellor’s Office, 2012).
The CCC system is comprised of 112 colleges in 72 districts distributed throughout the
state. It has a diverse student body and in 2010, the ethnicity make-up was Hispanic
(34%), Whites (33%), Asian (11%), African-American (7%), Filipino/Pacific Islander
(4%), American Indian/Alaska Native (0.6%) and Other/Unknown (9%).
Each California Community College (CCC) has a library or learning resource
center that supports student learning. The number of librarians and library staff at each
college varies widely by the size of an institution. Despite variations in number of staff,
each library has a designated chief librarian through the Council of Chief Librarians, a
self-governing, state-wide organization through the CCC Chancellor’s Office. Similarly,
other college leadership roles have self-governing groups with a representative at each
college such as the California Community College Chief Instructional Officers (CIO),
Chief Student Services Officer (CSSO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), etc.
The chief librarian has typically been an administrator with the day-to-day
responsibility for overseeing the physical and virtual library as well as supervising staff.
However, evidence shows that chief librarians that were traditionally administrative
(director or dean) are changing into faculty representatives with the common titles of

44
department chair, division chair, head librarian, or librarian (CCL Directory, 2013). The
following research question and sub-questions guided this study:
What are the administrative practices in the California Community College (CCC)
libraries?
•

What are the titles, roles, and duties of chief librarians?

•

What are the external reporting lines for CCC libraries?

•

What are the trends for library administrator recruitments?

This study includes a literature review on related concepts including community college
library/learning resources centers, academic library restructuring, library organizational
studies, and a multi-frame leadership conceptual framework. Methods for the extant data
study will be discussed, followed by results and discussion.
Literature Review and Conceptual Framework
Community colleges are an overlooked segment of higher education and there is a
wide gap in the library and information science literature on community college library
administration, leadership, and librarianship practice. Literature on library leadership and
administrative practices are available for four-year university libraries, especially those
with Association of Research Libraries (ARL) affiliation. However, there is very little
written on community colleges that serve a majority of the total number of students in
higher education (Goldrick-Rab, 2010; Reed, 2011; Townsend, 2009).
Academic library restructuring. Although much library and information science
literature focuses on the decline of college and university libraries with decreasing use of
physical collections and reference transactions (Ferguson & Bunge, 1997; Ferguson,
2000; Martell, 2008), there is a growing body of literature on innovation and leadership

45
to address the challenges within the academic libraries field (Arnold et al., 2008;
DeLong, 2009; Hernon, 2011; Quinn, 2008). Academic library restructuring and
administrative practices are topics that need further examination during a time of
continued technological advancements, changing library user expectations, and uncertain
economic conditions.
Reorganizations or restructuring of organizational practices, often citing cost
savings and increased collaboration as the desired outcomes of the reorganization, have
become commonplace in higher education. In the last few years, there have been many
visible library reorganizations at research institutions including the libraries at Harvard,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California, Los Angeles, and
University of California, San Diego (Goldberg, 2012; MIT Libraries, 2010; Strong, 2011;
UCSD Libraries, 2012). Facing reduced collection budgets and smaller staffs when not
replacing those who retire, college and university libraries are examining their
administrative practices and organizational models.
Conceptual frameworks. This bounded case-study design relies on conceptual
framework offered by Bolman and Deal (2003) that includes four organizational frames:
structural, human resources, political, and symbolic (see Table 1). The structural frame
relies on policies, mission and visions, and organizational practices for leadership. The
human resources frame focus on employees as the core of an organization and
relationships are used to approach issues. The political frame focuses on power dynamics,
strategic planning, and coalitions when resources are limited. The symbolic frame
focuses on rituals, traditions, ceremonies, and storytelling to inspire members of
organizations.

This study primarily utilized the structural frame to examine the administrative
practices in the California Community College libraries. Structures in a workplace are a
“blueprint for formal expectations and exchanges among internal players and external
constituencies” (Bolman and Deal, 2003, p.46) and structure clarifies lines of authority.
The structure of CCC libraries was examined through chief librarian characteristics,
including their titles, roles, education, and reporting lines. Organizational charts and staff
directories, or responsibility charting, for each college were utilized to verify information.
In Hernon’s 2011 study on library directors that recently accepted a directorship,
Bolman and Deal’s four frames were used in semi-structured interview questions for

47
participants to analyze their new organizations. Interviewees were asked which of the
four-frame leadership styles (structural, human resource, political, and symbolic frames)
they thought their organization and their institution needed. This study reveals the use of
Bolman and Deal's framework to be an effective tool in exploring the perspectives of
library administrators.
Library organizational studies. Crumpton and Bird (2013) argue that
organization structures and reporting role within a college can be important to the overall
success of a library. The typical organizational structures of libraries are focused on three
areas: academic programs (instruction or academic affairs), information technology (IT),
or student services.
•

Academic programs – library mission is tied closely to the mission and goals of
college academic divisions and student learning

•

IT – supervision of campus computer labs, electronic resources, and information
delivery

•

Student services – includes library in the array of services offered to students
(counseling, financial aid, etc.)
A nationwide study was conducted by Born, Clayton, and Balash (2000) on the

organization of community college libraries (n = 268). Relevant findings included:
•

Surveyed libraries were organized very differently and this reflected in
collected organizational charts.

•

60% of the community college libraries had a change in organizational
structure in the previous 5 years.

48
•

Reporting structures for respondents varied widely and there were 37 titles of
administrators the library reports to.

•

Libraries offered a variety of services including AV/Media, library
instruction, computer classes, credit courses, distance learning, public
computers, web development, instructional technology, staff development,
and more.

The Born et al. (2000) study highlights the complexity of community colleges across the
United States and offers insight on the organizational practices, external reporting, and
library services offered.
Content analysis of library job advertisements. Content analysis of job
advertisements is a commonly used methodology in library and information science (LIS)
to analyze higher education library positions (Lynch & Smith, 2001; Shank, 2006;
Sproles, et al., 2008). In a review of job advertisement content analysis methodology,
Harper (2012) argues that LIS research studies utilize job advertisements as a data source
to analyze and track changes to job skills and the employment market over time.
Furthermore, the changing duties, education, and other qualifications (i.e. as years of
experience) desired by hiring institutions for library positions is informed by job
advertisements.
Examples of LIS content analysis of job advertisements methodology include
Lynch and Smith (2001)’s study reviewing 220 librarian job advertisements in College &
Research Libraries from 1970 to 1999, finding that instruction had become an integral
part of librarian work. Sproules and Ratledge (2004) analyzed entry-level librarian job
advertisements for teaching requirements. Shank (2006) utilized job advertisements from

49
1999 to 2004 to investigate position announcements for newly emerging position of
Instructional Design Librarian.
In this study, California Community College library administrator position job
advertisements were collected and analyzed using content analysis described by Harper
(2012) as “a systematic technique of segmenting data into describable linguistic units.”
As part of the content analysis process, manual coding was utilized for each recruitment
to identify the following criteria including (1) position title (2) duties/areas of
responsibility, (3) education requirements (Master’s of Library/Information Science), and
(4) external reporting. This criteria matched analysis of the CCL Directory extant data
and was utilized for comparison purposes. Through analysis of extant data and content
analysis of job ads, administrative practices of in the California Community Colleges
libraries were examined.
Methods
This quantitative case study generated descriptive statistics that help illustrate the
current status of administrative practices of in the California Community Colleges
libraries. A case study closely explores a bounded system (e.g. an activity, event, process,
or individuals) based on extended data collection (Creswell, 2008). In this research, the
“case” or one bounded system will be chief librarians in the CCC system. Extant
demographic data on the California Community College (CCC) chief librarians (n = 112)
and content analysis of job advertisements in the CCC libraries (n = 18) was analyzed.
See Table 2 for a summary of data sources and types of information gathered in this
research.

Council of Chief Librarians Directory. The Council of Chief Librarians (CCL)
maintains library profiles on their website which includes detailed information on chief
librarians at each CCC library. Demographic information on Chief Librarians is selfreported including chief librarian contact information, titles, organizational roles, external
reporting structure, areas of responsibility, educational background, and additional library
information.
Data from CCL Directory was analyzed to determine library administrative
practices in CCC libraries. Themes included chief librarian titles, type of position
(administrative or faculty), areas of supervision, education, and external reporting.
Directory information was confirmed using library staff directories, organizational charts,
or by contacting individual chief librarians.
Library staff directories. Library staff directories were used to verify CCL
Directory information including name of library director/dean/department chair. Staff
directories were located on library websites or college directories. When outdated

51
information was found, the researcher contacted chief librarians by email, phone, or faceto-face.
Organizational charts. Organizational charts were utilized to determine
reporting structures of CCC libraries and to verify the chief librarian title and names.
These were obtained by searching college websites for the following terms: org chart,
organizational chart, functional map, administrative organization, leadership
organizational, organizational relationships, reporting structures. If organizational charts
were not posted on college websites, the researcher also searched accreditation
documents, college directories, Board of Trustees reports, course catalogs, annual reports,
educational master plans, and district handbooks.
California Community College job advertisements. The sampling period for
CCC library administrator job advertisements was from January 2013 – April 2014 (16
months). There were 18 total library administrator job advertisements collected, two ads
were for two different library administrator positions at one institution. Job
advertisements came from 17 total CCC libraries, which equal 15% of all community
college libraries in California.
Position advertisements were collected directly from Human Resources websites.
The researcher used a variety of sources to be notified of job advertisements including:
•

California Community College Registry, a database used by the 72 Human
Resources offices representing the 112 colleges (CCC Registry, 2014).

•

CCC library listservs (CCL-Libraries, CCCEARINFO)

•

Job listing websites (ALA JobLIST, Inside Higher Education, Indeed.com)

52
Content analysis of job advertisements was conducted using the same themes from the
CCC Council of Chief Librarian Directory data analysis.
Results
Extant data analysis of the Council of Chief Librarian Directory and content
analysis of job advertisements for California Community College (CCC) library
administrators revealed current administrative practices and hiring trends within the large
college system. Organizational charts, staff directories, and contact with individual chief
libraries were used to verify results.
Council of Chief Librarians (CCL) Directory. CCL Directory data was
examined for chief librarian information. Overall, the most common chief librarian titles
were dean/director of library and/or learning resources and/or learning resources center
(LRC) (27%, n = 30) and department/division chair of library or learning resources or
LRC (22%, n = 25). Other common titles were coordinator of library/library services,
head librarian, or librarian; all three of these titles were for chief librarians with faculty
status. Other than these more traditional library titles, chief librarian titles varied widely
with few duplicated titles.
Chief librarian titles. Analysis of CCL Directory extant data was conducted to
determine the number of unique titles and to categorize job titles of chief librarians to
determine trends. Of the all the chief librarians, 37 unique titles were found out of 112
total colleges. Titles were then sorted by traditional library titles (library/learning
resources/learning resources center) and non-traditional chief librarian titles were
clustered into the following emerging job title trends:

53
•

Academic Disciplines other than library (i.e. Language Arts, Visual Arts, etc.) or
College Programs (i.e. Study Abroad, Institutional Effectiveness)

•

Technology or Online Learning (i.e. Educational Technology, Chief Technology
Officer)

•

Temporary or Vacant (i.e. Acting Coordinator, Library Services or Interim
Library Director)

A summary of chief librarian job titles by type is provided in Table 3.

The majority of chief librarian titles (70%) were traditional librarian titles such as
Dean or Director or Department Chair of Library, Learning Resources, or Learning
Resources Center. Chief librarians with these titles had both faculty and administrative
roles. There were various ranks of traditional library deans including assistant dean,
associate dean, and dean. Chief librarians that had non-traditional titles,
academic/college programs (10%) or technology/online education (10%) were

54
administrative deans. Of the temporary positions, which were 10% of the total, eight were
filled by administrators and three were unknown.
Examples of chief librarian job titles that included non-library academic or
college programs or a technology or online education component included:
Dean, Language Arts, Library, and Learning Resources (Evergreen Valley
College)
Dean, Visual & Performing Arts and Library (Orange Coast College)
Dean, Institutional Effectiveness and Learning Resources (Ventura College)
Dean, Online Education and Learning Resources (Saddleback College)

•
•
•
•

There is an emerging trend of chief librarian titles without “library/learning
resources/LRC” and only has technology or academic/college programs in job titles.
There were six chief librarians (5% of total) with these titles:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dean, Instruction and Technology (Folsom Lake College)
Director of Technology (Fresno City College)
Dean, Liberal Arts and Language Arts (Mission College)
Dean, Fine and Performing Arts (Santa Ana College)
Chief Technology Officer (Solano Community College)
Dean, Instructional Technology Services (West Valley College)

Through analysis of the CCL Directory, is it clear that there is a wide variety of job titles
for the chief librarians at the community colleges in California. It is important to note that
chief librarians with faculty roles are often reporting to an administrator that primarily
supervises an academic/college program or technology/online learning areas. This is also
evident in the CCL Directory with one example at Palomar College in which the chief
librarian is a faculty department chair that reports to the Dean of Social & Behavioral
Sciences. Further implications and limitations of results will be discussed in the
discussion section.

55
Chief librarian role. Extant data from the CCL Directory was analyzed to
determine the roles of chief librarians (administrative, faculty, or unknown/vacant). This
information is self-reported and was verified using organizational charts and contacting
individual chief librarians when necessary. Figure 3 shows more than half of chief
librarians had a faculty role, 55% (n = 62), and 39% of chief librarians (n = 43) were
administrative. Vacant or unknown chief librarians were 6% of the total, or seven of the
112 total colleges.

Chief librarian credential. Education was self-reported by chief librarians in the
CCL Directory. Some chief librarians that did not report their education in the CCL
Directory but their college degrees were found through public LinkedIn profiles. Analysis
focused on possession of the degree required for librarians, an American Library
Association accredited Master’s in Library Science or Library and Information Science
(MLS/MLIS). The majority of chief librarians, 77%, possessed a MLS/MLIS degree

56
which included 23 administrators and all 63 faculty members (Figure 4). However, 19%
of chief librarians did not have a MLS/MLIS degree and all chief librarians in this
category were administrators. There were seven chief librarian positions that were vacant
or unable to determine the MLS/MLIS status.

Chief librarian areas of supervision. In the CCL Directory, chief librarians selfreported areas of supervision and information was verified using college organizational
charts and library or college website information. Categories in the directory included:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Library: includes Learning Resource Center (LRC)
Media services: includes Audiovisual (A/V) services
LAC (Learning Assistance Center): includes tutoring
ITV (Instructional Television Courses): asynchronous courses through video,
some with course websites and/or occasional class meetings
Computer: includes open labs, student computing
Publications: includes course catalogs and other college publications
Distance Education: can include online, hybrid, and off-site courses
Instructional Technology: includes educational technology and learning
management systems
Staff Development: includes faculty and professional development
Academic Program: includes instructional programs (OPEN ENDED)
Other: includes all non-instructional programs (OPEN ENDED)

Figure 5. Chief librarian areas of responsibilities (Council of Chief Librarians Directory, March
2014)

All chief librarians oversee the library/LRC. Figure 5 shows the most common areas of
responsibility in addition to the library were Media Services (36%), Distance Education
(22%), Instructional Technology (22%), LAC/Tutoring (21%), and Computer (19%). The
least common areas were ITV (8%), Staff Development (7%), and Publications (0%).
There was a variety of numbers of areas supervised among the chief librarians as
demonstrated in Figure 6. About half of all chief librarians only had responsibility for the
library and these were primarily faculty department chairs or administrators with an
academic or college program. Very few chief librarian administrators were dedicated to
the library. It was more common for administrators to have multiple areas of supervision.

58
For example, the chief librarian at Cerritos College was responsible for eight distinct
areas of the nine total (everything except for Publications).

Chief Librarian Academic Program(s) Supervision. In addition to overseeing
the library and the previously identified areas (media, LAC/tutoring, distance education,
etc.), the CCL Directory has an open-ended response for academic programs. Academic
programs typically fall under Academic Affairs, or Instruction, and are related to
disciplines. Of the total chief librarians, 20 had responsibility of an academic program
(18% of the total) and some had more than one discipline such as Humanities and Social
Sciences at Irvine Valley College. With many general education and transfer courses in
the Humanities and Social Sciences, these are large areas to manage with a high number
of faculty and students.

59
The most common academic program for chief librarians was Library &
Information Technology, Library Technology, or Library Science (10 total). There are
currently 10 library technology programs in California that award Associate’s Degree
(AA/AS) or Certificates for paraprofessional library work (COLT, 2014). After library
technology, there were six chief librarians that oversee Languages or Foreign Languages
in addition to the library/LRC duties. There were 10 other academic programs that Chief
Librarians supervise and a full list is in the following Table 4.

Work Experience

It is important to note that of the 20 chief librarians with academic program
responsibilities were mostly administrators in a structure that included a library
department chair. One example is from Santa Ana College that has the Dean of Fine &
Performing Arts as the chief librarian and there is a library department chair that oversees
a Library Technology program. Furthermore, many of the faculty chief librarians (56% of
all chief librarians), directly report to an Academic Affairs dean that oversees academic
programs/disciplines and this is not accounted for in the CCL Directory.
Other Chief Librarian Duties. In addition to the previously identified areas
(media, LAC/tutoring, distance education, etc.), the CCL Directory has an open-ended

60
response for other areas of supervision. Unlike the open-ended academic program
responses, the “other” category was for college programs not directly related with
instruction. There were nine unique “other” categories listed by chief librarians. Only
nine of the total chief librarians listed an area under other (8% of total).
The most common other area of supervision was basic skills (n = 3) and
information technology (n = 2). The other remaining areas were centers supporting
technology and supplemental learning and an assortment of other college areas. A full list
of “other” duties is listed in Table 5.

and Learning Resources at Irvine Valley College who in addition to supervising the
library, media, and LAC/tutoring is responsible for the two large disciplines of
Humanities and English as well as the bookstore and English/Writing/Language labs.
Chief Librarian External Reporting. External reporting was self-reported by
chief librarians in the CCL Directory Library and was verified using college
organizational charts. A high majority of chief librarians (81%) reported to Academic
Affairs, which is also known as Instruction, Student Learning, Curriculum, or other areas

61
associated with the academic programs. There is a designated Chief Instructional Officer
(CIO) at each college and the most common title is Vice President, Academic Affairs or

There were nine chief librarians (8% of total) that report to Student Services,
which often includes counseling, financial aid, and other non-instructional areas. There is
a designated Chief Student Services Officer (CSSO) at each college and the most
common title is Vice-President, Student Affairs. Two chief librarians reported to
Administrative Services/Chief Business Officer (CBO) and one reported directly to the
college President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
Another nine chief librarians (8% of total) reported that their direct supervisor
was a combined Academic Affairs (CIO) and Student Affairs (CSSO) administrator,
often titled an Executive Vice President (joint CIO/CSSO). From analysis of college
organizational charts, there were 23 colleges that had a joint CIO/CSSO position (21% of

62
all colleges). Many of the chief librarians that had a joint CIO/CSSO reported to
Associate Vice-President of Instruction and was thus included as reporting to Academic
Affairs.
CCC library administrator job advertisements. Content analysis was
conducted on library administrator job advertisements from 2013 to 2014. There were a
total of 18 recruitments collected for the CCC system from 17 colleges, or 15% of
colleges statewide. Two of these recruitments were for the same institution, Palomar
College, for a classified library manager and the dean that would be overseeing the
library in addition to other academic areas and programs (Dean, Social & Behavioral
Sciences). Job advertisements were analyzed by position titles, educational requirements,
and areas of responsibilities.
In the analysis of position titles of the library administrator job advertisements,
almost all of the titles were unique with only two duplicates for recruitments in the same
district (Fullerton College and Cypress College in North Orange Coast County College
District). Although most positions were dean positions (15 of the total 18), each library
administrator title was different. Similar to the chief librarian title analysis from the CCL
Directory extant data, job titles from the job advertisements were categorized into (1)
traditional library administrator titles, (2) library administrators with academic/college
program(s) titles, and (3) library administrators with technology/online education titles.

64
About a third of the chief librarian titles were traditional titles (28%). However,
14 of the total library administrator titles included the words or phrases, library, learning
resources, or learning resources center, (78% of job advertisements). Four of the library
administrator titles (22%) did not include any library/LRC phrases in the advertised job
title.
Library administrator areas of responsibilities. The areas of responsibilities in
advertised library administrator jobs were analyzed using the nine CCL Directory
categories (Library, Media, LAC, ITV, Computer, Publications, Distance Education,
Instructional Technology, and Staff Development). Duties for the positions varied widely
with only supervision of the library up to five areas in addition to the library as well as
college programs (See Figure 9).
All of the administrators in these job advertisements had the library as an area of
supervision. The most common responsibilities in addition to the library (using the CCL
Directory categories) were LAC/tutoring (67%), distance education (56%), instructional
technology (56%), and staff development (39%). Computer lab and media supervision
was not a common duty advertised in the job advertisements and there were zero job
advertisements with ITV or publications responsibilities. Three of the 18 recruitments
were for dedicated managers for the library, without responsibility for other areas. All of
the other positions had additional areas of responsibilities listed in the CCL Directory
categories above or with academic or college programs. The posting for City College of
San Francisco listed responsibilities in six distinct areas (library, LAC, computer,
distance education, instructional technology, and staff development).

Library administrator academic programs responsibilities. In the CCC library
job advertisement analysis, there were four total positions (22% of total) that had
traditional academic program or discipline/department responsibilities. These positions
were titled “dean” and the academic programs supervised varied widely (see Table 6). As
an example, the Dean of Academic Services, Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences at Las
Positas College would oversee:
American Sign Language; Humanities (Art, Art History, Interior Design,
Photography, Visual Communications, Humanities, Philosophy, Religious
Studies, Creative Arts); English; English as a Second Language (ESL); Foreign
Languages (French, Italian, Spanish); Mass Communications (Journalism,
Newspaper, Radio, TV); Performing Arts (Dance, Music, Instrumental Music,
Speech, Theater Arts); Library (Library Skills), Social Sciences (Anthropology,
Geography, History, Political Science, Sociology, Women's Studies)

66
In addition to supervising the library, this administrator would be responsible for very
large departments with a high number of faculty and course offerings.

Library administrator other responsibilities. The “other” category was
determined using the same criteria from the CCL Directory: college programs not directly
related to classroom instruction such as support programs and functions. Five of the
library administrators (28%) had these types duties listed in job advertisements. The most
common areas of supervision were college website (n = 2) and honors program (n = 2).
There were a variety of college program duties listed in Table 7 listed from most

Library administrator education requirements. More than half of the job
advertisements for administrators responsible for the library did not have a minimum
qualification of an American Library Association accredited Master’s in Library Science
or Library and Information Sciences (MLS/MLIS). Of the 18 total job advertisements, ten
had the educational requirement of any Master’s degree with no preference for discipline
(55%). Less than half of all job postings listed a MLS/MLIS as a minimum qualification
requirement (17%) or as one of the preferred degrees among others (28%). See Figure 10

advertisements.

Discussion
Traditional library organizational practices have been a dedicated library
administrator with the title of Library Director or Library Dean and the library is a
separate college or unit, reporting to a Vice-President (Born, et al., 2000). Anecdotal
evidence suggests it has become common for community college libraries to be managed
by an administrator with a wide variety of duties which may include supervision of

69
technology/online education or academic and college programs. In this section, findings
from extant data and job advertisement analysis will be compared against similar studies.
Furthermore, implications of results and limitations of the study will be discussed
Administrative practices. Through analysis of the Council of Chief Librarians
(CCL) directory, current administrative practices were examined. Content analysis of job
advertisements for library administrators was conducted to determine hiring and
administrative trends. Analysis focused on job titles, roles, duties, education
requirements, and external reporting of chief librarians and recruitments of library
administrators.
Job titles. Job titles of chief librarians from the CCL Directory (n = 112) and for
CCC library administrators in job advertisements (n = 18) were analyzed. Traditional
library titles such as Dean or Director or Department Chair of Library, Learning
Resources, or LRC were much more common in the CCL Directory (70%) than the job
advertisements (31%). This large difference in job advertisements can be attributed to the
large number of faculty librarians that serve as chief librarian and have the title of
department chair or librarian.
Non-traditional job titles were primarily for administrative dean roles and
included phrases relating to technology/online education (i.e. Dean of Library Services
and Educational Technologies) or academic/programs (i.e. Dean of Visual & Performing
Arts and Library). With all of the library administrator job advertisements having unique
titles, it is evident that there is not consistent practice in the CCC system. Four of the job
advertisements for administrators overseeing the library (22% of the total) did not include
the phrase library or learning resource or learning resources center/LR, in the position

70
titles (i.e. Dean of Social & Behavioral Sciences). This suggests that traditional library
manager positions, dedicated deans and directors, have been or are being combined with
other college functions such as technology/online education and/or academic/college
programs.
Chief librarian roles. Chief librarians are the representatives from each college
to the statewide organization, the Council of Chief Librarians (CCL) and contribute in
library advocacy and promotion. According to CCL Executive Director, Gregg Atkins,
chief librarians were primarily administrative dedicated library dean and directors when
the organization was formed in the 1980’s (personal communication, March 7, 2014).
Analysis of current CCL Directory data indicates that more than half of chief librarians
have faculty roles with titles such as department chair, division chair, coordinator, head
librarian, or librarian. About 40% of the chief librarians had an administrative role and
5% of the chief librarians were vacant or unknown. All job advertisements reviewed were
for administrative director, manager, or dean positions. Faculty department chairs
positions are not advertised in job advertisements and instead chosen by election among
current librarians and rotate on a set term such as two or three years.
Administrative duties. The CCL Directory library profiles include chief librarian
areas of supervision with nine categories that have been commonly associated with
library assignments: library, media services, LAC (tutoring), ITV (instructional
television), computer labs, publications, distance education, instructional technology, and
staff development. In addition, there are open-ended responses for academic programs
and “other” duties. The CCL administrative duties categories were also used to analyze
job advertisements to examine hiring trends for library administrators.

71
Among the faculty chief librarians, the majority only had oversight for the library.
The administrative chief librarians had varying amount of duties and some also had
responsibility for academic programs (i.e. Language Arts, Fine & Performing Arts, etc.)
or college programs (i.e. basic skills, information technology, etc.). The most common
areas for chief librarians to oversee in addition to the library were media services,
distance education, and instructional technology.
Using the same CCL Directory categories to analyze job advertisements for
administrators responsible for the library, it was possible to compare duties versus current
chief librarians (see Table 8). In recruitments for library deans and directors, there was a
decline of duties for media services, ITV, and computer. Notable growth in duties were in
the areas of staff development, LAC/tutoring, distance education, and instructional
technology. As many current chief librarians have similar additional responsibilities in
these growth areas, it is expected that library administrator job advertisements will
continue to follow this trend.
It is difficult to compare academic program and other duties for current chief
librarians against job advertisements because of the different roles. More than half of
chief librarians are faculty members and do not have official supervisory duties and all
job advertisements were for administrators. However, it is clear that the range of duties
for administrators supervising the library is varied from dedicated library managers (that
only oversee the library and/or learning resources) to administrators with a wide range of
duties that may include technology/online learning as well as academic and college
programs.

Education requirements. The terminal degree for librarians is an American
Library Association accredited Master’s in Library Science degree. From the analysis of
CCL Directory data, the majority of chief librarians (77%) possess a MLS which
included all faculty members and about half of the administrators. In the job
advertisement analysis, only 17% of jobs required a MLS and 28% listed the MLS as a
preferred degree. For more than half of the library administrator positions, any Master’s
degree was required with no preference. The jobs that did not require or state a preference
for MLS degree were positions with academic/college program or technology/online
learning titles. With most positions not having a requirement for a library science degree,

73
it is feasible that these administrators will not have experience or knowledge in managing
a library.
External reporting. The CCL Directory and job advertisements were analyzed to
determine chief librarian and library administrator reporting lines. There was similarity
between current and hiring practices for external reporting. The majority of libraries fall
under Academic Affairs or Instruction (CIO) in the directory data as well as in job
advertisements. A smaller percentage report to Student Services (CSSO), another college
administrator, or to the President directly. Although these findings do not fully match the
reporting areas described by Crumpton and Bird (2013), instruction, IT, or student
services, many of the library deans have computer, distance education, and instructional
technology duties.
A number of chief librarians self-reported that their supervisor is a joint Academic
Affairs and Student Services Executive Vice-President. From analysis of college
organizational charts, there were 23 colleges that had a joint CIO/CSSO position, 21% of
all California Community Colleges. A recent survey, “Merged VPI and VPSS,”
conducted by the CCC Chief Instructional Officers (CCCCIO) documented concerns
about these positions due to increased workload (Tortorici, 2013). Some respondents
noted that the positions became “unmerged” and workload was the rationale. It appears
that cost saving measures to reduce college operating costs have impacted not only the
library but other college program and upper administration.

74
Conclusion
In this study of library administrative practices in the California Community
Colleges, there is a clear trend that traditional dedicated library manager positions are
declining. It is common that administrators that oversee the library may also be
responsible for tutoring, distance education, instructional technology, professional
development, academic programs, and/or college programs. It is also common for the
day-to-day supervision of CCC libraries to be under faculty department chairs that report
to an administrator that may or may not have a library background or education. When
comparing current chief librarian vs. library administrator job ad areas of supervision,
there is a clear trend of increased additional duties in learning assistance center/tutoring,
distance education, educational technology, and professional development.
Limitations. This study explored library administrative practices in the California
Community Colleges. Although this system is the largest community college system in
the world, it may not be generalizable to all community college systems. This study is not
intended to make broad statements about library administrative practices for all
community colleges, but only within in California. Furthermore, the validity of the
Council of Chief Librarian Directory data collected depended on self-reporting by chief
librarians. There were vacancies for chief librarians at seven institutions; many of these
were for current recruitments. Organizational charts and library staff directories were
used to verify information. In addition to regular reminders from the CCL Executive
Board, the researcher emailed the statewide listserv asking chief librarians to update their
library profiles and also contacted individual chief librarians to verify or correct
information.

75
Areas for future research. Many questions about library administrative practices
still exist. The library administrative practices in this study were a recent snapshot in time.

Current library leaders, along with other college leaders would benefit from a historical
data analysis of chief librarian data as well as a longitudinal study of library administrator
job advertisements. Interviewing library faculty and staff in colleges with different library
administrative practices, especially in those that have been recently restructured, could be
revealing.
As part of a larger study, the organizational structure of CCC libraries could be
explored with a focus on the library administrators, whether or not they are designated as
chief librarian. This would provide more clarity of “who’s in charge of the library” and
how this may have changed over time. It would be beneficial also within library
organizational structure or models to investigate which colleges have faculty department
chairs and what their leadership duties are. After determining organizational models, an
explanatory study could be conducted to investigate correlation between models and the
variables of college size, region, and type of district (single or multi-district).
With the statewide trend moving away from dedicated library managers and more
duties for administrators responsible for the library, it is important to study effective
administrative practices and library organizational models. Furthermore, if libraries are
increasingly administered by non-librarians (without a MLS), how does this impact
library operations and aspiring library leaders? How should library schools that operate
MLS programs approach this changing trend in their curriculum?
Implications for leadership. This research provides insights about the
administrative practices among California Community College libraries. Community

76
college libraries are not represented in the literature, especially in the area of changing
administrative practices. Community colleges serve a majority of our nation’s higher
education students and libraries support student learning. If changing administrative
practices negatively impact the ability of libraries to meet their mission and goals, student
success may be hindered. Examining current library administrative practices could
uncover valuable lessons or practices that could help current executive leaders when
making decisions on library administrative practices. Furthermore, this study may
provide useful information to those who may become chief librarians and the library
faculty and staff that work closely with them.

CHAPTER IV: THE EXPERIENCES OF CHIEF LIBRARIANS
In the California Community College (CCC) system, a chief librarian is
designated at each college as a statewide representative to the Chief Council of Librarians
(CCL), a self-governing association that actively engages in state-wide issues that impact
CCC libraries (CCL, 2014). The primary purpose of CCL is to “…represent, promote,
and advance libraries in public California community college education and to provide a
vehicle for communication among chief librarians, other community college personnel,
and state agencies (CCL, 1993).” According to Gregg Atkins, Executive Director and
former chief librarian, when CCL was initially formed in the 1980’s, chief librarians held
administrative roles dedicated to the library with the title of library dean or library
director (personal communication, March 7, 2014). However, when examining the CCL
Directory (2014), it is evident that many current chief librarians do not have the title of
library dean or director.
Faculty librarians, often with the title of department chair, coordinator, or head
librarian, are listed as chief librarians and participate in the annual meetings that have
retained the name of Deans and Directors Meeting. Through the statewide CCL listserv,
CCL-Libraries, many library leaders and librarians have raised concerns about losing
dedicated library managers and the increasing number of faculty department chairs acting
as chief librarians instead of deans and directors. Some of the main concerns with not
having a dedicated library manager were summarized by long-time chief librarian and
nationally recognized community college leader, Mary Ann Laun:

77

78
•

Library representation/advocacy: there is not a library manager is “not at the
table where decisions are made.” A department chair as chief librarian reporting
to a dean of many areas is two steps from upper administration (CIO) and may not
be able to advocate for the library.

•

Administrative time: reduced administrative time for library administrator with
additional duties; department chairs typically get 20% release or stipend to cover
a large amount of duties formerly done by a dedicated library manager. No time
past day-to-day duties including strategic and long-term planning.

•

Supervisory issues: Without a dedicated manager, day-to-day staff supervision
may be more difficult. Library faculty, including department chairs, in most
colleges do not have the authority to supervise classified library technicians (staff)
that carry out many library functions and services (M. Laun, personal
communication, September 23, 2008).
From the 1980’s to the 21st century, it appears that the role and experiences of

chief librarians has shifted significantly. The purpose of this study is to explore more
deeply the experiences of library leaders currently serving in community colleges with
different administrative practices. The design of this study was built around the following
research questions:
1. What are the administrative practices in the California Community College
(CCC) libraries?
2. What does it mean to be a chief librarian in a CCC library?
This study sheds light on administrative practices in California community college
libraries in the largest system of higher education in the nation. Despite their prevalence

79
in higher education, very little is known about the administration and leadership of
community college libraries. The changing role of library management and faculty
responsibilities in the management of community college libraries has not been studied.
Qualitative research is ideal for the in-depth exploration of chief librarian experiences
and leadership perspectives. A literature review on relevant literature will be followed by
methodological design. Results from the study will be shared and the significance of the
research is addressed in the discussion section.
Literature Review and Conceptual Framework
Several bodies of literature were reviewed to understand the experience of chief
librarians in the California Community College system. The first body of literature on
community college library leadership provides context and background for the study. The
second body of literature presents the two conceptual frameworks used to explore the
leadership perspectives and administration of the CCC chief librarians. The conceptual
frameworks utilized were (1) organizational change framework and (2) competing values
framework. These conceptual frameworks provide a relevant structure by which to
examine the experiences and leadership perspectives of chief librarians. Background for
the study and theoretical constructs will be reviewed and followed by the methodology,
results, discussion, and conclusions.
Community college. The majority of post-secondary students in the United States
now attend community colleges, also known as junior or technical colleges. California
Community Colleges serve over 2.9 million students, or approximately 63% of higher
education students in the state (Lorenzo, 2011). These two-year institutions were created

80
as add-on colleges to high school or university in the early 1900’s to increase access to
higher education (Bock, 1985). The number of community colleges in the United States
rapidly grew from 1960-1980 with the creation of 662 new colleges (Cohen & Brawer,
2003). Reed (2011) notes that community college libraries were often created after the
establishment of a college often in response to pressure from accreditation feedback.
Community college libraries. Standards of practice have developed
specifically for community colleges through the state of California Educational Code
(Title V), the statewide Academic Senate, and accreditation. The regional accrediting
body for the California Community Colleges is the Accrediting Commission for
Community and Junior Colleges, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACCJC
– WASC). These standards and regulations provide benchmarks for library practices and
evaluation. There are standards from the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL), a chapter of the American Library Association, for libraries in higher education
(ACRL, 2011). However, these are not specific to community colleges and do not address
administrative structures.
Standards of Practice for California Community College Library Faculty and
Programs were developed and adopted by the Academic Senate (AS) for California
Community Colleges in 2010. These standards address the role of library faculty and
provide guidelines for library resources, facilities, instruction, and other library services.
In addition, recommendations for the organization and administration of library
community colleges are recommended. The AS argues that the organization and
administration of the library has significant impact on its effectiveness and provides
specific standards (p. 11):

81
•

Administrator role: The library should be under the leadership of an instructional
administrative director or dean who is responsible for the daily operations of the
library.

•

Required education: The administrator should possess the minimum
qualifications of the library discipline in addition to having experience and
training in management or leadership.

Despite all of the existing regulations, standards, and guidelines, administrative practices
for community college libraries vary widely and need further study.
Community college library standards. Standards of practice have developed
specifically for community colleges through the American Library Association,
Association of College and Research Libraries, the state of California educational code,
and the statewide Academic Senate. The regional accrediting body for the California
Community Colleges is the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior
Colleges, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACCJC – WASC). These
standards and regulations provide benchmarks for library practices and evaluation.
Standards of Practice for California Community College Library Faculty and
Programs were developed and adopted by the Academic Senate (AS) for California
Community Colleges in 2010. These standards address the role of library faculty and
provide guidelines for library resources, facilities, instruction, and other library services.
In addition, recommendations for the organization and administration of library
community colleges are recommended. The AS argues that the organization and
administration of the library has significant impact on its effectiveness and provides
specific standards (p. 11):

82
•

Administrator role: The library should be under the leadership of an instructional
administrative director or dean who is responsible for the daily operations of the
library.

•

Required education: The administrator should possess the minimum
qualifications of the library discipline in addition to having experience and
training in management or leadership.
Organization of community college libraries. Crumpton and Bird (2013) argue

that organization structures and reporting role within college can be important to the
overall success of a library. The typical organizational structures of libraries are focused
on three areas: academic programs (instruction or academic affairs), information
technology (IT), or student services.
•

Academic programs – library mission is tied closely to the mission and goals of
college academic divisions and student learning

•

IT – supervision of campus computer labs, electronic resources, and information
delivery

•

Student services – includes library in the array of services offered to students
(counseling, financial aid, etc.)
A nationwide study was conducted by Born, Clayton, and Balash (2000) on the

organization of community college libraries (n = 268). Relevant findings included:
•

Surveyed libraries were organized very differently and this reflected in
organizational charts.

•

60% of the community college libraries had a change in organizational
structure in the previous 5 years.

•

Reporting structures for respondents varied widely and there were 37 titles of
administrators the library reports to.

83
•

Libraries offered a variety of services including AV/Media, library
instruction, computer classes, credit courses, distance learning, public
computers, web development, instructional technology, staff development,
and more.

The Born et al. (2000) study highlights the complexity of community colleges across the
United States and offers insight on the organizational practices, external reporting, and
library services offered.
Reed (2011) conducted a multi-case study of library deans and directors at large
comprehensive community colleges and their advocacy for instructional and
technological innovation. In her interviews with six library deans and directors, the
organizational practices included:
•

Multi-campus district/ multiple libraries / one director

•

Multi-campus district / multiple libraries / one director per library

•

One campus / one library / one director
Diablo Valley College (DVC), a large, comprehensive community college in

California, conducted a study of administrative practices in CCC libraries to inform the
development of a chief librarian job opening at the college (Diablo Valley College,
2013). The survey was shared on the statewide chief librarians listserv (CCL-Libraries) to
library administrators and department chairs (n = 34 unique institutions or 30% response
rate of the 112 CCC libraries).
The most common titles for chief librarians were department chair/division chair
or chairperson (faculty role); library/LRC director (faculty or administrative role); Dean

84
of Library and/or Learning Resources. Deans that have non-library assignments were
reflected in titles (e.g. Dean of Library and Educational Technologies) or the term
“library” was not in their title (e.g. Dean, Liberal Studies and Language Arts). In addition
to demographic data, the survey instrument asked respondents to evaluate their current
administrative structure and asked individuals what they would change about their
position or library managerial/administrative structure.
•

82% of respondents thought that their current library administrative structure was
effective (13 strongly agree, 15 agree)

•

74% of respondents thought that they can effectively advocate for their division or
department (13 strongly agree, 12 agree)

•

62% of respondents disagreed that they have enough time to devote to
management of the library (16 disagree, 5 strongly disagree)

The results from this study will be further discussed in Chapter V.
Organizational change conceptual framework. Bolman and Deal’s (2003)
conceptual framework includes four frames to examine organizations from different
perspectives: structural, human resources, political, and symbolic. The structural frame
relies on policies, mission and visions, and organizational practices for getting results.
The human resources frame focus on employees as the core of an organization and
relationships are used to approach issues. The political frame focuses on power dynamics,
strategic planning, and building coalitions when resources are limited. The symbolic
frame focuses on rituals, traditions, and storytelling to inspire members of organizations
and shape organizational culture.
In Hernon’s 2011 study on library directors that recently accepted a directorship,
Bolman and Deal’s four frames were used in semi-structured interview questions for

85
participants to analyze their new organizations. Interviewees were asked which of the
four-frame leadership styles (structural, human resource, political, and symbolic frames)
they thought their organization and their institution needed. This study reveals the use of
Bolman and Deal's framework to be an effective tool in exploring the perspectives of
library administrators.
Competing values framework. Cameron and Quinn (2011) developed a
Competing Values Framework (CVF) that assesses the type of organizational cultures
focusing on four variables including: (1) flexibility and discretion – clan culture, (2)
stability and control – hierarchy culture, (3) internal focus and integration – market
culture, and (4) external focus and differentiation – adhocracy culture. The University of
Saskatchewan Library applied the CVF to assess types of organizational cultures
(Shepstone & Currie, 2008). At the Ohio State University Libraries, Schlosser (2011)
utilized CVF to identify culture change targets including: a “culture of no” that stifles
innovation, sheer size of an organization, and elements of distrust or resentment between
library faculty and library staff (p. 156-157). The use of this framework in prior library
research indicates its appropriateness for use in studies, such as this, where changes
associated with organizational structure and leadership roles are being explored.
Combined conceptual frameworks. In this study, Bolman and Deal’s multiframe conceptual framework was combined with Cameron and Quinn’s (2011)
competing values model in answering the research questions. With rapid technological
change and shrinking library budgets, many academic library managers are applying
organizational change approaches to reshape their libraries. Commonly utilized
organizational change theory in the academic library literature includes the competing

86
values framework and multi-lens organizational approach. Because there are similarities
among these frameworks and they are both useful for examining chief librarian
leadership perspectives, a combined model was utilized for this study (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Combined competing values (Cameron & Quinn, 2011) and organizational change
conceptual framework (Bolman & Deal, 2003).

Methods
Four community college library leader experiences were explored using a
multiple instrumental case-study design. Two combined conceptual frameworks
addressing leadership (Bolman and Deal, 2003) and organizational culture (Cameron and

87
Quinn, 2011) were used to guide the study and analyze data. Data was collected through
semi-structured interviews and organizational documents.
Methodological design. Through use of a multiple instrumental case study, also
called a collective case study, four bounded systems were examined through the
participation of four specific chief librarians with different administrative library
practices. An example of a case study of six bounded systems is the study by Reed (2011)
in which six community college library deans and directors participated. In this case
study, the researcher investigated library leaders’ advocacy of instructional and
technological innovation using qualitative interview data.
Community college libraries are rarely studied and qualitative inquiry allows
researchers to study processes in detail. My utilization of qualitative methods was an
inductive process, allowing participants to shape my understanding of community college
chief librarians and library administrative practices. Gorman and Clayton (2005) argue
that qualitative research methods are suited to library and information science work as
information environments are complex and social. Library and Information Science
researchers often use qualitative methods to investigate library users and their
information seeking behavior, such as the seminal ethnographic study on University of
Rochester undergraduate library use by Foster and Gibbons (2007).
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four chief librarians key
informants. Esterberg (2002) argues that the use of semi-structured interviews allows
researchers to “…explore a topic more openly and [allows] interviewees to express their
opinions and ideas in their own words" (p.87). Semi-structured interviews were utilized
by Hernon (2011) to explore the experience of library directors that recently accepted a

88
new director position. Ten first-time and seasoned directors were recruited to participate
in interviews. Participants discussed their experiences of their new directorship from the
beginning to the end of the process: how they discovered the position, prepared for the
interview, examined the organization and institution, and why they chose to accept the
position. Similar to the Hernon study, the experiences of chief librarians in CA
community college libraries were explored through the use of semi-structured interviews.
Context and research sites. The study focused on the California Community
College system which is comprised of 112 colleges. Because of the system’s size and
diversity, the system is a microcosm of community colleges around the country, making
it an ideal environment to study chief librarians. Four chief librarians at different research
sites were selected using reputational sampling. All of the study participants were from
very large community colleges (more than >10,000 full time student enrollment) and
none of these research sites had a dedicated library manager.
Interview participants. Reputational sampling, a type of purposive sampling,
was utilized to identify participants for the study. Experts in the field highlighted
appropriate participants (Miles and Huberman, 1994). The researcher solicited participant
suggestions from the President and Executive Board of the Council of Chief Librarians
(CCL), the statewide association for community college library leaders, for names of
chief librarians whom they would identified as meeting the criteria for selection.
Criteria for chief librarian participants was a strong reputation (ex. active
participation in statewide library issues, implementation of innovative library practices,
and leadership and/or library awards), as well as three to ten years of experience in their
current role. Chief librarians of single college libraries, as opposed to multi-college

89
library administrators, were selected for reliable contextual comparison. The vast
majority of CCC chief librarians oversee one library although many colleges are part of
multi-college districts.
As with any sampling method, reputational sampling has benefits and drawbacks.
The main advantage of this sampling strategy was identifying cases of interest from
people who know people who know what cases are information rich (Miles and
Huberman, 1994). Additionally, Merriam (1998) explains that, “purposeful sampling is
based on the assumption that the investigator wants to discover, understand, and gain
insight and therefore must select a sample from which the most can be learned” (p. 61).
With purposive sampling, the sample can provide useful information and answer research
questions however, the individuals may not be representative of the population.
Additionally, there may be an injection of bias from the experts in the field although the
reputational sampling will yield access to key informants.
Seven interview participants were invited to participate in the study and four
chief librarians agreed to participate in the study (See Appendix A for recruitment letter).
Two declined without reason and one cited scheduling conflicts as an inability to
participate. Of the four chief librarians who participated, three were White and one was
of Asian ethnicity. Two of the chief librarians were female and two were male. Three of
the participants had a librarian background (Master’s in Library Science and had served
as faculty librarians) and one did not have a librarian background. Two chief librarians
were from single college districts and the other two were from multi-college districts.
Chief librarians with the following administrator and faculty roles and titles were
interviewed:

90

•

Library Dean (A)
Library Director (A)
Library Director (F)
Library Department Chair (F)

The four chief librarians represented a diversity of perspectives by their leadership roles
and backgrounds.
Data collection. Data was collected from one-on-one interviews and
organizational documents. Interviews were scheduled at a time convenient for chief
librarians and occurred in their offices. Before each interview, the purpose of the study
was reviewed and interviewees signed a writen consent form to participate in the study
and for audio recording (see Appendix B for informed consent form). The semistructured interviews lasted between one and a half to two hours with each chief librarian.
The interview protocol was designed to explore questions regarding library
administrative structures and practices, library leadership and organizational culture, and
chief librarian experiences. After drafting questions and probes based on my professional
experience and professional literature, I tested the instrument with former chief librarians.
With their feedback, I revised the instrument for reliability and clarity. The finalized
interview instrument consisted of six interview questions related to administrative
practices and chief librarian experiences (See Appendix C for interview protocol).
In addition, a variety of documents and extant data were collected for this study.
College organizational charts were available publically through college websites and/or
accreditation self-study reports. Library profile information was individually submitted
by chief librarians and made available through the Council of Chief Librarians (CCL)
Website (CCL Directory, 2014). Library profiles include demographic information on

91
chief librarians, areas of responsibility, external reporting, and names of previous chief
librarians at each college.
Data analysis. All of the interviews were recorded and transcribed by a
transcription service and verified by the researcher. All interviews were coded by number
and all identifiable information was removed. Initial codes for themes were developed
based on the literature review, conceptual frameworks (leadership frames and
organizational culture), examination of extant data (CCL Directory), and researcher
experience as a chief librarian. Manual coding was used to test and modify codes before
the use of computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS).
Computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS).
HyperResearch, a type of CAQDAS, was used to assist in organizing data for analysis.
According to Saldaña (2013), CAQDAS software provides the following benefits:
•

Flexible coding in recoding, uncoding, renaming, deleting, moving, merging,
and grouping codes

•

Powerful search and querying abilities to quickly collect and display
keywords and phrases

•

A way of keeping track of the project

HyperResearch was used to save transcripts and documents for coding, to create and save
my coding scheme, code data line-by-line, and to create and save analytic memos. The
interview data was further analyzed by reading and rereading transcripts to collapse codes
into themes (Creswell, 2008). Core themes centered on chief librarian experiences,
leadership perspectives, and organizational culture. The researcher constructed theme

92
descriptions using direct quotes from transcripts of the individuals’ experiences related to
the core themes.
Ethical considerations. Participants were informed of their rights, potential risks,
and benefits of participating in this study before interviews via email and in-person prior
to the interviews. Chief librarian participants signed a consent form which explained the
purpose of the study and outlined how the data collected was stored and kept confidential
(Miles & Huberman, 1994). Generic identifiers and modified titles for the participants
were used to anonymize personal information. Another precaution taken was the use of
member checking to help ensure confidentiality and privacy. This entailed submitting
interview transcript samples and the study’s findings to participants for their review.
Results
The main purpose of this study was an in-depth exploration of the administrative
practices and experiences of chief librarians in the California Community College
system. In this study, four chief librarian key informants shared their experiences,
leadership views, and organizational culture in relation to administrative structures. There
were different administrative practices in each library. Using a combined competing
values and leadership frame model, six main themes from chief librarian experiences
emerged including (1) supervision, (2) collaboration, (3) shared governance, (4) lack of
resources, (5) marginalization, and (6) credentialed librarian managers.
Research question 1. The first research question was: What are the
administrative practices in the California Community College (CCC) libraries?
Participants described their library administrative practices within three topics: current

93
administrative practices, department chairs, and rationales for changing administrative
practices. These topics will be discussed at length.
Current administrative practices. Each of the interview participants had
different administrative practices including chief librarian title, role (faculty or
administrator), areas of supervision, education, and reporting structure. A summary of
administrative practices for each key informant is summarized in Table 9. As chief
librarian titles vary widely and can be unique, titles were simplified to protect identities
of participants. Specific areas of supervision were also omitted for confidentiality.

Library Science (MLS) is the credential for professional librarians.

Each chief librarian had a different title: department chair, director, or dean. The
department chair and one of the directors had faculty roles; the other director and the
dean had administrator, or management, roles. All of the chief librarians had

94
responsibility of the library (personnel, facilities, etc.) outlined in their job duties except
for the faculty department chair participant, Chief Librarian A.
Chief Librarian A, the department chair, described internal reporting between the
dean and faculty as well as staff supervision in their library:
The dean is in charge of the library. [The librarians] are the ones that are
responsible for the policy and procedure for the building. Those are the
kinds of things that are hammered out in faculty meetings with the dean
there…The librarians have always reported to the dean, and there have
been staff supervisors. Librarians do not supervise, and that’s an issue.
You probably have come across it before, that while the librarians are
ultimately responsible for the services, resources, and so on in the library,
we don't supervise the staff that does the day-to-day work in those areas.
We sort of direct their work in a way, but we are not their ultimate
supervisors (personal communication, January 2014).
There were perceived issues with librarians having responsibility over library operations
but not having the authority to supervise the classified staff that carries out much of the
daily work. Chief Librarian A performed librarian duties as their primary role and
received a stipend to act as department chair.
In contrast, the faculty library director, Chief Librarian B, had formal
responsibility for the library including supervision of classified staff as their primary role
and explained “my role is to administer the library, manage the library, write evaluations,
hire people, take care of the student workers” (personal communication, January 2014).
Although the faculty library director reported to an instructional dean, they supervised the
day-to-day work of classified staff. The faculty director was not responsible for
supervising personnel or operations in any other college area besides the library. In
addition to managing the library, the faculty director also performed some librarian duties

95
such as reference, instruction, or collection development. The role of faculty as
supervisors will be addressed further in the discussion section.
Chief Librarians C and D were administrators had responsibility for the library as
well as other college areas or units. Common areas other than libraries for administrator
chief librarians to oversee include media services, computer labs, tutoring/learning
resources center, distance education, instructional technology, and/or professional
development (CCL Directory, 2014). The library dean and administrator library director
both supervised areas in addition to the library and also had oversight for academic
programs with credit courses. The library dean had responsibility for three other units
besides the library while the administrative library director had responsibility for two
other units. Both of these administrative chief librarians reported to the Chief
Instructional Officer on their college, the Vice-President of Instruction or Academic
Affairs.
Alternatively, Chief Librarians A and B in faculty roles reported to an
instructional dean that supervised the library in addition to other areas and programs.
All of the study participants mentioned a growing trend of colleges to add additional
duties to library managers. Chief Librarian D discussed the statewide trend to add
additional duties to library managers as a dysfunctional model and why it is difficult for
libraries to advocate for a dedicated manager.
The trend of the state to hire a dean of library and learning support, or
learning programs, or student support service, or whatever it is. What has
happened, it has become its own default affirmation of the current
dysfunctional model. In other words, it has become its own referent. Look,
there's this many schools with this model. It looks like this is the standard.
It becomes even more difficult to argue against that model. It's easy for
people who have never step foot into the library to run it and to say, "it

96
runs itself, doesn't it? Why do you need a dedicated manager? Look at all
these other schools, they don't have dedicated managers" (personal
communication, February 2014).
Chief librarian C shared this anecdotal observation about the added duties to library
managers across the state:
…They seem to take more nibbles out of the full 100% library
management plate and adding other things. Just seems to happen every
time it is in sync with trends across the country and certainly in California.
I worry that it’s the trend that happens without regard for the size of the
school, the number of students (personal communication, January 2014).
Concern about a new standard for library administrators without thoughtful consideration
or evaluation was expressed. All of the study participants were from very large
community colleges (more than >10,000 full time student enrollment) and none of these
libraries had a dedicated library manager.
Most of the chief librarians had a terminal degree for librarians, a Master’s in
Library Science (MLS). The two faculty chief librarians had a MLS as did the
administrative library director. All three of these chief librarians had served as librarians
in their current institution prior to becoming the chief librarian. The library dean, Chief
Librarian D, did not have a MLS but held a Master’s degree in another subject and had
never been in a faculty librarian role. All participants talked about whether a MLS was
needed to be an effective chief librarian and this will be discussed in results for Research
Question #2.
Department chairs. When discussing administrative structure, chief librarians
mentioned department chair models with faculty leaders (not administrative). Department
chairs existed in all of the participants’ colleges although only Chief Librarian A was an
official department chair. Department chair duties varied widely at each institution from

97
coordinating an academic program (e.g. credit information-literacy courses or certificate
programs) to overseeing library operations including reference services, library
instruction, and other public services. One of the administrative chief librarians (D)
shared a wide variety of their department chair’s duties:
There are routine kinds of things that [the library department chair] does
that other chairs do also. For example, scheduling, classes, who is going to
teach, scheduling who's on [reference] desk, subs, scheduling workshops,
working on curriculum for example. There are things that are pretty
standard, dealing with student complains, be the frontline to resolve issues
and that kind of thing. For example, library holds students who forgot their
ID or have a complaint against something (personal communication,
February 2014).
The library department chair participant, Chief Librarian A, did not have credit course
duties but shared similar duties with library operations in reference and patron issues:
•

Leading faculty meetings

•

Oversee adjunct librarians (hiring, timesheets, budgeting, evaluation)

•

Participation in full-time librarian evaluations

•

Oversee reference services

•

Handling patron complaints

•

Representation in regional consortium

Differing from other department chair duties, Chief Librarian C explained that their
department chair’s unique responsibility was to coordinate the library credit program:
[The department chair] is not an assistant manager or supervisory role
over the classified staff or decisions that affect the operation on a day to
day basis. If I’m not here, the people don’t automatically go to the
department chair because they are next in line operationally (personal
communication, January 2014).

98
This department chair did not coordinate library operations such as reference or library
instruction and instead modeled department chairs in other academic programs at the
college with course scheduling, adjunct hiring, and curriculum duties.
The administrative structure of the faculty library director did not include a
department chair. However, the faculty library director, Chief Librarian B felt that they
carried out duties of department chairs at their college:
I basically have all the responsibilities of the department chair. I'm not
called a department chair… We have a handbook that's the department
chair handbook. If I read that department chair handbook, I do every
single thing in that handbook as part of my regular job as a library
director…I'm essentially a department chair, but a full-time department
chair, in some ways (personal communication, January 2014).
The introduction of the department chair roles was recent at most colleges. At one library,
the department chair role had existed for six years and another for more than twelve
years. It is unclear whether these positions were introduced because libraries changed
administrative structures and no longer had a dedicated library manager or if department
chair models were instituted college-wide for academic programs.
Administrative practice change rationale. In the interviews discussing
administrative practices, all participants brought up previous administrative practices and
their predecessors. Rationales for the existing administrative structures and why changes
were made were explained by the chief librarians. Chief Librarian D shared an example
of converting a dedicated library director into a dean position that had oversight for the
library and other areas:
At one point, this library had its own library director. The administrative
structure changed to make her into a dean…she couldn't just be dean of
the library. She had to have additional duties to be "on par" with other
instructional deans because she didn't have as many traditional faculty or

99
courses as other deans. Therefore, she could be perceived as less than a
real dean. I used that word "real" on purpose because that's how they
talked about that position (personal communication, February 2014).
Chief Librarian B explained changes from a library dean position to a library director
position:
I know that the previous director, when he left, he was called the library
director. But I know that he was also, prior to that, had been called an
associate dean. He was on a regular contract, like a dean contract (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian C shared about a library director position being converted to a dean
position with the addition of tutoring duties and then being converted back to a library
director position:
These six years of the library director becoming all over sudden
responsible for tutoring was at the end of a difficult stretch for the college
or in the midst of one in general, through our accreditation issues, previous
administration, and this person’s style, it was not productive or
constructive to have this academic manager caught in the politics and the
challenges of a faculty committee, tutoring advisor committee and this
manager trying to implement things and not trusting faculty. Not a
positive, constructive experience. So, everybody was ready to take
tutoring off the plate. Once tutoring was taken off the plate there’s no
reason not to make it just director of the library again (personal
communication, January 2014).
In the span of approximately a decade, there had been many changes to administrative
structures at each of the participant college libraries. In two of these libraries, Chief
Librarian C and D, the library director positions were changed to dean positions with the
oversight of areas in addition to the library. Both participants shared that the title of dean
“has more weight” and stature than a title of director. This is supported by the changes
that Chief Librarian B described at their college with the “downgrading” of a library dean
to director due to ineffective leadership.

100
For all of the chief librarian participants, there had been a dedicated library
administrator in the past however in their current administrative structures; this is no
longer the case. Rationales for this change were offered by Chief Librarian C:
I think there is a perception that with technology, libraries have become
easier to run or manage while they remain expensive enterprises for the
colleges. I do believe they appear on paper as expensive enterprises and
management looks for ways to reduce those costs. Part of it is it just
appears that it must be simpler to run a library so we can afford to carve a
little bit of time out of a manager’s world to run that library and give them
other responsibilities (personal communication, January 2014).
The perception of upper administration was that the library manager has the ability to
take on more college duties because of technological advances. With budget reductions,
there was a need to reduce college personnel and increase manager responsibilities. Chief
Librarian B also focused on the salary costs of a dedicated library manager:
It will never be just a dean in the library, organizationally we can't afford
that. Structurally, it's not necessary. It would cost them $40,000 more a
year to have a dean of just the library. To what end? I think that our model
is a good one…for our community, our culture. It's served the library well
(personal communication, January 2014).
Although there was a dedicated library manager in the past, Chief Librarian B did not feel
like that this was necessary to bring back in light of other college managerial needs and
their existing administrative structure with a faculty library director was working well.
In summary, three of the four participants had worked with a dedicated library
manager in the past but changes to the administrative practices occurred. The
administrative library director position changed to a dean of multiple areas (Chief
Librarian D). An administrative library director changed to a dean of multiple areas and
then to an administrative library director with multiple areas (Chief Librarian C). An

101
administrative library dean position was changed to an administrative library director
position then to a faculty library director position (Chief Librarian B).
Research question 2. The second research question was: What does it mean to be
a chief librarian in a CCC library? Interviews explored what are their duties as the chief
librarian representative to the statewide Council of Chief Librarians. In addition, a
combined competing values framework and organizational change conceptual framework
were used to analyze chief librarian leadership perspectives and to generate themes based
on their lived experiences.
Chief librarian duties. In addition to their job duties as library department chair,
director, or dean, all participants discussed the responsibilities they had as the main
contact and representative to the Council of Chief Librarians, the statewide association
for CCC’s. These responsibilities included:
•

Attending regional and statewide meetings and workshops

•

Responsibility for submitting annual CCC Chancellor’s Office survey
(coordination of data/statistics collection)

•

Active participation/knowledge sharing in listserv

Furthermore, some participants had served in leadership roles in the CCL through the
consortium (CCL-EAR) or executive board (elected as regional representatives or as
officers).
The study found that chief librarians are responsible for being active participants
in statewide meetings (e.g. the annual Deans and Directors Meetings) and attending
regional meetings and workshops. Information that impacts all system libraries may be
discussed, such as statewide databases and funding sources. There may be guest

presenters to provide professional development or to introduce chief librarians to new
trends and/or to promote advocacy. Information from these meeting and workshops is
shared with library faculty and staff. In addition to important information, the chief
librarians have the opportunity to network, share experiences in their respective libraries,
and collaborate with other library colleagues.
All community college libraries in California are mandated by California
Educational Code to compete the Library and Learning Resources Annual Data Survey
administered by the California Community College Chancellor’s Office (Title 5, Section
55800). This annual survey includes information on annual expenditures on library
collections (books, periodicals, electronic resources, etc.), personnel, staffing, service
statistics, and general information. Chief librarians are responsible for compiling this
information and submitting it to the Chancellor’s Office each year.
Leadership perspectives. All participants in the study expressed the need for
strong leadership to administer California community college libraries. In order to have
strong leadership, adequate resources and authority are needed for chief librarians
regardless of their role. The organizational change framework and the competing values
conceptual frameworks were presented to chief librarians to describe the different types
of leadership that they utilize and to describe their organizations. The leadership frames
include human resources, political, structural, and symbolic. The competing values
characteristics centered on the internal or external focus and flexibility or inflexibility of
their organization. Interview transcripts were also coded using a combined lens with both
of these conceptual frameworks.

103
All interview participants stated that they use all of the different leadership frames
in various situations in their work as chief librarians. Chief Librarian B explained:
Probably a little bit of each, I would say…somewhere in the political and
human resource frames. I really try to be an advocate, both for the library,
but also the employees as well, and definitely a catalyst for change...I
guess I have some charismatic aspects in myself, which I don't necessarily
see that well. But others have said that. That would move it more into the
symbolic frame, but I don't typically see myself in that (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief librarian D reflected:
I'm all of those. I don't know that I rely on one particular one. I think part
of my role as leader is to figure out when to use what, and to be able to
switch frames and to embody all of those things. I think that I have
continually had to be all of those things every single year I've been dean.
The prophet or the poet [symbolic frame] doesn’t come out very often
(personal communication, February 2014).
Chief librarians were able to apply the leadership frames to their work and they felt that
effective leaders need to use different leadership frames depending on the challenge that
they are facing. Similar to the organizational frames, most of the chief librarians thought
that there was not one organizational culture that fit their library. Chief Librarian A
explained:
There's not one that nails it…There are people in the building who are
highly flexible and there are people in the building who are not very
flexible…I'd like to think [we have] more of an external focus. I think the
whole college is pretty much student-focused. We have meetings and
discuss things. It's always what is this going to do for the students? Then
when it comes to something that directly affects somebody's job, that's
when the barriers go up (personal communication, January 2014).
In the Chief Librarian A interview data coding, there were many instances of hierarchy
with a very structured and controlled environment as evidenced by their organizational
structure with a dean and multiple staff supervisors and some library staff unwilling or

104
unhappy to perform public services duties. At the same time, the faculty librarians
exhibited clan characteristics by working well together as a team with high commitment
to student-centered library services.
After exposure to the competing values framework, Chief Librarian D was
surprised that many of their organizational culture characteristics fell under hierarchy and
then reflected:
It's very interesting to me that among [the classified staff], there is a sense
of hierarchy as in the Tech III’s ruling. They're the ruling class, lording it
over the Tech I’s. They definitely take that status very seriously. I recently
had one Tech III tell me, “I worked my way up from a student worker to
Library Technician III so I would never have to do the work of a Tech I. I
shouldn't have to do low-level work (personal communication, February
2014).
On the other hand, Chief Librarian D felt that the library faculty as a group was between
clan and adhocracy cultures because “they are more flexible and they're very
sophisticated in being able to focus internally on what needs to happen and always
keeping an eye on external.” Chief Librarian D also shared the opinion that the library
should be more of a market culture to compete for resources and demonstrate the value of
the library to the college. Similar to the organizational culture of Chief Librarian A, this
library culture was also segmented by faculty and staff roles.
Chief Librarian C thought their library culture was also a mixture between a clan
with a collaborative culture and hierarchy with their strong internal focus:
I think we do a fair amount of collaborating really. I think we operate a
little bit like a clan, like a family. That’s part of the flatness and we work
well tougher but we quickly end up relying on control and hierarchy
whenever this is not working. I do think we are too internally
focused…We are certainly a blend. If I had to pick one. I think we’re
[hierarchy] mostly because I think not correctly but again because of

105
workload. It’s not a conscious decision to turn inward (personal
communication, January 2014).
Although this library had a strong clan organizational culture, it had moved more to a
hierarchy due to loss of library technician and librarian positions as well as additional
duties added to the library manager’s position. Chief Librarian C also stated that the
library should aspire to more of an adhocracy organizational culture to meet the needs of
students and the college.
Alternatively, Chief Librarian B immediately characterized their organization as
an adhocracy with a strong external focus and embracing the campus community:
We’re flexible and outward looking. I mean certainly there are inflexible
parts. Don't get me wrong…Over the last eight years we've done a lot of
things differently. We've really changed and adapted and applied new
ideas and directions for the library. If you're inflexible, you couldn't do
that. That why I think we're flexible. Then the outward looking, that's been
my mantra that we need to look out into our college community as who
we're responding to and why we're here… Also being able to reach out
and invite participation and input to make it a welcoming place (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian B also shared that there were inflexible individuals in the organization
but the culture had shifted with “key retirements” and hiring of new librarians with a high
level of commitment and openness to innovative practices.
The competing values that chief librarians identified for their libraries are
summarized in Table 10. In the following section, the combined competing values
framework and multi-frame organizational conceptual frameworks were used to analyze
leadership perspectives more in-depth and generate themes on chief librarian lived
experiences.

Lived experiences
Structural frame / Hierarchy culture. A core premise of the structural perspective
is that “clear, well-understood roles and relationships and adequate coordination are key
to how well an organization performs (Bolman and Deal, 2003, p.44).” With very
different types of administrative and leadership roles in the community college libraries,
it is important to examine administrative practices for efficacy. Many themes emerged
from the chief librarian experiences relating to the structural frame or hierarchy culture
including (1) supervision, (2) faculty or administrative roles for chief librarians, and (3)
preferred or alternate structures.
Hierarchies are characterized by “clear lines of decision-making authority,
standardized rules and procedures, control, and accountability mechanisms” (Cameron
and Quinn, 2011, p.42). Many personnel and library issues were attributed to unclear
roles and lack of authority for supervision by chief librarians. Chief Librarian A was a
faculty department chair that worked closely with classified staff that report to a separate
classified staff supervisor (administrative) that does not have a librarian background
(MLS degree):
Librarians do not supervise, and that's an issue. You probably have come
across it before, that while the librarians are ultimately responsible for the
services, resources, and so on in the library, we don't supervise the staff

107
that do the day-to-day work in those areas. We sort of direct their work in
a way, but we are not their ultimate supervisors (personal communication,
January 2014).
In the library of Chief Librarian A, the roles and duties of the organization were very
clear however, there were many personnel issues (e.g. apathy, inflexible to new ideas)
that were attributed to lack of supervision and accountability. It was also surmised that
personnel issues could be related to staff supervisor lack of library knowledge and
experience.
Similar to Chief Librarians A and C, the Chief Librarian D expanded on why
faculty librarians cannot assign work to or supervise classified staff at their college:
The classified union is very, very strident in their view that faculty do not
supervise classified staff. This is a very sore point of contention between
the faculty group and the classified group. The classified union leadership
position is that only managers can directly supervise classified staff. This
is problematic for the institution in a number of ways. Generically
speaking, a manager, a dean would not necessarily have the technical
know-how to be able to give assignments to the classified staff
member…If a librarian were to give classified staff a project, that's
considered a no-no under sort of union perspective…Do we do it here? Of
course, we do. It's under my knowledge and direct instruction giving. The
librarians come to me and talk about what are the things that need to be
done and I turn around and give it to the classified staff member, and ask
the two now to work together. My way of dealing with that is by creating
effective teams of faculty and staff, with faculty as leaders. I really
articulate the faculty's role vis-a-vis the classified which is the faculty are
the leaders (personal communication, February 2014).
Unlike Chief Librarian A’s administrative structure, Chief Librarian D did not have a
library classified staff supervisor (administrative) role and as the dean, worked closely
with librarians to assign work to classified staff and form teams of librarians and staff to
work on projects.

108
Alternatively, Chief Librarian B was a faculty library director that has
supervision of classified staff members as part of their job duties.
I know that some campuses in the system say that faculty cannot
supervisor anybody. They can't supervise classified employees or faculty.
But that's not the case on our campus anywhere. A lot of faculty
supervised classified employees. You might have a department chair in the
sciences, like the geology department chair, she supervises two lab
assistants that are classified staff and writes their evaluation. It's not just a
library issue for us. It's not even an issue. Faculty on campus supervise
and evaluate classified employees. The union has not raised an issue with
it, ever (personal communication, January 2014)
Chief Librarian B shared that their college legal advisors interpret California educational
code (Title V) differently from the college districts that do not allow faculty to supervise
others. With the ability and responsibility to supervise, direct, and evaluate librarians and
staff, Chief Librarian B addressed personnel issues, disciplined staff when needed, and
had the authority to shape their behavior.
Faculty or administrator role for chief librarians. In the last few decades there
has been a shift from dedicated library managers and administrative chief librarians to
library managers with a wide range of responsibilities and some faculty chief librarians
(CCL Directory, 2014). Many library leaders in the California Community Colleges
system and the statewide academic senate have argued that an academic or instructional
administrator should oversee the day-to-day operations of the library. Although Chief
Librarians C and D were academic administrators, they had supervisory duties for other
areas in addition to the library. The only chief librarian that had reasonable oversight for
the daily operations of the library was Chief Librarian B but this was in a faculty library
director capacity.

109
Chief Librarian B did not agree that an administrator was the best role to manage
a library and argued that a faculty member could be just as effective in meeting library
goals and mission:
…You can be a dean and have no ability to impact the mission of the
library because of who you are and how you advocate or don't advocate.
You could be a faculty member who is totally knowledgeable and
passionate and articulate and be able to have a huge impact on the mission
of the library. I think leaders can come from either place. Leadership
doesn't have to be assigned or tied to a title or a role in an organization…I
think that a faculty member can impact the mission and the direction of
the library just as equally as an administrator (personal communication,
January 2014).
In contrast, Chief Librarian D agreed that a manager should supervise the library due to
legal ramifications, commenting:
I think there are distinct advantages, necessary advantages, to having a
management title. That is because Ed Code, say federal laws governing
work like labor laws, or labor code, or enforcing contracts, and things like
that, you have to have a manager. That authority needs to be bona fide
given to that person. Faculty don't occupy that role no matter what
operationally they might be designated or assigned to do. They don't have
that institutional power. And when does that get revealed? Grievances and
lawsuits… libraries really need to be run by managers, to be
complemented by strong faculty leadership. It's not mutually exclusive
(personal communication, February 2014).
Chief Librarian D was in a district in which faculty do not supervise staff whereas Chief
Librarian B was a faculty library director that did have bona fide supervisory duties. It is
evident that there is different interpretation of labor laws and educational code by college
districts within the CCC system.
Preferred administrative structure. All chief librarian participants shared their
past and current administrative practices and reflected on their preferred administrative
structure based on manager and library effectiveness. Two of the chief librarians, A and

110
C, stated a preference for a dedicated library manager with a library background for their
organization. Chief Librarian C shared:
The history has been the former library director and resisted doing
anything but running a library never let them consider changing the name
of the library to the learning resource center and never wanted to take over
AV and media, which was great. A college needs a library and she was the
library director…It’s still the model that I would prefer (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian A preferred an instructional dean with a MLS but shared another
administrative scenario for their library:
Maybe a decent situation would be to…have a dean that might be over the
library, but then have a strong library administrator, like an associate dean,
who does have a library background because there's so much to the library
background. Those outside of the profession aren’t aware of that (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian D agreed that dedicated leadership for the library was needed however,
there was no preference for a faculty or administrative role and no emphasis on a
librarian background:
I envy the libraries that have dedicated leadership. Dedicated meaning
singularly hired just to run the library whether it's in the faculty role or
administrative role… I need to be more focused on the library, to have
more time to focus on…personnel issues. The day-to-day management of
staff members and librarians…I don't think any unit runs itself. There are
people who need to direct the operations. Otherwise, it just becomes an
operation that just responds and reacts to the day-to-day. Then where is
the leadership for vision, planning, assessment, accountability, report
writing, to even cobble together the evidence to demonstrate there's some
thoughtful planning and implementation going on (personal
communication, February 2014).
In contrast, Chief Librarian B argued that their college’s library director faculty role had
been beneficial to their library’s ability to develop strong relationships with faculty across
the college:

111
I think that the relationships that I'm able to cultivate and maintain on
campus with the faculty are much more significant and stronger because
I'm a fellow faculty. There's no like, perceived discriminations, us and
them sort of approach. But it also allows me to be integrated into a faculty
structure, being as I go to curriculum committee as a participant if I want
to, and other senate type committees, instructional technology, etc.
Organizationally, I think that's been really beneficial for us as a library and
our ability to cultivate relationships with discipline specific faculty.
Obviously it benefits me because I have the shorter contract than an
administrator does…The weird part is my pay is the same as all the other
librarians…I don't get paid anything extra for being a library director, but
it's my primary responsibility (personal communication, January 2014)
At the same time, Chief Librarian B brought up issues of salary equity performing
administrative duties but not being compensated additionally for them. Overall, all the
chief librarians preferred dedicated leadership for the library although there were varying
preferences between faculty and administrator roles and librarian background. All chief
librarians shared a preference for libraries to be under Academic Affairs or Instruction in
college organization.
Human resources frame / Clan culture. The human resources frame highlights
development of the individual to meet organizational needs. In clan cultures, the
environment is “…managed by teamwork and employee development…to empower
employees and facilitative their participation, commitment, and loyalty” (Cameron and
Quinn, 2011, p.46). Chief librarian participants spoke about teamwork in the library,
collaborative leadership, and shared governance, decision-making between
administrators, faculty, and staff.
All of the chief librarian participants shared that their library faculty worked as a
team. Some expressed concerns that staff had issues working together or with faculty.
Chief Librarian A, in a faculty role, shared examples of librarian collaboration in regular

112
meetings and proposals for changes that will be highlighted in the shared governance
section. Chief Librarian D fostered working relationships between librarians and shared
opinions on effective change management:
What it takes to do well in a management position and in shepherding an
organization through different kinds of changes demands, I think, a
collaborative style. To implement the practices of effective leadership
takes time and you can't do it sitting at your desk writing a bunch of emails. You have to talk to people and work with them. You have to
brainstorm solutions together. You have to confront issues together so that
people feel like, yeah, you really get this (personal communication,
January 2014).
Chief Librarian C spoke about how they support and empower others to succeed:
[I] definitely manage ways to support and try to create a context for other
people to succeed or implement what they’re trying to do. Yeah but also
providing a piece of technology that they need to be empowered to
accomplish what they want (personal communication, January 2014)
Chief Librarian B, in a faculty role, talked about feeling supported by their supervisor
while also having autonomy:
I have a great dean who is super supportive…she doesn't give hardly any
oversight. Now I know that she has to give more oversight to some other
departments, but she sees in me and in our library, that she doesn't have to
do that with us. I can go to her and say...this is what I want to do. This is
the direction we should go. And this is why." And she's like, "Great, just
make sure I understand it so I can explain it to the [the vice president]."
She doesn’t question it at all because she trusts my role in that job
(personal communication, January 2014).
Chief librarian participants spoke about the importance of collaboration within the library
to accomplish work and to make effective decisions. Additionally, chief librarians
discussed the importance of external collaboration and relationships.
All participants were active in shared governance, collaborative decision making
between faculty, staff, and administration, as a way to contribute to their colleges and

113
advocate for the library externally. Many chief librarians had campus leadership roles
such as a chair of shared governance committees, being a primary investigator for a grant,
and/or being an officer in the faculty or management groups. Chief Librarian B described
the decision-making for faculty members through shared governance:
For faculty, your avenue for decision making is the faculty academic
senate. For faculty in the library, that should always be their avenue
course. If library faculty wanted have something occur or a decision to be
made, or a policy to be addressed, they should take it to the academic
senate…That should be their voice to the administration. That's the
appropriate route. Doesn't mean that they can't talk to their dean about it
too…If they have a need they can go through the academic senate
procedure, which in my opinion is a much more ... A better method,
because it's more inclusive, broader, it involves more people. It has
support; it has the weight of the senate on it, as opposed to just going to a
dean and trying to work it that way. Again, it depends on whether it’s
fiscal or structural or facility, or whatever (personal communication,
January 2014)
Chief Librarian A provided a specific example of librarians working as a team to
advocate for additional positions with a program review shared governance committee:
After the last program review, the librarians noticed that it was hard for us
to compete for positions because others out there didn’t understand what
we did… You're asking me here for these kinds of statistics and metrics,
and so on." How many students on a waitlist? We don’t have a waitlist.
How many FTE generating income? We can't do that. We need to be able
to compete. How can we do that?…We the librarians met together and
said, "What do they see from us? They see us at the reference desk. Those
that bring classes in see us do that. Other than that, do they even know?"
So, we put together this whole document - collection development. You
are responsible for 10 programs on campus. You need to be familiar with
so that you can order materials for, so that you can liaise with their faculty,
so that you can help their students who might be having issues, so that you
can evaluate the databases that go there. Then, there are the databases.
There are a lot of them coming along. We have to determine the best
ones…We just laid it all out (personal communication, January 2014)
Chief Librarian D described participation in shared governance as a manager and in a
recommending role.

114
As the co-chair of the X committee, I co-chair it with a faculty
[coordinator] with reassigned time… in terms of shared governance; we
might work with the committee to come with resolutions or
recommendations. Our resolutions are through the Academic Senate.
Technically, managers aren't supposed to co-write resolutions. Any faculty
member can write a resolution. There are six or seven faculty on the
committee. They can work on that. I feel really privileged that somehow,
that managers on this campus, there's good collaborative, mutually
respectful work relationship between the faculty and the managers. There
is an expectation that we give input together because in the end, our
resolution needs to be carried out. It has to be implementable. Managers
need to weigh in on that. I feel really good that my opinions are valued.
My perspective is valued… I find that incredibly gratifying because there's
been a string of evidence of my being influential in those processes
(personal communication, February 2014)
It is important for chief librarians, as well as library faculty and staff, to actively
participate in shared governance for information, advocacy for resources, and to be
college community members. Chief Librarian B comments that library faculty can impact
decision-making by engaging in shared governance processes:
I think that our college is such a great, unique environment, that we have a
very collaborative, open, engaged, administrative faculty relationship. I
know that's not the case on a lot of other campuses it seems because
librarians complain about how awful things are…I push my way into other
ways of being engaged with the college and the decision making…I go to
all the meetings. I'm involved in all the budgetary discussions and
decisions and stuff…You get what you put into it (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarians B and D both emphasized positive relationships across their colleges but
this may not be the case for other institutions. Having strong, collaborative relationships
outside of the library can garner support for chief librarians in a political environment.
Political frame / Market culture. The political frame is simply “the realistic
process of making decisions and allocating resources in a context of scarcity and
divergent interests” (Bolman and Deal, 2003, p. 181) and the market culture is one

115
characterized by competition. All participants revealed ongoing concern about the need
for dedicated library leadership that are inherent with reduced staffing and resources for
community college libraries. Political/market themes that arose were need to garner
external support, effective advocacy, and feelings of marginalization.
Chief Librarian C discussed perception that the library is an expensive college
enterprise and described significant staffing reductions with state budget cuts.
I’ve definitely been told the library is expensive, while successful and
much appreciated by campus. We weren’t called out but we fully
participated in around personnel reduction since the 2009 state crisis. We
lost significant full-time retirees that were told flat out was not going to be
replaced and then another position cut in half (personal communication,
January 2014).
Also addressing the cost of running libraries, Chief Librarian B commented that libraries
need to demonstrate their value to garner external support from administration.
I think for community colleges, the libraries, I think the biggest challenge
has to do with being able to advocate for their value, demonstrate their
value in terms of gaining the continued support of the administration
(personal communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian D spoke about being an effective advocate as the division dean in
getting staff positions and faculty members noting their “killer political instincts.” Chief
Librarian A shared an example of successful funding increase for library electronic
databases through administrator relationships:
Several years ago, we had a certain budget for databases. We had gotten it
for years and it was not very much. At the time, our chief administrative
officer was on good terms with our dean. When the librarians would meet
with the dean, we would say, "All these new products are coming along,
but we can't take advantage of them without cancelling something else.
This was before program review really took off. He was able to work out,
essentially, a doubling of that budget, which was great (personal
communication, January 2014).

116
Although some chief librarians felt that they were able to garner external support and
resources for the library, all participants expressed a need for staffing including faculty
librarians, classified staff, or additional managers. Furthermore, the importance of the
library and the complexity of the organization were not widely recognized.
A sense of marginalization of librarians and library leaders statewide was a
reoccurring theme with Chief Librarian B observing:
I think there's a certain level of, maybe even despair, among our
profession in this state. It's really sad sometimes to go to our state-wide
organization meetings, our dean and directors meeting because I think that
some of them, they don't feel empowered or supported (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian D offered rationale for the negative sentiments:
There's a deep-seeded frustration of not being properly accorded, the
stature, the resources to be able to run libraries (personal communication,
February 2014).
Chief Librarian A also felt that libraries are not accorded importance as evidenced by the
addition of duties to managers in charge of the library and there is a perception that
anyone can manage a library:
I just find that very discouraging that, in some cases, even though the
person being recruited will be in charge of the library, there's nothing
about the library in the job advertisement. As I said, we're seeing more and
more of the dean positions going to non-librarians, and partly, because
they're piling on all this other stuff. I think those making those decisions
are just not understanding how much is involved in running a library.
They think anybody can do that. We want this person to do the online
instruction and the campus-computing infrastructure and stuff like that.
Adding on to the point where…I don’t know. There are not many
librarians that have all of those skills. It's like the library piece drops off in
importance (personal communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian C spoke on an institutional level about how the library is declining due to
reduced staffing resources:

117
I can point a variety of ways where this library is already slowly going
from some state-wide leadership role to a library that handles the basics
and has a hard time being sure that we are excellent and handling the load
of even keeping the building running well, looking nice, providing
reference, providing some instruction. We can handle all that but we will
settle at a lower level of operation (personal communication, January
2014).
These concerns about resources influence participants’ view of the effectiveness of their
libraries to meet their mission and goals to support student learning in an environment
with reduced resources and competition for funding. Chief Librarian B emphasized the
important of demonstrating the value of the library as a way to advocate for staffing
while also keeping a holistic perspective of college community needs in mind regarding
resources.
Symbolic frame / Adhocracy culture. From the symbolic perspective,
organizations can develop a culture that gives purpose and meaning to work (Bolman and
Deal, 1991). Adhocracy cultures are characterized as dynamic, entrepreneurial, and
creative (Cameron and Quinn, 2011). The symbolic frame was identified as being used
less than the other frames by chief librarians due to lack of time, leadership style, and
comfort with the concept. In analysis of interviews, the researcher found many
applications of the symbolic frame and adhocracy culture.
Chief Librarian B shared the external focus that is promoted in their college
library, using library faculty and staff as a symbol for the library:
When we're walking around the campus, they're not seeing you as a
person; they're seeing you as someone in the library. I represent the library
when I walk around campus When people think of the library, they're not
thinking about that building with the flags in front of it, they're thinking
about [librarians, staff], or whoever they've come in personal contact with.
They're not thinking about the building. I think that that's a real key
element to outward viewpoints (personal communication, January 2014).

118

Chief Librarian D commented on leadership by appealing to a higher purpose:
I prefer it to inspire the ideal in every person. The person that's going to
say, really I should be doing this or that better or differently. We have a
higher calling. There's a moral imperative to what we do. What we do is
for students (personal communication, February 2014).
Although the chief librarians were not comfortable with the symbolic frame or
identifying themselves as charismatic leaders or inspiring, the importance of this type of
leadership was recognized. The flexibility and external focus of adhocracy culture was
embraced by Chief Librarian B as a way to garner support for the library.
It could be argued that the credential to serve as a professional librarian, the
Master’s in Library Science degree, is a powerful symbol to librarians. The MLS degree
from an American Library Association accredited program is listed as a requirement in
librarian job postings but not in many administrative positions overseeing the library.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that in addition to having dedicated library managers in the
past, community college libraries were administered by manager that had education and
experience of a librarian. However, there are many current chief librarians in California
that do not possess the MLS degree and have not worked as professional librarians (CCL
Directory, 2014). All chief librarian participants revealed whether they thought a MLS
was needed for effective leadership of a library.
Although Chief Librarian A shared examples of effective non-MLS chief
librarians in other community colleges, they felt strongly that a librarian-manager would
be the most effective advocate for their college library:
If it's a librarian who's in charge of the library, there's less that you have to
explain. We've spent a lot of time, not just with administrators, but with
other faculty letting them know and justifying what we do…With that

119
background and grounding in libraries, then they could better help with
things like outreach, talk to faculty about what we do and so on (personal
communication, January 2014).
Chief Librarian B observed that there may be resentment to having a leader that is not a
librarian but put a greater importance on managerial skills in communication, trust, and
relationship building than on a librarian background.
If you look at a dean role, it's mainly about relationships and communication. If
you know how to do those things, how to trust the people that do their work, how
to build relationships with the people doing their work, and the people who your
public is, and can listen and communicate those things effectively, it doesn't
matter if you’re a librarian or not (personal communication, January 2014).
For their unique situation, Chief Librarian C shared that a manager that was a librarian
was the best scenario however, it was more important for libraries to have adequate
overall staffing than a librarian-manager to be successful.
I think the library is a special place and it takes someone with a wide open
view. The more I’m sitting here though the more I think the success is
really dependent on adequate and effective personnel resources devoted to
the library. It’s not ultimately so much about who’s sitting in the position
and what degrees they have but that they have the people to do the work,
whether it’s the manager or the librarian; they have adequate resources to
pull it off. A lot of people can do it (personal communication, January
2014).
Chief Librarian C also brought up trust, collaboration, and communication as
characteristics of an exceptional leader. For a manager without a librarian background, a
commitment to libraries, student services, and technology would be important. The only
chief librarian participant without a library background, Chief Librarian D, shared their
experience and opinion on whether a MLS should be a requirement for library
administrators:
I don't feel any pushback at all because I've not been a librarian…I think
that I've been really open about that. I’ve said to the staff and librarians

120
from day one “I do not pretend to have any knowledge about running a
library. That's why my seeking information from you is genuine…I have
had librarians say to me that they find it now directly relevant the fact that
I don't have a [MLS] because I have brought other skill sets to bear,
strengthen the role of my librarians.
[For a future leader], I would hope that the library faculty and staff would
put things in the job description that then allow them to ask interview
questions to then ferret out the kind of leader they need and want that they
consider minimal standards in someone who's walking in. One of the
questions that the college has to ask is if that person has to have an [MLS]
as a part of the minimum qual. I don't know what the answer is (personal
communication, February 2014)
Chief Librarian D thought that librarians and staff appreciated their consultative,
collaborative work approach and interest in the library and information field.
Furthermore, the librarians valued their acknowledgement of their expertise in day-to-day
operations and policy making for the library.
In summary, four chief librarians were interviewed to determine the current
administrative practices of their libraries and to examine their experiences as chief
librarians using a combined competing values and multi-frame organizational model.
Current administrative practices for the day-to-day supervision of the library varied
although none of the participants had a dedicated library manager. The efficacy of their
administrative structures was discussed and preferred models were shared. All
participants had similar duties as representatives to the statewide association, Council of
Chief Librarians. The leadership perspectives of the chief librarians also varied and the
main themes that emerged were supervision (structural/hierarchy); collaboration and
shared governance (human resources/clan); lack of resources and
representation/marginalization (political/market); and credentialed librarian-managers

121
(symbolic/adhocracy). In the next section, implications of the study results will be
discussed.
Discussion
This qualitative study explored the experience of four chief librarians in the
California Community Colleges system including the administrative practices at their
respective libraries. The findings of this study were presented relative to the research
questions and using a combined competing values and organizational change conceptual
framework was used for analysis. The findings will be considered in the context of the
literature review and will continue with implications for leadership. Furthermore,
limitations for the study and future areas of research will be suggested.
Administrative practices. The study showed that current library administrative
practices at the four community colleges varied widely by analyzing the role, title,
education, and areas of supervision of the chief librarians. However, all the libraries had
similar college organization with an instructional or academic dean with formal authority
of the library. The two administrative chief librarians had formal authority of the library;
the two faculty chief librarians did not. Although the faculty director had day-to-day and
long-term oversight responsibilities for library, they reported to an academic dean of
multiple areas that included the library.
Gregg Atkins, the executive director of the Council of Chief Librarians, provided
anecdotal evidence that most community college libraries had dedicated library managers
(administrative positions with the library and/or learning resource center as areas of
responsibility) but there has been a trend moving away from this in the last few decades

122
(personal communication, March 7, 2014). Three of the four chief librarians worked at
community colleges with a dedicated library manager in the recent past and offered
rationale for the change in administrative practices including budgetary reductions,
college managerial gaps, ineffective leadership, bolstering of status, and the perception
that the library does not require significant management. A review of job advertisements
of community college administrators responsible for libraries also supports the trend of
fewer dedicated library managers.
The impact of not having dedicated library managers in the library varied among
the chief librarian participants. Most of the participants (Chief Librarians A, C, and D)
had a preference for a dedicated library manager whether through an additional
administrator to their current structure or removing responsibilities from the current
administrator responsible for the library. Reasons cited were that libraries are complex
organizations (especially large libraries) requiring significant administration and
managerial time was “diluted” such that there was insufficient time to attend to personnel
issues and to innovate. Without adequate administrative staffing, community college
library services and student support could decline.
However, Chief Librarian B in a faculty library director role felt that their
administrative structure had benefitted the library to develop strong relationships with
faculty across the college and that the dean with library oversight provided adequate
support for the library. It is important to note that Chief Librarian B had staff supervisory
and other administrative duties as a faculty director and that most chief librarians that are
in faculty department chair roles may not have the authority to oversee library operations.
In a review of the Council of Chief Librarians directory, more than half of the chief

123
librarians at California community colleges are faculty department chairs (CCL
Directory, 2014). Chief Librarian A, the faculty department chair, expressed that lack of
supervisory authority was an issue in their library and will be further addressed in the
discussion of chief librarian experiences.
Chief librarian interview themes. The study confirmed that all participants had
similar duties as representatives to the statewide association, Council of Chief Librarians
(CCL). The interviews also revealed that there are no clear guidelines on designation of
chief librarians at institutions (i.e. by role, duties, or possession of Master’s in Library
Science) or active outreach when positions are vacant.
Six themes on the experience of chief librarians were distilled from the data using
a combined competing values and multi-frame leadership lens including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Supervision (structural/hierarchy)
Collaboration (human resources/clan)
Shared governance (human resources/clan)
Lack of resources (political/market)
Marginalization (political/market)
Credentialed librarian-managers (symbolic/adhocracy)

These consistent themes emerged from interviews with four chief librarians and the
impact of these findings will be discussed.
Supervision. Bolman and Deal (2003) argue that reorganizing or restructuring is
a powerful but high-risk tool that can produce confusion, resistance, and a decline in
effectiveness in the short-term. It was previously presented that administrative practices
had changed in all of the participant libraries in their time working at the college
including role and responsibility of the administrator responsible for the library.
Restructuring and reorganizing had different impacts on the effectiveness of chief

124
participant libraries. Supervision was a structural frame/hierarchy theme that emerged in
interviews.
Hierarchies are characterized by “clear lines of decision-making authority,
standardized rules and procedures, control, and accountability mechanisms” (Cameron
and Quinn, 2011, p.42). Structural issues can occur without clear roles and
responsibilities. Chief Librarian A, a faculty department chair, had an administrative
structure that included a division dean of multiple areas including the library as well as
classified (non-academic) staff supervisors. Although the faculty librarians had
responsibility for library policies and operations, they did not have supervisory authority
in shaping the work and behavior of staff. Many staff personnel issues were not
addressed and it was difficult for librarians to get staff buy-in for new ideas and/or
changes in services. Faculty also did not supervise staff at the colleges of Chief
Librarians C and D due to union/collective bargaining positions.
Alternatively, Chief Librarian B was also in a faculty role as a library director
and was able to assign work to and discipline staff if needed due to a different
interpretation of California educational code (Title V) by their college. The inability of
faculty to supervise classified staff in libraries, especially when there is not a dedicated
library administrator, is commonly cited as a source of personnel issues due to lack of
accountability and/or knowledge about library operations and management.
Chief Librarian C shared an example at another college in their district that
experienced library personnel issues after a restructuring (losing a layer of management
as the librarians report directly to the Vice-President of Instruction) and how they

125
addressed faculty supervisory issues in an environment in which faculty do not supervise
classified staff:
At [X] college, they don’t really have an official manager. One of their
librarians has been given temporarily 20% release time to play the role of
library director. I only bring it up if that came as a result of a major
discipline problem with their library assistants and the three faculty
librarians had no way of fixing the problem. It took several years to
unravel. With that little sliver of change of status, it has given her some
authority to evaluate and discipline and so on because of this problem. The
faculty here in our district are not given the authority to discipline
classified staff or evaluate. Because she’s been given 20% release time
from her faculty role and hired 20% in this managerial role (personal
communication, January 2014).
Although this hybrid 80% faculty and 20% management position provided bona fide
authority for a librarian to supervise and discipline classified staff, Chief Librarian C
acknowledged that there were workload issues as 7-8 hours/week of release time from
faculty duties was probably not enough time to for an individual to manage a library.
Although Chief Librarian B, the faculty library director, occasionally performed library
duties, their main job duties were to administer and manage the library.
As restructuring and reorganizing is occurring at community college libraries, it is
important to consider the implications of not having a dedicated library manager.
Although there are cost savings to removing or adding additional duties to a library
administrator, there can be increased personnel issues, overload of duties, and lowered
overall effectiveness of libraries. There is much variation amongst colleges statewide by
size, union/collective bargaining environment, existing personnel issues, and other factors
and thus, the administrative practice of not having a dedicated library manager should not
be considered the standard for all California Community Colleges.

126
Collaboration and shared governance. Internal and external collaboration
themes were distilled from interviews as classified under human resources/clan culture
because of relationship building and working in teams. Chief librarian participants spoke
about teamwork in the library, collaborative leadership, and shared governance, decisionmaking between administrators, faculty, and staff. Many of the chief librarians identified
clan culture among their librarians or their library organization as a whole and valued
collaborative leadership as way to support and empower others within the library.
Externally, all of the chief librarians were active in shared governance, the process for
collaborative decision-making between faculty, staff, and administration on a college.
Many participants had campus leadership roles in shared governance and stated
that this was a mechanism to contribute to the college community as a whole and
advocate for the library. Two chief librarians, A and B, mentioned that faculty librarians
worked on and presented relevant library policies, such as collection development and
copyright, to bodies such as the Academic Senate for endorsement and in doing so,
educated college faculty on the complexity and importance of library faculty work in
supporting student learning. Internal and external collaboration and relationship building
is important to build coalitions of support, especially in an environment of reduced
funding.
Lack of resources and marginalization. In the political frame of organizations
and market cultures, there is competition for scarce resources including budgets for
staffing and supplies as well as time. As previously discussed, none of the participants
had dedicated managerial leadership and many attributed this partially to college-wide
budget and staffing reductions. All participants identified needs for additional staffing

127
and expressed difficultly in attaining additional or replacement classified staff, librarians,
and/or administrators.
Overload of work duties was a common theme across all chief librarians, the
sense of not having enough time to carry out their duties. Some chief librarians had
reductions of staff and had not hired a new position in many years and the work had been
redistributed. With the administrative chief librarians supervising multiple areas and time
constraints, they noted a shift of day-to-day operational duties that had resided with
managers going to faculty librarians. Faculty chief librarians also noted a shift
administrative workload to them and insufficient staffing for library operations.
Since the publication of the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL) report on The Value of Academic Libraries in 2010, there has been a national
conversation for academic libraries to show their contribution to institutional missions
and goals. To successfully advocate for library resources, Chief Librarians B and D spoke
about the importance to garner external support for the library by demonstrating the
connection between the library and student learning. Chief Librarian D shared that with
wide campus support of the library, they had recently received a growth faculty librarian
position despite a small number of total faculty positions. However, they had not been
able to argue for an increase of electronic database budgets despite rising annual costs.
Most of the chief librarians felt that they had influence in their organizations and
were “at the table” where decision-making that impacted the library occurred. At the
same time, the chief librarians did not have adequate time, staffing, and/or budget for
information resources for the library. These findings are supported by the results found in
the Diablo Valley College survey (2013) in which the majority of library managers felt

128
they had influence but faced challenges with the amount of workload and needed
additional time for their job duties.
It is also important to note that although most respondents in the Diablo Valley
College library manager survey mentioned lack of resources as a challenge for their
library, particularly in staffing, a high majority (82%) of the respondents thought that
their current library administrative structure was effective. However, the results cannot be
extrapolated for all California Community Colleges as participants had different roles
(administrators and faculty, chief librarians and others). Furthermore, the administrative
structures of the survey respondents varied widely from dedicated library administrators,
to faculty department chairs serving as chief librarians, to non-MLS deans of multiple
areas, etc. To apply survey findings to California Community Colleges, it would be
necessary to (a) categorize the types of administrative structures, (b) survey participants
by their roles, and (c) obtain a representative sample to measure the perception of
effectiveness of administrative structures in the CCC libraries.
The chief librarian key informants spoke about the common sentiment of
marginalization that was felt in community college libraries statewide without the needed
resources to run libraries. Furthermore, chief librarians addressed the frustrations that
some feel with non-librarians managing libraries, administrators without the library
credential of a Master’s in Library Science and experience as a librarian. As a chief
librarian attending statewide meetings and active in the CCL-Libraries listserv, I have
repeatedly heard librarians and library leaders express that they do not feel like they can
impact the funding, resources, and hiring of MLS-holding administrators for their
libraries.

129
Credentialed-librarian managers. The Master’s in Library Science (MLS) is the
terminal degree for professional librarians and is a standard minimum qualification in job
advertisements within California colleges and universities and nationwide. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that in addition to having dedicated library administrators in the past,
community college libraries were administered by full-time managers without areas
outside of the library or learning resources center that had education and experience of a
librarian. However, there are many current chief librarians in California that do not
possess the MLS degree and have not worked as professional librarians (CCL Directory,
2014) and more than half of current job advertisements for administrators in charge of a
library may not have the MLS as a requirement nor a preferred degree.
It is not clear why the trend is to not require a MLS for an administrator in charge
of the library. College administrators and others responsible for drafting recruitment ads
may not see Library Science as a unique discipline with specific knowledge that is
required to manage a library. Alternatively, it is likely difficult to hire effective
administrators with the ability and experience to oversee multiple areas in addition to the
library. With a MLS requirement, the hiring pool is limited to librarian candidates and
probably smaller.
Among the chief librarians that had served as librarians, the MLS was preferred or
strongly desired for library leaders but was not identified as a necessity. Many of the
chief librarians shared experiences with previous library managers with a MLS that were
not strong or effective library leaders. The chief librarians spoke about the importance of
strong managerial skills required to run libraries and attributes of successful library

130
leaders. “Soft” skills such as advocacy, communication, listening, trust, and building
relationships were highlighted when discussing leadership perspectives.
Although the library background was considered helpful, providing “grounding”
for library administrators, all of the chief librarians were able to identify individual
administrators without a MLS that were strong library leaders. Many community college
colleagues express frustration that their non-MLS dean does not understand what
librarians do and cannot adequately support them. In libraries without a MLS library
administrator, it was important for faculty librarians to be active in the day-to-day
operations of the library, for the administrator to foster teamwork between librarians and
classified staff, and for the administrator to have a genuine interest in libraries.
In my experiences as a faculty librarian working with MLS and non-MLS deans, I
found that strong management skills complemented by library knowledge were needed
for effective leadership. Librarians that become chief librarians also need to develop
managerial soft skills and technical administrative knowledge such as budget
management and personnel management. As I transitioned into my first chief librarian
role with a public services librarian background, it was important for me to recognize that
libraries are complex and there was a great deal that I did not know about other areas of
the library such as cataloging, acquisitions, and systems. Not making assumptions, asking
questions, spending time learning, and trusting faculty and staff were key as a leader. Onthe-job and continued learning in libraries and leadership is needed for all library
managers whether or not they possess a MLS.

131
Conclusion
This study provided clarity about library administrative structures and leadership
perspectives of four chief librarians in the California Community Colleges. As a result of
this inquiry, other library leaders can benefit from the awareness that libraries are
complex and require dedicated administrative time to support student learning and
innovate. In addition to an in-depth look at administrative practices at the different
libraries, six themes on the experience of chief librarians (supervision, collaboration,
shared governance, lack of resources, marginalization, and credentialed library managers)
were identified using a combined competing values and organizational change conceptual
framework. With this knowledge, existing and future chief librarians, along with other
leaders, have additional resources to bolster their leadership practice. In addition,
decision-makers responsible for restructuring libraries can be better informed.
Limitations of the study. This study provided insight into chief librarians in the
CCC system and how library administrative practices may impact the ability for
organizations to meet their mission and goals. Although this system is the largest
community college system in the world, it may not be generalizable to all community
college systems. This study was not intended to make broad statements about library
administrative practices for all community colleges, but only within in California.
Furthermore, this study provided insights and opinions from four Chief Librarians on
library administrative practices and leadership perspectives. Instead, this study provided
through the experiences of four chief librarians, an in-depth account of leading libraries
in a public institution of higher education. The validity of the data collected have been

132
affected by the ability of the researcher to access the honesty and truthfulness of
participants.
The main limitation of the study is the bias I may have brought to this study as a
chief librarian and a dedicated library manager at my institution. Additionally, I possess
Master’s in Library Science and have worked as a faculty librarian. My position brings
context knowledge which can be a strength in understanding the context in which chief
librarians do their work. However, my lens could have impacted my ability to see beyond
my own experience. In order to maintain my objectivity, I frequently thought about the
research questions posed and talked with many chief librarians about this topic. I worked
to be conscious of my biases while conducting my research, being open to new
information and noting any information with which I disagreed. Furthermore, I employed
the strategy of member checks in order to corroborate my findings.
Areas for future research. This is one of the first studies to examine
administration and leadership of community college libraries. During the interviews,
participants expressed how much they valued the opportunity to reflect. Participants
found that hearing themselves explain their position, duties, and experiences gave them
new ideas and insight for future library administrative practices. There are many lines of
inquiry to further this research as many questions about library administrative practices still
exist. The chief librarian sample could be expanded to other types of administrative models
(ex. single librarian/chief librarian colleges, multi-district chief librarians, etc.)

With the statewide trend moving away from dedicated library managers and more
duties for administrators responsible for the library, it is important to study effective
administrative practices and library organizational models. Furthermore, if libraries are

133
increasingly administered by non-librarians (without a MLS), how does this impact
library operations and aspiring library leaders? How should library schools that operate
MLS programs approach this changing trend in their curriculum?
Concluding remarks. In California, the composition of community college
library leaders designated as chief librarians is changing. Although faculty librarians are
essential members of a library organization, they often lack formal authority by design
and support for administrative duties when in the role of department chair. A faculty
department chair may not have the ability to take disciplinary action involving another
faculty member as outlined in the faculty union contract. As chief librarians represent,
promote, and advance community college libraries, strong leadership is needed in each
college and across the state. Exceptional library leaders need strong management skills
including communication, collaboration, and trust, coupled with an appreciation for the
complexity and value of libraries.

CHAPTER V: DISCUSSION
The administration and leadership of community college libraries has
dramatically changed in the last few decades with college reorganizations and
restructuring. Traditional library organizations have a dedicated library administrator
with the library as a separate college or unit, reporting to a Vice-President (Born, et al.,
2000). This research shows that it has become common for California Community
College libraries to be managed by an administrator with a wide variety of duties, which
may include supervision of technology/online education or academic and/or college
programs. There has been a decrease in dedicated library administrators in the CCC
libraries and this trend may be occurring more widely.
Few empirical studies on academic library restructuring or reorganization exist
and little research has been conducted on community college library administration.
Previous studies illustrate the diverse and dynamic nature of organizational and
administrative practices in community college libraries (Born, et al. 2000; Diablo Valley
College, 2013). The person “in charge” of the library has a variety of titles,
responsibilities, educational background, and external reporting.
The purpose of this study was to examine library administrative practices and the
experience of chief librarians in the California Community College (CCC) system, the
largest higher education system in the nation comprised of 112 colleges. Using mixedmethods, this study investigated current administrative practices and the leadership
perspectives of chief librarians. A descriptive statistical analysis of Council of Chief
Librarian extant data and in-depth interviews of four chief librarians were conducted.
Leadership perspectives were analyzed using a combined competing values and

134

135
organizational change conceptual framework. In addition, job advertisements for
administrators responsible for CCC libraries were conducted in order to determine library
administrative practice trends.
Summary of Methods
This study used a combined organizational change and competing values
conceptual framework to examine administrative practices and chief librarian experiences
in the CCC libraries. A mixed-methods convergent parallel design was used; quantitative
and qualitative strands were independently conducted and analyzed in Chapters III and
IV. Results from both stands are analyzed together in this chapter.
Quantitative data relied on descriptive statistics from the Council of Chief
Librarian directory data and content analysis job advertisements. Qualitative data was
generated through semi-structured interviews with four chief librarian key informants and
key themes were generated using the combined competing values and multi-frame
organizational conceptual framework. Furthermore, documents including organizational
charts and library staff directories were used to validate and triangulate findings. Because
there is little research on community college libraries and its leadership, exploratory yet
in-depth methods were needed to answer research questions.
Summary of Findings
The summary of findings is organized by research question.
Research question 1: What are the administrative practices in the California
Community College libraries?” In the first part of the discussion, the data associated

136
with position titles, expected library knowledge, and expertise is presented. In the second
part of the discussion, the roles and responsibilities of chief librarians will be presented.
Position titles, expected library knowledge, and expertise. The analysis Council of
Chief Librarian (CCL) Directory, job advertisements, and chief librarian interviews
showed that there is a wide variety of administrative practices in the CCC libraries by
chief librarian roles and duties, library leadership, and libraries in the college
organization.
Administrative duties for chief librarians ranged from dedicated library managers
or faculty members (only overseeing library and/or learning resources) to administrators
with a wide range of duties that included technology/online learning and/or academic
programs and/or college programs. The most common areas of current chief librarian
responsibilities in addition to libraries were learning assistance center, distance education,
instructional technology, and staff development. The job advertisement content analysis
showed growth in duties for staff development, LAC/tutoring, distance education, and
instructional technology. It is expected that library administrator job advertisements will
continue to follow this trend of additional duties.
The data suggest that traditional library manager positions, dedicated deans and
directors, have been or are being combined with other college functions such as
technology/online education and/or academic/college programs. Furthermore, many of
the advertised administrative positions do not have a primary focus on the library and
very few are dedicated library management positions.
Another finding from analysis of CCL Directory data and job advertisements for
administrators responsible for CCC libraries centered on library background of those

137
currently serving and those being hired to serve as chief librarians. Although the majority
of chief librarians (77%) had a Master’s in Library Science (MLS), the credential for
professional librarians, only 18% of the job advertisements listed the MLS as an required
degree and 29% listed MLS as preferred or desired requirement. This indicates that most
community colleges do not recognize the MLS as an essential indicator for the
knowledge or experience for an administrator managing a library. This study verified the
anecdotal observations that most library administrator job ads do not require library
education or background.
Another compelling finding in the administrative practices data was that more
than half of the designated chief librarians have a faculty role such as department chair or
director. Chief librarians are designated at each California Community College and they
participate in statewide leadership, advocacy, and coordination. In the past, library
administrators (e.g. library dean or library director) primarily served as chief librarians.
Analysis of the CCL Directory indicated that only 40% of chief librarians are
administrators.
The qualitative interview data collected from two faculty chief librarians
(department chair and library director) and two administrator chief librarians (library
dean and library director) support these CCC administrative practice findings. All chief
librarian key informants had different job titles and varying administrator responsibilities.
To further emphasize this situation, one of the chief librarians interviewed did not have a
MLS and supervised the library as well as other college areas/programs.
Roles and responsibilities of chief librarians. The second set of findings from this
study was based on qualitative interview data triangulated with data from the CCL

138
Directory and organizational documents. The chief librarian duties as the CCL
representative were similar among the four participants including: attending regional and
statewide meetings and workshops, responsibility for submitting annual survey data to
the Chancellor’s Office, and active participation and knowledge sharing through the CCL
listserv.
Research question 2: What does it mean to be a chief librarian in a
California Community College (CCC) library? Six predominant themes emerged
through an analysis of the interview data using the combined competing values and
multi-frame organizational model. They are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Supervision (structural/hierarchy)
Collaboration (human resources/clan)
Shared governance (human resources/clan)
Lack of resources (political/market)
Marginalization (political/market)
Credentialed librarian managers (symbolic/adhocracy)
All the chief librarians shared a preference for libraries to be situated under the

Academic Affairs, or instructional area, of the college. All of the participants indicated
that they had a high level of collaboration among librarians in their organizations
although they were understaffed or lacked additional resources such as funding, space,
time, etc. All chief librarians preferred dedicated leadership for the library although there
were varying opinions on whether the role of the leader mattered (faculty or
administrator) and whether or not the leader needed a library background (MLS).
Implications
The three main implications of this mixed-methods study will be further explored
in this section, discussing impact of these findings on libraries as well as discussing

139
possible solutions for these issues. These implications are (1) decline in Master’s of
Library Science as a requirement for chief librarians, (2) decline of dedicated library
administrators, and (3) faculty vs. administrator role for chief librarians.
Decline in Master’s of Library Science. Library (and information) science is a
discipline requiring a unique set of skills and knowledge. It is recognized that learning
can occur “on the job” on gained in ways other than the MLS and not everyone with a
MLS will be a good library leader. However, the decrease of the MLS requirements for
library administrators and the number of credentialed chief librarians and library
administrators signals a devaluation of the degree that is not widely apparent in four-year
academic libraries.
Through examination of the Council of Chief Librarian Directory extant data, this
study confirmed anecdotal evidence that many chief librarians (about 25%) do not
possess a Master’s in Library Science (MLS), the minimum qualification for faculty
librarians, similar to a librarian credential. A strong understanding of libraries is typically
gained through the MLS program as well as experience working as a librarian. Libraries
are complex organizations with varied services and different staff roles and functions. It
is important for designated chief librarians to have a strong understanding of libraries in
order to be effective in their roles at their colleges as well as a state-wide leader.
Until recently, chief librarians had served as librarians and it is assumed that the
MLS was a requirement for all library administrators. This study revealed that less than
20% of job recruitments for administrators overseeing the library required the MLS
degree as a minimum qualification. If the job ad trend continues, it is likely that the
number of credentialed chief librarians will decrease. Additionally, many of the positions

140
are supervising multiple areas in addition to the library and it is unlikely that a candidate
will have the knowledge and experience for all areas.
Dedicated library administrator decline. When the Council of Chief Librarians
was initially formed in the 1980’s, the majority of chief librarians were dedicated
administrators (G. Atkins, personal communication, March 7, 2014). The commonly
discussed trend towards non-dedicated library administrators was confirmed in the extant
data analysis and in job ads. There were very few administrative chief librarians only
responsible for supervising the library and many chief librarians supervise learning
resources (tutoring), distance education, educational technologies, or academic programs
(such as English or Fine arts). In the advertised positions without library or learning
resources in the title, there was often very little written about the library nor specific
duties or knowledge related to the library. Because of this, it is assumed that the current
chief librarians that did not have library in their titles may split their time and efforts
between multiple areas and that the library may not the emphasis in role.
Without a dedicated library administrator, there can be issues with staff
supervision, oversight of library services, and as well as general managerial duties such
as setting the direction/vision for the library, planning/implementation/evaluation of
library services, staying abreast of emerging technologies and trends, and accreditation.
All the chief librarian participants cited a lack of time to carry out needed administrative
duties and some pointed to negative impacts on their libraries because of “diluted
managerial time.” It likely that administrators over multiple areas will not be able to
dedicate time and effort needed to CCL and statewide advocacy. College administrators,
especially with large student enrollment, should reduce the duties for library managers

141
and/or appoint a dedicated faculty director that has library operations as their main duties
and the authority to at least supervise library staff (similar to Chief Librarian B).
Faculty vs. administrator role. As previously discussed, libraries without
dedicated library administrators may have more issues with staff supervision. Interviews
with chief librarians (A, C, and D) revealed issues with the ability and authority of
faculty to supervise classified staff. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most CCC districts
interpret the California Educational Code (Title V) such that faculty cannot supervise
classified staff. When chief librarians are in faculty roles overseeing day-to-day
operations of the library without the authority to supervise, evaluate, or discipline staff,
personnel issues can be difficult to remedy.
Alternatively, Chief Librarian B was a dedicated library director and their district
interpreted Title V such that faculty could supervise classified staff. There multiple
faculty directors at their college that had the ability to supervise, evaluate, and discipline
staff. Chief Librarian B had coordination and planning of their library as part of their
main responsibilities but was not the direct supervisor of faculty librarians; all librarians
reported to a dean that supervised multiple areas. It was shared by Chief Librarian D that
another college in their college reassigned a department chair 20% as an administrator
and this gave them authority to supervise staff in order to address severe personnel issues.
College districts, especially with large enrollment, should have a dedicated or full-time
library administrator when possible or a dedicated faculty director devoted to
administration of the library. The issue of faculty supervision needs to be interpreted at
the state level by the CCC Chancellor’s Office.
Conclusions

142
Several salient conclusions were drawn from this study that provides insights into
the leadership and administration of community college libraries. In order to have strong
and effective leadership in the California Community College libraries, adequate
resources and authority are needed for chief librarians regardless of their role. The first
conclusion is that there is much change occurring in community college library
administration. All of the study participants described change in administrative practices
at their institutions and also identified a growing trend of colleges to add additional duties
to the administrators responsible for libraries.
Supervision (structural/hierarchy). A second conclusion is that there are
different interpretations of California educational code (Title V) on whether or not faculty
members can supervise fellow faculty and classified staff in colleges, a
structural/hierarchy issue. The ability of faculty supervisors differs in practice by districts
within California and may be addressed at a local level through unions/collective
bargaining. Most of the interview participants were in districts in which only
administrators can supervise, evaluate, and direct faculty and staff. With increased nonlibrary duties and responsibilities, administrator chief librarians often relied on faculty
librarians to handle day-to-day library operations and act as leads for classified staff. This
represented a shift of workload to faculty and issues with unclear roles and
responsibilities such as who to go to when there is an issue.
Although Chief Librarian B was a faculty member reporting to a dean of multiple
areas, their primary duty as library director was to oversee the library and also had the
authority to evaluate and supervise classified staff within college and district guidelines.
With supervisory authority, Chief Librarian B could shape the behavior and performance

143
of staff members. Chief librarians in districts in which faculty cannot supervise proposed
alternative ideas including additional administrators (assistant deans/director) for daily
operations supervision and other managerial duties or adding partial administrative
assignments to faculty members (e.g. 80% librarian, 20% administrator).
Collaboration and shared governance (human resources/clan). A third
conclusion drawn from this study was the prevalence and importance of internal and
external collaboration (human resources/clan). All of the chief librarians shared that their
library faculty worked well as a team and that they tried to support collaborative
decision-making among the library faculty and staff. Many chief librarians had campus
leadership roles and spoke about the need to exchange information, advocate for
resources, and be college community members through shared governance.
Lack of resources and marginalization (political/market). A fourth important
conclusion was the prevalence of budgetary issues at each participant college and a
perceived sense of marginalization of libraries also related to financial support as well as
staffing. With prevalent budget cuts across higher education, it is not surprising that this
has reduced funding for staff, resources, and supplies for libraries. All of chief librarians
mentioned library and college budget reductions and the need for additional staff which
included librarians, classified staff, or additional managers. In their environments of
scarce resources and competition, there was the need to garner external support through
coalition-building and effective advocacy.
Concerns about resources influenced participants’ views of the ability of their
libraries to effectively meet their missions and goals. A sense of marginalization on a
wider level were shared by the chief librarians in their descriptions of the profession –

144
despair, discouragement, “a deep-seeded frustration of not being properly accorded the
stature and the resources to be able to run libraries (Chief Librarian D, personal
communication, February, 2014).” A common sentiment from chief librarians was the
need to demonstrate the value of the library in meeting college goals, such as
accreditation in order to increase support and funding.
Credentialed librarian managers (symbolic/adhocracy). Finally, by examining
the California Community College library administration in detail, the fifth conclusion is
that many libraries do not have administrators with a library background (Master’s in
Library Science and/or experience as professional librarian). Additionally, most of the
examined job advertisements for administrators in charge of the library did not list the
MLS as a requirement or preferred/desired degree. It could be argued that the Master’s in
Library Science is a powerful symbol for the profession as the administration of libraries
is moving away from dedicated librarian managers.
Among the chief librarian interview participants that had a library background,
the MLS was preferred or strongly desired for library leaders but not identified as a
necessity. Although all the chief librarians stated that library education and experience
were important in providing “grounding” and technical knowledge, they revealed that it
was possible for non-librarians to be effective chief librarians by sharing specific
examples of non-librarian chief librarians that had strong reputations. Participants
identified characteristics of exceptional library leaders including strong management
skills including communication, collaboration, and trust, coupled with an appreciation for
the complexity and value of libraries.

145
Limitations. This study explored library administrative practices in the California
Community Colleges. Although this system is the largest community college system in
the world, it may not be generalizable to all community college systems. This study is not
intended to make broad statements about library administrative practices for all
community colleges, but only within in California.
For the quantitative strand of the study presented in Chapter III, the validity of the
Council of Chief Librarian Directory data collected depended on self-reporting by chief
librarians. There were vacancies for chief librarians at seven institutions; many of these
colleges had recruitments in progress. Organizational charts and library staff directories
were used to verify information. In addition to regular reminders from the CCL Executive
Board, the researcher emailed the statewide listserv asking chief librarians to update their
library profiles and also contacted individual chief librarians to verify or correct
information.
The qualitative component of the study presented in Chapter IV provided insights
and informed opinions from four Chief Librarians on library administrative practices and
leadership perspectives through the experiences of four chief librarians, an in-depth
account of leading libraries in a public institution of higher education. The validity of the
data collected could have been affected by the ability of the researcher to access the
honesty and truthfulness of participants.
The main limitation of the study is the bias I may have brought to this study as a
Chief Librarian and a dedicated library manager at my institution. Additionally, I have
earned a Master’s in Library Science and have worked as a faculty librarian. My position
brings context knowledge which can be a strength in understanding the context in which

146
chief librarians do their work. However, my lens could have impacted my ability to see
beyond my own experience. In order to maintain my objectivity, I frequently thought
about the research questions posed and talked with many chief librarians about this topic.
I worked to be conscious of my biases while conducting my research, being open to new
information and noting any information with which I disagreed. Furthermore, I employed
the strategy of member checks in order to corroborate my findings.
Areas for future research. This is one of the first studies to examine
administration and leadership of community college libraries. During the interviews,
participants expressed how much they valued the opportunity to reflect. Participants
found that hearing themselves explain their position, duties, and experiences gave them
new ideas and insight for future library administrative practices. There are many lines of
inquiry to further this research as many questions about library administrative practices still
exist.
The library administrative practices in this study were only a snapshot in time.

Current library leaders, along with other college leaders would benefit from a historical
data analysis of chief librarian data as well as a longitudinal study of library administrator
job advertisements. Interviewing library faculty and staff in colleges with different library
administrative practices, especially in those that have been recently restructured, could be
revealing.
As part of a larger study, the organizational structure of CCC libraries could be
explored with a focus on the library administrators, whether or not they are designated as
chief librarian. This would provide more clarity of “who’s in charge of the library” and
how this may have changed over time. It would be beneficial also within library

147
organizational structure or models to investigate which colleges have faculty department
chairs and what their leadership duties are. After determining organizational models, an
explanatory study could be conducted to investigate correlation between models and the
variables of college size, region, and type of district (single or multi-district).
With the statewide trend moving away from dedicated library managers and more
duties for administrators responsible for the library, it is important to study effective
administrative practices and library organizational models. Furthermore, if libraries are
increasingly administered by non-librarians (without a MLS), how does this impact
library operations and aspiring library leaders? How should library schools that operate
MLS programs approach this changing trend in their curriculum?
Implications for leadership. In an environment of limited resources and an
abundance of community colleges facing accreditation sanctions, it is time to closely
examine the different ways of administering college programs and the impact of
restructuring and reorganizations. Similar to chief librarians, many colleges are merging
and increasing responsibilities of upper administrators, Vice-Presidents of Instruction and
Student Services. A survey conducted by the California Community College Chief
Instructional Officers (CCCCIO) organization, demonstrates concern about workload and
insufficient staffing for merged VPI/VPSS positions (Tortorici, 2013). This suggests that
the trend to merge libraries with other college areas and programs may not be targeted
and instead, a widespread college practice.
This case-study suggests that dedicated library leadership is needed for libraries to
meet its mission and goals as well as innovate. It is also important for college
administration and districts to recognize that libraries are complex organizations to

148
manage. Findings from this study indicate that community college districts are not
allocating sufficient leadership for libraries (time and authority), whether in faculty or
administrative roles. These findings are supported by the results of the Diablo Valley
College survey (2013) in which many library managers faced challenges with amount of
workload and needed additional time for their job duties. There may be negative impacts
to accreditation review and student success if libraries are not administered well.
This study provided clarity about library administrative structures and leadership
perspectives of four chief librarians in the California Community Colleges. As a result of
this inquiry, other library leaders can benefit from the awareness that libraries are
complex and require dedicated management time to support student learning and
innovate. In addition to an in-depth look at administrative practices at the different
libraries, six themes on the experience of chief librarians (supervision, collaboration,
shared governance, lack of resources, marginalization, and credentialed library managers)
were identified using a combined competing values and leadership frame model. With
this knowledge, existing and future chief librarians, along with other leaders, have
additional resources to bolster their leadership practice. In addition, decision-makers
responsible for restructuring libraries can be better informed.
Recommendations. After conducting this study on the administration and
leadership in community college libraries, I have developed recommendations for the
California Community Colleges Council of Chief Librarians (CCL) organization, future
library leaders, and for decision-makers at colleges and at the state level (California
Community College Chancellor’s office).

149
It is important to recognize the key role that CCL plays in statewide library
leadership and advocacy. CCL is a prominent and respected organization that supports
library and learning centers throughout the state. With the high turnover of administrative
positions in community college libraries and rotating department chair positions, CCL
should be actively involved in the designation of chief librarians at each college when
there are known vacancies and present a clear guideline for who should serve as chief
librarian (department chair, interested librarian, library manager, library administrator,
etc.). CCL could advocate to groups such as the CCC Chief Information Officers and/or
develop a position paper about the importance of community college library dedicated
leadership and promote the Academic Senate CCC recommendations on a wider level.
Another recommendation focuses on future library leaders, especially those that
seek an administrative position. Many in the community college libraries have noted the
decline of Master’s in Library Science (MLS) holding librarians managing community
college libraries and believe this is negative trend. The job advertisement content analysis
conducted in this study indicated that most positions do not require a MLS and there is a
growth in library administrators also managing learning assistance centers/tutoring,
distance education, educational technology, and professional development. Current hires
for these new combined library dean positions may lead libraries for upcoming decades.
The skills and knowledge that librarians bring to managing and leading libraries is
needed to transform academic libraries to face challenges and meet the needs of current
and future students and scholars.
In order to be competitive candidates for dean positions overseeing other college
areas in addition to the library, librarians should be seeking opportunities to collaborate

150
and work outside of libraries in the aforementioned areas and/or pursuing additional
graduate work in technology or educational leadership. To become strong candidates to
oversee academic programs, it is recommended for librarians to study pedagogy and
teach credit courses, face-to-face and online. There exist many possible opportunities for
librarians to leverage educational technologies to reach students in different modes and to
assist in the development and support of other college faculty.
Lastly, the decision-makers at each college and at the state-wide level should be
evaluating library administrative practices across the state for effectiveness in meeting
college and accreditation goals. In a political environment, with reduced resources and
increased competition, additional duties and responsibilities have been added to library
administrators. Although information technology has simplified information acquisitions
and access, the finding, evaluation, and use of information remains complex as does the
need for research assistance. Libraries do not “run themselves” and this is clear from
personnel issues and the time and effort to adapt, innovate, and transform libraries. To
support student learning and meet college and accreditation goals, dedicated library
leadership is needed at each community college library.
Regardless of faculty or administrative role, there should be a dedicated library
leader with a clear role, supervisory authority, adequate resources, and representation in
decision-making. Adequate resources include sufficient staffing, materials/information
resources budget, fair compensation, and time for administrative duties. A dean or
administrative director supervising multiple areas may not be effective nor a faculty
department chair with 20% release time and no authority to address personnel issues.
Because many community college districts interpret California educational code that

151
faculty cannot supervise other faculty members or classified staff and there are impacts to
the library and other areas of a college, this warrants interpretation at a state-wide level
from the Chancellor’s Office.
Leadership reflection. In Chapter I, I shared my positionality through my
experiences as a faculty librarian and a chief librarian. My research has informed my
work and professional development as a newer community college library administrator.
Resources in higher education continue to be scarce with an increased pressure to
increase student success through higher completion, retention, and transfer rates. The
intrinsic value afforded the library cannot be relied upon with information technology
advances and competition for funding, space, and staff. As a leader at my college, I need
to re-define the role of library in supporting these student success indicators and
demonstrate our value to college administrators, faculty, staff, students, and the
community.
After concluding my doctoral studies, I will start my first permanent chief
librarian role (after serving as an interim chief librarian at another CCC library). My new
college recently changed library administrative structures from a dedicated library
director to a dean supervising multiple areas including library, tutoring, and media. This
administrative structure change was not effective for many reasons. As a result of
accreditation issues and declining usage of the library, the college leadership sought a
dedicated library director in an administrative role to help make the library “the heart of
the college” again. My close examination of library administrative structures and chief
librarian interviews influenced me to become a dedicated library director and not pursue

152
an opportunity as an administrator supervising multiple areas and programs in addition to
the library.
Using the combined organizational frame and competing value lens for reflection,
I have generated ideas for how I can lead change and develop a new library
organizational culture to support the library and college missions/goals. This will be
followed with action I will take through library professional organizations.
Structural/hierarchy. As a dedicated library manager, I will have the formal
authority to supervise all library staff. In this college district, faculty members cannot
supervise classified staff. It has been recommended to me by upper administration that I
evaluate the workflow of the library for best library practices and make changes to job
assignments as needed. It will be important to have clear duties and responsibilities for
each person and to identify shared duties and responsibilities. I will work with the staff to
update and change job descriptions that will be reviewed by Human Resources and the
appropriate collective bargaining units. Furthermore, I will need to review the personnel
evaluation process in place and set expectations for all staff, providing feedback,
mentoring, and resources throughout the process.
Human resources/clan. After a significant leadership gap in the library and
turnover of many long-term employees, the library culture is in the process of change and
strong relationships need to be developed. My chief librarian participants emphasized the
need for “soft skills” for library managers in addition to library knowledge to be an
exceptional leader. Increased collaboration and communication needs to occur between
the faculty librarians and staff; I plan to utilize appreciative inquiry and competing values
inventories to approach this. I hope that I can empower the librarians and staff through

153
shared decision-making, providing autonomy when possible, additional professional
development/training, and cultivating leadership skills.
In addition to developing faculty and staff leaders among the library team, I will
continue to mentor current and aspiring librarians in community college librarianship and
leadership. I have informal mentees from underrepresented backgrounds and have
volunteered as a mentor in official capacities through professional organizations. In
addition, I will be proposing a Master’s level internship program that will give interns
experience and college credit and also provide a co-learning experience for the faculty
librarians.
Political/market. In addition to building strong relationships and trust in the
library, it is also important to build external relationships across the college and
community in order to successfully advocate for the library. As previously mentioned,
there is a great deal of competition for scarce resources and having wide-spread support
will help. As an instructional manager, I will represent and advocate for the library and
student success at administrator meetings. I will also work with the library to pursue
supplemental funding sources through internal and external grants, partnerships,
community donors, and other opportunities.
As validated by my findings of the chief librarian experiences, the library needs to
be active in shared governance, especially in the areas impacting student learning such as
curriculum, student learning outcomes, and assessment committees. Furthermore, the
library must seek opportunities to participate in college-wide activities impacting students
including accreditation and implementation of statewide initiatives such as the Student
Success Act and Student Equity Plans. I will encourage and support library faculty and

154
staff in active participation and representation of the library in shared governance
committees.
Symbolic/adhocracy. Similar to the chief librarian participants, the
symbolic/adhocracy lens is the one that I am the most uncomfortable identifying with as a
leader. At the same time, I also agree that this is an important aspect of leadership that
often does not get the attention needed. I have identified professional learning and growth
needs for my practice: developing shared mission and goals, storytelling skills to be
compelling and inspiring, and being an authentic leader working with a strong set of
values.
To increase flexibility and teamwork in my new library, it is important for me to
form working teams with librarians and staff based on their strengths, roles, and interests.
I want all of the library staff to recognize their contributions to student learning and to be
proud to represent the library when out of the building and working across the college.
Professional organizations. Lastly, I will be more active in community college
library advocacy through library professional organizations and as a practitionerresearcher. I am increasing my involvement in the Community Junior College Library
Services section of the American Library Association and was recently appointed to a
nominations committee and a conference planning committee. Additionally, I have
collaborated with two other new community college library directors to submit a proposal
for the Association of College and Research Libraries Conference on community college
librarianship, leadership, and the challenges we face.
There is much interest among the chief librarians in the CCC on my research and
I plan to disseminate my findings and interpretations in scholarly and informal avenues

155
and to directly share with my peers through the Council of Chief Librarians (CCL). I was
recently invited to serve on the CCL Executive Board and may have the opportunity to
implement the recommendations I developed for CCL based on my research. Conducting
research on administrative structures and chief librarians has given me a deeper
appreciation and understanding for my colleagues and profession.
Concluding remarks. At the time of writing, California Governor Jerry Brown
appointed a former political reporter and non-librarian, Greg Lucas, as the California
State Librarian (McGreevy, 2014). Much surprise and concern has been expressed by
librarians across the state with many writing letters to the governor to express disapproval
and their state senators to not confirm the appointment (A. Cunningham, personal
communication, April 2. 2014). Having non-librarians managing libraries is not unique to
the California Community College system and may become more prevalent in libraries.
Action is needed to demonstrate the value of library experience and knowledge in
managing libraries.
In California, the composition of community college library leaders designated as
chief librarians is changing. As chief librarians represent, promote, and advance
community college libraries, strong leadership is needed in each college and across the
state. The CCC Council of Chief Librarians (CCL) Executive Board recently proposed a
change to the annual “Deans and Directors” meeting title to reflect the current
composition of the chief librarians as half are faculty members and most have the title of
“department chair.” The title change will be a symbolic shift, making the group more
inclusive of all library leaders that represent their colleges. To increase leadership

156
capacity, CCL has also discussed developing a mentoring program for new chief
librarians and/or a leadership development program for future chief librarians.
Library leaders, whether or not they have a library background or are in an
administrative or faculty role, need adequate resources, authority, and excellent
management skills to lead high-performing libraries. Exceptional library leaders need
strong management skills including communication, collaboration, and trust, coupled
with an appreciation for the complexity and value of libraries.

Email and In-Person Review
Pearl Ly, a graduate student in the joint doctoral program at California State University
San Marcos (CSUSM) and University of California, San Diego (UCSD), is conducting a
study on the experience of chief librarians and administrative practices in California
Community College (CCC) libraries. You are invited to participate because of your role
as Chief Librarian at your college and administrative practices at your library. A total of
four chief librarians are being interviewed about their library administrative practices.
This study has two principal objectives:
1. To better understand the current administrative practices of CCC libraries.
2. To better understand the experience of chief librarians in CCC libraries.
Description of Procedures
You will be interviewed individually. The conversational style interview regarding your
experiences as a chief librarian and your library/libraries administrative practices will
take approximately one and a half hours. There are no rights or wrong answers to the
questions and your candid responses will be appreciated. With your permission, the
interview will be audio taped and transcribed. You may decline to answer any of the
questions and you may stop the tape recording at any time.
All information collected in this study is confidential. Responses will be reported through
the use of pseudonyms for participants and anyone mentioned by a participant. All
audiotape recordings and transcripts will be entered into a computer file and both hard
and digital copies on CD will be stored in a locked safe. The data will be maintained on a
single password-protected computer and an additional password will be required to open
files. The researcher is the only individual with access to this safe, computer, and files. If
you agree to participate and later change your mind, all data associated with you will be
immediately deleted. If for any reason I need to withdraw you from the study without
your consent, you will be immediately notified.
Risks and Inconveniences
