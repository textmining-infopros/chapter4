ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
On the social epistemological nature of questions: A comparative analysis of knowledge
domains’ question formulations on the topic of “memory”
by HANNAH KWON

Dissertation Director:
Ross Todd

If “information” is a central concept for library and information science, then
“questions” are fundamental, for information “informs” relative to the question. But
research focusing on questions as a central theoretical concept has been stymied by the
paradox of the question, which observes that in order to ask one must know enough to
know what one does not know (Flammer, 1981). This dissertation proposes that this
paradox results from the limitations of the cognitive approach to questions as indications
of individual information need, and that the paradox can be resolved by reframing
questions as social epistemological tools of inquiry within knowledge domains. The
questions posed by three knowledge domains – neuroscience, literature, and computer
engineering – on the common topic of “memory” are analyzed in order to investigate how
the domains’ question formulations compare and what the comparisons convey about
how to answer and the assumptions upon which question and answer are constructed. A
method is developed for identifying the implicit questions that motivate and organize
scholarly inquiry by analyzing dissertation abstracts as knowledge products of inquiry.
The comparative question analysis of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering

ii

dissertations’ question formulations about “memory” supports the proposition that
knowledge domains ask different questions and ask them differently. What they ask, the
content of their questions, communicates the indeterminate epistemic situation that each
domain has of memory, while the mode of presentation of the question, its form, conveys
the epistemic structure of inquiry and the production of knowledge. A social
epistemological model of domains’ question formulations is developed that proposes that
question content reflects domain ontologies, question form reflects domain
epistemologies, and determinations of question relevance reflect domain sociality, which
model has implications for document relevance, question negotiation, information
retrieval design, and inquiry-based learning.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Just as a question reveals and exposes the questioner’s stance in the world, this
dissertation reveals and exposes my intellectual and personal formation. I am grateful to
my committee members for their intellectual mentorship: Eviatar Zerubavel for sparking
my hidden “sociological imagination” and for showing me how to look for the formal
patterns that make everyday social phenomena visible in their generality and specificity;
Marija Dalbello, whose doctoral course on Social Epistemology gave me the theoretical
tools to bridge sociology and epistemology and to see the value of this perspective for
library and information science (though I did not realize it until long after the course had
ended); and Marie Radford who brought together for me the worlds of professional
librarianship and theory-driven research.
I am especially grateful to my dissertation chair, Ross Todd, for his enthusiastic
support and cheerful championing of my work. His enjoyment and pride in his doctoral
students seems nearly equal to that which he takes in his own work, and I strive to follow
his example of joyfulness and intellectual generosity.
The initial years of my dissertation were funded by the Institute of Museum and
Library Services (IMLS) Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program, jointly
administered by the New Jersey State Library and Rutgers University, School of
Communication and Information. Many thanks to Jana Varlejs for her work in
developing and administering this grant program.
My family brings me back from my private and ordered world of concepts,
theories, and forms to the beautiful mess of a shared reality. I am amazed at the sheer
force of life that is contained in my two sons, Benjamin and Abraham; they compel me to

iv

consider what it means to really be in this world. For the hours of loving time spent with
my boys and the endless amounts of home-cooked Korean food, I am so grateful to my
parents. Their support has been quiet, endless, consistent, and without expectation of
anything in return.
Finally, I am grateful for my husband, Stevie, who chooses to extend himself to
nurture my personal, intellectual, and spiritual growth, in spite of my own reluctance.
May we continue to choose each other, again and again, and yet again.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Question asking is one of those mundane and everyday activities which [sic] we
spend considerable time engaged in yet have a very rudimentary technical
understanding of. Ask people you know to tell you why they ask the questions
they do. A shrug. Or why they ask questions at all. They will probably respond
(if they don’t think the question too absurd) by telling you that they ask questions
to find out something they don’t know. But ask them how, out of all the possible
things they don’t know when they ask a question, do they choose to ask a
particular question, in a particular way. Wouldn’t another question have been as
good? Ask them if they think questions also convey information as well as request
it [emphasis added].” (Kearsley, 1976, p. 355-6)

1.1 Background: Why study questions?
Any theory of information needs to begin with a theory of questions (MacKay,
1969). In the ongoing debate about whether “information” is the central object of interest
in library and information science (LIS) and if so how it should be defined, the theoretical
significance of the question has been neglected. If “information” is most literally defined
as “that which informs or has the potential to inform,” one might ask what information
“informs” in relation to. One communications scholar, challenging a LIS audience to
reflexive research, puts it this way: “Information may be the answer, but what is the
question?” (Halloran, 1983, p. 159). From the simplest request for information (“What
time is it?), to the deepest metaphysical inquiries (“Why are we here?”), questions are the
“functional interface of the inquiry process” or “an instrument for inquiring” (Horne,
1983, p. 5). To pose a question is to admit one’s lack of knowledge about something and
a desire and intention to remedy that lack. The question plays an “organizing function”
(MacKay, 1960, p. 790) by pointing back towards its assumptions and simultaneously
looking forward towards what constitutes an answer. Questions precede information.

2
What might it look like, then, to consider the question as a more fundamental
concept for organizing the universe of documents than information? “Information” is an
ambiguous term with a variety of meanings, including: information-as-process,
information-as-knowledge, information-as-thing (Buckland, 1991); information as
selective, information as general phenomenon, information as category and property of
matter, information as semantic, information as event, information in relation to
uncertainty, information as structure (Belkin, 1978); as well as information as relevance
(Furner, 2004). The conflicting conceptions of and ensuing debate about “information”
creates a tendency towards generalized abstractness or else makes necessary the
articulation of which exact information concept is being employed. Questions, on the
other hand, are undeniably contextual. In their formulation and presentation, questions
reveal a wealth of information about questioners’ assumptions and their criteria for what
constitutes an answer. Subsequent to understanding what constitutes an answer,
judgments of document relevance can be made. Consequently, a better understanding of
questions is necessary to inform information scientists’ and practitioners’ efforts to
structure the universe of recorded documents to promote its effective and efficient
navigation in the continual production of new knowledge. If LIS is concerned with
helping people to navigate the universe of recorded documents, then the study of
questions and what they reveal about questioners’ criteria for what constitutes an answer
and the criteria for documents relevant to producing the answer is of utmost importance
to theoretical and practical advancement.

3

1.2 Problem statement: The paradox of the question and the problem of
context
While questions have long been an object of study in library and information
science, theoretical and methodological insight into the role of the question in inquiry and
the production of knowledge has been stymied by what one psychologist identifies as the
paradox of the question (Flammer, 1981): questioners are required to formulate questions
to solicit precisely the information that they lack. The paradox of the question states that
in order to ask for the needed information, the questioner has to know enough to know
what can be known. This paradox is taken to its logical extreme in Taylor’s (1962)
observation, “By asking a question, the inquirer imposes limits on the information
acceptable as an answer. The converse of this statement is the postulate that knowing
what counts as an answer is equivalent to knowing the question” (p. 393).
Taylor’s (1968) research on question negotiation works within this paradoxical
assumption to develop a model of the increasingly opaque question expressions, from the
initial inception in the mind of the questioner, to its presentation to the information
system being approached by the questioner. Taylor’s description of the four levels of
question formation and information need offer a conceptualization of the communicative
complexity of even the most basic reference encounter. Librarians have long been
witness and party to the opacity of language and the paradox of the question in the
context of information intermediation. The question as it is explicitly stated can only be
effectively understood and answered when viewed in relation to what, by the questioner’s
intention or inability, remains implicit or unstated – what too often is relegated to the
black box of “context” – or by the recipients’ inability to comprehend the stated question
and its implicit context. In order to negotiate or disambiguate the question context,

4
reference librarians are taught to probe questioners about their context: task criteria,
search history, cognitive level, and practical constraints such as time limits and physical
access to resources such as the Internet, special libraries, or library databases. A search
engine or digital library interface might similarly prompt the user to add additional search
parameters or proactively suggest relevant or related search terms.
The importance of context in relation to information and communication is widely
agreed upon, but little else in relation to context is. Dervin (2003) writes that “there is no
term that is more often used, less often defined, and when defined defined so variously as
context” (p. 112). Depending on contextual elements such as the functional constraints
of the information system or the questioner’s cognitive ability, social location, task,
situation, culture, environment, time, and place, to name a few, a stated question can be
interpreted in an endless number of ways, with each interpretation resulting in different
criteria for documents that might assist in the inquiry process. It is the contextual nature
of the question that suggests that questions are not mere requests for information, but
have important communicative properties beyond delineating the topic of the inquiry.
Questions convey information as well as request it, but what information is being
conveyed? An approach to conceptualizing questions that can account for the problem of
“context” is essential to unlocking the question paradox, both for the purpose of aiding
information organization and intermediation and in the interest of developing relevant
theories of information. This is the problem that lies at the center of the current
investigation.

5

1.3 Statement of purpose
This dissertation seeks a way out of the question paradox and the problem of
context by conceiving of questioning as a social epistemological phenomenon and
questions as social epistemological objects, asking how questions can be recast as tools of
knowledge production within the context of knowledge domains rather than indications
of individuals’ cognitive information needs. Towards this end, three contrasting
knowledge domains’ dissertation research on a common topic will be compared in order
to determine how their question formulations compare, what the comparisons reveal
about how to answer and the domain assumptions upon which questions and answers are
constructed, and the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of this
paradigmatic shift in question research. In doing so, this research seeks to re-establish
the fundamental importance of the question as a concept for library and information
science by illustrating how different question formulations function to organize inquiry
according to the specific nature of knowledge production in each domain. This domainbased understanding of the question is proposed as the most fundamental context for
understanding inquiry, which is the process by which knowledge is produced, and thus
the foundation for theories and practices of information behavior and knowledge
organization.

1.4 Research questions
The overarching research question guiding this investigation is: How do
knowledge domains’ question formulations about a common topic compare and what do
they convey about the answers that follow and the assumptions that precede the
questions? The following research questions will further guide the investigation.

6
I.

What questions do different knowledge domains formulate about a common
topic?

II.
III.

How do the knowledge domains’ question formulations compare?
What information do the comparisons between knowledge domains’ question
formulations convey about the answers that follow and the assumptions that
precede the questions?

The questions guide the investigation in incremental stages, from identification of
knowledge domains’ questions, to their comparison, to interpretation of the comparisons.
The first question requires the development of a method for identifying domains’
question formulations from the knowledge products of inquiry and for characterizing the
types of questions within and across domains. Question two considers how to categorize
and compare the types of question formulations in each domain. The third question
pivots to turn a theoretical lens on the relationships between questions, answers, and
assumptions, as well as between question formulations and the knowledge domain as a
context for inquiry and the production of knowledge. A social epistemological model of
domains’ question formulations is presented that links the dimensions of question
formulations (content, form, relevance) to dimensions of the knowledge domain
(ontological, epistemological, social).

1.5 Statement of rationale
All human inquiry begins with a question, is guided throughout by the question,
and ends when the question has been answered or resolved. It is the unacknowledged
framework for all human interactions with information, even for “accidental” or
“unintentional” information encountering, such as described by Erdelez (1997), for

7
information only informs relative to a question. The question may be implicit or only
emergent at the point of encountering the data, which becomes information at the point of
its relation to the question. Without acknowledgement of the question as framework for
inquiry and the knowledge domain as the social context of inquiry, the empirical study of
information behaviors and practices is susceptible, at its worst, to wayward
interpretations or, at the very least, piecemeal understanding of humans interactions with
information in the production of knowledge.
Furthermore, the comparative epistemological methodology directs theoretical
attention to the formal dimensions of human-information phenomena such as question
formulation. A comparative lens produces knowledge that cuts across the historic focus
on subject-oriented user groups, suggesting a way forward for theoretical advancement of
LIS, which Bates (1999) describes as a meta-discipline whose study is the content of
form and organization of information. The current investigation demonstrates that
comparative research can simultaneously produce knowledge of specific knowledge
domains’ question formulations and the nature of questioning as a general phenomenon
of human-information interaction.

1.6 Definition of terms
The following concepts are central to the current investigation. Definitions have
been derived from reviews of the existing literature, with an eye toward the specific
perspective and goals of this study. Concepts will be further discussed throughout the
dissertation.
Inquiry. Inquiry is the directed or controlled transformation of an indeterminate
situation into a determinate one (Dewey, 1938). It is both natural and cultural: natural in

8
the sense that it has its foundations in the biological activities of humans, and cultural, in
that it is a socially conditioned mode of activity with cultural consequences (Dewey,
1938). Inquiry is conducted through the asking and answering of questions (also referred
to as “questioning”) in a manner that accords with the norms and practices of the
knowledge domain or domains of origin. The result of competent inquiry is the
production of knowledge (Dewey, 1938).
Knowledge domain. Knowledge domains are the basic social unit of inquiry and
the foundational context for all information practices and behaviors. Domains have
ontological, epistemological, and social dimensions (Hjørland and Hartel, 2003b).
Domains can be scholarly, scientific, or affiliated with everyday knowledge producing
contexts such as religion, politics, or professional trades and hobbies (Hjørland, 2010).
Knowledge. Knowledge is the product of competent inquiry (Dewey, 1938). It is
the sum total of what is known, the “warrantably assertible conclusions” (Dewey, 1938),
about the world possessed by or n relation to knowledge domains. As a question seeks to
produce an answer, inquiry seeks to produce knowledge.
Question. Questions are epistemic devices, tools used to transform indeterminate
situations into determinate ones in relation to knowledge domains as social units of
knowledge production. The indeterminate situations that questions seek to transform are
of several types, including epistemic gaps, epistemic conflicts, and problems. Questions
are a combination of indication and invitation (MacKay, 1960): they indicate the
indeterminate epistemic situation and invite its resolution.
Question formulation. A question formulation is the precise expression of the
indeterminate epistemic situation that is seeking transformation. Question formulations

9
have both content and form, and are subject to knowledge domains’ norms and practices
of inquiry. “Question” is used to indicate the abstract concept, while “question
formulation(s)” refers to the operationalized expression of the concept.
Question content. The content of the question expresses what is being asked
about, the indeterminate epistemic situation that motivates inquiry and seeks resolution.
Question content is comprised of subjects, the entities of uncertain epistemic status, and
queries, the types of determinations being sought about the entities.
Question form. The form of the question expresses how the question content is
being presented. At the domain level of discourse, the epistemic form of the question
conveys how inquiry is organized or components of inquiry are defined, as well as
illustrating the relationships among the components of inquiry. Whereas question content
conveys the epistemic determinations that the questioner seeks to make, question form
functions as the device or tool used to make the determinations.
Answers. Answers are the determinations that resolve the indeterminate
situations expressed in questions. The type of determination in an answer corresponds to
the type of indeterminacy indicated in the question: epistemic gaps are answered by
filling the gap with new information; epistemic conflicts are answered by resolving the
conflict; problems are resolved with solutions. The content and form of the answer
follows that of the question.
Assumptions (of questions). Questions are formulated on the basis of tacit
beliefs in the knowledge domain about the nature of inquiry and the production of
knowledge. Chief among these assumptions are ontological commitments, or beliefs
about what entities exist in the world, their features and relations, and epistemological

10
presuppositions, or beliefs about what can be known and how it is known. Domain
assumptions precede question formulation.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
By asking a question, the inquirer imposes limits on the information acceptable as
an answer. The converse of this statement is the postulate that knowing what
counts as an answer is equivalent to knowing the question. (Taylor, 1962, p. 393)

2.1 Introduction
A review of the major theories of library and information science suggests that,
with some notable exceptions, questions are hardly ever the direct object of study but are
often the implicit frame for information retrieval and information behavioral research.
Most of the major theories and concepts of information seeking, including
Dervin’s (1992) Sense-Making, Kuhlthau’s (2004) Information Search Process,
Chatman’s (1999) theory of life in the round, Belkin’s (1978) concept of anomalous
states of knowledge, and Wilson’s (1983) concept of cognitive authority, presume that
information seeking behaviors result from the existence of a question and the individual’s
inability to answer the question with the information that they currently possess. In order
to understand what constitutes a relevant document that can provide an answer or assist in
the production of an answer, one must understand what constitutes an appropriate answer.
In order to understand what constitutes an appropriate answer, one must understand the
question. The following review of the literature assesses the state of knowledge about
questions and question-related phenomena of interest to library and information science
(LIS) by conducting a meta-theoretical analysis of the question research in LIS. Before
proceeding, the review of question research in LIS is contextualized in relation to the
broader notion of “inquiry,” the multidisciplinary nature of questions and questioning,
and varying approaches to defining the “question.”

12
2.1.1 Inquiry and its relation to questions. The understanding of inquiry in this
dissertation draws from Dewey’s (1938) logical philosophical discourse on the theory of
inquiry. Dewey defines inquiry as “the directed or controlled transformation of an
indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and
relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole” (p. 1045); in short, inquiry is the determination of an indeterminate situation. Dewey prefers the
concept of “indeterminate situation” to the alternative “problematic situation” (which
concept was introduced in the LIS research by Wersig (1979)) for the reason that a
situation is not inherently problematic, but only becomes so upon being subjected to
inquiry. An indeterminate situation is one in which the inquirer’s experience of their
environment is unsettled, and its constituent elements cease to “hang together.” The
expression of the manner in which the inquirer experiences the situation as indeterminate
determines what is required for it to be transformed into a determinate situation. If the
transformation is conducted in a directed or controlled manner that ends in a “unified
existential situation,” inquiry can be deemed as “competent” (Dewey, 1938).
The current investigation views the controlled and directed activities that
transforms an indeterminate situation into a determinate one as centered on the asking
and answering questions. Dewey (1938) asserts that up to a certain point, inquiry and
questioning are synonymous, that we inquire when we question and when we seek an
answer to a question. Inquiry is conducted by asking and answering questions. What
remains implicit in this statement of inquiry as conducted by the asking and answering
questions is the complex social epistemological context within which the inquiry occurs.
While inquiry has naturalistic foundations (as the use of humans’ sense organs is a

13
necessary condition of inquiry), how inquirers see, hear, measure, build, read, think,
make decisions, and use language – all of the elements of inquiry – are shaped by culture
(Dewey, 1938).
Dewey (1938) distinguishes common sense inquiry from scientific inquiry as that
which draws its significances and meanings in reference to the application of the resultant
knowledge. In contrast, scientific inquiry is directed the production of knowledge that is
coherent and consistent with existing knowledge. Knowledge resulting from common
sense inquiries is meant to settle issues of use and enjoyment of the environment, while
knowledge resulting from scientific inquiry exists for its own sake. The use of the term
“inquiry” in this dissertation is intended to encompass both common sense and scientific
inquiry, at the conceptual level, but at the empirical level only scientific (more commonly
referred to in LIS as “scholarly”) inquiry is investigated.
As inquiry is here understood as being conducted by asking and answering
questions, questions are defined as tools of inquiry. Derr’s (1982) definition of questions
as linguistic devices, tools used to make epistemic determinations is here combined with
Dewey’s (1938) definition of inquiry as the directed and controlled transformation of
indeterminate situations into determinate ones, in order to define questions as epistemic
devices, tools used to transform indeterminate situations into determinate ones.
Questions function to transform indeterminate situations into determinate ones by guiding
and organizing all aspects of inquiry, including: identification of subject matter, choice of
sources of evidence, methods of analysis and reasoning, understanding what constitutes
an answer, how to present it, and how to evaluate the quality of the answer. Horne
(1983) aptly captures the utility of questions as a tool of inquiry in her definition of

14
questions as “the functional interface of inquiry” (p. 5). The term “inquiry” is used
throughout the dissertation to refer to the practice of asking and answering questions,
rather than any specific instance of it.
2.1.2 Multidisciplinary nature of question research. As a fundamental
phenomenon of human knowledge, questions have been studied in many disciplines, each
with its own conceptualization of what constitutes a “question,” methods of investigation,
and types of findings. In a review of the multidisciplinary study of questioning, Dillon
(1982) divides the literature into three basic categories: theoretical research as is
conducted in philosophy, linguistics, erotetic logic, and cognitive psychology;
the empirical research of social anthropology, sociolinguistics, and survey research;
and practical research that focuses on how to ask questions to obtain desired effects, such
as occurs in education, counseling, personnel interviewing, and legal cross-examination.
Dillon (1982) includes library science in the practical research category, as is exemplified
by Slavens’ (1978) book, Informational Interviews and Questions, in which common
reference questions are grouped according to the type of reference source (directories,
yearbooks, dictionaries, etc.) that should be used by reference librarians to answer the
questions. Four fields of analysis emerge from Dillon’s (1982) review: linguistic
analysis, concerned with the nature, structure, and meaning of questions as language
events; education, the oldest and largest field, mostly concerned with the teachers’ use of
questions as a pedagogical technique; practical pursuits such as opinion-polling, crossexamination, personnel interviewing, and psychotherapy; and scholarly inquiry, which is
concerned with the formulation of questions in the pursuit of knowledge.

15
It is of particular interest to note the importance that Dillon (1982) attributes to
the field of scholarly inquiry, “…where the fewest questions are posed, where the choice
of question is of the most consequence, and where the resulting answer is of the greatest
significance. Here also is where the least is known about questioning” (p. 156). LIS is
uniquely qualified to contribute to the field of scholarly inquiry, as it has long been
interested in both the pragmatic functions of questions and theories of scholarly
communication. The two areas of question research and scholarly inquiry have, however,
been largely isolated from each other, and is a reflection of the broad separation between
the LIS fields of human information behavior and scholarly communication. Dillon’s
(1982) observation, that many disciplines study questions in relative isolation from each
other even as their complementary approaches and findings have potential to inform each
other, easily applies to this divide as well: user studies can gain depth from being placed
in the context of the bigger picture of scholarly communication systems and structures,
while scholarly communications research can be particularized by user studies.
2.1.3 Defining “questions.” One of the difficulties in assessing what is known
about questions and questioning is that there is no agreement in the literature as to what
constitutes a “question,” if and how they can be identified, and what can be known about
them. From the perspective of question answering research in computer science and
linguistics, questions are identified by their syntactic or linguistic features, such as a
question mark at the end of a written sentence or rising intonation at the end of an
utterance (Lauer, 2001). In this view, questions are verbally expressed requests for
information. A question can also be defined in cognitive behavioral terms, such as
Horne’s (1983) definition of a question as “an observable behavioral act reflecting

16
information need, and proceeds from a series of cognitive processes produced by the need
‘to know’” (Horne, 1983, p. 5). The “information need” emerges from a cognitive state
characterized by the lack of information or conflicting information; through the question,
the mind seeks to re-establish equilibrium (Farmer, 2007, p. 41). In short, the question is
a behavioral indication that an information need exists, but is not an exact representation
of the information need (Swigger, 1985). This definition casts some doubt or at
minimum complicates the assumption of the one-to-one mapping between the expressed
question and the underlying information need. Questions are born of the user’s
inadequacy: they indicate that the learner’s “cognitive structure is not adequate to the
task’” (Ford, 1980, p. 100). Questions serve “to expose you to a certain incompleteness
in his picture of the world – an inadequacy in what we might call his ‘state of readiness’
to interact purposefully with the world around him and specifically with you” (MacKay,
1960, p. 789).
Ultimately, questions seek to elicit a response (Kearsley, 1976).1 Responses have
two functions: epistemic and interpersonal. The epistemic function of a question is to
produce knowledge, fill a knowledge gap, or resolve an epistemic conflict, as reflected in
Derr’s (1982) definition of questions as “linguistic devices…tools which [sic] we use to
make epistemic determinations about the world” (p. 69). In the LIS
literature, Eichman (1978) distinguishes between the use of questions to correct
knowledge deficits (epistemic function) and the use of questions to monitor common
ground (interpersonal function). While the epistemic and interpersonal functions seem to

1

Even rhetorical questions can be said to elicit a response by stimulating the thoughts of the respondent,
though the respondent is not expected to verbalize the thoughts.

17
suggest two different kinds of responses, all responses encompass both functions, though
one may be emphasized over the other. MacKay’s (1960) definition of a question as “a
combination of an indication and an invitation” reflects the dual functions of the question.
Questions expose an inadequacy in the questioner’s ability to interact purposefully with
the world (indication of epistemic gap) and ask the respondent2 to help remedy the
inadequacy (invitation to respond) (MacKay, 1960).
In addition to the linguistic and cognitive conceptions of the question,
philosophers also talk about the question in existential terms, as simultaneously
representing inadequacy and potential. To ask a question is to inhabit a state of “being in
the middle,” between knowledge and ignorance, actuality and possibility (Gelven, 2000).
To ask a question is also to be poised on the brink of action, putting the questioner “to the
test…on the sharp side of the edge between yes and no” (Struyker Boudier, 1988). The
existential perspective emphasizes the revelatory nature of the question rather than its
functions. Struyker Boudier (1988) describes the question as revealing and exposing the
questioner’s stance in the world:
In strictly linguistic terms, the question should be interpreted as a request for an
answer…. If viewed social-communicatively and philosophicalanthropologically, however, the question has a much wider purpose. It may be
interpreted as a pre-eminent way to show who or what the person ‘is’ or where he

2

The definition of a respondent depends upon to whom the question is posed and from whom the answer is
being sought. Most often, questions are thought of as being posed to another person, but questions can also
be posed to a collective, one’s own self, or the representations of an individual’s or collective’s knowledge,
such as a document or the knowledge structures that mediate between questioner and document, i.e. search
engine or search interface.

18
stands [emphasis added], just as the questions about things makes it possible for
them to be exposed in the light of the truth. (p. 13)
By asking a question, particularly in the case of philosophical or metaphysical questions,
the questioner is exposed. As a demonstration of the revelatory nature of questions,
consider asking a number of individuals what questions they have about life after death.
Inevitably, the questions reveal as much as they request; they will indirectly or directly
reveal personal and cultural history, philosophical viewpoints, institutional affiliations,
biases, styles of thinking, levels of existing knowledge, and more.
In light of these various definitions and conceptions of the question, what can be
commonly agreed upon is that: (1) questions indicate a need for information; (2) they
invite an answer or reply; and (3) they convey information about the questioner.
2.1.4 Question research in library and information science. In a survey of the
question research in library and information science, Swigger (1985) groups the research
according to the three question-related topics: questions and answers, questions and
questioners, and question negotiation. Each topic can be mapped to one of the “’isms” or
meta-theoretical approaches of information science described by Talja, Tuominen, and
Savolainen (2005). The topic of questions and answers can be described as taking an
information transfer meta-theoretical perspective that centers on the question as object.
Research on questions and questioners and question negotiation takes the metatheoretical approach of cognitive constructivism and implicitly locate the question in the
context of the individual questioner’s “problematic situation” (Wersig, 1979). The
approach that is least defined in the existing literature, and which the current
investigation takes, focuses on question as an intersubjective practice that occurs in the

19
context of knowledge domains. Table 1 shows the relationship between the metatheoretical approaches, paradigms, and topics.

Table 1. Categories of question research in LIS
These broad categories of research serve as ideal types that maximize analytical
difference, but the boundaries between categories are porous and individual studies often
include elements of more than one category.
The following sections, labeled according to the context of the question and the
associated paradigmatic approach, update Swigger’s (1985) review of the research
literature on questions. By progressing through the paradigmatic stages of question
research, an argument will emerge for a constructionist paradigm in which questioning is
conceptualized as an intersubjective practice of knowledge domains. The questioning-asintersubjective paradigm is proposed as a fruitful foundation for future question research,
as it resolves some of the conceptual and methodological limitations of the other
paradigms that have resulted in diminished scholarly attention to the question in LIS.

20

2.2 The information system: Question-as-object
The conceptualization of question-as-object is characterized by “a prima facie
approach to questions, assuming that the way in which they are stated is perfectly clear,
need no disambiguation, and perfectly conveys an information need” (Pomerantz, 2005,
p. 717). Question-as-object has its roots in what Talja, Tuominen, and Savolainen (2005)
label the information transfer model meta-theoretical approach. In this approach,
information operates within a physical paradigm in which reality is objective and
knowable and is captured in information, which is a “brick-like” entity. Information has
objective meaning that can be transferred between sender and receiver with little loss of
meaning (Dervin, 1994). Accordingly, the question is taken as an unproblematic request
for information: “an interrogative statement requiring an answer, a statement which is a
verbalized (oral or written) representation of an information need” (Saracevic, 1980, p.
146). More simply put, “A question is a formalized request for information” (Keyes,
1996, p. 238).
The primary mode of question research in information science is analysis of
existing questions in order to create or improve question-answering tools and service.
Both library reference services research and information retrieval (IR) systems research
concern question-answering systems: physical libraries, on the one hand, and digital
libraries or information systems, on the other. This research considers how information
intermediaries (reference librarians) or technologies (automated algorithms) can better
interpret the question in order to improve question-answering capabilities. Aptly
categorized as “questions and answers” research by Swigger (1985), the research is
organized around a shared problem: increasing information systems’ efficiency, variously

21
defined as volume of service, accuracy, user satisfaction, etc., in answering questions.
The question is analyzed for its components or properties that indicate criteria for the
selection of documents relevant to the production of an answer. The studies and their
findings are discussed below according to these question components or properties:
subject or topic; syntax and grammatical status; conceptual presupposition; reference
categories; and information retrieval facets.
2.2.1 Subject or topic. Most fundamentally, the question reveals the subject or
topic of interest to the questioner. In library science, there is a long history of classifying
reference questions by subject or topic in order to inform collection development and
develop best practices for reference services. Conner’s (1927) analysis of question
subjects for a Library Journal article on “What a reference librarian should know” is an
early example of this type of question classification research. Conner classifies the
reference questions asked at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh from 1905 to 1925
according to broad Dewey Decimal classes (General, Philosophy, Religion, Sociology,
Philology, Fine Arts, Literature, History), as well as by prominent contemporary topics
(the suffragists movement, evolution, the Montessori method of education, etc.).
Knowledge of the subjects and topics of interest to the public should, she suggests,
determine the college courses taken by those interested in working in public libraries and
the planning of graduate courses in book selection, classification, and reference. In
conceptual terms, questions are reduced to the subject or topic on which information is
being requested. The question is taken at face value as a request for topical information.
To this day, subject classification remains the central organizing principle for
librarianship.

22
2.2.2 Syntax and grammatical status. The syntax of the question can also be
analyzed for clues as to the nature of the question and what kind of answer is required. In
his review of question taxonomies, Pomerantz (2005), drawing on Robinson
and Rackstraw’s (1972) linguistic analysis of questions, identifies the most basic
classification as “the five Ws”: who, what, when, where, and why3. He notes that several
question-answering systems use wh- words as the primary criterion for determining the
type of answer expected. Saracevic (1980) similarly lists grammatical status as one of
the possible question properties for classifying questions en route to producing search
results, defining it as the “(i) type of words and phrases and syntactic constructs in a
question, and (ii) frequency distribution of words and phrases within one or many
questions” (p. 147).
In reference studies, syntax is considered in the study of librarians’ use of openand closed-ended questions in the reference interview (King, 1972; White & Iivonen,
2001; Dervin & Dewdney, 1986). Open questions are more effective in eliciting query
clarifications, but many librarians ask predominately closed-ended questions (Dervin &
Dewdney, 1986; Marsteller and Mizzy, 2003; Radford, Connaway, Confer, et al., 2011).
Whether they concern the initial use of questions by information seekers or subsequent
questioning by reference librarians in negotiating information seekers’ questions, these
studies presume that the syntax of the question conveys expectations about the
informational nature of the answer and the manner of its production.
2.2.3 Conceptual presupposition. A research project funded by the National
Science Foundation and supervised by Tefko Saracevic and Miranda Pao at Case Western
3

Commonly, “how” is added to the list, to comprise the “five Ws and one H” of information gathering.

23
Reserve University entitled “Classification and Structure of Questions in Information
Retrieval,” aimed to classify questions in order to improve accuracy of information
retrieval systems. As a part of this project, Derr (1982; 1984) breaks down questions into
the structural components of subjects and queries. By abstracting the subject
(“X”), Derr identifies the query’s conceptual presuppositions, the basic concepts that
define the kinds of question being asked. Table 2 shows Derr’s (1982) classification
scheme.

Table 2. A classification of questions in information retrieval by conceptual
presupposition (Derr, 1982)
In a study of users’ questions and their effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents,
Saracevic and Kantor (1988) similarly classify questions according to “presuppositions,”
operationalized as the presence and number of implied concepts that can be expressed as
search terms. Questions’ presuppositions provide parameters for the system to
understand what constitutes an answer to the question.
2.2.4 Reference categories. The practice of classifying reference questions in
order to inform collection development and references service takes as its implicit
context the library as an information system, in what has been identified as the systemcentered perspective (Dervin & Nilan, 1986) in librarianship. Questions are categorized
in order to evaluate existing library services and to improve the efficiency of the services
and the library system as a whole. Beyond the question’s explicit subject or topic, the

24
information system dimensions identified as facets by which questions can be classified
in order to improve the efficiency of reference service provision include: the library
department as source of answer (Braxton & Brunsdale, 2004; Marsteller & Neuhaus,
2001); type of reference question (Katz, 1997; Cobine & Mohanty, 2005); type of
resource the patron is inquiring (DeGroote, Dorsch, Collard, & Scherrer, 2005); type of
resource used by librarian to answer (Goda & Bishop, 2008); and level or type of
librarian skill required (Warner, 2001).
By classifying reference questions according to these dimensions, the library-asinformation-system can improve its efficiency in answering questions. What is not
addressed is the issue of whether the questions that are posed are actually representative
of the questioner’s “true” question, in other words, whether the spoken question can
indeed elicit the answer or relevant documents that the questioner needs. Nevertheless,
there is an intuitive grasping of the social and epistemological nature of information in
some of the classificatory dimensions. For instance, when the library department reflects
a division along subject disciplines, it can be seen as a proxy for the questioners’ social
epistemological context. Also, the type of library information/resource patron is
inquiring about and type of resource used by librarian to answer reflect an understanding
of the importance of form in terms of criteria for justifying answers in different
disciplines.
2.2.5 Information retrieval facets. Information retrieval researchers similarly
seek to classify questions in order to improve the ability of the automated information
system to produce documents that are “relevant,” in the sense of containing partial or
complete answers to the questions. Unlike the reference encounter, which is often

25
described as more art than science due to the communicative intelligence that is required,
information retrieval as executed by databases, online public access catalogs, and digital
libraries automates the encounter, effectively rendering the “art” of reference into
“science” – and thus subject to scientific experimentation. To disambiguate the question
is the first step in knowing what an answer might look like and figuring out how to
automate the retrieval of relevant documents. Information retrieval research situates
questions in the implicit context of the automated information system. Beyond the
question’s subject, syntax, and conceptual presuppositions, the retrieval of relevant
documents is influenced by: the degree of ambiguity of question terms (Taylor, 1962);
specificity of meaning (Saracevic, 1980; Saracevic & Kantor, 1988; Cousins, 1992); how
well the user’s intent was formulated (Saracevic & Kantor, 1988); the clarity, complexity,
and searchability of the question (Saracevic & Kantor, 1988); and the question’s
thesaural status (Saracevic, 1980). Questions are classified according to their structural
components and then subjected to experiments designed to determine the effect of query
formulations on the retrieval of relevant results (Cousins, 1992; Keyes, 1996; White
& Iivonen, 2001), or the effectiveness of retrieval mechanisms given a specified question
with a known answer, as in the Text Retrieval Conference’s Question Answering (TReCQA) experimental track. These studies use large sets of data in which either questions or
answers can serve as controls for experimental or quasi-experimental research designs.
Despite their analog-digital differences, reference services and information
retrieval share the common orientation towards the information system as the context for
classifying questions. The reference and IR research classifies questions according to the
system’s ability to answer them. While IR and reference question classification may

26
produce more effective information systems, this approach foregrounds a major
limitation of the question-as-object paradigm: the functioning of the information system
takes precedence over the peculiar circumstances of the individual questioner. Little
regard is given as to whether the question accurately represents the questioner’s cognitive
information need and the contextual criteria of the search (search history, time limit,
whether it is an “imposed query” (Gross, 1995), etc.). This criticism of questionanswering research is found in both the reference and IR literature, in calls for question
negotiation (Taylor, 1968) or query clarification (Radford & Connoway, 2006) in
reference research, and for question disambiguation in information retrieval research.
Research in the Text Retrieval Conference’s Question-answering track (TREC-QA) has
found that building better mechanisms for information retrieval is well-suited to
answering “factoid” questions (akin to “ready reference” questions) that have a single
clear answer, but fails when put to the test of answering complex questions with multiple
and ambiguously-determined correct answers (Spärck-Jones, Robertson, & Sanderson,
2006). Spärck-Jones, Robertson, and Sanderson (2006) question the sensibility of TRECQA’s focus on unambiguous requests when the vast majority of real searches outside of
testing laboratories are known to be ambiguous requests, usually of two words or less. In
acknowledgment of this criticism, TREC LiveQA 2015 supplies participants with real
unanswered user questions, selected from the Yahoo Answers site (TREC LiveQA 2015,
n.d.). The common criticism is that there is too much attention to producing documents
perceived by the system to be relevant in answering the question and too little given to
the accuracy of question interpretation.

27
In summary, the reference and information retrieval research focuses on
improving the retrieval mechanisms – whether human or automated – which mediate
between questions and the selection of relevant documents or direct production of
answers. The research is two-fold: it studies the components or properties of the question
in order to build information systems for automated document retrieval and question
answering, and it studies the properties of the information system as the respondent to the
question (Table 3).

• Level of skill required to answer (Warner, 2001)

Table 3. Question-as-object: Research areas
Juxtaposing these two sides of the research, the picture that emerges is of the question in
relation to the information system as respondent. Accordingly, relevance is mostly
limited to subject or topic relevance and is defined as an objective property of the
question, as judged by researcher-observers or subject experts. The goal is to build more
efficient information systems, but in taking the question at face value, the complexity of
questioners’ cognitive processes of formulating and asking questions is overlooked. In
response, the question research takes a cognitive turn towards a greater focus on

28
questioners, their unique problematic situations, and the ambiguous nature of information
needs.

2.3 The problematic situation: Questioner-as-subject
The conceptual shift from question-as-object to questioner-as-subject parallels the
movement from the system-centered to user-centered perspective in library and
information science as documented by Dervin and Nilan (1986). In contrast to the
system-centered paradigm that sees users as passive receivers of information, the usercentered paradigm sees active users in individualistic situations. Talja, Tuominen,
and Savolainen (2005) describe the constructivist meta-theoretical approach as similarly
shifting researchers’ focus from objective to subjective reality. Constructivism
emphasizes the active role of the individual in making meaning from information through
the processes of information needs, seeking, and use (Talja, 1997). Individuals’
interactions with information are mediated by the pre-existing knowledge structures and
mental models that they have of the world. Constructivist theories emphasize that
“information is not a pill an individual can swallow in order to become informed, but a
plastic substance that can be shaped in many ways” by the personal meanings that
individuals attach to information as they make sense of reality (Talja, Tuominen, &
Savolainen, 2005, p. 83).
With a turn to from the objectivity of the information system to the individual
subjectivity of the questioner, the implicit context of the question becomes the
individual’s “problematic situation” (Schutz & Luckmann, 1974; Wersig, 1979), which
exposes questioners’ natural attitude or approach as insufficient in some way. The
questioner comes into view as a particularized and unique being in time and space. In

29
this context, questions are not objective requests for information. Questions are triggered
when particular individuals are faced with anomalous information (Belkin,
1978; Graesser & McMahen, 1993) or sense-making gaps (Dervin, 1992) in a specific
moment in time and space. What results is called an “information need,” and questions
are but imperfect reflections (Horne, 1983) or indications (Swigger, 1985) of these
information needs. Horne (1983) defines the question as “an observable behavioral
act reflecting [emphasis added] information need and proceeds from a series of cognitive
processes produced by the need ‘to know.’ The need ‘to know’ is the cognitive
information need which, when satisfied, creates understanding and the subsequent
altering of one’s state of knowledge” (p. 5). The need “to know” is subjectively defined,
with the question as the mechanism by which questioners indicate the inadequacy of their
knowledge state and invite respondents to assist in remedying the inadequacy.
2.3.1 Epistemic function. The cognitive turn in question research shifts focus
from the problems of information retrieval systems to the search for the “real” question
that accurately represents the questioner’s information need. The ambiguity of language
and its inability to transparently represent questioners’ cognitive information needs plays
a defining role in research on questioners-as-subjects. Interpreting questions in light of
existing knowledge structures and anomalous states of knowledge and sense-making gaps
– in essence, trying to “see” what the information need is, inside questioners’ heads,
despite what they say or do – is the core methodological problem for constructivist
studies of questions. Empirical studies of questioners-as-subjects can be divided into two
methodological approaches: first, the use of experiments to study questioning behaviors
in relation to controlled information needs (Graesser & McMahen, 1993; Horne, 1983;

30
Horne, 1990; Miyake & Norman, 1979; Stavri, 1996; Wildemuth, Bliek, Friedman, Miya,
1994), and second, the study of naturalistic sites of face-to-face question behavior such as
the reference interview (Taylor, 1968; White, 1989; White, 1998) or virtual questioncentered communities such as online community forums (White, 2000).
Utilizing experimental methodologies, several studies have tested the relationship
between the number of questions generated and the size of the information need. Miyake
and Norman (1979) find that the desirable maximum number of questions occurs when
people are well matched to the level of new information presented to them, suggesting
that people cannot cope with material too far beyond their present knowledge. Horne
(1983) is ambivalent about the relation between the number of questions and the size of
the information need. She finds some evidence that the number of questions decreases as
the information need is being satisfied, but also suggests that decreasing question
generation does not necessarily indicate a decreasing information need.
Other studies have investigated the relationship between the mode of
questioning and the state of inquiry. Horne (1983) provides empirical evidence linking
the questioning mode to the state of inquiry: open questions indicate a state of
information seeking, while closed questions indicate a state of information confirming,
denying, or choosing (Horne, 1983). Kuhlthau’s (1992; 2004) observation that questions
tend to be invitational in the early stages of the search process and indicative in later
stages is informative here: the “mood” of the questions is an important indicator of the
nature of the information need. Gross (1995) finds that answering imposed questions
involves differing information seeking stages and criteria for successful resolution than
self-generated questions. Questioning strategies are also shown to relate to problem-

31
solving ability, with problem-solvers asking more questions overall and more open-ended
information gathering questions, while non-solvers asked mostly hypothesis-testing
questions, even in the early stages of problem-solving (Horne, 1990). School media
specialists are particularly interested in the pedagogical implications of these findings,
given the ubiquitous use of questioning as tool of critical inquiry (Farmer, 2007).
Graesser, Lang, and Horgan’s (1988) semantic categorization of questions has
been utilized several times by information behavioral researchers to identify the
relationship between question type and the epistemic nature of the information
need (Table 4) and the communicative function of the question.

Table 4. Semantic categories in question taxonomy (Graesser, Lang, & Horgan,
1988)
By classifying large bodies of question interactions according to Graesser, Lang and
Horgan’s (1988) semantic categories, researchers can discern patterns in the types of

32
questions used and their expected functions. For instance, in a study of 610 questions
asked during the course of twelve reference interviews, White (1998) finds that clients
most frequently phrase questions as requests for information about a topic or for specific
resources. Information specialists most often ask verification questions to affirm their
interpretation of the inquirers’ information needs, or judgment questions in order to
solicit the opinion of the inquirers in relation to the direction of the search or to evaluate
results. In the medical domain, Stavri (1996) finds that in urgent case scenarios,
physicians tend to ask quantification questions – how long did the pain last? How much
medicine did you take? In cases where little information is given, physicians surprisingly
ask mostly verification questions, which Stavri surmises is an interpersonal tactic used
with patients who are not immediately forthcoming.
Despite the findings, Stavri (1996) questions the utility of Graesser, Lang and
Horgan’s (1988) taxonomy, sensing that some aspect of the information need gets lost in
the application of semantic function categories that would classify both of the following
statements as verification questions: “Did she try to commit suicide?” and “Is the pain
localized?” In contrast, Wildemuth, de Bliek, Friedman, and Miya’s (1994) experiment
classifies medical students’ questions not only by question type but also by subject
content and hypothetical answer source. They find that students most often ask
explanation questions about patient symptoms and appropriate treatments to the
hypothetical physician, but ask identification questions about toxins and references to the
hypothetical medical librarian. Classifying questions according to their semantic
function in combination with the stated subject and type of answer source provides a
more nuanced representation of the information need than use of the semantic function

33
alone. In Derr’s (1984) terms, the question is comprised of both subject and query; any
classification of questions that considers one without the other fails to grasp the entirety
of the information need that the question represents.
Additional facets affecting the selection of relevant documents in studies from the
questioner-as-subject paradigmatic approach include: the amount of research known to
the inquirer (existing knowledge structure) and size of the anticipated answer (Taylor,
1962); the extent to which users’ internal knowledge gave rise to the question
(Saracevic & Kantor, 1988; Gross, 1995); users’ estimations of the probability that public
knowledge existed on the question’s subject and type of application for which
information was being requested (Saracevic & Kantor, 1988); nature of the information
need (Horne, 1983; Kuhlthau, 1992; 2004); size of the information need (Miyake &
Norman, 1979; Horne, 1983;); problem-solving ability (Horne, 1990); and the
questioner’s developmental stage (Farmer, 2007). Extrapolating from this list of
questioner properties, the notion of relevance in the questioner-as-subject approach
adheres to Talja, Tuominen, and Savolainen’s (2005) characterization of relevance in the
cognitive constructivist meta-theoretical approach as situational and subjective. Relevant
documents must match the exact specifications of the questioner’s information need,
which means that it must meet the cognitive and material needs and constraints of the
individual questioner as he or she stands in relation to the task, problem, or situation at
hand.
2.3.2 Interpersonal function. A second subset of studies focuses on the
interpersonal dimension of asking questions, namely, the communicative difficulties
between questioners and respondents. In library science, the respondent generally takes

34
the form of an information intermediary, one who goes between the questioner and the
universe of potentially relevant documents. Information intermediaries may be persons
such as reference librarians, colleagues, family or friends; they also include information
technologies such library catalogs, indexes, keyword search tools, or advanced search
tools of digital libraries and databases. Studies focusing on the interaction between
questioners and information intermediaries acknowledge that, in addition to the difficulty
of recognizing one’s own information need, there is an added dimension of having to
communicate one’s information need to another being or entity with its own context, set
of values, and organizing principles. Asking a “particular question, in a particular way”
(Kearsley, 1976, p. 355) gains an additional meaning in this context: it gives an
indication of the assumptions that the questioner has about how the intermediary can or
should respond. A patron approaches the reference desk or search interface with a set of
preconceived notions, based on previous experience, of what constitutes “appropriate”
questions and the social and technological norms that surround the interaction. When
even partially incorrect, the preconceived notions can constitute a serious barrier to
communication. Even when correct, they can obfuscate the information need by
prioritizing the interpersonal dimension over the epistemic one.
In acknowledgment of the interpersonal dimension of questions, reference
librarians are trained in question negotiation (Taylor, 1968), a working backward from
the explicitly expressed question to the “ideal” question that would perfectly express the
questioner’s information need. Swigger (2007) makes the assertion that question
negotiation is a category of research unique to LIS. The “actual” question is one that
reflects the visceral need (Q1) in Taylor’s (1968) model of question formation (Table 5).

The actual, but unexpressed need for information (the visceral need)

The question as presented to the information system (the compromised need)

Table 5. Taylor’s (1968) four levels of question formation
Information intermediaries are taught to work backwards from the compromised
information need to the visceral need (Taylor, 1968), thus moving toward the
questioner’s “actual” information need. Questioner and respondent are on parallel tracks,
attempting to balance what they individually know or do not know about the question,
while simultaneously framing their communications in terms that they envision will be
comprehensible by the other within the expectations of what the information system can
provide.
Negotiating back to the visceral question from the expressed question requires
expertise in communication strategies in equal measure to search expertise and subject
knowledge. This is encompassed in the notion of the reference interview as a
communicative encounter (Radford, 1999). Studies of the reference encounter suggest
that librarians should use neutral questioning techniques (Dervin & Dewdney, 1985) and
ask “why” questions (Dewdney & Michell, 1997) to negotiate patrons’ information
needs. Lynch (1978) finds that question negotiation occurs in only 35 percent of
holdings transactions, 53 percent of substantive transactions, and 78 percent of “moving”
transactions in which the query changes from one category to another. Studies of
librarian-patron reference interaction have gone from strictly casting patrons as
questioners and librarians and respondents, to a realization that both librarians and
patrons ask and answer questions in the course of a communicative encounter.
Radford, Connaway, Confer, Sabolsci-Boros, and Kwon (2011) find that librarians clarify
questions in 74 percent of virtual reference encounters, usually in the beginning and end

36
stages of the encounter, and with 33 percent of clarifications utilizing open questions.
Users clarify as well, at a lesser rate of 23 percent and mostly during the middle of the
encounter. In terms of question subject, they find that users and librarians clarify in order
to seek information about the query topic and background – search history, extent, depth,
and type of resource needed. In terms of question function, users and librarians clarify in
order to verify understanding and correct misunderstanding. White (1989) finds that 82.9
percent of reference librarians utilize a question-oriented approach that focuses on
clarifying the question. However, she suggests that a dogged focus on question
negotiation may not be as effective as a needs-oriented approach (see also Cole,
Kennedy, & Carter, 1996) that focuses on clarifying the cognitive information need.
One of the major limitations of question research in the reference context is the
emphasis on rational information seeking. Observing this limitation, McFadyen (1975)
differentiates between informational and experiential modes of questioning. The
informational mode’s goal is to find specific facts and their relation to well-defined
theories, while the experiential mode encourages exploration of materials in order to
spark creative insights. He likens Taylor’s (1968) levels of questioning to the spectrum
of increasingly expressive (experiential) to designative (informational) questioning
modes, with humanistic languages on the expressive end of the spectrum and scientific
languages at the designative end. McFadyen (1975) recommends that reference librarians
use open-ended techniques and search strategies to foster insight, a “personal Gestalt,
rather than the analysis of a subject” (p. 9) sought by patrons with experiential inquiries.
This is a different type of information intermediation, less mechanistic in nature, in which

37
the ultimate role of the librarians is to ask questions in order to stimulate insight, rather
than to provide information or an answer.
In summary, the properties of question negotiation that have bearing on the
provision of relevant documents includes: the intersubjective agreement on the "visceral
need" (Taylor, 1968); presence of query clarification or question negotiation (Taylor,
1968; Lynch, 1978; Radford, Connaway, Confer et al., 2011); and mode of question
negotiation (informational vs. experiential questioning) (McFadyen, 1975). These factors
are reminders that questioning is a fundamentally an outward-facing phenomenon that
exists between the questioner and the universe of potentially relevant documents, as
mediated by additional intermediating technologies of communication including
librarians, classification systems, digital libraries and print collections. Relevance is still
subjective and situational, but it is influenced by the negotiation between the questioner
and the intermediary.
What these studies about the epistemic and interpersonal functions of questions
have in common is that they indicate various aspects of the questioner’s information
need, which is not easily expressible by the questioner in the first place, and then
potentially clarified – but potentially further confused – by intermediaries’ attempts at
question negotiation. As compared to the properties of the question and of the
information-system-as-respondent under the question-as-object paradigm (Table 5),
research from the questioner-as-subject paradigm focuses on the properties of the
questioner in relation to the problematic situation (Table 6).

• Size of anticipated answer (Taylor, 1962)
• Type of application for which information was being requested
(Saracevic & Kantor, 1988)

Table 6. Questioner-as-subject: Research areas
The questioner-as-subject perspective ceases to take the question at face-value and
instead tries to work backwards from the imperfectly stated question to the “ideal”
question that represents the cognitive information need that is representative of the
individual questioner’s problematic situation. The implicit dimension of the question
takes center stage, almost entirely eclipsing the explicitly stated question that is
immediately and forever suspect. As compared to research on the question-as-object and
its focus on inherent question structure and relation to the information system,
questioner-as-subject research interprets questions in relation to the properties of the
questioner, their existing knowledge structures and cognitive states, and of their unique
problematic situation. Both areas of research assume that the primary function of the
question is to communicate the questioner’s information need in order to retrieve
information that can fill the need.
But how does one specify a need for what one does not know? Based on a review
of experimental psychological research on question asking, Flammer (1981) proposes an
outline of a psychological theory of questions that proposes the information sought by the
question is fundamentally related, even dependent upon, the knowledge that the person
already has. The theory’s first postulate is that explicit information-seeking questions
concern information, or potential knowledge, that the questioner lacks. Postulate two is
that explicit information-seeking questions presuppose some available knowledge that
enables the questioner to formulate and select a “good” or “effective” question to solicit

39
the needed information. What the juxtaposition of the two propositions produces, he
observes, is a paradox: in order to ask what one does not know, one already has to know.
Questions concern information that the questioner lacks, but the formation of questions
also requires the questioner to presuppose that the information exists. In other words, the
ability to question assumes a certain level of pre-existing knowledge about the topic
because “to ask a question of someone implies more than a need for information. It also
implies a proper structure of knowledge with which to formulate the question and to
interpret the response (Miyake & Norman, 1979, p. 357). As Taylor (1962) writes, “By
asking a question, the inquirer imposes limits on the information acceptable as an answer.
The converse of this statement is the postulate that knowing what counts as an answer is
equivalent to knowing the question” (p. 393). Through interactions with information,
questioners’ understanding and formulation of the question itself becomes clearer and
more specific as the inquiry proceeds. Taken to the logical extreme, the question is only
perfectly known and expressible at the moment that the answer is known.
From the researcher’s perspective, there is a methodological paradox that
accompanies the conceptual one: the researcher can never know whether one’s
interpretation of the question is accurate because it is impossible to get unmediated
knowledge about cognitive states (Talja, 1997). As a result, researchers rely on measures
such as user satisfaction to judge whether questions have been answered in order to
compensate for the difficulty of measuring changes in knowledge structure, resolution of
problematic situations, or outcomes of information acquisition. This begs the question: if
the “actual” question can not be determined, or only determined in hindsight once an
answer has been established, how valid is it as a theoretical concept? The search for the

40
illusive “actual” question privileges internal reality and individualistic information
behavior over an intersubjectively constructed reality and information practice. Internal
reality and external reality are only metaphorically connected, with the mental sphere
opposed to social and material processes (Gergen & Wortham, 2001). In focusing on
individuals’ minds, knowledge structures, and cognitive concepts, language and
information become mentalized (Frohmann, 1990) and the mapping to external
observable behaviors is tenuous. As a whole, the cognitive viewpoint ignores the social
dimension of reality (Frohmann, 1990). The mechanisms by which individuals relate to
the social world and by which mentalities relate to materialities are absent.

2.4 The knowledge domain: Questioning-as-intersubjective
One way to overcome the question paradox and to move away from the notion of
the “actual” question as perfectly capturing an individual’s unique problematic situation
is to place questions and question formation in a social epistemological context: question
formation as an intersubjective practice rather than as an individual behavior. In response
to the methodological individualism and universal model building of the cognitive
viewpoint, collectivist researchers are reorienting the frame of reference to “knowledgeproducing, knowledge-sharing and knowledge-consuming communities (Jacob & Shaw,
1998, p. 42). The questioning-as-intersubjective approach has its roots in
what Talja, Tuominen, and Savolainen (2005) identify as the collectivist meta-theoretical
approach, which they observe has much in common with the socio-cognitive viewpoint in
LIS. In this approach, “knowledge” replaces “information” as the central concept.
Knowledge is constructed by individuals within a socio-cultural context, and as such, the
focus of study is not on individual minds but on the dialectical relationship between the

41
individual and the socio-cultural environment (Talja, Tuominen, & Savolainen, 2005).
Knowledge is culturally situated and exists between members of a knowledge domain. If
questioner-as-subject research assumes that “similar questions may have different
meanings depending on who asks them” (Gelven, 2000, p. 66), questioning-asintersubjective research presumes that different domains ask different types of questions
and ask them differently. Questions are not construed primarily as indications of
individuals’ problematic situations; rather, questions formulations are the products of
social norms and practices of inquiry. Questioning is a shared mode of communication,
delineating those who are interested in similar questions and methods of inquiry from
those who, though they may be interested in the same topic, ask different questions
and ask them differently.
In terms of Kearsley’s (1976) initial observation that questions convey
information as well as request it, the stated question conveys information about the
knowledge domain or domains in which the questioner is participating as well as their
stance towards or within the domain. In Fleckian (1986) terms, members of different
“thought-collectives,” for example, physicists, cabbalists, and mystics, have different
“thought-styles” which results in the situation where “what is obvious for one, is
nonsensical for the other” and where “a specific feeling of strangeness” characterizes
attempted communications between members of different thought-collectives (p. 82).
One has become a full-fledged member of a domain when thinking and speaking – and
asking and answering – in the manner of the domain is second nature. The more essential
a practice is to constituting the realm of sociality within the collective, the more implicit
is its performance, extending even to the most basic practice of perception, as well as to

42
the practices of attending, classifying, remembering, assigning meaning, and reckoning
the time (Zerubavel, 1999). The socio-cognitive nature of perceiving, attending, and
classifying are particularly important to formulating questions. Socialization into a
knowledge domain trains a member to perceive and attend to certain objects and
phenomena and not others; these ontological entities are potential subjects for questions.
The classification of these ontological entities is according to their features and relations,
and thus determines what can be asked about them. Domains’ questions, particularly
when compared across domains, reveal their socio-cognitive processes of perception,
attention, and classification.
The view of questioning as a socio-cultural practice is minimally present in LIS
research, often as a byproduct of an ethnographic or practice-oriented perspective. In
ethnographic studies of “information poor” populations such as janitors (Chatman, 1991),
single mothers (Chatman, 1986), female prisoners (Chatman, 1999), and elderly women
in a retirement community (Chatman, 1992), Chatman addresses the issue of why some
populations do not ask questions that, from a normative perspective, would result in
potentially beneficial information. What she finds is that in these “small worlds,” the
perceived risk of asking questions outweighs the potential benefits, such that not
asking becomes a sensible behavior within the culture. Individuals in small worlds
tightly control the flow of information into and out of the circumscribed world in order to
maintain a sense of control, even if this means maintaining a less-than-desirable status
quo. Chatman’s work demonstrates that questioning, even at the basic level of asking or
not asking, is a socio-cultural practice.

43
In those cultures that do ask, little is known about the process of enculturation by
which individuals become competent practitioners of questioning within a domain.
Cultural values, such as those related to questioning practices, are rarely explicitly
verbalized and taught; rather, they are embodied values that require firsthand experience
to learn over time. Mostly, they reside in cultural conventions and norms, which are
hardly ever explicitly stated but are learned by simply enacting the practices. Weinberg
(2010) illustrates how scholars of ancient Judaism accomplish this enculturation by
admonishing students for asking “irrelevant” questions and enumerating the manner in
which the question is irrelevant. The relevance of students’ questions is evaluated, first,
according to their topicality. Tractate Avot of the Mishnah characterizes a wise man as
one who “asks questions with relevance to the subject,” and the Talmud often asks, “How
does the question relate to the topic?” (Weinberg, 2010, p. 1). Relevant questions are
also characterized by their novelty, as when the Talmud frequently asks, “What are you
adding to the discussion?” In this particular questioning tradition, questions must be
topical and novel in order to be worth answering. Weinberg (2010) makes a singular
contribution to the question research in LIS by noting that “in information science, the
concept of relevance usually applies to answers, but in classic Jewish literature,
considerations of relevance are often applied to questions” (p. 2). Asking “relevant”
questions is an exercise of domain membership.
Outside of LIS, questions have been studied by researchers in education,
communication, and cultural anthropology, but with a focus on what the use of questions
indicates about the cultural context rather than for their epistemic purposes. Educational
anthropologist Brice Heath (1982) compares the use of questions by white teachers at

44
school and by black families in their homes and found that questions were used with
varying frequency, for different uses, and with different assumptions in the two cultural
settings, leading to communicative difficulties between white teachers and black students.
Cultural anthropologist Goody (1978), influenced by the work of Austin (1962) and
Searle (1969), describes the performative function of questions by the Gonja people of
Ghana, finding that the mode of the question (rhetorical, control, deference) is indicative
of the relative status of the questioner in relation to the respondent. In communication
research, Tracy and Naughton (1994) study the use of questions in academic
departmental colloquia, where questions are tools used to accomplish interpersonal
purposes such as supporting or challenging a presenter’s identity as a knowledgeable,
original, and intellectually sophisticated thinker. These studies support the questioningas-intersubjective paradigm by demonstrating that the formation of questions, their
functions, and the appropriate responses are relative to the cultural context; however, they
do not attend to the epistemic function of the question to any significant degree.
The existing research that takes a social epistemological view of the question
produces an understanding of the properties of the question in relation to the properties of
the knowledge domain (Table 7).

Table 7. Questioning-as-intersubjective: Research areas

45
Compared to the cognitively-oriented criteria for relevance in the questioner-as-subject
body of question research such as nature of the information need (Horne, 1983; Kuhlthau,
1992; 2004); size of the information need (Miyake & Norman, 1979; Horne, 1983);
questioner’s problem-solving ability (Horne, 1990), the above criteria reflect the social
epistemological nature of questioning. Relevance is redefined as epistemological and
domain-based, not situational and subjective. It is not sufficient for a document to fit the
individual questioner’s situation and subjective criteria, for in order for a knowledge
claim to be justified, it must pass the social and epistemological norms of the knowledge
domain. Only by referring to the domain context can one know if one’s question and the
ensuing answer are relevant.
In summary, the questioning-as-intersubjective paradigm overcomes the objectsubject dichotomy of the question-as-object and questioner-as-subject perspectives by
situating questions in the social epistemic context of a knowledge domain. In terms
of Kearsley’s (1976) question, of how questioners choose to ask a particular question in a
particular way, the questioning-as-intersubjective perspective suggests that questioners
choose to ask a particular question in a particular way relative to the knowledge domain
or domains that form the context of their inquiry. Whereas language poses a major
obstacle to clear communication of the “actual” question in the questioner-as-subject
paradigm, in this approach language is a shared resource among domain members. The
focus shifts from questioners trapped in uniquely individualized problematic situations, to
the questioning practices of knowledge domains, occurring via established norms of
communication. Methodologically, this allows researchers to study questions and inquiry
within a specific domain context or comparatively between domains. When placed

46
within this social frame of inquiry, individuals’ information seeking processes and the
design and use of information retrieval systems are contextualized according to the
appropriate domain or domains, rather than according to a one-size-fits-all model of
human-information interaction.
Questions convey information as well as request it. “Thus, when a person asks a
question,” writes Dillon (1990), “he is communicating something in addition to the very
question he asks. He communicates also what he assumes by (1) the question and (2) the
asking of it – his presuppositions and presumptions” (p. 131). By placing questions in
the context of domains’ differing questioning practices, the question paradox is
effectively inverted. Questions are transformed from a reflection of the inability of
questioners to express their information need, to a reflection of the ability to engage in
the work of a knowledge domain.
This dissertation explores the notion that questions are epistemic in nature and
that their social context is the epistemic culture known as the knowledge domain.
Knowledge domains are defined by Hjørland and Albrechtsen (1995) as “thought or
discourse communities, which are parts of society’s division of labor” (p. 400).
Operating from the questioning-as-intersubjective paradigm, questions are recast as social
epistemological tools of knowledge domain-based inquiry rather than objective
representations or cognitive indications of information needs. In order to test this
conception of questions, we will compare the questions found in three contrasting
knowledge domains around a single topic, “memory,” in order to compare different
domains question formulations and what the comparisons indicate about how to answer
and the domain assumptions upon which both question and answer are constructed.

2.5 Research goal and objectives
The goal of this dissertation is to develop a theoretical framework and
methodology for the identification and characterization of domain questions, as presented
in the knowledge products of inquiry. Once a theory-based methodology for identifying
and characterizing domains questions is developed, the questions can be compared in
order to determine the ways in which they differ by domain. This research will produce a
foundation for future comparison of domains’ document use for how domain definitions
of relevance differ in relation to the types of questions in the domain.
The empirical objective of this study is to characterize three different domains
according to the types of questions they pose about a common topic: “memory.” This
particular topic was chosen because of its interest to academics, professionals, and people
in everyday contexts: as a means of engaging with history and the past, as a theme in
literature, dance, and music; as a basic mechanism of learning; as associated with healthy
aging or impairment due to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s disease; and as a material component of computer systems. The domains of
neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering were chosen as the academic domains
producing the most research on “memory” and for encompassing several distinct contexts
in which memory is of interest.
The empirical objective is achieved via a comparative analysis of domains’
question formulations according to content and form. Comparative analysis is an
underutilized methodology in LIS, corresponding to a dearth in the depth of knowledge
of the formal dimensions of phenomena of human-information and human-document
interaction. This may be partially explained by the historical focus on subject expertise

48
in LIS, which has produced many studies of domain-specific behavior and practices, but
little knowledge of the structural aspects of humans’ interaction with documents. While
there is increasing interest in social epistemology and socially informed theoretical
perspectives as frameworks for understanding information- and document-related
practices, the methodological approaches to empirical study of these social phenomena
are still developing. The comparative methodology utilized herein is presented in the
social epistemologically informed vein of domain analysis, but with a central interest in
the phenomenon of questioning across domains rather than an in-depth understanding of
any single domain.

2.6 Research questions, general
The central research question is: How do knowledge domains’ question
formulations about a common topic compare and what do the comparisons convey about
the answers that follow and the assumptions that precede the questions? In order to
address the central question, the following general research questions will organize
inquiry into three stages of analysis:
I.

What questions do the neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
domains formulate about “memory”?

II.
III.

How do the domains’ question formulations compare?
What information do the comparisons between domains’ question formulations
convey about the answers that follow and the assumptions that precede the
questions?

The first question requires the development of methods for identifying knowledge
domains’ question formulations from the knowledge products of inquiry. The second

49
question requires categorization of the question formulations in order to produce question
profiles of each domain, which can then be compared in order to make visible the distinct
perspectives on producing knowledge about “memory” between and among the
knowledge domains. Finally, the third question directs a formal gaze at the phenomenon
of questioning by consideration of the structural relations between questions, answers,
and assumptions across the three domains. What results is increased knowledge of
domains’ question formulations, research on “memory” in three domains, and the
structure of questions as a tool of inquiry.

CHAPTER 3: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
If we were able to indicate the set of questions to which a given discipline tries to
give answers, then we would have a precise image of this discipline. In questions,
we may express everything that we know, what we do not know and what we
want to know at a given moment. (Brożek, 2011, p. 266)

3.1 Overview
While library and information science has long been interested in the questions
with which patrons and users approach information systems, research in this area has
been stalled by what has been identified by psychologist Flammer (1981) as a paradox of
question asking: in order to ask questions, one already has to know what can be known.
Questions concern information that the questioner lacks but also presuppose some
available knowledge (Flammer, 1981). Most of the seminal models of information
seeking reflect the tension of this paradox, which requires questioners to articulate what it
is that they do not know in terms of what is known, whether the unknown takes the form
of an “anomalous state of knowledge” (Belkin, 1978), “problematic situation” (Wersig,
1979), or sense-making gap (Dervin, 1992). The turn in library and information science
research from the information transfer model to a cognitive meta-theoretical perspective
shifted researchers’ attentions from objective to subjective reality, in which individuals’
interactions with information are mediated by pre-existing knowledge structures and
mental models of the world (Talja, Tuominen, & Savolainen, 2006). In turn, the question
is recast as an observable behavioral act that reflects information need (Horne, 1983) and
requires negotiation (Taylor, 1968), rather than a transparent request for information. But
by focusing on individuals’ minds, knowledge structures, and cognitive concepts,
language and information become mentalized and the social dimension of reality is

51
ignored (Frohmann, 1990). The present investigation seeks a way out of the question
paradox by presuming that knowledge is a social phenomenon and that a
reconceptualization of questions according to a social framework of reality is both a
theoretically and pragmatically fruitful endeavor.
In conducting a social epistemological investigation of questions, two questions
arise. First, what is the relevant context for a social conception of the question? Domain
analysis is employed for its characterization of the “knowledge-producing, knowledgesharing and knowledge-consuming communities (Jacob & Shaw, 1998, p. 42)” known as
“knowledge domains” (or simply, “domains”) that are the social epistemological context
for question asking and answering, among many other information practices and
phenomena. Hjørland (2010) proposes domain analysis as a meta-theoretical framework
for library and information science (LIS), one that proposes “domains,” rather than
individual cognitive structures, as the primary object of study. Domain analysis offers a
conceptualization of the domain as a social unit of knowledge production and the
foundational context for all knowledge practices, including the most fundamental practice
of inquiry.
Second, how should the question be conceptualized in relation to the social units
of knowledge production? A logical philosophical approach allows for the formal
elements of questions and answers to be identified and compared across vastly diverse
domains. Brożek’s (2011) erotetics, or theory of questions, provides a philosophical
conception of questions according to their logical structure and communicative function.
This conception offers a theoretical perspective with which to approach the documentary

52
products of domain knowledge production when seeking to identify the questions and
answers represented therein, even as their linguistic expressions differ.
The theoretical framework developed in this chapter is directed towards definition
of the domain analytic and erotetic concepts that are needed for the current investigation
of what questions indicate about domain assumptions related to knowledge production, as
guided by the specific research questions stated at the end of the chapter. Erotetic theory
provides a theoretical conception of the question as an epistemological tool, displaying
function and form, while domain analysis provides a theoretical conception of the
knowledge domain as the context of questions and inquiry. By comparing domains
questions according to logical structure and communicative functions, the ability of
question formulations to convey information about the answers that follow and the
assumptions that precede the question begins to emerge.

3.2 Domain analysis
3.2.1 Knowledge domains. First articulated by Hjørland and Albrechtsen (1995)
as a sociological-epistemological paradigm for library and information science, domain
analysis is a response to the methodological individualism of the cognitive viewpoint in
information science, which views individuals as rational information processors and
frames their information-related behaviors and practices as products of isolated user
needs and individuals’ abilities and constraints. In contrast, domain analysis posits that
cognition is fundamentally social, as individuals’ perceptions and thoughts are shaped
through the language use and material practices of the knowledge domain. Information
should be understood not in terms of individual cognitive structures but in the context
of knowledge-domains as thought communities such as scientific disciplines or scholarly

53
fields, or discourse communities such as those connected to a political party, a religion, a
trade, or a hobby (Hjørland & Albrechtsen, 1995; Hjørland, 2010). Knowledge domains
are the primary context for the production and justification of knowledge.
Hjørland (2010) notes that though domain analysis takes the domain as its
primary focus, it also has a view on individual cognition that can be described as sociocognitive and related to American pragmatists such as John Dewey and Russian
historical-cultural psychologists such as L. S. Vygotsky. When considering individuals,
they are considered from the socio-cognitive viewpoint, not as “users in general” but as
belonging to different cultures, to different social structures, and to different
domains of knowledge. Information producers, intermediaries, and users are
more or less connected in communities that share common languages, genres, and
other typified communication practices. There are different ‘semantic distances’
between the agents. (Hjørland, 2010, p. 1652)
In other words, reality cannot be understood by “the unprepared and isolated subject,” but
rather requires “the knowing subject, who is formed by history and culture, including the
concrete development in specific knowledge-domains” (Hjørland & Albrechtsen, 1995, p.
408).
3.2.2 Preceding and related social approaches in LIS.
Hjørland and Albrechtsen (1995) identify the explicit and latent contributors to the
formulation of domain analysis as: Patrick Wilson’s (1993) identification of specialties as
the relevant unit of study; Taylor’s (1991) Information Use Environments; Saracevic’s
(1975) subject knowledge view of relevance; and Froehlich’s (1989, 1994) view of
social epistemology as the foundation for information science. What these studies have

54
in common is that (1) they use comparative methods to identify patterns between groups,
and (2) they attend to the epistemological nature of the differences between knowledge
domains. Domain analysis thus applies theoretical and methodological rigor to what
information scientists and documentalists have traditionally done as a matter of training
and intuition: organize documents for access by domain members according to their
cultural practices and epistemic norms. Domain analysis re-contextualizes user studies
from a universal and cognitivist viewpoint of information behavior to its domain-specific
contexts, providing a framework within which findings from individual user studies can
be related to one another rather than standing in isolation. It is thus simultaneously a
return to the traditional principles of documentation and a unifying way forward for
library and information science. It hearkens back to the historical development of
information science by subject specialists, while also providing a theoretical view of
knowledge phenomena and integrating sub-disciplines such as bibliometrics, document
representation, document retrieval, information seeking (Hjørland, 2010).
3.2.3 Domain analysis as general foundation for LIS. Hjørland (2002a) claims
that the epistemological approach of domain analysis, though difficult and even
problematic due to its epistemological dimension, may be the only general foundation
that is possible for library and information science to establish, as epistemology forms an
interdisciplinary foundation for general theories of knowledge-related phenomena.
Library and information science professionals and scholars, he suggests, should not
compete for status with the subject experts whose intellectual products, processes, and
structures form the content of a unique domain. Domain analysis seeks to move
information science beyond the organization of the subject matter found in information

55
objects such as textual documents and recorded images, to the study of their production
and organization. Information scientists should be experts in the information resources of
the subject fields (Hjørland, 2010): the production, organization, and means of accessing
the knowledge products of the domain, rather than the subject content of the domain.
Through the study of individual domains and domains in relation to each other,
information specialists will be able to “formulate ‘general’ theoretical principles”
(Hjørland, 2010, p. 1649) about people and their interactions with information or the
phenomena that arise from the interaction between people and information. This interest
in the forms of human-information phenomena across domains, in addition to the
subject content of individual domains, can be seen as an antidote to what Wilson (1994)
sees as the failure of user studies to produce much valuable knowledge about how and
why people interact with information.
Hjørland (2010) identifies a number of areas as belonging distinctly to an
information science that is grounded in the sociological-epistemological perspective of
domain analysis: systems of communication, document types, genres, special languages,
special functions; who the knowledge producers are, who the intermediate actors are,
who the users are, and how all the agents, institutions, and services are connected in
social systems; relevance criteria/quality criteria for selecting documents, for indexing
documents, and for retrieving documents; and how the field is structured, or, should be
structured. Knowledge of these domain-relevant areas would distinguish information
professionals and scholars from subject specialists in a manner that supports Bates’
(1999) assertion that LIS is a meta-discipline that is orthogonal to conventional subjectbased academic disciplines.

56
3.2.4 Domain dimensions. Hjørland and Hartel (2003b) have broadly described
knowledge domains as having three main dimensions: ontological, epistemological, and
sociological. Each dimension will be discussed briefly before considering the
implications for characterizing domains based on the questions that they pose.
3.2.4.1 Ontological dimension. Of the three dimensions, the ontological
dimension is the most fundamental in defining a knowledge domain. Ontological
theories describe the nature of reality, or what sorts of things exist in the world.
A scientific discipline is normally defined by its object, for example, botany by
plants, zoology by animals, psychology by minds and behaviors, history by the
past, theology by God, etc. A theory of what objects exist in the world is called
‘an ontological theory.’ Domains are normally defined by ontological theories (at
least implicitly). (Hjørland, 2010, p. 1650)
The “objects” that exist in any given domain may be material objects, properties, events,
phenomena, processes, structures, or relations, among others. It is essential to understand
ontological theories when studying domains because ontology determines the possible
objects of study. Ontological concepts form the basis of systems of classification. LIS
has historically focused heavily on the ontological dimension of knowledge domains via
research about and practices of classification and indexing as the basic methods by which
documents are organized for access and retrieval. As domains’ understanding increases
and the view of reality changes, their ontological theories change (Hjørland, 2010), which
should be reflected in the classification systems and practices of indexing.
3.2.4.2 Epistemological dimension. If ontology can be characterized as a theory
of the objects that can be known, epistemology is the study of the nature, sources, and

57
limits of knowledge, or how one can know what one knows. The central epistemological
concern is with justification, what it means for a knowledge claim to be justified and
what makes justified beliefs justifiable. Epistemology is a fundamental concern of
domain analysis because knowledge domains’ beliefs regarding the nature, sources, and
limits of knowledge determine the manner in which they produce and circulate
knowledge. As such, it is fundamentally related to most library and information science
concepts such as relevance (Hjørland, 2002b), classification systems, genres, documents
(Hjørland & Hartel, 2003a), cognitive authority (Wilson, 1983), expertise, and credibility.
Hjørland (2002b, p. 268) writes, “The cognitive view tends to psychologize the
epistemological issues (to study knowledge by studying the individual), but what is
needed is the socio-cognitive view, which tends to epistemologize psychological issues
(to see individual knowledge in a historical, cultural, and social perspective).” From the
viewpoint of the social epistemological position, domain analytic scholars can understand
the why behind the how of the inquiry process. Different epistemological stances are
differentiated based upon the relation between the knower and the known.
Epistemological dimensions may be uncovered by studying domains singly as
they change over time, or comparatively at a single point in time, as in the use of
bibliometrics to visualize the relationships between multiple domains (Hjørland & Hartel,
2003b). The operative commonality between these methodological approaches is
comparison across time or space: the epistemological dimension is revealed in between
knowledge domains, or a single domain across different points in time. The methodology
employed in this dissertation is of the former kind: comparison of multiple domains in

58
relation to a common topic. A justification of the comparative approach will be detailed
in Chapter Four, Research Methodology and Design.
3.2.4.3 Sociological dimension. The sociological dimension of domain analysis
distinguishes it from currently dominant cognitive approaches in human information
behavior, hearkening back to the traditional focus of documentalists on organizing
information for specific user groups, but from a meta-perspective of knowledge domains
as the basic context for human-information interaction. Hjørland and Hartel (2003b, p.
242) broadly describe the sociological dimension as being “about groups of people
working with some objects by applying some approaches.” This broad characterization
allows knowledge domains to be viewed as a purely analytic construct as well as a
pragmatic one, in the sense of knowledge domains as “parts of society’s division of
labor” (Hjørland & Albrechtsen, 1995). Hjørland (2000) asserts that epistemological
positions such as empiricism, rationalism, historicism, and pragmatism, should be
considered as the most generalizable explanatory models of relevance and informationseeking patterns, which leads Fry and Talja (2004) to criticize domain analysis as
privileging epistemological considerations over social factors such as reputation building
and reward systems within specialties or disciplines, which they assert are equally
influential in shaping scholarly communication structures. Fry and Talja’s (2004) study
of intellectual fields finds that information practices in the digital realm are shaped by the
dynamic interrelationship of social and epistemic characteristics that constitute the
culture of the intellectual field.
Here we see two different conceptions of the “social” in social epistemology,
differentiated by the degree to which the “social” exists apart from the “epistemic.” Fry

59
and Talja’s (2004) conception of the social is a mediating influence or force on the
epistemic process of inquiry, as, for instance, when researchers formulate questions based
on available funding, departmental resources, publishing or job opportunities. Hjørland’s
(2000) view melds the social and epistemic completely, concerned as it is with the social
foundation of the epistemic processes of inquiry, as belonging to thought or discourse
communities, rather than the ways in which social pressures mediate or moderate
individual inclinations. The social epistemic view of domains is exemplified by
Knorr Cetina’s (1999) research on epistemic cultures, which directs researchers’ attention
to the social nature of knowledge production as evidenced in the comparison between the
empirical, technological, and social machineries of high-energy physics and laboratory
biology. These two conceptions of the sociological dimension occupy different positions
along the spectrum of tacit performance of domain membership: in the previous case,
behavior and thought are consciously adjusted to the norms and practices of the domain
while in the latter, the behaviors and thoughts are sub-consciously adherent to the
domain.
3.2.5 Defining domains. Researchers working from the domain analytic
viewpoint have proposed many different ways of identifying the domain as the unit of
analysis. Hjørland and Albrechtsen’s (1995) initial description of domains as disciplines,
trades, discourse communities, working groups, or thought communities indicates that the
concept of a domain is flexible and ultimately depends upon what is most empirically
useful. Some other examples of domains include: scientific discipline or scholarly field,
or a discourse community connected to a political party, religion, trade, or hobby
(Hjørland, 2010, p. 1650).

60
While single-domain studies tend to rely solely on the ontological dimension and
to define domains by the subjects and topics that comprise the domain’s boundaries of
knowledge production, comparative studies bring attention to the epistemological and
sociological differences between domains as well as the obvious ontological differences.
There are several well-known typologies dealing specifically with academic domains,
such Becher’s (1989) characterization of academic tribes and territories in which the
subject content is related to the cognitive and social characteristics of those in the
discipline, or Biglan’s (1973) typology of academic disciplines according to the axes of
hard-soft, pure-applied, and life-nonlife. In LIS, Talja and Maula (2003) choose domains
for empirical comparison that differ structurally in terms of size, degree of scatter, and
relevance criteria. Fry (2004) takes the intellectual field as the structural and
communicative unit of analysis, but moves between perspectives of the scholarly
community, the intellectual field, and the discipline as relevant and interrelated social
configurations as embodied in teaching programs, journals, conferences, and funding
agencies. Fry and Talja (2004) and Talja, Vakkari, Fry, and Wouters (2007) use
Whitley’s (1984) theory of the social and intellectual organization of the sciences, which
integrates the epistemic consideration of task uncertainty and social consideration of
mutual dependence to define domains as specialist fields. Tennis (2003) offers a
structural definition of domain, operationalizing domain along two axes: areas of
modulation (scope) and degrees of specialization (intension/extension), in order that
knowledge produced by domain analysts can be transferable. Informed by her focus on
interdisciplinary information seeking, Palmer (1999a) questions the utility in these
attempts to forge consensus on a definition of domains, suggesting that domains are

61
continually changing in size and shape as they are constructed and modified by their
participants. She suggests, based on her own empirical study of interdisciplinary
information seeking (Palmer, 1999b), that domains are most helpfully defined in relation
to the particular types of research problems being addressed rather than the subject area
of the researcher’s training.
3.2.6. Domains as the context for questions. This dissertation compares three
domains’ question formulations on a common topic, “memory,” in order to explore the
nature of questions as tools of domain-based inquiry. Becher (1979) asserts that
academic disciplines are distinguishable by the questions they ask. This dissertation
proposes that knowledge domains, of which academic disciplines are one type, are
distinguishable by the questions they ask. Particularly in the realm of scholarly inquiry,
questions should be precisely formulated in such a manner that they reflect, both
explicitly and implicitly, the ontological, epistemological, and social dimensions of the
domains from which they emerge. In contrast with the cognitive viewpoint, which views
question formation as an individual cognitive process reflecting the mental state and
knowledge structures of the questioner, a social epistemological perspective such as is
offered by domain analysis views question formulations as domain products and tools of
inquiry.
The importance of understanding the domain context of the question is
demonstrated by the following example. In a review of the topic of social epistemology
in LIS, Fallis (2006) offers the following analysis of a potential intelligence test question
as an argument for the importance of a social constructionist understanding of
knowledge:

62
There are five birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one of these birds. How many
birds are left on the fence?” Some people (and cultures) will say four because five
minus one is four; others will say none because when you shoot one, the rest will
be scared off and fly away. But really, these are two different questions with
different answers: (1) What is five minus one? Four; and (2) What happens when
you shoot at birds? They fly away. (Fallis, 2006, p. 491)
Here we see that the answer formulated in reply to the question depends entirely upon the
domain context. The difference between the two answers can be attributed to the
differing domain contexts, of groups of like-minded people, or cultures. The domain
contexts can also be defined in terms of academic disciplines. The first question and
answer (What is five minus one? Four.), takes as its domain context the discipline of
mathematics, in which the bird scenario illustrates the mathematical principle of
subtraction. The second question and answer (What happens when you shoot at birds?
They fly away), may take as its domain context the discipline of zoology, or the subfield
of etiology, the study of animal behavior, in which the question directs the respondent
towards observation of how the animals behave in response to a stimulus. Different
academic domains will approach the same data, situation, or topic with different
assumptions about what is of interest and what can be known, which manifest in the
formulation of distinct questions and the subsequent production of equally distinct
answers.
Whereas language can be a barrier to communication across domain boundaries, it
is a shared resource within domains. Fallis’s (2006) example demonstrates that the more
precisely the question is worded in accordance with the habitual language use of the

63
domain, the easier it is to identify the questioner’s domain, to orient inquiry in
accordance with domain norms, and to communicate the domain-appropriate answer.
This is similar to Taylor’s (1968) injunction to negotiate back to the “visceral”
information need from the “compromised need,” but shifts the contextual frame from the
individual questioner to the knowledge domain. The “ideal” question is the one that most
precisely articulates the individual’s indeterminate situation in terms that comply with
domain norms and practices. Fallis’s (2006) example suggests that different domains ask
different questions, and that understanding the assumptions of the domain context is
necessary for formulating an appropriate reply. By re-conceptualizing the “ideal”
question with reference not to the individual’s mental model but to domains’ question
formulations, information intermediaries can negotiate the formation of more accurate
questions.
Having established the theoretical rationale for the knowledge domain as the
context for questioning, the following section outlines the theoretical framework for
approaching questions as social epistemological tools of inquiry and the problem of
implicit questions in scholarly inquiry.

3.3 Erotetic Theory
The logical philosophical approach offers a conceptualization of questions that
sheds light on the central dilemma in the study of questions in inquiry, particularly as it
pertains to the knowledge products of inquiry: how can the questions that drive inquiry be
identified? Rarely do the knowledge products of inquiry state the questions that drive
inquiry in direct interrogative form. The nature of the domain as a site for knowledge
production is that the things that are most fundamental to the domain need not be stated;

64
what is stated are those things that require validation or justification. Accordingly, the
questions that drive inquiry remain implicit while the knowledge claims produced by the
question-driven inquiry are explicitly stated as declarative expressions of findings,
results, or arguments. Questions are fundamental to inquiry but, to varying degrees
depending on the practices of the domain, they are largely unstated. The tension between
the import of the question in organizing inquiry and its tacit status as a marker of domain
competence makes questions a difficult subject for empirical research.
The erotetic logical approach enables the development of a method for identifying
the implicit questions that organize inquiry from the knowledge products of the inquiry in
diverse domains. Brożek (2011) proposes a general theory of questions consisting of “a
semiotic analysis of questions and answers, their components, their grammatico-logical
form, and the relations between elements of erotetic situation” (p. 17), or the types,
structures and functions of question-related objects. The nature of the application of
erotetic theory to the current study of the social epistemological nature of questions relies
upon the ability of logical philosophical analysis to be applied equally to questions
spoken by an individual as to those “spoken,” metaphorically, by a collective such as a
knowledge domain. Furner (2012) notes that there is an obvious analogy to be made
between the logical philosophical analysis of a sentence as a sequence of words, and of a
document, as a sequence or aggregation of sentences. This is, in fact, the lens through
which erotetic theory is here applied, to the knowledge products of inquiry (dissertation
abstracts) as sequences or aggregations of sentences. The knowledge products are
analyzed as multi-sentence expressions of the question that motivates the research and the
answer produced by it. A theoretical conceptualization of the question from the logical

65
philosophical approach provides guidelines for the identification of the implicit questions
driving scholarly inquiry from the knowledge products of research according to their
communicative function and logical structure.
3.3.1 Communicative function of questions. Brożek (2011) defines
communicative functions as connecting classes of expressions to a typical, abstracted
type of experience, which allows a sentence to be meaningful and comprehensible to
others. The expressions in class K are distinguished by the structural properties of the
expression and the psychological properties it attributes to the speaker. Questions,
Brożek (2011) asserts, are a special class of expressions with a distinct communicative
function: “Questions are expressions suitable for communicating experiences consisting
of gapped cognitive pictures of the world and the will to fill gaps in them” (p. 53).
Structurally, questions are usually marked by a question mark or its spoken counterpart,
rising intonation, as well as an inverted word order. Psychologically, the experience
being communicated by questions can be described as a confluence of three factors: the
cognitive, incognitive, and volitional (Brożek, 2011).
First, the cognitive factor of the experience expressed by the question is the
conviction that there exists an adequate picture of the situation (Brożek, 2011), what
Dewey (1938) would call the “determinate situation.” When Flammer (1981) observes
that one must know enough to ask, he is referring to this cognitive factor: the questioner
must “know,” in the sense of believing, that there is an adequate picture of the situation.
Without the conviction that there exists an adequate picture of the situation, the
questioner has no grounds for posing the question. Second, by posing a question, the
questioner indicates a realized ignorance or gap in the picture (incognitive factor)

66
(Brożek, 2011). This realized ignorance is what motivates inquiry towards the filling of
the gap. The notion of information seeking behavior as resulting from perceived gaps in
situations is already present in LIS, most notably in Dervin’s (1992) Sense-Making
Theory, in which information seekers experience a gap in a situation that requires the use
of information, in the form of ideas, attitudes, beliefs, emotions, intuitions, memories,
narratives, etc., to bridge the gap in reality and continue on in their sense-making.
Emphasis on the formulation and expression of this cognitive gap in a manner that
comprehensibly solicits the needed information constitutes a significant focus of the
question research in LIS.
The third psychological factor of questions is the volitional factor, the will to fill
the gap or to complete the picture of the situation (Brożek, 2011). In Mackay’s (1960)
terms, questions are both indication – in erotetic terms, of the conviction that there exists
an adequate picture of the situation and that there is a gap in the questioner’s picture –
and invitation to a respondent to fill in the gap. The response may be sought in the
testimony of others or by recalling what one already knows (Hookway, 2008), but
without the invitation to respond, the expression is not a question.
The combination of cognitive, incognitive, and volitional psychological factors
distinguishes questions from declarative and imperative expressions as having a distinct
communicative function. Consider the difference between (1) and (2).

Sentence (1) expresses the speaker’s experience of a gapped cognitive situation, not
knowing whether or not the respondent enjoys classical music, with a will to fill in the

67
gap, expressed as an invitation to respond. In addition to the psychological properties
attributed to the speaker, the expression is structurally marked by a question mark and
inverted word order. Sentence (2) is a declarative expression, defined by Brożek (2011)
as a sentence that says something about the epistemic states and acts (convictions
judgments, doubts, assumptions, etc.) of the sender. It expresses the same cognitive gap
as in (1), but without a will or invitation to fill it. Not all declarative expressions express
a cognitive gap, but those that do, as (2) does, are not technically questions as they lack
the volitional factor. However, the type of declarative expression in (2) is colloquially
considered a passive or indirect form of question.
Sentence (3) is in the class of orders, or imperative sentences, which have the
volitional factor, but do not express a cognitive gap.

Order expressions are used to communicate the will to realize one’s picture of reality, to
make reality correspond to the picture that one has of a situation (Brożek, 2011), in this
case, a will to make the questioner’s cognitive picture (that the respondent enjoy the
book) correspond to reality. The comparison between the three types of expressions
demonstrates that questions are differentiated as a unique expression type by having all
three psychological factors: the cognitive and incognitive, which produce a gapped,
picture of reality, and the volitional, a will to fill in the gap (Brożek, 2011). Questions
are indication and invitation (Mackay, 1960).
3.3.2 Logical structures of questions. Within the class of expressions known as
questions, there are two basic logical structures: completive and hypothetive (Brożek,
2011). The structural types are differentiated by the experiences that motivate the asking

68
of the question. Question (4) is a completive question from one of the literature
dissertation abstracts in the sample, which functions to communicate the experience of a
cognitive gap and the will to fill it:
(4)

How are memory and history embedded in images of the built environment

(L11)?
Completive questions have three explicit parts: a question particle (who, what, when,
where, why, how) and question mark, which together constitute the “query,” and the
“remainder” that defines the unknown (Brożek, 2011). This conception converges with
Derr’s (1984) conception of question structure as having two parts: the subject, the object
in the world4 about which an epistemic determination is being made, and query, the type
of epistemic determination. In colloquial terms, completive questions are open-ended
questions. They identify a gapped cognitive picture and issue an invitation for
respondents to answer. The gapped picture in (4) asks how – by what manner, way, or
means – memory and history are embedded in images of the built environment.
A hypothetive question communicates the experience not only of the will to fill a
gapped picture of a situation, but a hypothesis of how to fill the gap (Brożek, 2011).
Statement (5) is a hypothesis question from the sample of neuroscience dissertation
abstracts:
(5)

Is long-term memory distorted by information erroneously retrieved from
episodic memory (N8)?

By posing (5), the questioner expects the respondent to verify the hypothesis. The
hypothetive question, a type of closed-ended question, is seeking its own verification.
4

Brożek (2011) would describe it as a “picture of the world” rather than “object in the world,” which is
preferable for its broadness in including non-object subjects.

69
Hypothetive questions are constructed by inversion of the subject and verb5 (“Stress
impairs memory updating” inverts to “Is memory updating impaired by stress?”), unless
logically structured as whether-questions, as in (6):
(6)

Whether long-term memory is distorted by information erroneously retrieved
from episodic memory. (N8)

Structurally, hypothetive questions are composed of two parts: a question signal, such as
inversion plus a question mark, and a hypothesis of how to fill the cognitive gap. For
both (5) and (6), the hypothesis is that long-term memory is distorted by information
erroneously retrieved from episodic memory. The question signal in (5) is inversion plus
a question mark, while in (6) it is the whether- question indicative.
Selective questions pose a special case of hypothetive questions in which multiple
hypotheses are being put forth to fill the gap of the picture of the situation. Consider the
question in (7):
(7)

Which is most effective for the study of the expression and extinction of
conditioned fear memory: foot shock, immobilization or predator exposure, alone
and in combination?

In this case, the hypotheses to fill the gap of the picture of the situation are indicated by
the methods that have been chosen for testing: foot shock, immobilization, and predator
exposure, either alone or in combination. In effect, (7) proposes six hypotheses to fill the

5

At least, they are in English. Brożek (2011, p. 131) notes that in other languages such as Polish, inversion
is not needed because there is a specialized operator ‘czy’ that occurs at the beginning of hypothetive
questions.

70
gap of the picture of the best method for the study of fear extinction using mice6 and
expects to verify that one of the six can be identified as most effective.
3.3.3 Scientific domains’ questions. Brożek (2011) employs the term “scientific
discipline” to describe the subset of knowledge domains that engage in scholarly inquiry,
rather than the narrower set of scholarly domains that employ the scientific method. She
identifies scientific disciplines as composed of:
•

Problems - the set of questions to which representatives of a given discipline try
to find an answer or to which an answer is already given in this discipline;

•

Methodological directives – rules of how to resolve problems; how to find
answers to scientific questions; and

•

Theories – ordered sets of answers to scientific questions.

Brożek’s “scientific disciplines,” or what this dissertation terms “scholarly knowledge
domains,” should be reflected in the questions they ask and how they answer them.
According to Brożek’s (2011) definition of a question as an expression of the will to fill a
gap in a picture of a situation, the question arises as to who is the subject whose will is
being expressed in scholarly questions. Scholarly questions differ slightly from
interpersonal questions by the definition of the “subject” exerting volition through the
question. The will to fill in the gap in the picture of reality ultimately belongs not to the
individual questioner, but to the scholarly community or knowledge domain on behalf of
which the questioner is conducting the inquiry. The questioner expresses the scholarly
community’s will to fill in a gap in the picture of the situation, or what Dewey (1938)
6

The six hypotheses ask, which is more effective: foot shock or immobilization; foot shock or predator
exposure; immobilization or predator exposure; foot shock and immobilization or predator exposure; foot
shock and predator exposure or immobilization; and immobilization and predator exposure or foot shock?

71
refers to as determination of an indeterminate situation, as defined by their disciplinary
lens. A precisely formulated domain question expresses “everything that we know, what
we do not know and what we want to know at a given moment” such that it is semioticologically correct, properly posed, and resolvable according to domain norms (Brożek,
2011, p, 266). A domain’s indeterminate picture of a situation and the definition of the
gap in relation to the situation, even if a situation shared with other domains, will differ
according to the methodological directives and theories of the discipline. The implication
is that different domains should ask different questions.
Scholarly questioning also differs from everyday question situations according to
the receiver and respondent of the question (Brożek, 2011). Whereas in everyday
questioning the receiver of the question is generally another person who replies with a
verbal response, scientific questioning is received by the part of reality that is being
examined. Natural scientific inquiry is a controlled and testable approach to studying
natural reality, while humanistic inquiry studies the reality of products of human activity
(Brożek, 2011). The respondent to the scholarly questions is the reality that is being
studied, whether nature or the products of human activity, as spoken for by the inquirer.
Here, Brożek points out, nature and the products of human activities are the
“respondents” only in a metaphorical sense; in fact, the scientist is responding to herself
by interpreting the data through the lens of the adequately formulated question. This is
designated as “the solitary case” of questioning (Hookway, 2008), where the questioner
and respondent are one and the same.
3.3.4 Answers. One of the capacities one must possess to produce knowledge, in
addition to the capacity for formulating questions, is an ability to recognize whether

72
something is an answer to a given question (Hookway, 2008). The structure of the
question indicates what counts as a correct answer: “it is an answer that uniquely picks
out the member of the universe of interrogative quantification who satisfies the attributive
presupposition of the question” (Hookway, 2008, p. 7). The logical structure of the
completive question in (4) identifies the universe of possible correct answers: “how”
indicates that the answer should demonstrate the manner in which something happens or
is achieved, while the rest of the question identifies what it is that is happening: the
references to Fénelon’s name are reflecting and affecting cultural memory. In Dewey’s
(1938) terms, the manner in which the situation is indeterminate indicates the
determination that needs to be made. The answer to (4), which is presented as the thesis
statement, is:
(8)

Fénelon's name appears hundreds of times in the literature of the long nineteenth
century, and the context surrounding his name offers a view of the posterity of
Fénelon, which contradicts what is available through an investigation of
biographies and academic studies of his theological and literary work alone. I
show through my dissertation that memory is not only a reconstructive process,
but a referential one. (N8)

The answer shows how the changing nature of references to Fénelon’s name marks the
cultural shift in the treatment of memory, from being solely referential, as found in
biographies and academic treatments, to reconstructive, as called upon in literary texts as
a vehicle for the culture to deal with the past.

73
In (5), the logical structure of a hypothetive question constricts the possible
answers to “yes” – long-term memory is distorted by information erroneously retrieved
from episodic memory – or “no.” The answer to (5) is an indirect “yes”:
(9)

Retrieved information is preferentially stored and accessed in memory, which can
have both beneficial and impairing effects on long-term memory (N8).

Brożek (2011) defines answers, in the traditional logical sense, as “sentence-types, being
in certain syntactico-semantic relations to [this] question” (p. 207), while emphasizing
the communicative functions of the answer sentences. This communicative function of
answers is what differentiates direct answers from indirect answers. Direct answers
communicate how to fill the gap in the picture of the situation, while indirect answers do
not directly fill the gap, but provide information that enables the questioner to fill it. The
answer in (9) provides information that enables the questioner to answer the question in
(5) with a yes – long-term memory is distorted by erroneously retrieved memory. Other
types of answers, as defined by their communicative senses, are partial answers (only
partially fills the gap), limiting answers (limits the scope of the gap), correcting answers
(corrects the picture of the situation), modifying answers (modifies the picture of the
situation), and exhaustive answers (provides all possible accurate ways to fill the gap).
How does a respondent know which types of answers are acceptable? Again,
familiarity with the domain context is needed in order to understand what type of answer
the question requires, just as domain knowledge is needed to determine the proper
emphasis of a question. Hookway (2008) identifies the role of context in answering
questions as well as understanding them. For any given correct answer, he asserts, there
are multiple ways of presenting the answer, some of which may meet the questioner’s

74
needs, while others do not, or some better than others. Answering questions requires the
respondent to know what counts as a correct answer, and what is the best manner of its
presentation. In the context of the literature domain, the respondent knows that the
question in (4), of how the references to Fénelon’s name are reflecting and affecting
cultural memory, can be answered by asserting that memory is both referential and
reconstructive. Furthermore, relevant answers are those that respond to the
“conversational context” (Hookway, 2008, p. 10) by attributing “salience” to some
aspects of the answer. In the “conversational context” of literature, the relevant answer is
that memory is “not only referential, but reconstructive in nature (emphasis mine)” (L9).
This indicates that the questioner presumes that the domain largely views memory as
referential and that the additional property of being reconstructive in nature adds a new
dimension to the domain discourse.7
3.3.6 Assumptions. Every question is based on some convictions about the
gapped picture of the situation from which the question arises, which constitute the
background of a given question (Brożek, 2011). Brożek (2011) identifies these
convictions, the assumptions of the question and the presuppositions that analytically or
semantically follow from the assumption, as comprising the cognitive content of the
question. The assumptions and presuppositions can be reconstructed purely on the basis
of the structural form of a question. For example, the completive question (4) (“How are
memory and history embedded in images of the built environment?”) can be said to
express the assumption that memory and history are embedded in images of the built

7

Whether the questioner’s presumption about the domain’s state of knowledge regarding the properties of
memory is correct does not affect the logical interpretation of what constitutes a relevant answer.

75
environment, as well as the presuppositions that there exist images of the built
environment and that memory and history can be embedded in them.
Brożek (2011) further defines the cognitive context of the question as “some
convictions of a questioner which do not belong to the cognitive content of a question”
but as “the convictions possessed by a questioner at the moment of asking” (p. 197), such
as, in everyday situations, convictions about the resolvability of the question or the
epistemic authority of the respondent. In the scholarly realm, the epistemic context may
be interpreted as the set of currently accepted theories and the set of methodological
directives of a given discipline (Brożek, 2011). Question (4) possesses assumptions
related to the methodology for approaching the literary texts and the literary theories that
inform the argument constructed from the textual analysis.
The concept of questions having assumptions related to cognitive content and
cognitive context are of interest in their possible application at the domain level of
discourse. What are the assumptions of domains’ questions relative to the questions’
content and context? Assumptions related to the content of domains’ questions are
ontological in nature, constituting the phenomenon of interest in terms of the domains’
beliefs about the nature of reality, its entities, features, and relations. Question (4) can be
examined for what it indicates about the nature of memory as an object of literary
interest. By the question structure, we can deduce that memory has some relation to
history, and that it can be embedded in images. Some ontological assumptions, or
domain convictions about the question content, can be identified by the question structure
alone.

76
Other convictions, those related to the epistemic context, are more tacit in nature
and only emerge in comparison with other questions. Hookway (2008) defines the
context of an utterance as “an evolving body of presuppositions, of things that are taken
for granted by the participants, and, perhaps, are known to function as a body of shared
background knowledge” (Hookway, 2008, p. 13). In both scientific inquiry and everyday
inquiry, knowing which questions are relevant, how to reply, and what constitutes a
“relevant” or “good” answer, is largely a matter of tacit knowledge. Jardine (1991)
argues that scientific inquiry relies on “tacit criteria by which [scientists] assign burdens
of proof and judge the competence and worth of other practitioners and their findings,
tacit conventions of how to present materials to other practitioners, and the role of
‘habitual competence in the use of instruments’ in guiding experimental work (p. 90).
This is the domain context, composed of propositions that are taken as certain, or at least
uncontroversial, to those operating inside its boundaries. These tacit assumptions are best
made visible by comparing domains’ question formulations, as illustrated by Fallis’s
(2006) above example of shooting at birds on a fence. The differing set of assumptions
related to the inquiry and the production of knowledge between the domains of
mathematics and zoology become highlighted when their question variants relative to a
common scenario are juxtaposed. Only in comparison to other questions, particularly
those in other domains, will the epistemic context, or the domain’s epistemological
assumptions, emerge.

3.4 Identifying and classifying questions in scholarly domains
Questions, according to erotetic theory (Brożek, 2011), are those expressions that
communicate the experience of a gapped cognitive picture of reality and the will to fill it,

77
structured in a manner that reflects the experience motivating the question (whether one
has a hypothesis of an answer or not) and indicates expectations about the form and
content of an answer. But the question, despite – or, given the tacit nature of much
domain knowledge, because of – its central communicative and logical role in inquiry,
often remains implicit in the knowledge products of inquiry. Erotetic theory offers a
theoretical conception of the question according to its communicative function and
logical structure that provides guidelines for recognizing the question when directly
stated, or deriving it when it is implicit.
The characterization of the question as an expression with certain communicative
functions and logical structures is employed in conjunction with Hookway’s (2008)
premise that knowledge sentences have indirect question correlates in order to identify
the implicit questions of scholarly research from the knowledge products of inquiry. The
definition of knowledge as a relation between the agent and the question (or, from a
social epistemological perspective, between a knowledge domain and a question) allows
Hookway (2008) to assert that knowledge sentences often have indirect question
correlates. Hookway provides the example of the knowledge sentence, “John knows that
71 is a prime number,” which has an indirect question correlate, whether 71 is a prime
number. The indirect question correlate to “John knows how the internal combustion
engine works” is, “how does the internal combustion engine work?” This proposition,
that knowledge sentences have question correlates, is the key to identifying the implicit
questions that organize scholarly inquiry. Questions, when not explicitly stated, can be
identified as complements to the knowledge claims by reinserting volition into the
declarative statement by the method of inversion and insertion of a question particle

78
(who, what, when, where, how, why, which, whether). Take the following literary topic
statement:
This dissertation concerns the fate of a particular object of French collective
memory, François Fénelon, investigating how references to his name in
nineteenth-century literature through to the writings of Proust reflect and affect
the changing French imagination of him whose posterity became a standard for
the remembrance of grands hommes and pantheonization in the nineteenth
century. (L9)
The topic is a declarative statement of the gapped cognitive picture of the question. In
simplified form, and with an emphasis on the memory-related phenomenon in question,
cultural memory, the declarative statement of the topic is reduced to the following form:
(10)

This dissertation concerns how references to Fénelon’s name in literature reflect
and affect the cultural memory of Fénelon.

To deduce from the declarative sentence the question that produced the knowledge claim,
volition must be reinserted into the statement through inversion and insertion of a
question particle. Following this process, the question correlate is:
(11)

How do references to Fénelon’s name reflect and affect the cultural memory of
him?

The derivation of the (11) question correlate from the (10) knowledge claim is achieved
by reinserting the volitional aspect, the invitation of a response to fill in the gap in the
picture of the situation, according to the logical structure of a completive question. The
declarative statement (1) suggests that the question correlate should be structured as a
completive question, which is confirmed by reference to (4), the answer. Completive
questions are answered by filling in the gapped cognitive picture (of how references to
Fénelon’s name reflect and affect the cultural memory of him), while a hypothetive

79
question would be answered by confirmation or disconfirmation of the hypothesis of how
to fill the gapped picture.
In addition to justifying and offering principles for the identification of explicit
and implicit questions from the knowledge products of inquiry, the application of erotetic
theory to domain-level questions suggests some dimensions or facets by which domains’
questions can be classified. Questions have a communicative function, to express the
questioner’s experience of a gapped cognitive picture of reality and the will to fill it. The
cognitive gap is expressed by the asking of the question. Chapter 2 organizes the
question research into three basic paradigmatic approaches, differing according to the
conception of the question-related phenomenon of interest and the context of the
question. One of the central differences between the paradigmatic differences is the
treatment of the question content. The question-as-object paradigm takes the content of
the question at face value, accepting that the question has the ability to express a precise
request for information from the information system. From the paradigmatic approach of
questioner-as-subject, the content of the question must be negotiated from the question
that expresses the compromised need back to the visceral need (Taylor, 1968), relative to
the context of the individual’s cognitive and situation states. This is the conceptual level
at which erotetic theory constructs the question: the question as an expression of the
gapped cognitive state of the questioner.
Applying the logical principles of erotetic theory to domain-level questions, the
knowledge-domain-as-questioner experiences an epistemic indeterminacy, rather than a
cognitive one. Whereas an individual’s question communicates the experience of the
individual’s will to resolve an idiosyncratic indeterminate cognitive picture of a situation,

80
the knowledge domain’s question communicates the experience of the domain seeking to
resolve an indeterminacy in the current state of collective knowledge about the
phenomenon. The epistemic indeterminacy, or what Dewey (1938) calls the
“indeterminate situation” is a manifestation of the known unknown that is being pursued
by the questioner, on behalf of the knowledge domain, through the formulation of a
question and its subsequent answering. Asking a question is what allows reality to
respond. The question is posed at reality, in the form of scientific nature or the products
of human activity, as brought into focus by the question and answered, on behalf of that
reality, by the knowledge domain. The scholar or researcher formulates questions, on
behalf of the knowledge domain, and answers, on behalf of reality. The epistemic
indeterminacy that the researcher, on behalf of the knowledge domain, seeks to fill is
expressed by the content of the question. A logical philosophical approach to domain
questions as having a communicative function of expressing the will to transform an
indeterminate situation into a determinate one thus suggests that domain questions be
classified by their content in relation to other domain questions in order to produce a
picture of the domain state of knowledge.
Beyond categorizing domains’ questions according to content, the erotetic
characterization of questions as having a logical structure also suggests categorization of
questions according to their form. As discussed in relation to the paradigmatic
approaches to question research in Chapter 2, question answering research, described by
the paradigmatic conception of question-as-object, is primarily concerned with the
syntactic form of questions, given the context of automated information systems and their
need to be able to parse sentences and make them comprehensible to the system for

81
retrieval of relevant documents. The information behavioral research that stems from the
cognitive paradigm of the questioner-as-subject focuses on semantic form, on
understanding what the question means, in the context of each questioner’s individualized
problematic situation. Erotetic theory deals with form on this level, linking the logical
structure of questions to the meaning that the questioner is intending to communicate to
the potential respondent. A questioning-as-intersubjective paradigmatic approach, in
which the questioner speaks on behalf of the knowledge domain, shifts the focus to the
question at the level of domain discourse. At the domain discursive level, question form
carries meaning about shared standards and practices of knowledge production, which
structure the production and formulation of an answer. Erotetic theory thus suggests that
questions be classified according to their form, which is epistemic in nature.
Brożek’s (2011) characterization of questions as distinguished from other
expressions by their communicative function and logical structure dissolves the
traditional distinction between the semantics and pragmatics of questions. The traditional
semantic approach to questions examines the relations between questions-as-signs and
their possible interpretations, while the pragmatic approach examines the relations
between questions-as-signs and questioners or questioning contexts. Brożek
distinguishes questions from declaratives and orders according to their communicative
function, to communicate experiences consisting of gapped cognitive pictures of the
world and the will to fill the gaps. The questioner formulates the question according to
the logical structure that will most likely correspond to reality and thus be interpreted by
the respondent in the manner that is desired to solicit the needed information to fill the
gapped picture. This is both semantic and pragmatic: semantic in its consideration of the

82
meaning of the question, its possible interpretations, and pragmatic in its consideration of
the use of the question, the relation between the questioner and question context. The
application of erotetic theory to the current study of questioning as a social
epistemological phenomenon, applying Brożek’s (2011) conception of the question to
domain questions, similarly views the semantic and pragmatic dimensions of question
formulations as inextricably intertwined.
In summary, questions are characterized by their communicative function and
logical structure (Brożek, 2011). The communicative function is to express the belief in
the existence of an adequate picture of the situation (cognitive factor), a gapped picture
(incognitive factor), and the will to fill the gap (volitional factor), transforming an
indeterminate situation into a determinate one. The logical structure expresses the
experience motivating the asking – the need to fill a gap (completive question) or confirm
a conjecture of how to fill a gap (hypothetive question). When the question is not
explicitly stated, this theoretical conception of the question, along with the proposition
that all knowledge sentences have a question correlate (Hookway, 2008), allow the
implicit question to be inferred from the declarative expressions of knowledge claims.
The domain’s gapped epistemic picture, the indeterminate situation, is communicated by
the question content, while the epistemic structure within which an answer is produced is
conveyed by the question’s form. This theoretical framework will anchor the
identification and categorization of domains’ questions towards the pursuit of
characterizing knowledge domains by their questions formulations, which convey
information about what constitutes a relevant answer and the domain assumptions by

83
which the answer is produced. Chapter Five describes the development and application
of this process to the three-domain sample.

3.5 Research questions, specific
This dissertation seeks to situate the tension between the implicit and explicit
dimensions of the question within the social epistemological context of knowledge
domains. Questions serve a communicative function, to express a cognitive
indeterminacy and the will to resolve it, and are logically formulated in accordance with
domain norms of knowledge production. If knowledge domains are defined as thought or
discourse communities that are part of society’s division of labor – the labor of
knowledge-based work – the implication is that domains should ask different questions
and ask them differently. This dissertation seeks empirical verification of this
proposition, and considers what the differences in question types indicate about the
answers that follow and the domain assumptions that precede the questions.
A multidisciplinary topic of interest will be used to identify a sampling frame for
studying the questions of contrasting domains. The topic of investigation is “memory,”
which is deemed a topic that is currently of interest to academics in many fields as well
as to the general public in relation to societal issues such as traumatic brain injury,
neurodegenerative diseases, and healthy aging, and as central to the formation and
maintenance of identity and culture. More specifically, the following research questions
will guide the three-stage investigation.

84
Stage One: Identification
1. What questions do the knowledge domains of neuroscience, literature, and
computer engineering formulate about the topic of “memory”?
Stage Two: Categorization and comparison
2a. What are the contents of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory”?
2b. How do the contents of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory” compare?
3a. What are the forms of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory”?
3b. How do the forms of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory” compare?
Stage 3: Interpretation
4a. What information do the comparisons between question contents convey about
the answers that follow the neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory”?
4b. What information do the comparisons between question contents convey about
the assumptions that precede the neuroscience, literature, and computer
engineering dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory”?

85
5a. What information do the comparisons between question forms convey about the
answers that follow the neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory”?
5b. What information do the comparisons between neuroscience, literature, and
computer engineering question forms convey about the assumptions that precede
the neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering dissertations’ question
formulations on the topic of “memory”?
Kearsley’s (1976) observation, that questions indicate information as well as request it, is
here put to service as a means to characterize knowledge domains by the questions that
they formulate about a common topic. Stage One consists of the identification of the
three knowledge domains’ question formulations, based on Hookway’s (2008)
observation that all knowledge has a question correlate. Research question one directs
inquiry towards the development of a method for identifying implicit questions from the
knowledge products of inquiry.
In Stage Two, domains’ question formulations are categorized and compared.
Research questions 2a and 3a characterize the question formulations according to content
and form, or what they ask about and how they ask. The content of a question is
declarative of the indeterminate situations, the known unknowns that the questioner is
seeking to fill on behalf of the domain, while the form indicates the logical structure of
the inquiry. These questions will produce knowledge of how domains can be
characterized according to their question formulations, creating a functional question
profile of each domain on the topic of “memory.” Questions 2b and 3b invite comparison

86
of the content and form of domains’ question formulations in order to identify the varying
approaches to “memory” found within and between the three domains.
In Stage Three, the comparisons of domains’ question formulations are further
analyzed and interpreted to shed light on the organizing functions of the question itself,
namely, its ability to indicate information about the answers that follow the question and
the domain assumptions that precede it. Comparison across contrasting domains makes
visible the unstated assumptions of each domain, thus highlighting the formal dimensions
of the phenomenon (Zerubavel, 2007), in this case, of questioning. Research questions
4a and 5a focus on what question content and form dictates about the content and form of
the answers that follow, while questions 4b and 5b consider what they indicate about the
assumptions that precede the questions. In this manner, the current investigation seeks a
path out of the question paradox by recasting questions as social epistemological objects
and tools of domain inquiry.

3.6 Conclusion
This dissertation investigates the relations between knowledge domains, their
questions, answers, and assumptions related to inquiry and the production of knowledge.
A narrow focus on the question, in this case as presented in the knowledge products of
scholarly research, is compelled by theoretical, methodological, and pragmatic reasons.
Theoretically, the analysis of different domains’ question formulations about a shared
topic of interest aims to find a way out of the question paradox – that in order to ask, the
questioner must know enough to know what is unknown (Flammer, 1981) – by testing
the supposition that domains’ question formulations indicate information (Kearsley,
1976) about the domain norms of knowledge production. Methodologically, a focus on

87
questions allows for a comparative study of domains, which Wilson (1994) suggests is
one of the reasons that LIS has produced few significant theories with explanatory power.
Finally, a close understanding of how to identify questions in knowledge products
and knowledge of what questions convey about knowledge domains is of pragmatic value
to domain analysis, suggesting that one of the ways in which domains can be described is
by their questions. A focus on questions has implications for knowledge organization, in
areas such as the representation and classification of documents, and production of
secondary documents such as indexes, subject research guides, and bibliographies. The
research questions focus the investigation on the content and form of domain questions
about a common topic in order to discern differences in what and how domains ask, what
and how they answer, and the assumptions upon which these determinations rest.
Chapter Four presents the comparative methodological approach by which the research
questions will be explored.

CHAPTER 4: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN

4.1 Overview
Chapter 3 describes a theoretical framework for the identification and
comparative analysis of research questions about the topic of “memory” as posed by
three contrasting scholarly knowledge domains. Domain analysis provides a
characterization of knowledge domains as the social units of knowledge production,
defined along ontological, epistemological, and social dimensions, which is encapsulated
in the question formulations that drive inquiry. This chapter outlines a domain analytic
methodological approach to studying questions and answers. As a meta-theoretical
framework for library and information science (Hjørland, 2010), domain analysis is a
comprehensive methodological context for the interpretation of bibliometric and
empirical user studies (Hjørland and Albrechtsen, 1995). This chapter develops a
comparative methodology from the meta-theoretical assumptions of domain analysis,
following the example of Brenda Dervin’s (1992) development of the Sense-Making
Methodology as meta-theory, theory, and methodology. The comparative domain
analytic methodology informs the three-stage research design for studying domains
according to their question formulations.

4.2 A comparative domain analytic methodology
The potential for domain analysis to serve as meta-theory, theory, and
methodology is modeled after the example offered by Dervin’s (1992) Sense-Making
Methodology. Dervin (1992) describes Sense-Making as a set of meta-theoretic
assumptions and theoretical propositions about the nature of information, the nature of

89
human use of information, and the nature of human communication, that also implies
methodology and methods:
The assumptions and propositions of sense-making, taken together, provide
methodological guidance for framing research questions, for collecting data, and
for charting analyses. Derived from these assumptions are [sic] a set of methods,
particularly methods for interviewing humans about their experiences.” (p. 62)
Whereas Sense-Making is concerned with a constructivist understanding of how people
experience and make sense of phenomena, domain analysis posits a collectivist or social
constructionist approach to studying the nature of knowledge production, with knowledge
domains as the objects of study, as described in Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework. From
the meta-theoretical assumptions and the theoretical propositions of domain analysis,
methodological principles are extracted that suggest the framing of research questions,
modes of data collection and analysis for the current study of domains’ question
formulations.
4.2.1 Domain analysis as meta-theory and theory. The central meta-theoretical
assumption of domain analysis is that the primary object of study in information science
is knowledge domains and knowledge structures rather than individuals and individuals’
cognitive structures (Hjørland & Albrechtsen, 1995; Hjørland, 2010). At the highest
level of abstraction, knowledge domains are described as thought communities defined
by ontological, epistemological, and social dimensions that interact in complex ways to
constitute a thought or discourse community (Hjørland & Hartel, 2003a; Hjørland, 2010).
Domain analysis shifts the focus from individual cognition and information needs,

90
seeking, and use behaviors to knowledge structures and knowledge domains’ information
activities and practices. Hjørland (2010) bases domain analysis on a view of “pragmatic
realism,” which claims that a mind-independent reality exists, though it is not given that
any given individual, collective, or humankind as a whole, grasps or has true knowledge
of that reality, or that science accurately reflects that reality. Objective knowledge exists
as separate from subjective knowledge, but this objective knowledge is not of the natural
sort that is conceived of by fundamentalist paradigms such as empiricism or rationalism.
Rather, objective knowledge is most likely to be approached by contextualizing
individuals’ subjective knowledge to the collective knowledge that exists within domains
(Hjørland, 2010).
From these meta-theoretical assumptions, sets of propositions can be identified
for explaining knowledge-related phenomena and the relations between them, suggesting
that domain analysis can function as a theory as well as meta-theory. Domain analysis
has been employed to explain characteristics of single domains as well as to draw
comparisons between contrasting domains. In an example of a single domain study,
Ørom (2003) employs domain analysis to explain the knowledge organization of the
domain of visual art relative to three paradigms in art scholarship (the iconographic, the
stylistic, and the materialist) and their relation to existing taxonomies of the domain.
Other single domain analytic studies include an epistemological reading of the indexing
of musical genres (Abrahamsen, 2004), a symbolic interactionist study of the nursing
knowledge domain (Sundin, 2004), and a taxonomic domain analysis of social work
(Zins and Guttman, 2004). At the comparative level, domain analysis has been employed
to develop theoretical propositions about the use of e-journals and databases in four

91
domains that are distinguished by domain size, degree of scatter in the domain, and
domain-specific relevance criteria (Talja and Maula, 2003); information practices across
four scholarly fields (Fry, 2004); the use of digital library resources according to research
culture (Talja and Vakkari, Fry, and Wouters, 2007); and conceptual modes of digital
access in the sciences and humanities (Palmer, 2005). In each of the studies, domain
analysis is employed as a theory that proposes that information practices emerge from the
ontological, epistemological, and social dimensions of knowledge domains.
4.2.2 Domain analysis as methodology. Dervin (2003) defines methodology as
a bridge between meta-theory and theory: methodology rests “on a fundamental set of
philosophic assumptions about the nature of human Sense-Making (and sense unmaking)
which, in turn, mandates a specific set of methodological moves” (p. 27). Methodology
also “opens up or closes down theoretical possibilities” and “mandates attention to certain
‘primitive terms’” (Dervin, 2003, p. 27); it rests upon meta-theoretical assumptions while
constraining theoretical propositions. Domain analysis as a methodology relies upon
philosophic assumptions about the nature of knowledge production (domain analysis as
meta-theory) and simultaneously suggests theoretical possibilities vis-à-vis attention to
certain “primitives” (domain analysis as theory). The “primitives” briefly discussed here
are based on Hjørland and Albrechtsen’s (1995) list of central concepts for domain
analysis. In some cases, the “primitive” concepts are contrasted with the corresponding
concepts in the cognitive viewpoint, in relation to which domain analysis positions itself.
•

Knowledge – In contrast to the abstract notion of information, knowledge is a
social phenomenon, situated in a particular space-time context and held by
particular subjects.

92
•

Documents – Documents are inherently context-rich, a product of the social
nature of their creation, circulation, and use in the production of new
knowledge.

•

Subjects – The “knowing subject,” as contrasted with the abstract “user” of
information, perceives reality through the lens of the knowledge domain
(Hjørland & Albrechtsen, 1995). Rather than erase individual agency for the
sake of the structure of knowledge domains, the individual is understood in
socio-cognitive terms as seeking to align or otherwise define one’s self to the
domain context or contexts in reference to which knowledge is being
produced.

•

Knowledge structures – The “knowing subject” operates within and between
existing structures of knowledge that frame their view of reality, what
constitutes knowledge, and how it is known, represented, and circulated.

•

Information practices – Domains are constituted by information practices. As
a subset of the more fundamental concept of the social practices that constitute
the social world (Schatzki, 2001), information practices are embodied,
materially mediated arrangements of information activities centrally organized
around a shared practical understanding.

These primitives speak to the status of domain analysis as offering an alternative to
methodological individualism, in the form of methodological collectivism (Hjørland and
Albrechtsen, 1995). The methodological collectivist viewpoint sees inquiry as a social or
cultural process and knowledge as its product, while also acknowledging that collectives

93
are comprised of individuals with agency in relation to the social structures of the
domain.
The methodology of domain analysis offers guidance for the formulation of
research questions, data collection, and data analysis through the orienting framework of
these “primitive” concepts. The methodological principles and primitives of domain
analysis suggest that since knowledge is a social phenomenon, the questions that drive
and organize inquiry must also be social in nature. Moreover, the social unit of
significance is the knowledge domain, which is participated in by “knowing subjects”
and constituted by information practices, of which question asking and answering is but
one type. In this social epistemological context, documents fulfill their function of
scholarly communication if the knowledge represented within meets the ontological
commitments and epistemological presuppositions of the knowledge domain.
Documents, as domain knowledge products, can thus be considered a site of study for the
domain-based nature of inquiry.
Like Sense-Making Methodology, which is a “methodology between the cracks”
(Dervin, 2003), domain analysis exists between the dichotomies of quantitative versus
qualitative methods; theoretic versus applied research; individualistic versus structural
research; and administrative versus critical research. This is due to the conceptual
flexibility of the central ontological object of interest, the knowledge domain. The
concept of a knowledge domain is most easily applicable to those domains in which
knowledge production is the primary purpose, hence the focus of the existing research on
scholarly domains. But the concept is extendable to all domains that produce and justify
knowledge claims, even if that is not the express purpose of the domain as it is with

94
scholarly domains. Fleck’s (1986) notion of the “thought collective,” which enables and
constrains one’s perception of reality and the language available for representing it, is apt
in this regard, as one can easily call to mind examples of thought collectives outside of
academia: religious sects, political parties, artistic subcultures, professions, hobbyists.
Hartel’s (2007) study of gourmet cooking as a hobby domain is a notable exception to the
scholarly focus of domain analysis and is particularly important for its depiction of how a
domain is constituted by shared information practices.
4.2.3 A comparative approach. Comparison is the oft-unacknowledged
backbone of qualitative research (Silverman, 2013). Whether the comparison is between
cases, social groups, contexts, geographical or political configurations, or any of these at
different points in time, comparison highlights differences amongst similarity, which
reveals the sociological dimension. Hjørland (2010) calls for domains to be studied
singly and comparatively, stating that “The examination of how knowledge domains
differ on some points and are similar on other points is important to construct ‘a general
information science’ that is not just an empty abstraction’” (p. 1652). Compared to other
types of social research, LIS rarely uses comparative methodologies, tending instead to
study single subject domains or broad domain groupings, producing many domainspecific findings but little insight into the nature of domain-general or phenomenally
focused information activities and practices. The near-exclusive focus on single domains
is rooted in the subject expert view of librarianship, which prioritizes deep knowledge of
a subject area rather than cross-subject comparative knowledge.
Mills (2008) points to Max Weber's comparative sociology for revealing the
power of comparison to foreground uniqueness, pointing out that “Comparisons not only

95
uncover differences between social entities but also reveal unique aspects of a particular
entity that would be virtually impossible to detect otherwise” (p. 3). This is what Knorr
Cetina (1999) calls “comparative optics” as a framework for seeing: looking at one
domain through the lens of the other in order to “visibilize” the invisible, with “each
pattern detailed in one science serves as a sensor for identifying and mapping (equivalent,
analog, conflicting) patterns in the other” (p. 4). In contrast, a focus on similarity across
domains signals a search for universals or underlying general processes across contexts or
categories (Mill, 2008). This kind of comparison brings out essential features and forms
of the phenomenon of interest, as recognizable by their specific instantiations. Zerubavel
(2007) situates this type of comparative social research methodology within historical
sociological precedents as context for articulating a method called social pattern analysis,
which is purposefully oblivious to idiosyncratic differences, instead looking for general
patterns that transcend the specific instantiations. The current study engages in both
types of comparisons, seeking to “visibilize” the comparative differences between
domains’ question formulations, while also searching for similarities in the relation
between question dimensions and domain assumptions.
The first comparison undertaken is of domains according to their question
formulations. Dillon’s (1990) empirical study of the practice of questioning demonstrates
that domains such as the classroom, courtroom, journalistic interview, and survey
research utilize questions differently, have different expectations for answers, and reflect
different social dynamics between questioner and respondent. The current study explores
this insight in the context of the LIS conception of knowledge domains, asking: do
different knowledge domains formulate questions differently relative to a common topic?

96
The underlying proposition guiding this comparison is that knowledge domains can be
distinguished by their question formulations, which subsequently produce different
answers. Implicit in this question is the need for a method of identifying and comparing
questions, to which we turn to the logical structure and communicative function of
questions, as described in Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework. Armed with a method for
identifying domains’ question formulations, the formulations can be compared in order to
determine the salient characteristics by which they differ from each other.
In order to make visible the domains’ assumptions, a second type of comparison
is needed: a comparison of question categories for their inherent assumptions. Each
domain’s question categories, comprised of content and form, will be compared in order
to make visible the tacit assumptions of inquiry. The movement from comparing
domains to comparing question categories within and across domains allows for the
likely possibility that domains may be characterized by more than one question type, each
representing a different set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge production on
the topic. Focusing on question categories rather than pre-defined domain boundaries
places the question at the center of this inquiry, rather than the knowledge domain. In
other words, this use of the comparative approach is not aimed at a members’
understanding of domains as much as it is of the question itself as an epistemological tool
of inquiry.
Hub Zwart’s (2008) Understanding Nature: Case Studies in Comparative
Epistemology serves as an additional guide for the second type of comparison, of
questions according to their ontological and epistemological assumptions. Through a
series of case studies, Zwart compares the ways of knowing in relation to the subject of

97
“nature,” as evidenced in various works of literature including Herman Melville’s Moby
Dick, Ibsen’s play, The Wild Duck, Jack London’s The Call of the Wild, and Jules
Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days. Characters in these works exhibit different
“epistemological profiles” or “styles” in relation to “knowing” plants, animals, and the
natural environment, ranging from scientific to experiential and intuitive. The book,
says Zwart (2008), “starts from the conviction…that there are other ways of knowing
about nature besides science” (p. 4), more intimate ways that are better captured by
literary works than academic discourse. Art and science both serve as perspectives that
allow nature to emerge under certain conditions, and as such, neither is a straightforward
representation (p. 5). The methodological power of comparative epistemology is that is
forces critical reflection on the structure and reliability of knowledge forms, making
visible the assumptions that drive knowledge claims and their apparent truthfulness.
In addition to Zwart’s (2008) “ways of knowing,” or epistemological profiles, the
current study is also interested in comparing “ways of seeing,” or ontological profiles.
Zwart’s case study method favors the use of concrete examples rather than an abstract
treatment of epistemological issues, which he marks as an “empirical turn” in
epistemology (p. 8). His central question is: What is the epistemological profile of
science in general, and of the life sciences in particular, in comparison to other forms of
knowledge concerning living nature? Following his example, our central question for the
second stage of comparison is: What is the ontological and epistemological profile of the
different question categories in comparison to one another concerning “memory”? The
comparative analysis of question categories for their implicit assumptions will focus on
ontological and epistemological assumptions.

98

4.3 Research design
The comparative domain analytic methodology is implemented towards the study
of domain questions and what they convey about answers and assumptions by the three
stage research design outlined in Table 8. The first stage employs a logical philosophical
conception of questions to develop a method for formulating domains’ questions from the
knowledge products of scholarly inquiry. The second stage categorizes and compares the
questions according to content and form, resulting in a question profile of each domain
relative to the topic of “memory.” The third stage employs comparison to make visible
the assumptions that are implicit in the question types, resulting in an ontological and
epistemological profile of the research on “memory” as represented by the sample.

Table 8. Overview of research design
One of the central methodological problems of comparative research is the
selection of cases for comparison, including the unit, level, and scale of analysis (Mills,
2008). This has proven true for domain analysis, where the problem of how to define a
domain remains a fundamental issue for theory and praxis, which debate is summarized
in Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework. Ragin (2013) distinguishes between “given” and
“constructed” populations: “given” populations being historically and structurally
formed, such as nation-states, while “constructed” populations are theory-driven and
constructed by the researcher. The current study engages the debate about domain
definition by testing the proposition that the given populations, knowledge domains as
self-identified by the classification of dissertations about “memory,” coincide with the
theoretical populations of knowledge domains as constructed by their question types.
While the conceptual definition of knowledge domains by domain analysis
encompasses scholarly, professional, and everyday social domains, existing research
focuses mainly on the scholarly realm. Scholarly domains differ from professional and
everyday realms because their defining purpose is the production of knowledge,
communicated through the production and circulation of knowledge products such as
dissertations, journal articles, conference papers and presentations. The infrastructure of
scholarly domains is constructed around the circulation of knowledge products, and the
knowledge products themselves are highly structured for findability and clarity of

100
communication. Scholarly domains, rather than professional or everyday domains, are
chosen for this study because they produce knowledge products that are highly structured
according to the epistemic concern of justification, making them more amenable to the
study of the questions that drive and organize inquiry according to domain assumptions.
4.3.1 Selection of topic and domains. The study introduces a novel, topic-driven
method for selecting domains for comparison. As inter- and multi-disciplinary research
approaches to topics of societal currency increase in frequency and importance, the need
for understanding different domains’ approaches to knowledge production also increases.
Thus, at the pragmatic level, this topic-driven method for domain sampling reflects the
reality of growing interest in multi-disciplinary efforts of knowledge production. At the
theoretical level, a topic-driven study of domains allows for domain differences to
emerge as not general to the domain production of knowledge, but as specific to the
domain production of knowledge about the topic of interest. Simultaneously, as
Zerubavel’s (2007) social pattern analysis demonstrates, the formal dimensions of
questioning become visible by identifying the common characteristics of the phenomenon
across diverse contexts.
An initial search of dissertation research in the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
Database was conducted in order to find a topic that fit the following criteria for
selection:
•

Scale of analysis – The scale of analysis should lie between what Ragin
(1987) terms a small-N case-driven scale (high validity) and large-N variabledriven scale (high reliability). The aim is to get a sense of larger domain

101
patterns while preserving depth of analysis. Practically speaking, the number
of dissertations produced over a five-year period (2006-2011) was deemed a
reasonable size for the analysis of meta-data fields related to domain
membership and for more intensive coding of abstracts for the analysis of
abstracts in Stages 1 and 2.
•

Major domain focus – The topic should be of significant interest to a few
domains rather than a minor interest of many domains. This ensures that there
can be said to be a domain approach to inquiry regarding the topic, rather than
the coincident interest of a few researchers.

•

Contrasting domains – The domains producing the most dissertations should
contrast according to historical tradition (i.e., natural sciences, social sciences,
humanities) or along epistemic and structural dimensions of the discipline,
such as Becher’s (1979) axes of hard-soft, pure-applied, and life-nonlife.

Among the topics considered were: climate change, evolution, unemployment,
immigration, and memory. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database was searched
for any dissertations completed between 2006 and 2011 in which the topical search terms
were in the title, abstract, or keyword field. Of these topics, climate change and
evolution were heavily dominated by the natural sciences, unemployment and
immigration heavily dominated by the social sciences, and all four produced too much
research to be manageably analyzed, numbering between 500 and over a thousand
dissertations in a five-year period. The topic of “memory” produced a relatively
manageable 420 dissertations for metadata analysis and engaged a diverse set of domains.

102
Having identified a topic for domain comparison, four metadata fields were
considered for their ability to stand in for domain identification: “classification,”
“subject,” “keyword,” and “department.” “Subject” was found to mirror the terms in
“classification,” making them functionally identical, with the only difference being that
“classification” included a number identifier, indicating the use of the field for indexing
by ProQuest. The “keyword” field is defined by a lack of controlled vocabulary and user
indexing and as a result, produces up to 16 terms per dissertation that reflect topics, subtopics, discipline, specialty field, methodology, theory, practice and other miscellaneous
terms, proving too idiosyncratic for identifying domains. “Department” is an indicator of
the institutional affiliations that may have some relation with domain boundaries, but this
field is not populated by all dissertations. Thus, the “classification” field was determined
the best metadata field for identifying domains as historically and politically “given”
populations.
Table 9 lists the classification and count of the dissertations resulting from a
search of the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database on the topic of “memory” from
2006 to 2011. Classification fields sharing a base term but different modifiers were
combined; for instance, “Cellular Biology” and “Molecular Biology” are subsumed into
the category of “Biology.”

psychology, engineering, and literature. Both neuroscience and psychology are hard-pure
fields (with the exception of the subset of clinical psychology), so neuroscience was
chosen as it produced more dissertations. In contrast, engineering is a hard-applied field;
literature is a pure-soft field. These three domains were chosen for comparison as
producing the most dissertations and differing according to the hard-soft and pure-applied
axes8. Initial readings of the engineering dissertation abstracts indicated that each subset
was quite distinct in the construction of the phenomenon of “memory,” so computer
engineering was chosen as the subset with the most dissertations. On the other hand,
though the literature dissertation identified according to many subsets, the construction of
“memory” was indistinguishable among them upon initial review, so all of the literature
subsets were subsumed into the literature sample. Dissertations that were not centrally
about “memory” were eliminated, resulting in 57 dissertation entries in neuroscience, 20
in computer engineering, and 20 in literature, for a total of 97 abstracts.
4.3.2 Data collection. As one of the primitive concepts of domain analysis,
knowledge domains’ documents are a primary data source for single and comparative
studies of domains. Documents are informative of domain characteristics in at least two
senses: first, for their function in the production of knowledge, such as is of interest in
studies of document relevance. Second, documents are of interest as knowledge products
or inscriptions of domain practices. It is this second sense in which this study utilizes
documents as the primary source for comparing domains: as records of the domain
practice of questioning. Documents are useful for the study of information practices
8

Most researchers employing Becher’s (1979) typology to classify scholarly knowledge domains exclude
the life-nonlife continuum as forcing choices that do not necessarily reflect disciplinary boundaries, such as
is the case in the field of educational technology (Czerniewicz, 2008).

105
because they provide behind-the-scenes look at practices that are not directly observable
(Isah, 2008) such as the socio-cognitive aspects of questioning. In academic domains,
documents play an especially central role in establishing and maintaining domain
membership. Paré, Starke-Meyerring, and McAlpine (2009) go so far as to define
academic communities as being textually constituted:
another distinguishing feature of the academic workplace, is that one’s
community of practice is first encountered textually, as a disembodied
collective dispersed over time and space. In what other line of work might
a long-dead colleague continue to influence the current conversation?
Where else are one’s fellow workers—those with whom one might
interact (textually) every day—encountered face-to-face only once a year
at an annual association meeting? The doctoral student seeking passage to
disciplinary membership must locate herself in a textually constituted
community. (Paré, Starke-Meyerring, & McAlpine, 2009, p. 184)
The vast majority of scholarly communication takes place via the circulation of
documents, rather than face-to-face: documents are not simply fossilized records of the
process of knowledge production, but are themselves dynamic entities that are
fundamental to the ongoing constitution of domains’ knowledge structures. Documents,
mainly dissertation abstracts, along with a sample of full-text dissertations, are the
primary data source for studying these textually constituted communities.
4.3.2.1 Dissertations and abstracts. While scholars produce many types of
documents such as conference papers, journal articles, books, lecture notes and materials,

106
reports, grant applications, and more, dissertations were chosen for the study of domains’
questions for several reasons. In order to make comparisons between and across
domains, what is needed is a document type that is regularly produced in all domains. Of
all the types of documents produced by scholars in the arts and sciences, dissertations are
the one type of intellectual product that is required of almost all aspiring scholars, at least
those traveling the conventional route to establishing credibility in the knowledge domain
by obtaining a doctoral degree. Books may be favored in the humanities, but are rarely
written in the physical sciences; journal articles are the mainstay of physical, applied, and
social sciences, but of marginal importance in the arts and humanities. On the other
hand, every doctoral candidate must produce a dissertation.
From the social epistemic perspective, dissertations are simultaneously the
culminating product of the process of scholarly socialization and the initial intellectual
product of one’s scholarly career. In considering the dissertation as a genre, Paré, StarkeMeyerring, and McAlpine (2009) observe that, “On one hand, it is the ultimate student
paper, the final school-based display of knowledge and ability. On the other hand, it is
often – in whole or in part – the first significant contribution to a disciplinary
conversation” (p. 179). The dissertation is evidence of successful socialization into a
knowledge domain, a form of legitimate peripheral participation (Lave and Wenger,
1991) that takes place under the tutelage of a full member of the collective: the
dissertation advisor (Paré, Starke-Meyerring, & McAlpine, 2009, p. 182). Dissertations
serve as evidence that the scholar is a competent practitioner according to the domain’s
standards of participation in the work of knowledge production. The competent practice
of domain membership in the production of a dissertation is displayed in choosing a

107
“relevant” topic, designing and conducting the inquiry according to domain norms,
justifying findings according to the practices of the domain, use of language and
rhetorical style, etc. The full text of select dissertations chosen to represent each question
category are reviewed in order to glean further insight and gather additional evidence for
characterizing the differences between domains according to their questions, answers,
and assumptions. The focus of the full text dissertation analysis is particularly on
identifying domain assumptions (ontological, epistemological, pragmatic, etc.) that are
implicit in the question categories and made visible by their comparison.
As a data source, the dissertation abstracts should be representative of the
dissertation as a domain-based knowledge product. Rather than viewing abstracts as a
lacking-but-necessary summary of a knowledge product such as a dissertation or journal
article, it is here considered as a knowledge product in its own right. Constructed for the
explicit purpose of communicating the knowledge produced by the research and its
significance to the domain in the most concise language possible, the abstract displays all
of the elements of domain-based inquiry: the question being pursued, the answer that is
produced in reply and its mode of production, and, in what is stated and unstated, the
explicit and tacit assumptions that shape inquiry. Thus, the abstracts serve as an
important data source for the identification and comparison of domain questions.
4.3.2.2 Semi-structured interviews. Interviews are another documentary source
that will be used to guide the interpretation of results from the analysis of dissertations
and abstracts. Interviews were conducted from October to February 2014 with fourteen
authors representing all six of the question types. The interviews took place via Skype or
phone and lasted between 40 and 120 minutes. Transcribe.wreally.com was used to

108
automatically transcribe the audio of the interviews, which were then checked manually
for accuracy. Exempt status was granted from Rutgers University’s Institutional Review
Board Review (Protocol #: E13-325) on September 13, 2014.
The interview protocol consists of semi-structured questions designed to elicit
practitioners’ talk about how they chose dissertation topics, what influenced the choice,
and how they define their domain’s boundaries. The interview questions were designed
around several themes as they relate to the research questions: identification of the
dissertations’ research questions, identification of domain or domains of participation,
and the author’s general understanding of what constitutes a relevant question in the
domain. Spradley’s (1979) strategies of ethnographic interviewing were employed.
Descriptive questions were utilized to elicit initial talk, followed by structural
questions to encourage elaboration of the phenomena of interest and contrast questions to
reveal the dimensions of meaning related to the phenomena of questioning. The
interview protocol is included as Appendix A.
4.3.2.3 Subject literature. Domain-specific subject literature serves a two-fold
purpose: (1) as a general introduction to domain understandings of the topic of “memory”
and (2) as a guide for interpreting results of the analysis of dissertations and abstracts.
Several introductory texts were utilized in order to gain familiarity with the relevant
terminology and conceptual approaches of the domains’ research on the topic of
“memory.” Additionally, the subject literature was referred to if needed in order to
confirm or disconfirm findings about the domain questions, answers, and assumptions.

109

4.4 Data analysis
Analysis of the data at each stage corresponds to the research questions as shown
in Table 8. The first stage of analysis entails the formulation of questions from the
dissertation abstracts. The second stage characterizes the questions according to content
and form in order to create a question profile of each domain’s research on “memory.”
The question content-form categories are compared within and across domains,
producing a picture of the various approaches to knowing about “memory” within and
between the three domains. Stage Three entails an interpretive analysis of the results
from the Stages one and two, along with additional analyses of the interviews and full
text dissertations, in order to make visible the assumptions about the nature of knowledge
production inherent in the question formulations, creating an ontological and
epistemological profile of each domain’s research on “memory.” All data was imported
into NVivo for Mac (Version 10.2.0) for qualitative coding. Coding procedures,
consideration of code labels and usage, code-related theoretical insights, and all other
manner of research-related processing were recorded as research memos.
4.4.1 Identifying domains’ question formulations (Stage 1). The first stage of
analysis entailed the formulation of questions from the dissertation abstracts. Abstracts
were subjected to repeated close readings in order to become immersed in the abstract
format, language, and structure in the three domains. Stage One entailed a two-step
process for identifying the dissertations’ question formulations.
1. Segments of the 97 abstracts with any information pertinent to identification of
the “question” were broadly coded as “question” (Figure 1). This was guided
by the logical philosophical conception of questions, described in Chapter 3, as

110
expressions that communicate the gapped cognitive picture of the world
(Brożek, 2011) or the indeterminate situation regarding “memory.” In Figure 1,
the indeterminate situation concerns whether there is a difference in the verbal
and visual working memory of children and adolescents, aged 6 to 18, in three
groups: those diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD);
those with ADHD and anxiety; and those with ADHD and depression.
Simultaneous identification of the answer-indicative segments aided in the
identification of the question-indicative segments.
Children diagnosed with ADHD and children diagnosed with ADHD with comorbid anxiety or depression:
Exploring the differences in working memory performance
This study was a descriptive quantitative causal-comparative research design. Verbal and visual working
memory performance was examined in children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and ADHD
with comorbid anxiety or depression. Male and female participants, aged 6 to 18 were assigned to
research groups based on diagnosis. Children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD comprised
one group, a diagnosis of ADHD with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Anxiety Disorder,
NOS comprised a second group, and ADHD with comorbid Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic
Disorder or Depressive Disorder, NOS comprised a third group. Archival neuropsychological test data
was utilized and working memory performance was measured by the Wide Range Assessment of Memory
and Learning-Second Edition (Sheslow &Adams, 1990). An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was
conducted to compare statistical means of the three research groups. The ANOVA demonstrated
statistically non-significant differences in verbal, visual, and overall working memory performance
between the research groups. Further research is warranted to increase knowledge of working memory
performance in children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD with comorbid anxiety or depression.

Figure 1. Example of “question” and “answer” identification in abstract
2. The formulation of the dissertations’ questions are based on the “question” and
“answer” segments, in accord with the communicative function and logical
structure of questions described in Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework.
Declarative statements such as “This dissertation studies…” or “The focus of
this research…” or “I will show…” were transformed into interrogatives, either
completive (using open-ended interrogative words such as: who, what, when,
where, why, how) or hypothetive (using close-ended words such as which,

111
whether, does and is). This transformation was done in a constant comparative
manner within each domain. The question segment in Figure 1, in the context
of the other neuroscience abstracts, was transformed into the hypothetive
question: “Is there a difference in working memory performance between
children and adolescents with ADHD, ADHD with anxiety, and ADHD with
depression?”
This two-step process results in the formulation of the dissertations’ questions, such that
each dissertation is represented by a single question. The straightforward abstract in
Figure 1 hardly requires theorizing in order to identify the question and answer, but it is
in the minority among the sample of 97 abstracts. The need for a theoretical conception
of questions as having a communicative function and logical structure is much more
apparent in seeking to identify questions and answers in the non-hypothesis-driven
abstracts, such as those in literature, computer engineering, and even in parts of the
neuroscience domain.
Stage One produces a list of the question formulations driving inquiry in the
dissertations about “memory” in a consistent form. This consistency allows for the
comparison of questions within and across domains, which is the focus of Stage Two.
4.4.2 Categorizing and comparing domains’ question formulations (Stage 2).
Having identified the question formulations in the three domains’ dissertation abstracts,
Stage Two seeks to categorize and compare the question formulations within and
between the domains. The data source for this stage is results from the Stage One
analysis, in the context of familiarity with the abstracts and a sampling of full text

112
dissertations in each domain. Author interviews and introductory subject literature are
also utilized to guide the domain interpretations. What is sought by this stage of analysis
is a method for characterizing the types of questions (and thus the types of answers) that
are posed in a domain, such that any domain can be described by the questions they ask,
as in “Domain X asks Y and Z types of questions.”
Dillon’s (1990) theory of the practice of questioning posits that questions can only
be understood in relation to the assumptions that precede it and the answers that follow it;
furthermore, each is comprised of a “sentence” and the “act of putting” the sentence (p.
131). In other words, questions – as all other linguistic expressions such as declaratives
and orders – have both content and form. While content, or the what, of documents has
long been a topic of interest in LIS research in concepts such as document “about”-ness,
topical relevance, and subject classification, the form, or how, has received little
attention. In Stage Two, the questions and answers are analyzed for what the domains
ask about (question content) and how they ask and answer (question form). The
questions are classified according to the dimensions of content and form, briefly
described here and in more detail in Chapter Six: Question content and Chapter Seven:
Question form.
1. Content – A question is structured as a query posed about a subject, where the
subject is an object in the world about which some determination is being made
and the query is the particular determination; the subject expresses the
indeterminate situation, while the query indicates the type of determination that is
being sought. The subjects of dissertation abstracts were inductively coded,
guided by the question, “what is this dissertation about, relative to the topic of

113
‘memory’?” Once the subject codes achieved stability within each domain, the
queries were coded deductively using Dillon’s (1984) classification of research
questions (see Table 25) relative to the subjects. Each domain was analyzed
singly, for patterns of query-subject pairings, and comparatively, for differences
in query-subject pairings between domains.
2. Form –The concept of the epistemic form of the question was developed for the
current investigation. Epistemic question forms are structures that show how
inquiry is organized. Epistemic forms were inductively coded, guided by the
question, “What is the organizing structure by which the memory-related question
content is being presented?” Each domain is analyzed singly, for its epistemic
forms, and comparatively, for differences between domains’ use of forms.
The theoretical proposition that is being tested is whether knowledge domains can be
differentiated by question categories of content and form. Stage Two simultaneously
tests this proposition and develops the faceted typology of research questions according
to content and epistemic form. The products of this stage of analysis are: a method for
categorizing questions according to content and form; a question profile, consisting of the
different question categories, of each domain’s research about “memory” from 2006 to
2011; and a picture of the different questioning approaches that three domains take
towards “memory” as an object of research.
Stage 3 utilizes the question categories to explore the relation between question type
and domain assumptions related to the nature of knowledge production.

114
4.4.3 Making visible questions’ assumptions (Stage 3). Having identified the
question categories and produced domain question profiles in Stage Two, the goal of the
Stage Three analysis is to compare the Stages One and Two findings, the dissertation
abstracts, and a sample of full text dissertations of differing question categories in order
to make visible the assumptions that precede the question formulations, thus relating the
communicative function and logical structure of the question formulations to the
assumptions of inquiry. Building on the comparison of domains according to question
categories, here the comparison is of the question categories themselves, along the two
facets of content and form, for their assumptions. Each question category that emerges in
Stage 2 will represent a case for comparison, with the data for analysis including the
results from Stages 1 and 2, abstracts, full text of dissertations, interviews with authors,
and subject domain literature, as is deemed necessary for the understanding of
ontological and epistemological issues. The data will be coded on a case-by-case basis
for assumptions related to “memory” as a topic for inquiry.
Together, the coding of Stages Two and Three constitute the combined use of two
approaches to qualitative data analysis, occupying the top left quadrant of Glaser and
Strauss’ (1967) typology (Table 10). Stage Two employs the first approach, coding the
data first, according to an explicit coding procedure, for question content and form, then
analyzing the data against the provisional hypothesis that different domains ask different
kinds of questions. Stage Three adheres to the second approach, inspecting the data for
new properties or sub-categories of the theoretical categories, in this case, the categories
of inquiry-related assumptions.

The constant comparative method attempts to forge a third way by applying the
systematic analytical procedures of the first hypothesis-testing coding approach with the
sensitivity to theory development of the second approach. The current study combines
the first and second approaches on the basis of the theoretical framework of domain
analysis and erotetic theory, which suggests certain hypotheses to be tested about the
relation of question formulations to domain assumptions, but also leaves room for the
development and refinement of the existing theory of questions, particularly from the
social epistemological perspective of knowledge domains rather than the cognitive
linguistic viewpoint.

4.5 Conclusion
The three-stage study, guided by the methodological principles of a comparative
domain analytic approach, seeks to determine whether domains are unique in their
question formulations, how the different questions can be characterized along the
dimensions of content and form, and what the question categories indicate about domain
answers and assumptions related to “memory.” The research design hinges on
comparison of domain research on a common topic in order to discern differences in what
and how domains ask, and what and how they answer. These comparative differences

116
make visible the assumptions of the question, which are instrumental in understanding
the domain-based nature of inquiry.
The methodology developed in this chapter is intended to be applicable to all
scholarly domains. Stages One and Two are suitable for creating question profiles for
any single scholarly domain, while Stage Three is applicable to the comparison of any
number of domains. The results of the later stages hinge on those of Stage One, which
produces the question formulations that are the basis for analysis in later stages. The
following chapter, Chapter Five: Method for identifying domains’ question formulations,
details the development and application of the method.

CHAPTER 5: METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING DOMAINS’
QUESTION FORMULATIONS

5.1 Introduction
All knowledge is the product of inquiry, yet little scholarly attention has been
given to questions as a tool of inquiry. This dissertation considers whether and how
scholarly domains can be characterized by their questions, and what the differences
between domains’ questions indicate about the answers that follow and the assumptions
that precede the questions. The study of scholarly domains’ questions poses a significant
challenge, whether seeking to characterize a single domain or compare two or more
domains. For a single domain, the main difficulty is that questions are almost never
directly stated in interrogative form in the knowledge products resulting from inquiry.
Additionally, comparison between domains demands some method that cuts across the
special languages, vocabularies and norms of communication that accompany distinct
domains. What is needed is a method to systematically identify questions from the
products of domain inquiry in an accurate and consistent manner in order to build a
foundation of validity and reliability for the analysis that takes these questions as a
primary data source.
This chapter describes the development of a method for identifying domains’
question formulations from domains’ knowledge products and demonstrates its
application towards identifying the question formulations of ninety-seven dissertations
abstracts about “memory” in neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering. While
the method was developed for the analysis of scholarly dissertation abstracts, the

118
foundation of the method and the method itself will initially be discussed in abstract
terms in order to establish the generality of its application to any and all knowledge
products of inquiry in any and all knowledge domains.

5.2 Knowledge products of inquiry
For the purposes of this study, inquiry is defined as the determination of
indeterminate situations through the asking and answering of questions, with the
assumption that inquiry occurs relative to knowledge domains, the social epistemological
cultures of knowledge production. Some inquiries take place solely for the individual
questioner’s benefit and exist internal to the questioner, unknown by or shared with
anyone else; these are generally inaccessible to other inquirers and the documentalists
tasked with making knowledge products accessible to other inquirers. What is of interest
to library and information science (LIS) is inquiry that results in the production of
documents, objects, programs, actions, or happenings that embody the knowledge
produced by the inquiry. These are the knowledge products of inquiry. Some knowledge
products may embody the knowledge produced by the inquiry as a whole, as is the case
with books, journal articles, and even abstracts. All of these knowledge products aim to
communicate the significance of the entire inquiry. Other knowledge products have a
more partial relationship to the inquiry, reflecting some part of the knowledge produced,
but not intending to communicate the significance of the entire inquiry. For example,
computer engineering research often requires the development of a simulator to simulate
the environment within which one is seeking to model an environment. This simulator is
a knowledge product, but not one that aims to communicate the entirety of the knowledge
produced by the inquiry. It may be more aptly considered a byproduct or tool of the

119
inquiry. Additionally, some knowledge products, such as new research methods or
theories that are produced by the inquiry but not ultimately documented, are essentially
abstract and may not take a distinct material shape.
As compared to inquiry in everyday life, scholarly inquiry is more highly
structured in terms of its institutional and cultural norms and practices. The production
of knowledge, or stated differently, the creation of knowledge products, is one of the
primary activities of scholarly inquiry. Scholarly communication relies upon highly
ordered means of production, validation, and dissemination of knowledge. For this
reason, the context of scholarly inquiry was chosen as the context for developing a
method for identifying domains’ question formulations from the knowledge products of
inquiry, as the highly ordered norms of knowledge production and products are amenable
for establishing a baseline understanding of whether and how domains differ by their
questions. The knowledge products of scholarly research are diverse in length,
substance, form, and function, including products as varied as traditional text-based
written products (journal articles, books, conference papers), visual images, audio and
video, performances (talks, speeches, artistic performances), objects (blueprints, models,
design prototypes), as well as abstract entities (simulations, software, mathematical
formulas). The method developed for identifying domains’ question formulations
potentially applies to of these, but its value is most obvious for the class of written
documents that comprise the traditional products of scholarly inquiry – books, journal
articles, conference papers, etc. - and thus the main interest of library and information
science. Of these, dissertation research was chosen as the focus for this study for several
reasons. The dissertation is a knowledge product common to all doctoral students, acting

120
as an entry test for domain membership. To have a committee of domain members
accept the dissertation and grant the doctoral degree is to declare that the dissertation
writer is acceptably fluent in the domain manner of inquiry. Additionally, all scholarly
domains have a dissertation requirement for obtaining a doctorate, which make
dissertations a convenient and rich site for the comparison of multiple scholarly domains.
Identification of the question that represents the inquiry embodied in the
dissertation may be obtained from several data sources: analysis of the full text, analysis
of the introduction, conclusion, or indexing terms. However, dissertation abstracts were
chosen due to their concise nature and the primary role they play in scholarly access.
Dissertation abstracts are, in and of themselves, a knowledge product of significant
import in that their precise function is to communicate the new knowledge that the
dissertation research has to offer, in terms of its significance to the state of existing
knowledge in the domain. Scholarly abstracts were chosen as the first type of knowledge
product on which to develop and test this method, both for the epistemically structured
nature of the abstract as a genre of scholarly communication, and for the common use of
the dissertation abstract across all scholarly domains. The purpose of a dissertation
abstract is to concisely communicate the new knowledge produced by the dissertation in
a manner that maximizes its “findability” by those who would deem it relevant to their
own inquiries. As such, it is above all an epistemic document, one that is characterized
by its function of communicating and validating the knowledge produced therein.
As an epistemic document, its structural elements are defined by their role relative
to the knowledge that is produced by the dissertation. Dissertation abstracts within a
domain demonstrate patterns and norms in terms of the presentation of the research by

121
these structural, or epistemic elements. By identifying the epistemic elements of the
abstract, what is apparent is that the elements all either point toward the presentation of
the question, or refer back to it. In other words, the question is the element of the abstract
that is central to and defining of the other elements; it is the linchpin of the abstract, and
presumably of the inquiry itself. The epistemic structure of abstracts is further explored
in the analysis of question forms in Chapter Seven: Question form. For the current
purpose of developing a method for identifying domains’ question formulations, the
abstract elements of concern are limited to those that indicate the question and answer.

5.3 Question correlates
The implication of the statement that all knowledge has an indirect question
correlate (Hookway, 2008), is that any given knowledge claim implies the question that
produced it. Questions and knowledge are reciprocal phenomena; they exist in an
interdependent relationship. Yet even in textual knowledge products, which present the
process of inquiry and the new knowledge that results from the inquiry, questions are
rarely stated outright. The function of knowledge products is to communicate the answer
to the question, or the knowledge resulting from the question, not the question itself. It is
a testament to the essential status of the question in relation to the knowledge domain that
it remains unstated. But as a result, what is required is a method for identifying the
question, which is so central to organizing inquiry yet hardly ever considered for its
analytical or pragmatic use. A logical philosophical conception of questions informs the
development of a method for identifying the questions or question correlates that drive
the inquiry, from its knowledge products. The method allows for the questions, whether
implicit or explicit, to be extracted from the knowledge products of inquiry in a manner

122
that preserves the specificity of domains’ vocabularies while transforming them into
linguistically and logically comparable expressions.
As discussed in Chapter Three, Brożek’s (2011) logical conception of questions
defines questions according to their communicative function and logical structure.
Questions have a special communicative function that distinguishes them from other
types of expressions, such as orders and declaratives: “Questions are expressions suitable
for communicating experiences consisting of gapped cognitive pictures of the world and
the will to fill gaps in them” (p. 53). The experience that is expressed by the question has
three factors that motivate the asking of and are expressed in a question: cognitive,
incognitive, and volitional. The cognitive factor of the experience expressed by the
question is the conviction that there exists an adequate picture of the situation; the
incognitive factor indicates a realized indeterminacy in the picture. The volitional factor
is the will to resolve the indeterminacy in the picture of the situation. Importantly, while
it is an indeterminate picture of reality (the incognitive factor), the picture itself is
adequate (the cognitive factor); that is, what constitutes a determinate picture is known.
What remains unknown is the information that will transform the indeterminate situation
into a determinate one.
To demonstrate the epistemic function of the question to define the indeterminate
situation, which is the “known unknown,” consider the following example from a
neuroscientific dissertation abstract in the current data set. When asking, “What is the
role of hippocampal brain rhythms and neural spikes in episodic memory processes?”
(N50), what is known is that hippocampal brain rhythms and neural spikes have a role in
episodic memory processes; what is unknown is the precise nature of the role.

123
Juxtaposed, they produce a known unknown: that hippocampal brain rhythms and neural
spikes have some undetermined function in the neural mechanisms of episodic encoding
and retrieval. Fundamentally, questions express the indeterminate situation that drives
inquiry. The will to transform the indeterminate situation into a determinate one is
expressed by the asking of the question, or the declarative statement of the intent to
answer the question (“This dissertation demonstrates,” “I analyze,” “This thesis
concerns,” etc.).
The second aspect of Brożek’s (2011) definition of questions is that they are
defined by their logical structure, rather than by their syntactic structure. As relates to
structure, there are two types of questions: hypothetive and completive. The structure of
completive questions consists of three explicit parts: a question particle (who, what,
when, where, why, how), a question mark or its spoken counterpart, and the remainder of
the sentence. Hypothetive questions are structurally marked by inversion, or in the case
of embedded questions, by the whether- or which- question particle. While a few
knowledge products present questions directly, most embed the question in a declarative
statement of intent to fill the indeterminate situation. For instance, one dissertation
abstract states, “Here, we wanted to further characterize the contribution of Cdh1 to
learning and memory at both developmental and adult stages” (N47). While this
statement lacks the syntax of a question, it implies a question, which can be expressed by
reinserting the volitional element, the invitation to respond. Since the rest of the abstract
confirms that this is a completive, open-ended question rather than a hypothetive, closedended one, the transformation of the declarative description of intent can be transformed
into an interrogative by the re-insertion of the appropriate completive indicative: who,

124
what, when, where, why, or how. The only sensible choices are what- or how-: “What is
the contribution of Cdh1 to learning and memory at both developmental and adult
stages?” or “How does Cdh1 contribute to learning and memory…?” Considering the
presentation of the answer in the abstract, it is determined that the what- question is more
accurate. By this manner, we can be guided in the formulation of the question correlates
implicit in the presentation of knowledge claims in knowledge products.
It is important to note that the question correlate, as derived from the knowledge
products, is the “ideal” question in that the researcher poses it to the reader in full
knowledge of the answer. In this way, the current treatment of the question differs from
the cognitive investigations of question formation and negotiation in the information
search process, in which questions are manifestations of the searchers’ cognitive state of
knowledge in relation to the topic throughout the inquiry process (Kuhlthau, 1992). The
“ideal” question is, admittedly, static in nature, as it is formulated as a perfect inversion
of the answer, post-inquiry. But by this conception, the question paradox is unraveled:
questions do require that one knows what one does not know. One must know the
manner in which the situation is indeterminate. For this reason, knowledge products such
as scholarly publications, which present results of completed research, are ripe sources of
data for the initial establishment of a social epistemological theory of questions. In
contrast, one can think of the concept of a “working” question and its multitudinous
iterations as snapshots of either the scholar’s changing focus or increasingly refined
understanding of the research being undertaken. Research documents that reflect the
working question, such as dissertation proposals, research journals, memos, and reports,
have much to reveal about the relation of the individual questioner to the domain, but the

125
finished product is the better source for understanding questions in relation to knowledge
domains. A conception of the question as having a distinct communicative function and
logical structure allows for a consistent approach to characterizing the knowledge
products of a domain or multiple domains.

5.4 Description of method
The method for identifying questions from the knowledge products of inquiry
developed organically en route to the characterization and comparison of scholarly
domains according to their question formulations about the topic of “memory.” Two
principles were held in tension in the development and application of the method: (1) to
stay as close to the special languages and vocabularies of the domains, making
adjustments to the presented question as needed only for the sake of clarity and
consistency across the sample, and (2) to select the question that most precisely
communicates the known unknown from its myriad potential variants. In cases where the
sample is narrowly defined, such as when confined to a highly specific topic in which
domain inquiry is united in its focus and methods – having a high degree of strategic
dependence and low degree of strategic task uncertainty, in Whitley’s (2000) typology –
the tension between the two principles is likely low, as compared to the comparison
across disparate and diversely structured domains, in which case the tension may be high.
The method consists of four sequential steps that can be applied to any sample of
knowledge products, whether of a single domain or multiple domains.
1. Choose the sample of knowledge products – The sample of knowledge products,
in type, number, and domain affiliation, should reflect the social epistemological
context of interest. The choice to sample from a single domain at a point in time

126
or over a period of time, multiple related domains, multiple highly contrasting
domains, or multiple domains on a common topic corresponds to the depth and
breadth of focus that the corresponding analysis will have.
a. Type of knowledge product – The choice of what type of knowledge
product to analyze has a direct relation to the questions that will be
identified from the knowledge products. Analysis of entire books will
produce different questions than its individual chapters; photographs of
objects will produce different questions than written descriptions or the
objects themselves.
b. Sampling frame and size – The size, depth, and breadth of the sample will
also have an effect on the questions and answers identified. While a single
knowledge product can be subjected to the method, it is better applied to
coherent samples that attempt to represent a sub-domain, domain, or
multiple domains, due to the assumption that questions are social
epistemological tools and meant to be interpreted in relation to knowledge
domains. The more narrow the sample, the more the questions and
answers will reflect subject expert knowledge. The broader the sample,
the more the questions and answers will reflect a meta-perspective on the
domain or domains.
2. Familiarization with the sample – Familiarization with the knowledge products in
their entirety, whether through reading, viewing, or otherwise engaging with them
as dependent on their modality (textual, audio/visual, experiential, etc.), is the
priming stage for identification of the questions. The goal of this stage is to gain

127
a general familiarity with the structures and semantics of the knowledge products,
which provides context for the identification of the question- and answerindicative segments in Step 3.
3. Identification of question and answer-indicative segments – Identification of the
abstract segments that are indicative of the questions driving inquiry or the
answers produced by the inquiry are coded as “question” and “answer,”
respectively. For written knowledge products, code-able segments can be as
small as a sentence phrase or span many pages of text. Other types of knowledge
products (audio/visual products, tools or instruments, actions, etc.) will require
individualized determinations of what constitutes a code-worthy unit. This step is
essentially one of data reduction (Miles & Huberman, 1994), in which the nonquestion/answer-indicative parts of the knowledge product are eliminated in order
to see the question and its answer more clearly. The principle of coding should
tend towards inclusion of potentially relevant information at the beginning of this
process, then towards leaner coding as the epistemic structures of the knowledge
product (relation between informative segments and question/answer) begin to
emerge. The question and answer-indicative segments are identified on an
iterative basis until stability is achieved in the sample.
4. Formulation of the question – Formulation of the questions begins with those
abstracts with easily identifiable questions, requiring little-to-no manipulation of
the coded segments, and proceeds in stages to those requiring increased
manipulation and interpretation of the knowledge product as a whole. The
guiding principle is to stay as close to the language of the knowledge product as is

128
possible. Identification of the questions is conducted, in iterative manner, for the
entire sample of knowledge products, adjusting language or syntax as necessary to
reflect the relation of the individual knowledge products to the whole sample.
By this method, the knowledge products of a domain or domains can be approached in a
manner that is consistent in regards to the theoretical conception and empirical
identification of the questions that drive inquiry and the answers that are produced in
reply to the questions, as embodied in the knowledge products of the inquiry. At the
same time, the method is inherently flexible in that the level of specificity and contextual
nuances of the questions are dependent on the sample. A sample of knowledge products
from a narrow sub-field of the domain will engender a highly subject-specific
characterization of questions, while a sample across the entire domain will produce a
more domain-general characterization of questions. Comparison across several domains
will produce an even broader characterization of questions. It follows that a single
knowledge product may be represented by a limitless number of variations of questions
in a limitless number of sampling scenarios. This does not reflect a lack of reliability;
rather it is a measure of validity that reflects the meta-epistemological perspective of
knowledge organization. Knowledge products have no single, essential question, but
limitless variations depending on the social epistemological context in which they are
being located.

5.5 Application of method to the scholarly research on “memory”
The method that is described in general terms above is now described in the
context in which it was developed: the analysis of 97 dissertation abstracts in
neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering on the topic of “memory.” The first

129
step of the method for identifying questions and answers from the knowledge products of
inquiry is the selection of the sample for analysis. Since the interest is in characterizing
domains according to the questions they ask, the sampling frame is dissertation research
on “memory” over a five-year period (2006 to 2011). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
Database was searched for dissertations with “memory” appearing as a keyword, in the
title, or in the abstract, returning 420 results. Three of the top four highest producing
domains were chosen for comparison, resulting in a sample of 97 dissertation abstracts
after weeding out those not centrally about “memory”: 57 in neuroscience, 20 in literature,
and 20 in computer engineering. The abstracts were read in their entirety numerous times,
domain by domain, until a general familiarity was achieved with the language and
structure of the abstracts (Step Two). Steps Three and Four of the method were then
applied to each domain subset.
Step Three is the identification of question and answer-indicative abstract
segments. Initial attempts to identify the questions representative of the dissertation
inquiries resulted in several observations about the tacit nature of questions in scholarly
abstracts and the mutually defining status of the question and the answer. Interrogative
questions (statements marked by the use of question indicatives (wh- words) and ending
in a question mark, or the use of inverted grammar) are rarely present. In many cases, the
question is stated as a declarative: “This thesis seeks to explore…” “I will show…” “This
research considers…”. In some cases, the question is only implied in descriptions of the
research design or methodology. The answer is often more easily identified than the
“question.” It is recognizable in its presentation as the “findings,” “results,” or new
knowledge that is produced by the inquiry. In fact, the question is sometimes only

130
recognizable as an inversion of the answer. These observations suggested a multi-staged
process of identifying the questions from the abstracts, starting with those most easily
identified and requiring little transformation, and progressing to successive stages
according to the type and level of transformation involved (Step Four).
5.5.1 Neuroscience. The question- and answer-indicative segments were
identified by a process of data reduction. The segments of the abstracts that are not
directly indicative of the questions or answer were eliminated, such as those describing
the motivation or background of the research problem or explanations of the research
design and methods, leaving only the segments that pertained to the question and its
answer. What remains is, essentially, the question and answer summary of the inquiry.

Abstract
The behavioral and neural effects of emotion regulation on autobiographical memory retrieval
Individuals' short- and long-term goals can influence the constructive nature of
autobiographical memory recall. The overarching aim of this dissertation was to examine how
emotion regulation goals in particular might modulate autobiographical recall at both a
behavioral and neural level. In Chapter 1, a new behavioral task instructed individuals to
cognitively reappraise the emotions associated with negative and positive events. Results
revealed that such emotion regulation goals influence the emotional and other subjective
experiences associated with recall, such that up-regulation instructions were linked to greater
reported levels of emotional intensity, sensory detail, and recollection (e.g., reliving), and
vice-versa for down-regulation instructions. In Chapter 2, functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) was used as participants were instructed to decrease, increase, or maintain the
emotions associated with negative autobiographical events. Decreasing emotional intensity
primarily engaged neural activity in regions previously implicated in cognitive control (e.g.,
dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex), emotion generation and processing (e.g.,
amygdala, insula), and visual imagery (e.g., precuneus) during an early phase of recall as
participants searched for and retrieved events. In contrast, increasing emotional intensity
engaged similar regions as individuals prepared to recall negative events (i.e., before a
memory cue was presented) and again as they later elaborated upon the details of the events
they had recalled. In Chapter 3, individual differences in habitual use of cognitive reappraisal
were measured and their relation to neural activity during autobiographical recall was
examined. Results revealed that, even when not explicitly instructed to reappraise, habitual use
of reappraisal was broadly associated with neural activity in cognitive control regions (e.g.,
dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) as well as emotion
processing regions (e.g., amygdala, insula) across memories that varied in their emotionality
and specificity. Taken together, these results suggest that short- and long-term emotion
regulation goals can influence the construction of autobiographical memories on both
behavioral and neural levels.

Table 11. Neuroscience: Identifying question- and answer-indicative segments
The reduced portions of the abstract indicate the current state of knowledge on the topic,
the research design and methods, and the findings of the individual studies that comprise
the dissertation as a whole.9 These abstract elements, or inquiry components, will be
further analyzed and utilized in Chapter Seven to identify the epistemic form of the
question. A general rule of thumb for identifying the question- and answer-indicative
segments is to ask, “Does this tell me what the inquiry is about?” If so, it pertains to the
question. The segments indicating why the research is being undertaken, or how it is
carried out, inform about the nature of knowledge production in the domain but are not
essential to identifying the question. The identified question is also compared to the
dissertation title, to consider whether it reflects the dissertation author’s own conception
of what the inquiry is “about.”
Once the question and answer- indicative segments were identified, the
identification of questions proceeded from the simplest cases to the most complex, from
those requiring little-to-no syntactical transformations, to those requiring more
manipulation. As expected from preliminary readings of the abstracts, in no cases was
the question directly stated in interrogative form. In thirty-six of the fifty-seven abstracts,
identification of the question entailed turning a declarative statement of the researchers’
intent or statement of the research problem into an question through the inversion of
sentence grammar (Table 12).
9

Consideration was given as to whether to characterize the dissertation as having a single
question and answer or to identify a separate question and answer for each of the three studies
that comprise this dissertation. Since the sample is a broad, comparative sample of memory
research, it was decided that the broader question, as informed by the individual studies and
results, was more appropriate.

Table 12. Neuroscience: Transforming declarative statements of researcher intent
into questions
N47 states the intention of the inquiry as, “Here, we wanted to further characterize the
contribution…” which is transformed by inversion and the insertion of the question
indicative, what-, into “What is the contribution…?” The transformation of N1, a
hypothetive question, undergoes essentially the same transformation (inversion and
insertion of a question indicative, whether-), but the syntax is additionally adjusted. The
indirect whether- formulation is chosen in order to maintain consistency and ease of
presentation of hypothetive questions, whose direct variants may begin with “Is…?”
“Do…?” “Does?” etc.
In erotetic theoretical terms, these transformations reinsert the volitional aspect
that characterizes the communicative function of questions according to the logical
structure of completive or hypothetive questions. The statements are transformed from
declarations of the intent to resolve an indeterminate situation, to invitations to resolve an
indeterminate situation. The formulated question is checked against the identified answer
segments, to ensure that the question accurately represents the indeterminate situation
that is resolved by the answer. A full list of the questions formulated in this manner and
the questions and the abstract segments from which they were derived are included as
Appendix B.

133
Of the remaining ten abstracts in the sample that do not declare the researchers’
intent, in six cases the question is implied by the presentation of the answer. The
principle that all knowledge has a question correlate (Hookway, 2008) justifies the
inference of the question from the presentation of the answer.

Abstract segment
One hypothesis that has been proposed to account for these inconsistent
findings is that the response of some brain regions subserving working
memory (WM) task performance to parametrically increasing WM load,
most critically dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, may in fact be non-monotonic
in nature; that is, at sufficiently high loads activation in these regions may
begin to decrease…. To date, this hypothesis has not been directly tested;
however, I report here the results of a series of studies using the selfordered working memory task that clearly demonstrate such an 'inverted-U'
in healthy participants that is absent in patients with schizophrenia.

Question
Whether healthy
patients demonstrate
an “inverted-U’
response to the selfordered WM task
that is absent in
patients with
schizophrenia.

Table 13. Neuroscience: Inferring questions from answers
Table 13 shows an example of the identification of a question correlate from the
presentation of the answer. In this dissertation, an existing hypothesis, that patients with
schizophrenia lack the “inverted-U” pattern of neural activity of healthy patients, is put to
the empirical test. As with the hypothetive question in Table 12, the question is formed
by inverting the sentence grammar, inserting a question indicative (whether-), and
adjusting the syntax of the question to conform to the consistent presentation of
hypothetive questions in the sample.
Finally, the questions of the twelve remaining abstracts in the sample are most
clearly indicated in the title of the dissertation. The example in Table 14 demonstrates
this type of transformation.

Table 14. Neuroscience: Inferring questions from titles
In these cases, transformation of the title produces the most concise and complete
question correlate, as compared to the other abstract segments such as presentation of the
research design or answer. Hjørland and Albrechtsen (1995) propose that that the
information value of different subject access points such as titles, abstracts, citations,
descriptors, or words from full-text records is relative to the domain. That the question
can be identified solely by the title for these twelve abstracts indicates that neuroscience
places a high informational value on the title as a subject access point.
Overall, the neuroscience abstracts largely present declarative statements of
researchers’ intent, which are transformed into questions by the appending of question
particles or syntactic inversion. When there is no declarative statement from which the
question can be formulated by reinserting the volitional factor, the question correlate of
the answer can be identified, or inferred, from other elements of the abstract.
5.5.2 Literature. While the language and style of literature abstracts differs
markedly from neuroscience abstracts, the underlying epistemic structure is quite similar.
Identification of the question- and answer-indicative segments for the twenty literature
abstracts follows the basic procedure that was applied in the neuroscience sample. The
abstract segments related to description of the topic, theoretical influences, and
methodological approaches – anything related to how or why the inquiry is being
conducted – were eliminated in order to reduce the data to the question- and answerindicative segments (Table 15).

Abstract
The crónista (re)writes the nation: Memory and "alternative histories" in crónicas of Mexican
centennial and bicentennial commemorations of independence

Question

This study examines the relationship between the Latin American journalistic crónica

135

Answer

("chronicle") and memory, specifically the way writers used highly imaginative crónicas as a
means to uphold or challenge official memory and history and to propose "alternative"
readings of the nation during Mexico's centenary and bicentenary commemorations of
Independence of 1910, 1921, and 2010. The centenarios were times when historical memory
was of paramount importance and that foregrounded two long-standing obsessions of the
crónica: the topic of national identity and an interest in great historical events. Positing the
crónica as a sort of literary lieu de mémoire ("site of memory"), the study analyzes works from
Mexican and Mexican American cronistas ("chroniclers") drawn from current and turn-of-thecentury periodical sources including writings by Juan B. Urrutia, "Cagliostro," Rafael López,
José D. Frías, José de Jesús Núñez y Domínguez, Jorge Ulica (Julio G. Arce), Carlos
Monsiváis, Rafael Pérez Gay, and Hermann Bellinghausen. The study contends that the
modern crónica (1910, 1921) and the postmodern crónica (2010) as works of memory differ in
their literary treatment of events, partly due to the changing role of the cronista as well as
changes in the form/content, functions, and reception of the literary chronicle from one
century to the next. In the case of the Mexican independence celebrations examined here,
"alternative histories" or narratives of the nation's past also responded to changes associated
with the paradigmatic shift from modernity to postmodernity. While for turn-of-the-century
modernista writers, for instance, the crónica itself was an experiment in creative journalism,
crónicas today, often published in blogs, or online journals or newspapers, involve new forms
of experimentation, are not necessarily published by professional writers or intellectuals, and
may involve reader participation (or "modification" of official memory through online
commentary and social networking tools). Furthermore, while nineteenth-century cronicas
sought to express a singular, monolithic version of national identity, now postmodern or late
twentieth and early twenty-first century cronistas tend to question such metanarratives or "allencompassing" explanations of knowledge or "absolute truths". Today ́s cronistas also seem
less likely to function as an authoritative source of knowledge (or "memory"), as readers now
have the ability to quickly and easily verify information on their own (via the internet) and to
interact with electronically published texts to question them or to provide their own versions
of "what happened"; that is, to provide countermemories. Critical studies to date have been
unable to provide a definition of the literary crónica that accounts for diachronic changes as
well as issues relating to the genre's formal hybridity (between literature and journalism) or its
official or unofficial stance toward state-backed concerns. I argue, however, that reading the
crónica as memory transcends these questions and provides an important bridge to a more allinclusive definition of the genre, thus establishing its significance in the literary canon and
offering an additional approach to its critical study.

Table 15. Literature: Identifying question- and answer-indicative segments
In the example in Table 15, the question-indicative segment is the first sentence of the
abstract, which begins by introducing the topic (“the relationship between the Latin
American journalistic crónica ("chronicle") and memory”) and the focus of the inquiry:
“the way writers used highly imaginative crónicas as a means to uphold or challenge
official memory and history and to propose "alternative" readings of the nation during
Mexico's centenary and bicentenary commemorations of Independence of 1910, 1921,
and 2010” (N20). The answer-indicative segment comprises the bulk of the remainder of

136
the abstract. While there is more variation in length, style, and level of specificity and
thoroughness of literary abstracts than in neuroscience, the question and answerindicative segments are easily identifiable, in relation to each other and in response to the
question of what the inquiry is about, throughout the sample.
Having identified the question and answer-indicative segments of the literature
abstracts, the questions can be identified from these segments. In one rare case, the
question is actually stated outright as an interrogative (Table 16).

This is the single instance in the three-domain sample in which the question is actually
directly stated in logical form, requiring no transformation of any kind. More commonly,
the question is identified by inversion of the thesis statement (Table 17). This is a simple
syntactic transformation of the declarative expression into an interrogative one.

intent
Fifteen of the twenty literature dissertations’ questions are identified by this type of
transformation. The declarative statement of researcher intent is transformed into an
interrogative, with minimal change to the original segment (L1), by reinserting the
volitional element through inversion. When necessary, details are extracted from
elsewhere in the abstract in order to make the question completely self-sufficient, as
when a reference to “these women writers” in the original abstract is replaced with the
specific women writers’ names and their shared characteristics (L3).

In this case, as with the neuroscience example in Table 14, the abstract does not offer a
singular clear statement of what the dissertation is about, but the title is judged to
encompass the entirety of the answer that is presented in the abstract. This dissertation
stands out in comparison to the rest of the dissertations as producing literary theory where
the others produce literary criticism. The level of difficulty in identifying the question
may represent a division with the domain, between theoretical and critical dissertations,
or it may simply be a product of the individual scholar’s writing style that emphasizes the
theoretical approach over the critical findings.
The identification of the questions driving the production of creative writing
dissertations demands special attention, as creative writing is not typically considered a

type of question-driven scholarly inquiry. While this issue will be taken up in more detail

Table 19. Literature: Inferring questions from declarative statements of “about”ness
The creative writing dissertations’ abstracts are a combination of plot summary,
description of literary technique, and identification of literary influences. The questions
are notably broad, in relation to the other literature questions. The works are “about a
collective memory” (L7), or involve “the collectivity of memory” (L14), or importance of
memory in the South (L17). In relation to these broad characterizations of memory, the
question is equally broad. If the answer is that memory is collective, then the nature of
the indeterminate situation that it seeks to resolve is not “what is memory,” but “what is
the nature of memory – is it individual or collective?”
In summary, the questions of the majority of the literature abstracts are identified
through a transformation of declarative statements of researcher intent into interrogatives.
Where there is less clarity, the conception of the question as having a communicative
function of expressing a indeterminate situation is more heavily leaned upon to identify

139
the nature of the indeterminacy. A full list of the formulated questions and question and
answer segments from which they are derived literature abstracts is found in Appendix B.

about), and explanation of the design solution (how the question is answered). The
reduction of the twenty computer engineering abstracts down to question and answerindicative segments required elimination of the why and how, leaving the what – the
question and answer-indicative segments – from which the question can be extracted
(Table 20).

Abstract
Providing Fast and Safe Access to Next-Generation, Non-Volatile Memories
Emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as phase change memory, spin-torque
transfer memory, and the memristor, will provide many orders of magnitude decrease in
latency compared to disk and flash memory, dramatic increases in bandwidth, and a byteaddressable interface similar to DRAM. These new memories will offer enormous
performance gains and intuitive abstractions for storage, but fully realizing these benefits
requires us to rid software of disk-centric optimizations, design decisions, and architectures
that limit performance and ignore bottlenecks previously hidden by the poor performance of
disk. The algorithms that storage and database systems use to enforce strong consistency
guarantees are critical to performance, and current solutions are deeply tied to conventional
disk technology. This dissertation addresses the problem of providing transactional support for
fast, non-volatile memories that exploits their raw performance and makes programming easy.
First, we present a prototype PCI-based storage array that targets fast, non-volatile memories
and provides hardware support for multi-part atomic write operations. Multi-part atomic
writes atomically and durably commit groups of writes to storage. Unlike previous approaches
for flash-based SSDs, multi-part atomic write support makes logging scalable and transparent,
providing a strong foundation for flexible ACID transactions. Using multi-part atomic writes,
existing transactions mechanisms such as ARIES-style write-ahead logging can be redesigned
to make optimal use of these memories, providing up to 3.7× the performance of the baseline
version of ARIES. Second, we address the problem of providing strong consistency
guarantees for storage that is directly accessible via the processor's memory bus. We present
NV-heaps, a persistent object store which provides a familiar programming interface and
protects against application and system failures by avoiding familiar programmer errors as
well as new errors that only arise with persistent objects. Compared to Berkeley DB and
Stasis, two persistent object stores designed for disk, NV-heaps improves performance by 32×
and 244×, respectively, for operations on a variety of persistent data structures. To further
improve safety, we present programming language support for NV-heaps. We introduce a

140
Java-like language that provides the features NV-heaps require, along with a new static
dependent type system that enforces the invariants that make NV-heaps safe.

Table 20. Computer engineering: Identifying question- and answer-indicative
segments
The first few sentences of CE2 describe the significance of the inquiry in terms of the
memory-related obstacles to computer performance based on forecasted trends in
computer technology. Next, the abstract states the broad dissertation-level problem
emerging from the forecasted trends, “the problem of providing transactional support for
fast, non-volatile memories that exploits their raw performance and makes programming
easy.” The problem is addressed in three answer-indicative segments, corresponding to a
three-part design solution to the problem.
In five dissertation abstracts, including the example above, the question-indicative
abstract segment is a declarative statement of researcher intent or belief, similar to the
majority of dissertations in neuroscience and literature (Table 21).

Table 23. Computer engineering: Inferring questions from answers
In these dissertations, the declarative statement of the answer is transformed into an
interrogative question by identifying the question correlate to the cognitive indeterminacy
implied by the presented answer. As with the previous subset, action-oriented
declarations are responses to how- questions, while object-oriented declarations are
responses to what- questions. From the declaration that “we study every major element

142
of the memory system… and identify the key bottlenecks to efficiency ” (CE18), the
question is identified as, “What are the key bottlenecks to efficiency?” The objectoriented declaration corresponds to a what- question.

the introductory description of the research problem and the answer-indicative segment
(Table 24).

In CE20, the answer-indicative segment (“A”) suggests that the question is “How can
memory be successfully applied?” The definition of “success” is identified in the
abstract segment that introduces the research problem (“P”) in relation to the known
limitation of PCM’s write operation: long write latency, high write power, and limited
write endurance. The resulting question combines the information from both in a single
interrogative that describes the indeterminate situation that is driving inquiry.
In summary, the question formulations in computer engineering abstracts are
more implicit than those of neuroscience and literature, generally requiring more
manipulation than the simple transformation from a declarative statement of researcher
intent to an interrogative. Abstracts are mostly focused on the description of the
memory-related problem and the proposal and validation of the solution, from which two

143
elements the question is identified. A full list of the questions and the abstract segments
from which they are derived are found in Appendix B.

5.6 Conclusion
In seeking to characterize domains by their question formulations, a method was
developed for identifying the question formulations implicit in the knowledge products of
inquiry. While the method was developed for the scholarly abstract, it is intended as
applicable to other knowledge products and non-scholarly knowledge domains, albeit
with greater effort due to the likelihood of greater ambiguity, particularly for nonlinguistic knowledge products and the products of artistic fields, such as music, art
objects, and performances. Identifying the questions from neuroscience, literature, and
computer engineering abstracts describing dissertation research on “memory” was,
overall, a straightforward process once familiarization with the domain subsets was
achieved. This speaks to the epistemic efficacy of the abstract as a knowledge product of
scholarly inquiry and tool of scholarly communication, that presentations of the inquiry
produced clear patterns, to the extent that deviations from the relative norm are
identifiable and able to be mapped to the epistemic elements by which the abstracts
present the results of the inquiry.
The development and application of this method for identifying the questions
presented in knowledge products fulfills the first research question, which asks, “What
questions do the knowledge domains of neuroscience, literature, and computer
engineering formulate about the topic of “memory?” The questions, analyzed in the
context of the entire abstracts, form the main source of data for the analysis in Stage Two.
Chapter Six analyzes the content of the domains’ questions about memory, what they ask

144
about memory, and how the content of the question indicates what constitutes an answer.
Chapter Seven analyzes the epistemic forms in which the domains’ questions are
presented and what question form conveys about how to answer. In this manner, the
method and work of this chapter form the foundation of the analyses and discussions
comprising the remaining chapters of the dissertation.

In response to the “question paradox,” which states that in order to ask what one
does not know, one already has to know (Flammer, 1981), this dissertation recasts
questions as social epistemological tools of inquiry, rather than as cognitive indicators of
individuals’ information needs. A domain comparative approach to inquiry seeks to
determine whether one of the ways that knowledge domains are differentiated is by their
question formulations, and how these question formulations divulge information about
what constitutes an answer and the underlying assumptions of inquiry within the domain.
Chapter Five describes the development of a method for identifying the often implicit
questions from the knowledge products of inquiry and its application to the abstracts of
dissertations about “memory” in three domains: neuroscience, literature, and computer
engineering. The current chapter characterizes and compares the content of the domains’
questions, producing a relative picture of what domains ask about in relation to “memory,”
and considers what question content conveys about the expected content of the answers
that follow the question.
The identification of question content from domain knowledge products is
theoretically informed by the logical philosophical approach to questions, namely
Brożek’s (2011) erotetic theory. Erotetic theory characterizes questions as a class of
expressions that communicate the experience of having an indeterminate cognitive
picture of reality and the will to fill it. As applied to domain-level discourse about
“memory,” questions express the will to transform an indeterminate situation in the

146
domain into a determinate one. Abstract-derived question formulations are analyzed
based on the analogy between document- and sentence-aboutness: just as logical analysis
can determine what a sentence is about, so it can determine what a document, as a
sequence or aggregation of sentences (Furner, 2012), is about. The identification of
question formulations from the dissertation abstracts was conducted following a
nominalist approach to document “aboutness” or subject, rather than a realist approach,
defined as considering document aboutness not as an objective property of the work, but
as a relation between sets of works, subjects, agents, and dates (Furner, 2012).
Accordingly, question content is determined not as an objective property of each
individual abstract, but as relative to the other abstracts in the same domain, as well as to
the other domains.
This chapter responds to the research questions about question content: (2a) what
are the contents of domains’ question formulations on the topic of “memory,” (2b) how
do they compare, and (4a) what information do the comparisons convey about the
answers that follow? The content of questions and answers about “memory” in
neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering are analyzed in order to determine the
question content and what the question content conveys about criteria for an answer.

6.2 Method for classifying question content
How do domains compare in terms of the questions they ask about “memory,”
which express the indeterminate situations relative to “memory” in each domain? Derr
(1984) defines questions as linguistic entities used to make epistemic determinations
about objects in the world, having two parts: subject and query. A question’s subject is a
term or terms that refers to an object in the world about which some type of

147
determination is being sought, while the query is an expression that identifies the
particular determination to be made regarding the subject of the question. The subject is
that entity which has an uncertain epistemic status; the query is the particular
determination that will resolve the uncertain epistemic status. In the sentence, “Who is
the president of the United States?” the subject of the question is “the president of the
United States, and the query is “Who is he/she?” “The president of the United States” is
the object in the world about which a determination is being made; the determination
being sought is the identification of his or her identity. Together, the query-subject
pairing constitutes the content of the question being posed, describing the epistemic
indeterminacy, or indeterminate situation, that the domain seeks to resolve through
inquiry. The query-subject pairings demonstrate how questions are formulated to express
the indeterminate situation, which is a known unknown in the sense that the manner in
which the situation is indeterminate is being expressed.
The method for identifying question content, following Derr’s (1984) conception
of question structure and taking as its primary source of data the questions identified in
Chapter Five, has two steps: (1) identifying the question’s subject(s) and (2) identifying
the query or queries that are being posed about the subject(s).
6.2.1 Identifying subjects. Analysis of question subjects reveals the kinds of
objects – entities or phenomena – that are available to populate domains’ question
formulations about “memory” as a topic of domain research. The question formulations
identified in Chapter Five are the primary data from which question content is determined,
in the context of an in-depth familiarity with the abstracts in their entirety and other
secondary data sources including a sample of full-text dissertations, interviews with

148
thirteen of the dissertation authors, and introductory subject literature. The questions
were subjected to open and iterative coding for the subjects, the aspects and types of
“memory,” its features, or relations, about which some types of determinations are being
sought. The questions that guided coding of question subject were, “What is this
dissertation about, in regards to memory? What is the memory-related entity or
phenomenon in the world about which some type of determination is being made?”
Codes were inductively generated according to the principle of constant comparison
(Fram, 2013) on a domain-by-domain basis until stability was achieved within each
domain and across domains.
6.2.2 Identifying queries. Analysis of question queries reveals the existential
aspects of the “memory”-related subjects that are of interest in the three domains.
Dillon’s (1984) classification scheme for classifying scholarly research questions was
adapted to identify the types of queries that are posed by dissertations about “memory”related subjects (M) and other related phenomena (P, Q, etc.) (Table 25).

Table 25. Classification scheme for question queries (Modified version of Table 1 in
Dillon, 1984)
Given the use of Derr’s (1984) conception of the question as comprising subject and
query, what Dillon (1984) originally labels as categories of “questions” are here renamed
as “queries,” defined as the type of determination being made about M, the memoryrelated subject. First-order queries produce knowledge about the properties or individual
attributes of “memory.” The six first-order categories have a double-label, with the first
label indicating the existential aspect of “memory” in question and the second describing
the aspect in cognitive terms. The categories are arranged according to the order in
which the questions arise, suggesting that knowledge about a phenomenon is built
sequentially and incrementally: from affirmation of its existence, to identification of its
instantiations, to definition of its substance, and so on. Second- and third-order queries
describe comparative and contingent relations between “memory” and other phenomena,
P and Q (and R, etc.). The three orders thus describe queries producing propositional
knowledge about “memory” along a spectrum, from the fundamental aspect of the
existence of “memory” to the ultimate knowledge of its cause. Third order queries of
contingency that seek knowledge of relations between P and Q do not arise before second
order queries that produce knowledge of the comparative attributes of P and Q; second
order queries do not arise before first order queries that produce knowledge of the
properties of P itself.
Two additional orders include queries that exist outside of this sequential order.
The zero order of rhetorical queries includes queries that preclude inquiry or an answer,
such as tautological queries, loaded queries, and contradictory queries. Accommodating

150
other ways of knowing “memory,” the extra order includes queries of deliberation, as
well as a new category emerging from the current analysis, queries of acquaintance.
6.2.3 Answer content. Derr’s (1984) classification is a conceptual representation
of the correspondence relation between question and answer, in the sense of Hookway’s
(2008) proposition that knowledge sentences have indirect question correlates. If the
knowledge in the answer is “whether this is a/the instance” of the phenomenon, M, then
the question must pose a query of (2) instance/identification. Conversely, if the question
poses a query of (13) biconditionality, then it expresses the requirement that the answer
determines “whether or how if “M then P and if P then Q” – whether there is a causal
relationship between the phenomena. The query-subject pairings are thus categorizations
of the domains’ indeterminate situations regarding “memory” that convey the manner of
determination that the answer must provide. The answer must provide the known
unknown, that which will transform the indeterminate situation into a determinate one.
Question and knowledge are complementary sides of the same coin, and the content of
the question determines the content of the answer. Queries of (4) character/description
produce knowledge of what M has, queries of (5) function/application produce
knowledge of what M does, and so on. Question content declares the requirements for
answer content by virtue of defining the subject of inquiry and the type of query
determination that is being made about the subject.
The domains of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering are here
described in terms of the query-subject pairings emerging from analysis of their questions
about “memory,” as identified from the abstracts of 97 dissertations. The analytic focus
is on what domains’ question content tells us about what they ask about “memory.”

151
Question subjects, the memory-related things in the world that the inquiry is about, are
identified through inductive coding of the questions. The classification scheme in Table
1 is subsequently utilized to classify the queries, the particular determinations being
sought about the memory-related subjects. In some cases, the identification of queries in
relation to subjects caused reconsideration and recoding of earlier coded subjects, which
resulted in a more consistent set of codes within and across domains. Queries and
subjects will be discussed in a paired manner: as some type or types of queries posed
about certain memory-related subjects, labeled query – subject, together comprising the
category of question content. Each question content category is also discussed in terms
of what it conveys about the content of the answers that should follow.

6.3 Neuroscience
The questions posed by neuroscience dissertations can be categorized into querysubject pairings in two broad groupings: those of the first order that ask about the
properties of memory, and those of the third order that ask about the contingent relations
of memory and other phenomena. The subjects identify the memory-related objects or
phenomena of uncertain epistemic status, while the queries identify the particular
epistemic determination being sought about the subject. Together, they describe the
indeterminate situations that constitute the content of neuroscientific questions about
memory in a manner that expresses the requirements for an answer.
6.3.1 Results. The neuroscientific questions about memory can be characterized
by seven query-subject pairings, with the number of question formulations occupying
each category indicated in the last column (Table 26).

Table 26. Neuroscience: Question content
The query-subject pairings of the first order describe the content of neuroscience
questions about the properties of memory. Three of the dissertations, whose questions
are listed in Table 27, pose queries of (3) substance/definition about the neural correlates
of memory, specifically about associative memory (N3), conceptual memory (N5), and
successful cognitive aging as defined by working memory performance (N30).

Question
What are the electrophysiological and neural correlates of associative memory?
What is the neural basis of conceptual memory networks in healthy adults and in patients with
memory impairments resulting from neurodegenerative disease??
What is the neural signature of “successful” cognitive aging (SCA), as defined by working
memory performance?

Table 27. Neuroscience: Queries of substance/definition about the neural correlates
of memory
Queries of (3) substance/definition define the neurological signature of different memory
types by directing inquiry towards the definition of the pattern of neurological activity, as
indicated by electrical activity or increased blood flow in certain areas of the brain,
during the performance of a task that calls upon the type of memory under study. This is
the most fundamental work of the neuroscience of memory, engaging subjects in memory
tasks in order to identify the pattern of neural activity that defines that type of memory at
the neurological level. To be able to locate the patterns of neural activity that represent
the memory type, process, or phenomena under investigation is to be able to declare that
it exists, in neuroscientific terms. Answers to (3) substance/definition – neural correlates

153
of memory questions involve identification of the levels and patterns of neural activity
corresponding to the memory-related subject, and the brain region(s) or structure(s) in
which the activity appears. The identification of the neural activity’s locale provides a
context for interpreting the memory type, process, or phenomenon according to what is
already known about the various regions and structures of the brain and their role in
memory. The queries of (3) substance/definition about the neural correlates of memory
demand that the answers define the patterns of neural activity that correspond to the type
of memory or memory phenomenon whose epistemic status is in question.
Beyond the initial identification of neural correlates of memory, fourteen
dissertations formulate their questions as queries of (4) character/description queries
about the role of X in memory questions, where X is subcategorized as being at the
anatomical or neuronal level (Table 28).
Anatomical level (5)
N9
(1) Whether humans recruit the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex to successfully retrieve welllearned overlapping spatial routes; (2) Whether the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum
interact cooperatively to support flexible navigation of overlapping routes; (3) Whether the
hippocampus and caudate contribute to forming context-dependent memories
N15 What is the role of the gustatory cortex in learning?
N31 What is the role of the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex in time and distance coding?
N38 What are the functional processes of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) and the striatum (the input
nucleus of the basal ganglia) during associative learning and memory?

What is the role of the atypical Protein Kinase C zeta orthologue, PKC Apl III, in synaptic
plasticity and long term memory in Aplysia californica?
N17 What is the role of Homer1c in hippocampal function?

suppression in the medial temporal lobe during memory consolidation?
N28 What is the role of dysbindin in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory?
N36 (1) How are ERK- and mTOR-dependent proteins temporally expressed following acquisition of
delay fear conditioning? (2) Whether ERK and mTOR signaling are required for long-term
memory formation using selective inhibitors in the amygdala; (3) Whether ERK and mTOR
inhibition in the amygdala affects protein expression in other brain regions that receive amygdala
inputs
N45 What is the role of BDNF Va166Met in aberrant fear learning in both humans and animal models,
particularly during the developmental transition into and out of adolescence, when anxiety and
affective disorders are most prevalent in human populations?

What is the role of small RNAs in memory-related synaptic plasticity in Aplysia?
How can psychostimulants modulate memory processes and create addiction-like memories in
mice?

Table 28. Neuroscience: Queries of character/description about the role of X in
memory
Following the definition of the neural correlates of different types of memory, (4)
character/description – role of X in memory questions seek to describe the neural
components of various types of memory. At the anatomical level, the queries ask about
and produce knowledge of the specific brain structures that play a significant role in some
type of memory: the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory (N9) and episodic
memory (N50); the role of the gustatory cortex in learning and memory (N15); the role of
the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex in time and distance coding (N31); and the
role of the medial temporal lobe and striatum during associative learning and memory
(N38). The answers to these queries describe the roles that the anatomical structures play
in relation to memory – the ways in which they interact with other structures and how
they function as a part of larger memory and learning systems, for example, “that both
the MTL and striatum participate in the learning of arbitrary associations but also
dynamically interact during learning” (N38).
At the neuronal level, eight questions consider the role of specific protein kinases
in relation to the memory processes that they enable: PKC Apl III in synaptic plasticity
and long-term memory (N6); Homer1c in hippocampal function (N17); histone
methylation in the medial temporal lobe during long-term memory formation (N21);
dysbindin in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (N28); ERK and mTORdependent proteins during memory consolidation (N36); Cdh1 in fear learning and
memory (N47); BDNF Va188Met in aberrant fear learning (N45); and 5-HT3 receptors
in extinction of learned fear such as that resulting from traumatic events (N44). Apart

155
from the study of specific proteins but also at the cellular level, one question is about the
role of small RNAs in synaptic plasticity (N49). The (4) character/description – role of
X in memory questions require answers that describe the role of proteins and RNA in
producing memory, such as “that PKC Apl III is cleaved into PKM Apl III during
memory formation, and the requirements for cleavage are the same as the requirements
for the plasticity” (N6).
Fifteen neuroscience dissertations formulate their questions as queries of (4)
character/description about the neural mechanisms of memory (Table 29).

(2) How does ongoing reward learning modulate memory formation in the hippocampus?

Table 29. Neuroscience: Queries of character/description about the neural
mechanisms of memory
These questions seek to describe the neural mechanisms that constitute memory as a
process and phenomenon. They focus inquiry on the neural signals or “neural circuitry”

156
(N42) of three main processes: encoding the memory (further broken down into stages of
acquisition and consolidation), storage (retaining and maintaining the information in the
brain over time), and retrieval (reactivating a stored memory for use when needed). The
neural processes associated with types of memory in this sample of questions include: the
acquisition of associative memories (N24); punishment-motivated encoding of
declarative memory (N42); and the reward learning-modulated encoding of episodic
memories in the hippocampus (N56); the consolidation of retrieved memories (N8);
accumulation of episodic memories (N35); and the updating and storage of spatial
information (N23). Also of interest are the neural mechanisms of: memory-processing
fluency (N37), re-organization of spatial and verbal working memory due to age (N39),
information processing related to working memory (N40; N41), and proactive
interference related to working memory (N19). By asking queries of (4)
character/description about the neural mechanisms of memory, these questions demand
answers that describe the way in which memory functions in the biological substrate.
Four dissertations formulate their questions as queries of (6) rationale/explication
about memory models or instruments (Table 30).

What conventional and ethologically relevant forms of reinforcement are most effective in the

intellectual performance?
What alternate paragraph (Morris Revision-IV) for the WMS-IV Older Adult Battery Logical
Memory Subtest can be developed for the continued assessment of older adults?
What computational cognitive neuroscience model of episodic memory based on the mammalian
brain can be developed?

Table 30. Neuroscience: Queries of rationale/explication about memory models or
instruments
These questions differ from the rest of the first-order neuroscientific questions, as they do
not ask directly about the phenomenon of memory, but about the instruments of study: a

157
novel paradigm for studying fear conditioning in rats (N22), a measurement tool for
assessing older adults’ memory (N46), a training for patients with low visual working
memory capacity (N32), and a computational model of memory for the study of
mammalian episodic memory (N53). The queries of (6) rationale/explication convey an
expectation that the answer explain why the proposed tools for studying memory are
designed as they are, and how they fill the purpose for which they are designed.
Grouped into categories according to subject and query, it is apparent that firstorder questions in neuroscience mostly take the linguistic form of what- and howquestions. The what- questions seek to identify, define, or describe memory as a
neuroscientific phenomenon. The how- questions seek to discover how memory
functions neurologically. Both question types reveal the current state of knowledge by
defining the indeterminate situation in the form of a query (unknown) posed about a
subject (known). To ask, “What is the role of the gustatory cortex in learning?” (N15) is
to indicate that it is known that the gustatory cortex has a role in learning (subject = role
of X in memory), but the precise role is unknown (query = character/description). When
the research question asks, “How do episodic memories accumulate across longer time
scales and multiple presentations?” (N35), one may infer that it is known that episodic
memories do accumulate across longer time scales and multiple presentations (subject =
neural mechanisms of memory), but that the exact workings of the mechanisms by which
they do are unknown (query = character/description). In this manner, the question
content expresses the known unknown that is in the indeterminate situation and conveys
an expectation for the answer to resolve the indeterminacy.

158
The neuroscience abstracts also pose questions that produce third-order
knowledge of the contingent relations between memory and other phenomena. Eleven
dissertations pose queries of (12) conditionality about Y and memory, where Y is defined
as: diseases and disorders, traumatic brain injury, age, and individual differences (Table
31).
Diseases and disorders (5)
N10 Whether memory deficits reported by and neurobiological correlates of encoding and performance
of ill Gulf War Veterans differ from those of well GWV in a nationally representative sample
N16 Whether working memory performance differs between children diagnosed with ADHD and
children diagnosed with ADHD with comorbid anxiety or depression
N43 What are the patterns of verbal and visual learning and memory, as well as cognitive predictors of
functional abilities in MCI, for 71 individuals with consensus-diagnosed MCI enrolled in the
Measuring Independent Living in the Elderly Study (MILES) as compared to controls?
N48 Whether everyday functioning differs between between 33 PD patients and 26 demographically
comparable adults
N54 Whether healthy patients demonstrate an “inverted-U’ response to the self-ordered WM task that
is absent in patients with schizophrenia.

Whether verbal memory will be more severely impacted than nonverbal memory in a bilingual
pediatric TBI population as compared to a monolingual pediatric TBI population
N11 (1) Whether participants with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (MOD/S TBI) would
quantitatively and qualitatively differ from participants with no brain damage (NBD) in phonemic
and semantic verbal fluency; (2) Whether the potential differences may be attributed to working
memory (WM) and information processing speed

healthy males and males with traumatic brain injury

Individual differences (1)
N33 Whether associative inference is possible with and without awareness

Table 31. Neuroscience: Queries of conditionality about Y and memory
Queries of (12) conditionality ask whether and to what extent the differences between
two groups according to the dependent variable, memory, can be attributed to the
independent variables of interest. Known as ex post facto or causal comparative research,
it differs from research posing queries of (11) correlation in that two or more groups are
being compared rather than two or more variables within one group. Since it lacks
random assignment, substituting groups with pre-existing differences in cases when

159
random assignment is unethical or otherwise not possible, research posing queries of (12)
conditionality do not achieve true causality as do queries of (13) biconditionality,
described below. Dissertations posing queries of (12) conditionality seek to establish that
differences in memory activity or performance are likely caused by diseases and
disorders such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (N43), Parkinson’s Disease (N48), or
schizophrenia (N54); traumatic brain injury (N2; N11; N18); age (N14; N26); or
individual differences (N33). The question content of these query-subject category
communicate an expectation that the answers demonstrate that impaired memory can be
conditionally attributed to the diseases or disorders, age, or individual differences that
differentiate the experimental groups.
Nine questions pose queries of (13) biconditionality about Z and memory, where
Z is subcategorized as cognitive interventions, drugs, stress, and mode of presentation
(Table 32).
Cognitive interventions (4)
N1
Whether the experimental group receiving a 12-week neuroscience-based, cognitive-skills
computer-training program differs from the control group on the cognitive processing of 40
elementary students in grades 2-4 with specific learning disabilities (SLD).
N20 What are the practical utility and mnemonic mechanisms of self-imagination, a novel cognitive
strategy designed to capitalize on self-referential processing?
N27 How do emotion regulation goals modulate autobiographical recall at both a behavioral and neural
level?
N42 Whether reward and punishment motivation influences human declarative memory encoding and
its underlying neural circuitry.
Drugs (3)
N4
Whether amphetamines affect emotional memory
N7
Whether prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) leads to impairments in dentate gyrus-dependent
learning and memory, which is associated with NMDA receptor-dependent LTP deficits and
NMDA receptor subunit composition alterations in the dentate gyrus
N13 Whether chronic treatment with the serotonin 2A antagonist SR 46349B enhances retention and
efficiency of rule-guided behavior in mice
Stress (1)
N12 What is the effect of psychosocial stress on memory updating?

160
Mode of presentation (1)
N57 Whether there is a difference in the quantity of episodic memory that is stored when the
presentation of linguistic materials is visual (read by the individual) versus auditory (heard by the
individual)?

Table 32. Neuroscience: Queries of biconditionality about Z and memory
The dissertations in this subset are identifiable by the research design implied in their
questions. These questions seek to establish a causal relationship between certain
phenomena and the dependent variable of enhanced or improved memory. To establish
causality, two or more populations are studied in terms of the dependent-independent
variable relationship. While the question may not specify the presence of a control group,
queries of (13) biconditionality randomly assign participants to experimental and control
groups rather than comparing groups with existing differences. The basic question being
asked is, do the experimental and control populations demonstrate a statistically
significant difference in the effect of the cognitive intervention, drugs, or mode of
presentation on the dependent variable of memory performance or neural activity?
Overall, the (13) biconditionality – Z and memory questions produce knowledge about
phenomena that can enhance or impair memory. Four dissertations ask about the
enhancing effect of cognitive interventions: the effect of a cognitive neuroscience-based
computer training on cognitive processing (N1); of self-imagining on cued recall (N20);
of emotion regulation goals on autobiographical recall (N27); and of reward and
punishment motivation on declarative memory encoding (N42). Three dissertations ask
about the enhancing or impairing effects of drugs: the effect of amphetamines on humans’
emotional memories (N4), of 5HT2A receptor up-regulation on cognitive processes of
learning and memory in mice (N13), and of psychostimulants on the memory processes
of mice (N51). One query asks about the impairing effect of stress on memory updating
and consolidation (N12). Another asks about the difference in quantity according to the

161
mode of presentation (N57). By posing queries of (13) biconditionality, these questions
demand that the answer express that if memory is improved or enhanced, it is due to the
intervention; if the intervention is administered, then memory will be enhanced or
improved. If so, it can be said that the independent variable differentiating the
experimental and control groups has a causal effect on the dependent variable.
One dissertation poses a (13) biconditionality – memory and A question, more
specifically, about the causal relationship between memory-based strategies for physical
rehabilitation and increased physical mobility of Alzheimer’s disease patients (Table 33).
N55

Whether implicit memory and learning strategies, including high-repetition practice, errorless
learning (EL), and spaced retrieval (SR) improve objective measures of balance, performance on
the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and self-selected gait speed (ssGS).

Table 33. Query of biconditionality about memory and A
This query of (13) biconditionality differs from the others in its interest in memory as the
independent variable rather than the dependent: the causal effect of memory on another
phenomenon rather than of another phenomenon on memory.
Questions posing queries of (12) conditionality or (13) biconditionality ask
whether or not relationships between memory and other phenomena can be confirmed. In
Derr’s (1984) conception of question structure as query and subject, the subject is the
known thing in the world about which an epistemic determination is being made; the
query is the unknown type of epistemic determination. In these terms, the third-order
query-subject pairings indicate that enough is known to suggest a relationship between Y
and memory (subject); what is unknown is whether or whether a relationship of (12)
conditionality (query) can be shown. Likewise, enough is known to suggest that the Z
and memory (subject) are related, but what is unknown is whether the relationship is
causal, one of (13) biconditionality (query).

162
6.3.2 Discussion. What do the query-subject pairings tell us about question
content related to “memory” in the domain of neuroscience? Neuroscientific questions
about memory divide into two groups based on Dillon’s (1984) classification scheme of
research questions (Table 25): those employing queries of the first order, producing
knowledge in their answers about the neural properties of memory, and those employing
queries of the third order, producing knowledge of memory’s relations to other
phenomena. By considering the query-subject pairings as a whole, a picture begins to
emerge of two different areas of neuroscientific research on memory, as manifested in the
types of epistemic determinations indicated by the query type, and the memory-related
objects or phenomena in the world about which the determinations are being made, the
subjects. Together, the query-subject categories describe the different indeterminate
situations about “memory” that are found in the neuroscience sample.
The first order query-subject pairings address three of the four issues that Byrne
(1997) identifies as central to research on learning and memory. First, what are the
different types of memory? Second, where in the brain is memory located? The (3)
substance/definition – neural correlates of memory questions seek to differentiate the
different types of memory by interpreting the patterns of neural activity throughout the
various anatomical structures of the brain that correspond to the performance of memory
tasks. The (4) character/description – role of X in memory and – neural mechanisms of
memory questions produce fundamental knowledge of the way in which individual
structures work together to produce memory and of memory’s processes – how it is
perceived, encoded, consolidated, maintained, distorted, retrieved, and extinguished.
Finally, (6) rationale/explication – memory models and instruments questions mark

163
neuroscientific inquiry as highly dependent on continually developing technology for
“seeing,” measuring, and representing memory. They represent the reflexive dimension
of domain inquiry into memory, asking, are our models and instruments accurately
measuring and representing memory? As a group, the first order questions seek to
establish epistemic certainty about memory as a neuroscientific phenomenon and the
manner of its study.
Third order questions produce knowledge of the contingent attributes of memory,
more specifically, about the relations of (12) conditionality or (13) biconditionality
between some phenomena and memory. These questions address the fourth central
question of memory and learning: how can memory be maintained and improved, and
how can it be fixed when it is broken (Byrne, 1997)? Queries of (12) conditionality ask
whether diseases and disorders, traumatic brain injury, age, and individual differences
are the likely cause of differences between groups’ neural activity and memory
performance. Queries of (13) biconditionality produce knowledge of the causal effect of
cognitive interventions, drugs, mode of presentation, and stress on memory performance
and the neural activities of memory.
Only one question is posed in the form of a query of (13) biconditionality about
memory and A, asking whether strategies using the implicit memory system can be
applied to the physical rehabilitation of Alzheimer’s patients (N55). The current sample
suggests that this single instance of a query-subject pairing where memory is the
independent variable is not central to the domain approach to memory. At the domain
level, it may represent an emerging or waning area of research, being at the forefront or
the tail end of domain knowledge production relative to the query type. Alternately, an

164
infrequent query-subject pairing may represent a unique stance between domains, as in
inter- or multi-disciplinary research. Or it may be a question that is miscategorized as
belonging primarily to the neuroscientific domain, perhaps more accurately belonging to
the domain of physical therapy, or Alzheimer’s research. Finally, it may also indicate an
ill-formulated question that simply fails to adhere to domain standards rather than
representing a new area of domain interest. Here we are making a distinction between
questions that are formulated in reference to one or more existing domains, that attempt
to extend, expand, refine, or combine existing domain approaches, as compared to those
that are merely ill-formulated in reference to the target domain audience. The current
question analysis does not attempt to determine which of these applies to the single
instance of this query-subject pairing, but proposes that the identification of the querysubject pairings is the first step in being able to make those judgments.
6.3.3 Summary. The analysis shows that the content of neuroscientific questions
about memory can be divided into two basic groups of query-subject pairings: (1) those
of the first order, posing queries of (3) substance/definition, (4) character/description,
and (6) rationale/explication about the properties of memory; and (2) those of the third
order, posing queries of (12) conditionality and (13) biconditionality about the contingent
relations between memory and other phenomena. The two broad groupings characterize
the known unknown, or the indeterminate epistemic situations, of neuroscientific
knowledge of memory, and convey expectations for the answer to resolve the
indeterminacies. Neuroscientific inquiry into memory is an endeavor that is
simultaneously producing basic knowledge of memory as it occurs in the biological
substrate of the brain and knowledge of the ways in which it is affected – impaired,

165
enhanced, or simply changed – by phenomena such as age, diseases and disorders,
traumatic brain injury, cognitive interventions, and others. These two approaches to
producing neuroscientific knowledge of memory are reflected in the content of the
questions and answers in neuroscientific dissertation abstracts about memory.

6.4 Literature
What types of indeterminate situations regarding memory are addressed by the
dissertations in the literature domain? The question formulations identified in twenty

order in the classification scheme that produces knowledge of the properties of memory,
in this instance, of why or how literary memory has certain attributes. Of the seventeen
questions, ten pose queries of (6) rationale/explication about the literary uses of memory
questions, such as to challenge historical memory, to negotiate trauma, or for general use
(Table 35).

L15 How does a woman writer memorialize her own traumatic history, when it happens to be part of a
larger History dominated by male narratives (as far as Holocaust and slavery go), or when it is
altogether silenced (as is the case for madness and institutionalization)?

Table 35. Literature: Queries of rationale/explication about the literary uses of
memory
The three dissertations posing general questions ask about how memory is used
by literary texts: how cultural memory functions as a “security blanket,” providing safe
anchor for readers of a bestselling author’s detective novels even as they participate in a
“(post)modern shift of horizons” (L6), or how European and postcolonial migrant
literature uses the memory of the Holocaust to “reveal the insufficiency of liberal
strategies for the management of difference, and signal the danger of current versions of
racialist thought” (L18). In these questions, memory is wielded by literary texts in order
to accomplish some desired effect or result, such as when the act of remembering
“critically disrupts” the “strategic forgetting…and simultaneous repurposing” (L18) of
memories of traumas such as the Holocaust and Fascism. These queries of (6)
rationale/explication communicate an expectation that the answers provide explanations

167
of why or how the literary uses of memory accomplish the desired effect or result
towards which memory is applied.
The four questions about literary uses of memory to challenge historical memory
resist the notion that history is a factual and neutral representation of past events,
exploring the ways in which memory is intertwined with identity, agency, and issues of
truth and power. The research produced by these questions challenges the official record
of historical events, with varying degrees of creative energy. Literary texts may “uphold
or challenge official memory and history” (L20), challenge the dominance of certain
discursive views of history over others (L2), retrieve lost or forgotten stories (L10), or
even create “an alternate and competing memory” to “the dogmatic truths on the public
memory of the war” (L5). Queries of (6) rationale/explication convey the criteria that
answers explain why or how literary challenges to historical memory have the attributes
of that they do: to contest dogmatic truths, retrieve forgotten ones, and even create new
truths, through the subversive use of traditional genres such as idioms (L2) and crónicas
(L20), or the production of counter-narratives to the dominant discourse (L5; L10).
Three dissertations ask about the literary uses of memory to negotiate trauma.
These questions ask how “the fragmentation that characterizes the traumatic aftermath”
(L1) and the domination and silencing of women’s traumatic histories by male narratives
(L15) are negotiated and resisted by literary texts. Whether manifesting as traumainduced amnesia, the repression of traumatic memories, or cultural or generational
silence about collective trauma, the relationship between trauma and memory is fraught
with choices of whether and how to remember one’s trauma, as we are reminded that
“the issue of forgetting as an eternal return to remembering” (L3). There is potential for

168
continuing harm, re-victimization, and passing on of effects of trauma to the next
generation, but also for reclaiming agency, as when women writers “renegotiate socially,
construct cultural identities, conceptualize, reposition or discover their silent selves” (L3),
or when memory is placed in an intersubjective context, “which goes beyond the simple
individual plight to comprehend the need to be an ethically responsible agent of
remembrance in the present” (L1). By posing queries of (6) rationale/explication, these
questions solicit answers that explain how and why authors negotiate the traumatic
aftermath as they do.
Six dissertations formulate questions that pose queries of (6) rationale/explication
about the literary construction of memory (Table 36).

Question
What is the relationship between the violence of the events of the "liberation struggle" in
Zimbabwe and South Africa and the memory of them in selected exemplary fiction and film texts?
What/where is the nexus of aesthetic theory, historical memory, and emergent "community" that is
inherently heterogeneous and does not revolve around an exemplary subject?
How are memory and history embedded in images of the built environment? How, in turn, does
this spatialization of the past contribute to a criticism of traditional linear narration?
How does intergenerational, trans-temporal trauma become re-narrativized and re-envisioned over
time in four symbolic sites of slavery (five countries) – Africa (Ghana and Mozambique), the
Caribbean (Cuba), Brazil, and the United States) – with the goal of exposing differences and
emphasizing ruptures?
What are the technics of temporal memory in twentieth-century modernist and post-modernist
literature and film?
What are the different strategies - both rhetorical and political - "Franco's children" used at three
key historical moments: 1) the transition to democracy in the early 1980s; 2) the mid and later
1990s; and 3) the period following the Law of Historical Memory [October 31, 2007] by "Franco's
children" in El Sur, El florido pensil, Habiamos ganado la guerra, and La gloria de los ninos?

Table 36. Literature: Queries of rationale/explication about the literary construction
of memory
The questions posed by these dissertations ask how the literary portrayal of memories,
through dissident narratives (L4), decentering of the exemplary subject (L8), images of
the built environment (L11), intertextuality (L12), and rhetorical strategies (L19), serve
as the lens through which meaning is ascribed to the content of the memories, whether
personal or cultural. These questions are at the core of the literary inquiry into memory –

169
not as a representation of past experiences, but as creative act of construction, often
reshaping, redefining, or renegotiating memory as an explicit act of resistance, or as a
byproduct of the creative act. The queries of (6) rationale/explication seek answers about
why or how memory is constructed as it is in literary texts, demonstrating that the way in
which memory is written about is itself revealing of both the nature of memory and the
nature of writing.
One question formulation poses a query of (6) rationale/explication about the
cultural memory of a literary figure, seeking to understand what happens to the cultural
memory of a French writer and theologian between the nineteenth century and the first
decades of the twentieth century, during which he goes from being one of the most
esteemed writers in French history to a largely disregarded figure, as judged by critical
interest in his works (Table 37).
L9

How do references to the name of Fénelon in nineteenth-century literature through to the writings
of Proust reflect and affect the changing French imagination of him whose posterity became a
standard for the remembrance of grands hommes and pantheonization in the nineteenth century?

Table 37. Literature: Queries of rationale/explication about the cultural memory of
a literary figure
Underlying this investigation is a pursuit to understand what kind of a process is memory,
as the changing status of Fénelon in the cultural memory cannot be explained by an
understanding of memory as reconstructive in nature. The query of (6)
rationale/explication calls for an answer that explains how the situation of Fénelon
suggests that memory is referential in nature, as explained by the fact that
Fénelon's name appears hundreds of times in the literature of the long nineteenth
century, and the context surrounding his name offers a view of the posterity of
Fénelon which contradicts what is available through an investigation of

170
biographies and academic studies of his theological and literary work alone.”
(L9)
The premise that the cultural memory of Fénelon is reflected in references to Fénelon's
name in the broader literature and not only in direct biographical or critical treatments of
his body of work serves as evidence that the nature of cultural memory is referential, not
only reconstructive.
The literature sample shows that the domain asks mostly how- questions, and
sometimes what- questions, about memory. The how- questions ask how literary texts or
authors of literary texts accomplish certain things related to memory through literary
technical means, such as when one dissertation asks, “How do writers use highly
imaginative crónicas as a means to uphold or challenge official memory?” (L20). The
what- questions solicit definition or description of the literary devices utilized, as when
asking, “What are the different strategies - both rhetorical and political – ‘Franco's
children’ used at three key historical moments” (L19) in select literary texts? What is
known is that the interest is in the literary uses of memory, literary construction of
memory, and cultural memory of a literary figure (subject); what is unknown is its (6)
rationale/explication (query). It is known that literary texts construct memory and
negotiate trauma, but the unknown is how and why it does so.
Distinct from the rest of the query-subject pairings, three dissertations pose extraorder queries of (15) acquaintance. Rather than soliciting an answer, queries of
acquaintance are an invitation to know through direct experience. The questions
characterized by this query-subject pairing are posed by works of creative fiction, in the

171
form of two novels and a short story collection. These dissertations ask about the nature
of memory (Table 38).
L7
L16
L17

What is the nature of memory (individual vs. collective)? How do we as humans and creative
artist continue to grapple with, and attempt to reorder, our memories?
What is the nature of memory (individual vs. collective)? How does patriarchal culture ignore and
ultimate punish women’s anger and desire?
What is the importance of myth, memory, tradition, and place within a Southern context?

Table 38. Literature: Queries of acquaintance about the nature of memory
The two novels invite readers into the direct experience of the nature of memory, whether
collective or individual, through immersion into the protagonists’ perspectives: that of a
32-year old protagonist on a quest to reignite the romantic relationship he shared with his
fourth-grade teacher (L7) or of a amnestic woman struggling to regain her identity and
sense of belonging after a violent attack (L16). The third, a collection of short stories,
invites the reader to become acquainted with the nature of memory in the Southern
context, in which “place” is more than just the geographical setting of the stories, but is
some intangible combination of the natural and man-made landscapes, objects, people
and relationships, the passing of time and events, even encompassing myths and folktales.
Characters’ memories, their recollections and retellings of these various manifestations of
place, form the foundation from which their identities as rural Southerners spring.
Queries of (15) acquaintance occupy the extra order in the classification scheme,
indicating that the knowledge produced in reply to these types of queries is outside of the
sequential and incremental scheme of propositional knowledge produced by queries of
the first three orders. These questions communicate the expectation that the answers are
composed of direct experience the nature of memory through our own senses, of
becoming acquainted directly with memory, rather than simply knowing about it.

172
Queries of (15) acquaintance display the logic of what- questions about the
subject. The what- questions seek to produce first-order knowledge of the properties of
memory, specifically, of the nature of memory: its essence, its innate and inherent
properties. In L7, the question of “what is the nature of memory?” is followed by a howquestion that directs the inquiry towards a consideration of the malleable nature of
memory: “How do we as humans and creative artists continue to grapple with, and
attempt to reorder, our memories?” L16 also asks “what is the nature of memory?” with
the subsequent question directing inquiry towards a consideration of the nature of
women’s memories as collective, as a product of patriarchal cultural forces of oppression.
In terms of the question’s indication of the known unknown, what is known in themedriven literary inquiries is the focus of inquiry: the nature of memory (subject). What is
unknown is (15) acquaintance (query) with the subject, or the direct experience of it.
The three creative writing dissertations take the form of literary works of fiction that pose
a broad question about the nature of memory and invite the reader to formulate an answer
through direct acquaintance with memory in the texts.
6.4.2 Discussion. What does the overall pattern of query-subject pairings tell us
about the nature of question content related to “memory” in the domain of literature?
The literary inquiries into memory in our sample can be divided into two types of
question content according to query type: queries of (6) rationale/explication and queries
of (15) acquaintance. First-order queries of (6) rationale/explication ask about literary
uses of memory, literary construction of memory, and the cultural memory of a literary
figure in selected literary texts. In comparison to neuroscientific first-order questions that
seek to identify, define, and characterize the neurobiological substance and character of

173
“memory,” literature is interested in its function, in applying it to accomplish some
actions, and how literary texts utilize memory to enact those functions. By challenging
the official historical discourse, literary memory questions the past, recreates the present,
and opens up the potential for the future. It negotiates the aftermath of personal or
collective trauma, finding ways to make sense of fragmented reality, to transform the
traumatic experience by becoming witnesses against future atrocities. The queries of (6)
rationale/explication produce knowledge of why and how the literary phenomenon of
memory is constructed as it is, whether through the use of genre, narrative and structural
experimentation, rhetorical strategies, or aesthetic perspectives. Overall, the seventeen
queries of (6) rationale/explication present the critical dimension of literary inquiry into
memory, the analysis and interpretation of literary texts for their use of memory.
A small but significant set of creative writing dissertations pose extra-order
queries of (15) acquaintance about the nature of memory, dividing the domain into
distinct sub-domains of content. These dissertations invite direct experience, in this case,
unmediated engagement with literary works of fiction as contrasted to the mediated
engagement with texts encountered in literary theory and criticism. They form an
important subset of queries distinct from all the others in the three domains, as they
uniquely frame the production of knowledge. The distinction, as articulated by Bertrand
Russell (1910) is between knowledge that is indirect, mediated, and inferential
(“knowledge by description”), as is produced by queries ranging from (1)
existence/affirmation-negation to (13) biconditionality in Dillon’s (1984) scheme, and
knowledge that is direct, unmediated, and non-inferential (“knowledge by acquaintance”).
To know something by acquaintance, says Russell (1914), is to have a direct cognitive

174
relation to the object or phenomenon, to be directly aware of the phenomenon itself. The
ontological commitment of queries of (15) acquaintance is to this subject-object
relationship (Russell, 1914), or in memory-related terms, the relationship between agents
and memory itself, rather than theories of or arguments about memory. Russell describes
acquaintance as the converse of the relation of subject and object that constitutes
presentation: an object is “presented” to a subject, and the subject becomes “acquainted”
with the object.
The questions posed by the creative writing dissertations present memory to the
reader, and the reader becomes directly acquainted with memory by reading the texts.
Russell (1914) would classify both as types of propositional knowledge, but would
distinguish knowledge-by-description as declarative knowledge of propositional truth,
while knowledge-by-acquaintance is unmediated awareness of the propositional truth
through firsthand sense data. This is the type of knowledge that is conveyed by works of
art; they present the object or phenomenon (“memory”) to the reader, bringing the object
itself before the mind and inviting them to “know” though acquaintance, directly through
the senses, not inferentially through propositions.
6.4.3 Summary. The content of literary questions about memory can be divided
into two categories of indeterminate situations: queries of (6) rationale/explication about
the literary uses of memory, literary construction of memory, and cultural memory of a
literary figure; and queries of (15) acquaintance about the nature of memory. Queries of
(6) rationale/explication convey the expectation that the answer explain how the literary
texts disrupt forgetting, retrieve forgotten stories, renegotiate reality, resist or subvert
dominant discourses, create alternate histories, and expand the borders of the imaginary.

175
In contrast, queries of acquaintance, as utilized by the three creative writing dissertations,
invites direct experience, rather than literary analysis, of the nature of memory as it is
expressed in works of creative fiction. The two query-subject groupings present the
boundary of literary knowledge in terms of these two basic indeterminate situations: how
or why literary texts apply memory to accomplish some desired actions (queries of
rationale/explication) and direct knowledge of the nature of memory (queries of
acquaintance).

6.5 Computer engineering
What are the subjects and queries that characterize question content related to
“memory” in the domain of computer engineering? Nineteen dissertations in this sample
formulate questions by posing queries of (6) rationale/explication about memory
optimization. One dissertation, mistakenly labeled as belonging to the computer
engineering domain, poses a query of (11) correlation about memory and B (Table 39).

nineteen computer engineering dissertations can be subdivided according to whether the
problem of memory optimization is approached at the level of entire memory systems,
individual memory technologies, memory models, or memory circuits.

different nanoelectronic and hybrid CMOS/Nano circuits?
What hybrid DRAM-PCM memory systems for servers provide robust and consistent memory
performance without sacrificing energy?
What are the key bottlenecks to efficiency in the memory system?

Table 40. Computer engineering: Queries of rationale/explication about memory
optimization – memory systems
These questions ask how memory systems are designed or should be designed in order to
overcome “key bottlenecks to efficiency” (CE18) or to provide “the optimal use of the
resources involved” (CE4). The responses are of several types: analysis of every major
element of the main memory system and proposal of a novel system with innovative
features to overcome the bottlenecks to efficiency (CE18); the proposal of hybrid main
memory systems, which combine two different main memory technologies whose
advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed, capacity, volatility, ease of use, cost of
production, and power consumption complement each other, allowing for the computer to
call upon one or the other, depending on the nature of the need (CE12; CE15); or
modeling of a system in which intermediate logic is placed between the CPU and the
main memory (CE4). The dissertations in this subset solicit answers that explain how the
analysis of memory solutions or proposals for new memory systems contribute to the
optimization of memory and thus, overall performance of computer systems.
At the level of memory technologies, ten questions address memory optimization
in relation to the known limitations of specific technologies in the memory hierarchy

Table 41. Computer engineering: Queries of rationale/explication about memory
optimization – memory technologies
As computing contexts and use cases continue to put more and more demands on
computing systems, the limitations of existing memory technologies become obstacles to
faster processing. This subset of memory optimization questions, about memory
technologies, addresses the limitations of existing memory technologies or the integration
of new technologies, by: identifying the limitations of DRAM memory (CE11); seeking
solutions for already-known obstacles of existing or emerging memory technologies such
as the high power consumption of DRAM (CE16) and SRAM (CE9; CE10), the
inefficiency of write operations for Phase Change Memory and other non-volatile
memory technologies (CE3; CE20); the need for higher performing, low-power on-chip
memory (CE2; CE17; CE19), or the slow random write performance of NAND steady
state devices (CE1). This category of question content conveys the expectation that the
answers explain why and how the proposed solutions overcome the known problems of
these memory technologies.
Four questions are formulated in relation to memory models (Table 42).

What algorithm can effectively enforce stricter memory models in parallel processors, such as the
sequentially consistent memory model?
What dynamic optimization techniques, driven by models of shared data and cache use, can be
developed for disparate layers of the memory hierarchy?
What model of cache memory can be developed that eliminates context switch misses?
What is an efficient alternative model to existing coherence mechanisms that still maintains
shared memory?

Table 42. Computer engineering: Queries of rationale/explication about memory
optimization – memory models
These questions take a model-driven approach to optimizing memory, which has become
a major obstacle to performance because of the increasing demands that parallel
processing, the simultaneous execution of a problem by multiple processors, puts on the
memory system. Memory consistency models are the interface between the programmer
and the shared-memory system, determining the order in which memory operations will
appear to execute. The memory model “affects programmability because programmers
must use it to reason about the correctness of their programs,” as well as “the
performance of the system because it determines the types of optimizations that may be
exploited by the hardware and the system software” (Western Research Laboratory,
1995). The questions seek model-driven optimizations of the memory hierarchy as a
whole (CE5; CE6; CE8) or for a single level of the hierarchy such as cache memory
(CE7). By posing queries of (6) rationale/explication, the questions communicate an
expectation that the answers explain how the proposed models or model-driven
optimization techniques address the limitations of current memory models.
One question seeks to optimize a hardware element, memory circuits (Table 43).

How should logic circuits and their signal representations be configured in order to allow low

to offset the disadvantages of the current technology (CE14). This is the only dissertation
that takes a hardware approach to the problem of memory optimization.
One dissertation poses a (11) correlation – memory and B question, where B is
locomotion in a virtual reality system (Table 44).
CE13

Whether the atomic locomotion movements in a virtual reality system with a semi-natural
locomotion interface require a user's spatial cognitive resources (working memory).

Table 44. Not computer engineering: Queries of correlation about memory and B
In CE13, working memory is used as a measure of the cognitive resource requirements of
certain types of movements typically engaged by users of virtual reality systems and
correlated to manipulations of the user interface and field-of-view. This query-subject
pairing requires the answer to show that the user’s working memory increases and
decreases in conjunction with atomic locomotion movements in the virtual reality system.
6.5.2 Discussion. The query-subject analysis of computer engineering question
content is decisively uniform: (6) rationale/explication queries are posed about different
approaches to memory optimization. The questions in computer engineering dissertations
present as what- or how- questions. They ask, what is the solution or what approach can
be taken towards arriving at a solution to the problem of memory optimization, or stated
differently, how should the problem solved? The what- and how- questions of computer
engineering research on memory are all variations on a theme: how can computer
memory be optimized? Specifically, they ask how memory can be optimized according
to whatever definition of optimization is set forth in the framing of the problem statement,
such as when asking, “How should hybrid DRAM-PCM memory systems be designed
that provide robust and consistent memory performance without sacrificing energy?”
(CE15). How- questions can seek understanding of current memory systems, as when
asking “How do parallel applications interact with hardware?” (CE6), but mostly they ask

180
how something can or should be done. What- questions are of a two types: those that ask
what the problem is (CE11; CE18) and those that ask what approach should be taken to
solve the problem (CE1; CE12; CE16) or, more directly, what the solution is (CE8;
CE10). This query-subject pairing indicates that the known memory-related subject of
inquiry in computer engineering is memory optimization (subject); what is unknown is
the (6) rationale/explication (query) for the proposed optimizing solution.
Only one dissertation in the sample utilizes a different query-subject pairing: a
query of (11) correlation about memory and B. Similar to the single instance querysubject pairings in neuroscience and literature, this could indicate an area of emerging or
waning domain interest, a steady-but-minor area of interest, or a poorly formulated
question, in relation to domain standards. The uniqueness of this query warrants special
attention as to whether it belongs in the computer engineering domain, which otherwise is
so homogenous in its question content. Though drawn into the sample because of its
classification under the subject of “computer engineering” in the ProQuest Dissertations
and Theses database, an interview with the author reveals that this is due to a technicality,
in which doctoral students in his doctoral interdisciplinary program receive their degree
from their dissertation chair’s department. In his case, his degree was issued from the
computer engineering department, but he situates his research in the virtual reality
community rather than in computer engineering. The question content analysis identifies
this case as an outlier relative to the rest of the sample, which, with additional
information, is determined to be outside of the computer engineering domain. This
example again indicates that the query-subject analysis is able to identify those
knowledge products that are outside of the domain norms or cross domain boundaries,

181
though further analysis or reference to the researchers or to subject experts is needed to
determine the reason for its abnormal question content formulation. In this case, further
investigation indicates that this particular dissertation indicates a situation in which the
supporting domain structures, in this case, the institutional rule that doctoral students in
an interdisciplinary program are affiliated with their advisor’s academic department, lag
behind the more fluid nature of research center- and lab-based research.
6.5.3 Summary. The analysis of the computer engineering question content
demonstrates that the indeterminate situation regarding memory in the domain are
variations of a singular indeterminacy. While the types of systems and use cases are
many, this single question describes the single indeterminate epistemic situation that
computer engineering has about memory, in which the goal of memory optimization is
known (subject), but the (6) rationale/explication for the proposed solutions are unknown
(query). Computer engineering questions poses queries of (6) rationale/explication about
memory optimization at the level of memory systems, memory technologies, memory
models, and memory circuits, with each level representing a different approach to
determining how it can be optimized to improve system performance.

Table 45. “Memory”-related question content in three domains
The distinct patterns of query-subject pairings show the three domains to be clearly
differentiated by their question content profiles, which are a representation of the
indeterminate epistemic situations relative to “memory,” or the known unknowns, that
motivate inquiry in each domain. Both neuroscience and literature are divided into two
distinct orders of questions about “memory.” Neuroscience asks about the first order
properties of memory and the third order contingent relations between memory and
various phenomena of impairment and enhancement. The questions in the first order
produce knowledge of the neurobiological properties of memory, while the third order
questions produce knowledge about its contingent relations to phenomena of

183
enhancement, like cognitive interventions, and phenomena of impairment, such as
diseases and disorders. Literature poses first order questions of how literary works use
and construct memory, while extra order questions inviting acquaintance with memory.
First-order queries produce knowledge of the properties of literary memory by asking,
why or how does literary memory have the attributes that it does? Extra-order queries
invite direct experience of memory through direct engagement with works of literature.
There is a significant division, in the sequential classification scheme, between
first-order questions and third-order or extra-order questions, prompting the question of
whether these distinct orders of questions in literature and neuroscience should be
considered as separate domains, or sub-domains, or fields, or paradigmatic approaches, or
by some other label. On this matter, the question content analysis takes no position; the
query-subject profiles emerging from question content analysis are not meant to draw
hard-and-fast domain boundaries. The purpose of the analysis is to group like research
with like, thus providing a conceptualization of the different kinds of question content in
the sample. It is up to the discrimination of subject experts to then determine where
domain boundaries lie with regards to the question content areas, if determine of
boundaries is indeed the goal. To take the literature sample as an example, do the critical
and creative bodies of research constitute different content areas in a single domain, or
two separate-but-related domains? This is a matter for domain members to decide, most
likely with referral to more explicitly social dimensions of the knowledge production,
such as the informal and formal practices of scholarly communication, the structures of
the domain’s institutions, and other factors. Domain boundaries are naturally in flux over
time, but also are drawn differently at any given moment in time, depending on the

184
perspective from and function for which the boundaries are being drawn. The analysis
does not provide a final, static representation of a knowledge domain, but provides a
snapshot profile of question content that can serve as a starting point for the identification
of domain boundaries from a particular perspective.
In contrast to the neuroscience and literature research, computer engineering
research is unified in its question content matter, posing only (6) rationale/explication –
memory optimization questions. The single query-subject pairing indicates that computer
engineering research about memory is tightly focused, with all questions being variations
on a single underlying question: how can computer memory be optimized to improve
system performance? In computer engineering research on memory, memory
optimization is the clear goal, but the approaches to optimization memory are multiple:
through an overhaul of the memory system, optimization of the individual memory
technologies at all levels of the memory hierarchy, analysis and development of memory
models for the whole hierarchy, and development of new hardware component such as
memory circuits.
Overall, the distinct patterns of query-subject pairings in each domain support the
premise that domains can be differentiated by the content of their questions. Each
domain has a distinct pattern of query-subject pairings, which are a representation of the
domain’s indeterminate epistemic situations relative to memory according to the known
unknowns that constitute the content of domains’ questions. Of all the query types in
Dillon’s (1984) classification, only queries of (6) rationale/explication are utilized across
all three domains. In neuroscience, queries of (6) rationale/explication are posed about
memory models or instruments, producing knowledge of why and how the proposed

185
models and instruments serve the research-related purposes for which they have been
developed. Similarly, computer engineering queries about memory optimization utilize
queries of (6) rationale/explication to explain why or how the optimizations that that
have developed overcome the identified obstacles to efficient memory performance.
Literary questions utilize the same query type, but to explain why and how literary texts
construct and use memory as they do.
One issue for future research raised by the question content analysis in these three
domains is whether query type is wedded to domains regardless of the topic of study. If
the sample were drawn in regards to the topic of “language,” for instance, would the
same query types appear? We can imagine that literature would employ the same queries
as it does for “memory,” queries of (6) rationale/explication that ask why and how
literary texts demonstrate the properties of language, and queries of (15) acquaintance
that invite direct experience of language through sensory perception of literary texts. In
computer engineering, we can imagine that queries of (6) rationale/explication would ask
about why and how certain programming languages should be used over others. One
could imagine the identified neuroscience query types as applying to the study of
language as they do to memory. With three such contrasting domains, the query types
seem that they might hold, regardless of subject. On the other hand, comparison of more
similar domains or sub-domains within any single domain, effectively “zooming in” on
the topic of research, may shift the query-subject pairings as finer distinctions are made.
The definition of domains’ query types may depend largely on the scale of the initial
domain definition or selection of domains for comparison. This conjecture requires
empirical verification.

186
It is important to emphasize that the analysis of domains by question content does
not make any judgments on the quality of the included research, but merely indicates how
typical the question content is in the given sample. If a query-subject pairing is used by a
high number of dissertations, it is safe to say that the question content area represented by
the pairing is of central interest to the domain. However, if a query-subject pairing is less
frequently used, there are several possible explanations in terms of domain interest, as
briefly discussed previously. The pairing may represent a question content area of
waning interest or, conversely, an emerging area of interest. A variant of this explanation
is that the emerging content area is in between domains, either interdisciplinary or
multidisciplinary in nature. Query-subject pairings representing a small percentage of the
total may also represent a small-but-constant area of interest. The neuroscience content
area represented by (6) rationale/explication – memory models and instruments questions
may be an example of this, a minor but important and continuous area of research in a
scientific field in which the tools of measurement and models of experimentation are
diverse and rapidly developing and thus subject to questions of validity. Alternately it is
also possible, particularly for those query-subject pairings with only a single instance,
that its inclusion in the domain sample is actually erroneous, as in the computer
engineering sample’s single instance of a (11) correlation – memory and B question. In
both of these instances, historical domain question analysis would help in the definitive
identification of outliers and the increasing and decreasing interest in different areas of
question content.
The comparison of dissertation research about “memory” in neuroscience,
literature, and computer engineering over a five-year period results in a broad

187
comparative picture of each domain’s approach that cannot be definitively proposed as
representative of the nature of knowledge production in each domain generally, or even
as it relates to “memory” as a topic over time. What can be said, however, is that
question content analysis, operationalized as the classification of types of queries about
certain subjects, produces a characterization of the domain that corresponds to the
representative status of the sample. Within the sample, the question content analysis can
also distinguish central question content areas from minor areas. Choosing a sampling
frame and size that will most accurately represent the domain of interest, then, is essential
to a useful question content analysis. As the perspective on the topic is always relative to
the frame, the characterizations will shift according to whether the frame is a single
domain or multiple domains, and which multiple domains. This shifting does not detract
from the validity of the methodology; rather, it reflects the meta-ontological perspective
of LIS as concerned with the ways in which social epistemological knowledge domains
structure the universe of knowledge.

6.7 Summary of findings and conclusion
The categorization of question content in this chapter responds to research
questions 2a, 2b, and 4a: what is the content of neuroscience, literature, and computer
engineering dissertations’ questions on the topic of “memory,” how do they compare, and
what information do the comparisons convey about what to answer? The comparative
analysis of question content produces both empirical and theoretical findings: empirical
findings about what the individual knowledge domains ask about “memory,” and
theoretical findings about the phenomenon of scholarly questions. In the empirical realm,
the question content analysis of neuroscientific questions about “memory” indicates that

188
domain inquiry is mainly in two central areas, or two types of indeterminate situations:
the basic lack of knowledge about the neural correlates and mechanisms of various types
of memory at the neurobiological level, and the relations between memory and other
phenomena that impair or enhance memory. A smaller and more peripheral subset of
inquiry concerns the indeterminate situation of what models, tools, and instruments are
appropriate for the study of memory. The indeterminate situations regarding memory in
the literature domain mainly concern the literary use and construction of memory, with a
lesser interest in the direct knowledge and experience of memory. Computer engineering
research centers on a single indeterminate situation in its myriad forms: the optimization
of memory in computer systems. Each knowledge domain differs in what they ask about
“memory” and the level of unity within the sample chosen to represent the domain.
In the theoretical realm, questions are shown to be comprised of a subject, the
entities in the world about which an epistemic determination is being made, and query,
the type of epistemic determination being made. While the subjects of questions are
unlimited, the query types are limited to the ordered classification scheme created by
Dillon (1984). Together, the subject-query pairings are shown to be an effective way of
classifying questions based on what they ask about memory. This definition focuses on
the epistemic function of questions: that their primary purpose is to communicate the
“known unknown” of inquiry, the indeterminate situation that is seeking to be resolved
by the asking of the question. The indeterminate situation expressed by the question
content conveys the content-related requirements for the answer that should follow: it
should resolve the indeterminacy, transforming the indeterminate situation into a
determinate one. Furthermore, the indeterminate situation is defined relative to the

189
knowledge domain as a social unit of inquiry, rather than relative to the isolated
individual. From this social epistemological perspective, the paradox of the question –
that one must know enough to know what can be known – is no paradox at all, but simply
a truth that reflects the social nature of inquiry as the process by which knowledge is
produced.
Having established that the three scholarly domains can be differentiated by their
question content and that the query-subject pairings form picture of what domains ask
about memory, the next chapter compares how different domains ask, as manifested in
question form, and what question form conveys about how to answer.

CHAPTER 7: QUESTION FORM

7.1 Introduction
This dissertation proposes that one way out of the question paradox (Flammer,
1981) that has stymied research about questions in library and information science is to
recast questions as social epistemological tools of inquiry rather than as cognitive
indicators of individuals’ information needs. In reference to the individual questioner,
questions are defined as linguistic devices or tools used to make epistemic determinations
about the world (Derr, 1982), or as expressions of a cognitive gapped picture of reality
and the will to resolve it. We adapt these definitions to the domain level of discourse,
defining questions as epistemic devices, tools used to transform indeterminate situations
into determinate ones, in the context of knowledge domains as social units of knowledge
production. As questions are the tools by which knowledge is produced, it follows that
knowledge domains should be differentiated by the questions that they ask. This
dissertation seeks to investigate how domains compare according to their question
formulations on a common topic and what the comparisons convey about the answers
that follow and the assumptions that precede the question.
Chapter Six: Question content analyzes the content of the question formulations
in neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering dissertations about “memory” and
determines that each domain has a distinct profile of what they ask about memory. The
neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering question content expresses the
indeterminate situations, the “known unknowns” of “memory,” according to querysubject categories. Neuroscience inquiry into “memory” is organized around three main

191
categories of indeterminate situations, while literature is cleanly divided into two, and
computer engineering is narrowly focused on variants of one indeterminate situation
(Table 46).

Table 46. Summary of “memory”-related question content in three domains
The epistemic function of the question formulations is to express the indeterminate
situations motivating inquiry and to call for answers that resolve the stated
indeterminacies. By categorizing question formulations according to query-subject
pairings, the epistemic function of question content is revealed.
In erotetic terms, questions have a logical structure in addition to communicative
function (Brożek, 2011), which structure conveys the level of knowledge that the
questioner has about how to fill the indeterminate situation and what constitutes a
resolution. Completive questions are answered by filling the cognitive gap, while
hypothetive questions require confirmation or disconfirmation of the hypothesized
manner of filling the gap. But at the domain level of discourse, what is of interest is the
epistemic structure, rather than the logical structure. The epistemic structure of inquiry
conveys the domain criteria for how an answer should be produced in order to justifiably
resolve the indeterminacy that is articulated by the question content. Whereas logical
structure is manifested in syntactic form, epistemic structure manifests in the epistemic
form of the question. An analysis of the epistemic forms by which the questions are

192
presented shows whether and how domains can be differentiated according to their
epistemic structure, or how they ask questions. In this chapter, I develop a social
epistemological definition of epistemic form and identify the forms of questions present
in three domains’ dissertation abstracts about “memory” in order to explore the relation
between question form and the domain-based nature of asking and answering questions.

7.2 Method for classifying question form
When studying questioning in interpersonal contexts such as the reference
encounter or, as Dillon (1990) does, in the classroom, courtroom, personnel and other
interview contexts, form is defined as a relation between the syntactic and semantic
dimensions of the question. Syntactic form refers to the verbalized expression, often
offered by the questioner or elicited by an information system or intermediary, of “a
cognitive ‘need-to-know’: the information need” (Horne, 1983, p. 5). In these contexts,
the syntactic form of the question is analyzed for what it indicates about the questioner’s
information-seeking stage and corresponding cognitive state, as, for instance, in the use
of open-ended questions to gather information versus the use of closed-ended questions
to confirm or deny suspected propositions (Horne, 1990). The syntactic form is
interpreted according to the rules of interpersonal communication for the context in
question, reflecting the roles of questioner and respondent governing the interaction. In
this regard, Dillon (1990) observes question asking and answering as it occurs between
teacher and student, trial lawyer and witness, or psychotherapist and patient, among
others. Syntactic analysis of question forms studies the verbalized, observable questionand-answer interactions between questioners and respondents for the meaning that is
communicated between them.

193
At the domain level of discourse, the analysis of form primarily concerns the
relation between the semantic and pragmatic dimensions of the question. The form of the
question is of interest for what it conveys about the relation between the meaning of the
question and its use in organizing inquiry towards the production of knowledge. In the
social epistemic context of knowledge domains, how individual researchers ask is a
function of their level of competence in the knowledge domain in which they are seeking
to participate. The form of the question emerges from the ways of the “seeing” and
“knowing” of the knowledge domain and are thus inherently social and epistemological
in nature, rather than individual and cognitive. The meta-theoretical shift in perspective
is from conceiving of question formation as a process of translating an individual
cognitive need “to know” (Horne, 1983, p. 5) into terms that the questioner perceives the
information system or intermediary can likely answer, to questioning as a practice of
inquiry that seeks to follow the epistemological criteria for the production of knowledge
within the knowledge domain. The semantic nature of the question is embedded in the
pragmatic context of the domain.
The recognition and differentiation of epistemic question forms described in this
chapter developed organically from the process of identifying questions present in
domains’ knowledge products, which process is reported in Chapter Five: Method for
identifying domains’ question formulations. Apart from the obvious difference in the
content of the questions, I observed basic differences in the forms that domains presented
the questions. For instance, some neuroscience abstracts present their inquiries as driven
by hypotheses, while others seemed oriented around a central research question. The
difference is not only in the presentation of the question, but the entire epistemic structure

194
of the abstracts as revolving around the form of the question. While presentation of the
question does differ in terms of syntax, what is mainly of interest to the current
investigation is the epistemic form of the question rather than the syntactic form. More
precisely, what is of interest are the epistemic forms that undergird the syntactic
commonalities in the presentation of inquiry in knowledge products such as in the
scholarly abstracts that are the main data source of this study.
The development of the concept of questions as having epistemic form is aided by
the theory of epistemic games in education. Based on the work of Collins and Ferguson
(1993), Sherry and Trigg (1996) define epistemic forms as target structures that guide the
inquiry process, showing how knowledge is organized or concepts are classified, as well
as illustrating the relationships among the different facts and concepts being learned.
Epistemic forms are “models of information,” (Sherry & Trigg, 1996), a way of
organizing information into meaningful and recognizable structures that show the
relationships between the component entities. One simple and commonplace example is
the family tree, which visually organizes family members according to their direct and
indirect relationships to other individuals, as well as within the family as a whole.
Examples of other everyday epistemic forms include maps, calendars, and recipes.
Subject-based epistemic forms include the periodic table in chemistry, historical time
lines, mathematical equations, economic graphs, and musical compositions. Each of
these epistemic forms structures the visual representation, classification of, and relations
between the domains’ ontological entities. A calendar structures time into related
segments and places events in relation to each other according to the structure of
represented time and visual distances between; the periodic table structures knowledge of

195
chemical elements, which are defined by their atomic numbers and related to each other
by their chemical properties, and electron configurations.
Applying this notion of epistemic form to the topic of question formulation, I
propose that questions have epistemic forms that structure the components and relations
of inquiry. Where they differ from the epistemic forms discussed above is that
components and relations are not visually represented and organized by questions, but are
presented and organized at the cognitive level, in the minds of the questioners acting on
behalf of the knowledge domain. The epistemic form of the question conveys how
inquiry is organized or components of inquiry are defined, as well as illustrating the
relationships among the components of inquiry. The epistemic form of the question is
reflected in the first part of Derr’s (1984) definition of the question as a linguistic device
or tool used to make epistemic determinations about the world. Whereas question
content indicates the epistemic determinations that the questioner seeks to make, question
form functions as the device or tool used to make the determination. Questions organize
inquiry, and they do so, in large part, through their form. The epistemic form of the
question conveys the manner of producing an answer and criteria for evaluating the
answer. It provides the knowledge structure within which the components and
relationships of inquiry are defined.
The current chapter responds to the research questions concerning question form:
(3a) what are the forms of domains’ question formulations on the topic of “memory,”
(3b) how do they compare, and (5a) what information do the comparisons convey about
the answers that follow? The abstracts of neuroscience, literature, and computer
engineering dissertations about “memory” were analyzed in order to identify the

196
epistemic forms in which questions are presented. The domains are compared in terms of
the question forms they utilize and what the forms convey about how to answer and the
structure for inquiry. The epistemic forms were observed to be the central component of
the dissertation abstract, with the other abstract segments, corresponding to the other
components of inquiry, being definable in relation to the epistemic form of the question.
Having identified the epistemic question forms in this manner, the abstracts were then
coded, at a sentence phrase level, in order to identify and label the other components of
inquiry. The abstracts were then analyzed, grouped by question form, for the relations
between coded components of inquiry.
The following sections identify the epistemic question forms as they appear in the
three domains and the manner in which the epistemic form conveys the organization of
inquiry by defining the components of inquiry and their relations, particularly the form of
the answer.

7.3 Neuroscience
Three epistemic question forms are present in the fifty-seven neuroscience
abstracts: research question, hypothesis, and goal (Table 47). Each question form
conveys the epistemic structure of inquiry, the components of inquiry and the
relationships between them that determine the form of the answer and the manner of its
production.

7.3.1 Research question form. Twenty-eight of the fifty-seven dissertation
abstracts present the indeterminate situation in the form of a research question. A
research question is a question about a topic that is framed, based on a familiarity with
the topic, as a perceived knowledge gap or deficit of knowledge about the topic (Farrugia,
Petrisor, Farrokhyar, & Bhandari, 2010). The perceived knowledge gap refers to the
domain state of knowledge about the topic, rather than individual questioner’s state of
knowledge. A research question indicates the researcher’s perception of “where the
boundary between current knowledge and ignorance lies” (Brian Haynes, R., 2006). The
components of a research question-driven inquiry are shown in Table 48.

Research
The overarching aim of this dissertation was to examine how emotion regulation
question
goals in particular might modulate autobiographical recall at both a behavioral
and neural level.
Research
In Chapter 1, a new behavioral task instructed individuals to cognitively reappraise the
design
emotions associated with negative and positive events.
Results
Results revealed that such emotion regulation goals influence the emotional and other
subjective experiences associated with recall, such that up-regulation instructions were
linked to greater reported levels of emotional intensity, sensory detail, and recollection
(e.g., reliving), and vice-versa for down-regulation instructions.
Research
In Chapter 2, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used as participants
design
were instructed to decrease, increase, or maintain the emotions associated with negative
autobiographical events.
Results
Decreasing emotional intensity primarily engaged neural activity in regions previously
implicated in cognitive control (e.g., dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex),
emotion generation and processing (e.g., amygdala, insula), and visual imagery (e.g.,
precuneus) during an early phase of recall as participants searched for and retrieved
events. In contrast, increasing emotional intensity engaged similar regions as
individuals prepared to recall negative events (i.e., before a memory cue was presented)
and again as they later elaborated upon the details of the events they had recalled.
Research
In Chapter 3, individual differences in habitual use of cognitive reappraisal were
design
measured and their relation to neural activity during autobiographical recall was
examined.
Results
Results revealed that, even when not explicitly instructed to reappraise, habitual use of
reappraisal was broadly associated with neural activity in cognitive control regions (e.g.,
dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) as well as
emotion processing regions (e.g., amygdala, insula) across memories that varied in their
emotionality and specificity.
Finding
Taken together, these results suggest that short- and long-term emotion regulation goals
can influence the construction of autobiographical memories on both behavioral and

198
neural levels.

Table 48. Neuroscience: Structure of a research question abstract
As an epistemic question form, the research question is the component relative to which
the other components of inquiry and their interrelations are defined and structured. The
Table 48 abstract components are thus described below.
7.3.1.1 State of domain knowledge. The existing state of domain knowledge
regarding autobiographical memory recall is presented in a single sentence: it is known
that memory recall is constructive in nature, creating new neural connections between
synapses, not just traveling already established pathways, and that it is influenced by
individuals’ short- and long-term goals. This component of inquiry, generally presented
at the beginning of the abstract, summarizes the current knowledge of the topic in order
to anticipate the explicit statement of the knowledge deficit that the research question
seeks to fill. The relationship between the state of domain knowledge and the research
question is one of establishing the knowledge deficit as a rationale for the inquiry.
7.3.1.2 Research question. The research question drives the inquiry by
identifying what knowledge is being sought relative to the state of domain knowledge
about the topic; it states the known unknown. In light of existing knowledge that
autobiographical memory recall can be influenced by short- and long-term goals, the
research question arises from a perceived lack of knowledge about a specific sub-set of
goals: emotion regulation goals. Specifically, the research question asks, how might
emotion regulation goals in particular modulate autobiographical recall at both a
behavioral and neural level? The research question intends to increase the state of
domain knowledge about the topic. It functions to organize inquiry by maintaining a

199
focus on the boundary between known and unknown. The question formulations
presenting as research questions are indicated in Appendix C.
7.3.1.3 Research design. The approach to inquiry as organized by a
neuroscientific research question is a series of sequential or componential experiments
that, taken together, give insight into the unknown aspect of the memory-related
phenomenon. Description of the research design seeks to establish the validity and
reliability of each individual study, as well as of the overall logic of the multiple studies
towards increasing knowledge of the memory-related phenomenon. The example in
Table 48 describes a three-study research design for adequately addressing the research
question. The research question asks, what is the relationship between emotion
regulation goals and autobiographical recall, at behavioral and neural levels? Two
studies are described, one designed to measure the behavioral effect of emotion
regulation on autobiographical recall, the other the neural effect; a third study is
conducted in order to rule out individual difference as explaining the difference in neural
activity in the first study. For each, research methods are reported that correspond to the
nature of the question: the measurement of emotional and other subjective experiences to
study the behavioral effect of emotion regulation on recall and the use of functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the neural effect. The relationship
between the studies is either sequential, with each study building upon the results from
the previous study, or componential, with each study providing discrete results that,
interpreted together, increase holistic understanding of the phenomenon. The example in
Table 48 is both componential and sequential: experiments one and two are componential,
in that they approach a common known unknown, the relationship between emotion

200
regulation and autobiographical recall, at different levels, while experiments two and
three are sequential, in that experiment three clarifies the findings of experiment two.
7.3.1.4 Results. The abstract reports the results of each experiment. The
individual studies’ hypotheses are confirmed: emotion regulation effects autobiographical
recall at the behavioral level, also at the neural level, and the neural effect is not due to
individual differences in the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal. Each result is a
knowledge claim that individually contributes to the domain’s epistemic gap regarding
the relationship between emotion regulation and autobiographical recall.
7.3.1.5 Findings. Together, the individual results are interpreted as a finding
about the memory-related topic. In a research question-driven inquiry, the
epistemological activity of considering how experimental results from the multiple
experiments should be interpreted in relation to the research question requires another
layer of interpretation beyond the interpretation of the results of each individual
experiment. The results of the three experiments are interpreted together in light of the
research question of how emotion regulation goals modulate autobiographical recall. The
conclusion is that, “Taken together, these results suggest that short- and long-term
emotion regulation goals can influence the construction of autobiographical memories on
both behavioral and neural levels.” This finding reshapes the boundary between the
known and unknown of memory in the domain. In some cases, the boundary is simply
pushed further out by advancing knowledge of the memory-related phenomenon; the
findings “begin to elucidate” (N21) or “contribute to the growing understanding” (N47)
of the neuroscientific bases of memory, which in turn leads to more questions. In other
cases, the findings relocate the boundary entirely, forcing a questioning or rethinking of

201
previous understandings of the phenomenon. For example, one dissertation’s results call
into question the traditional memory systems dichotomy that assigns distinct functions to
the medial temporal lobe and the striatum in associative learning, concluding instead that
the two neural structures dynamically interact during learning (N38).
7.3.1.6 Summary of research question form. The research question form
organizes inquiry as a series of experiments that, interpreted together, shed light on the
indeterminate situation. Emerging from the state of domain knowledge, it asks questions
at the boundary of what is known about memory as a neuroscientific phenomenon. It is
known that associative memory exists, but its electrophysiological and neural correlates
are not known (N3); it is known that place cells resolve conflicting neuronal signals, but
not how (N25); it is known that the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex have a
role in time and distance coding, but not what the role is. A series of studies is conducted
to gather information about the phenomenon, producing some results, which are together
interpreted as a finding that directly responds to the research question. The finding is
evaluated according to whether it increases knowledge of the phenomenon.
7.3.2 Hypothesis form. Twenty-six dissertations present questions about
memory in the epistemic form of hypotheses. Hypotheses are testable and falsifiable
explanations for observations, phenomena, or problems in the form of tentative
propositions about the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
Whereas research questions are formulated to identify the domain’s epistemic gap,
hypotheses go a step further by conjecturing how the gap should be filled. The
indeterminate situation is one of conflicting information (is the hypothesis correct or
not?), rather than a gap. Neuroscientific research questions ask about memory while

202
hypotheses ask about the relationship between memory and other phenomena. Table 49
shows the structure of a typical hypothesis-driven abstract according to the components
of inquiry.
N1: Effect of Neuroscience-Based Cognitive Skill Training on Growth of Cognitive Deficits Associated
with Learning Disabilities in Children Grades 2-4
State of domain
Working memory, executive functions, and cognitive processes associated with
knowledge
specific academic areas, are empirically identified as being the core underlying
cognitive deficits in students with specific learning disabilities (SLD). Research has
not yet focused on interventions that strengthen the weak underlying neurological
processes, which result in students not improving these cognitive deficits.
Hypothesis
Using Hebb's theory of neuroplasticity and the principle of automaticity as
theoretical bases, this experimental study examined the effectiveness of a specific
12-week neuroscience-based, cognitive-skills computer-training program on the
cognitive processing of 40 elementary students in grades 2-4 with SLD; students,
who were equally divided and randomly assigned to the control and
experimental groups.
Research design
The independent variable was a computer-based cognitive skill training program.
The dependent variables were overall cognitive growth (GIA), executive functions
(EF), visual working memory (GV), verbal working memory (WM), processing speed
(Gs), short term memory (Gsm), and predicted achievement scores (Brief Reading,
Brief Math). Using a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and a 95%
confidence interval,
Confirmation/
the study results indicated the experimental group had significantly increased
disconfirmation
performance over the control group in every skill area examined.
Implications
Implications for positive social change include understanding the impact of cognitive
skill training on underlying cognitive deficits of students diagnosed with SLD. Such
training can result in increased academic performance.

Table 49. Neuroscience: Structure of a hypothesis abstract
The components of inquiry and their relations are described here with an emphasis on the
differences from the research question form.
7.3.2.1 State of domain knowledge. Similar to the research question abstracts,
the abstract begins with the state of domain knowledge on the memory-related topic: that
students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) have been shown to have cognitive
deficits in working memory and executive functions, but that no interventions have been
developed that strengthen the underlying neurological processes. Whereas the state of
domain knowledge component in the research question-driven inquiries presents a
knowledge gap, here it presents an epistemic conflict. Conflicting evidence may present

203
the need for resolution via experimental means, such as when “neuroimaging
investigations into the nature of these deficits” in schizophrenics’ ability to perform
working memory tasks “over the last decade and a half have been stymied by inconsistent
findings that leave no clear answer as to their cognitive or neural basis” (N54). There
may be clinical evidence that suggests the validity of the hypothesis but no direct
experimental evidence to back it up, such as in the case where “Memory complaints are
regularly reported by ill Gulf War veterans but there is scarce data to verify their
complaints” (N10). Or existing research may suggest the hypothesis, such as when
“Research in rodents and computational modeling work suggest a critical role for the
hippocampus in representing overlapping memories” (N9), but the hypothesis has never
been directly tested. The state of domain knowledge establishes the need for the
experimental research, introduces the relevant variables, and may also provide evidence
for the hypothesis about the relationship between the variables.
7.3.2.2 Hypothesis. The hypothesis proposes a relationship between the
independent and dependent variables that responds to the epistemic conflict or deficit
identified in the state of domain knowledge component. In indirect question form, it can
be expressed as a whether- statement, asking whether the relationship, between memory
and another phenomenon that may impair or improve memory, can be confirmed. The
abstract in Table 49 hypothesizes a causal relationship between a cognitive intervention
and improved cognitive processing in a group of specific learning disabled (SLD)
students who have undergone a twelve-week, neuroscience-based cognitive-skills,
computer-training program. Whereas research question-driven inquiries interpret the
results of a series of experiments to fill the domain’s epistemic gap of memory as a

204
neuroscientific phenomenon, the hypothesis-driven inquiry seeks to resolve an epistemic
conflict as to the existence of a relationship between memory and other phenomena of
impairment or enhancement. The question formulations presenting as hypotheses are
indicated in Appendix C.
7.3.2.3 Research design. The research design by which the hypothesis is tested
specifies the independent variable (a computer-based cognitive skill training program),
dependent variables (overall cognitive growth, executive functions, visual working
memory, verbal working memory, processing speed, short term memory, and predicted
achievement scores), and the predicted relation between them: a positive relation between
those receiving the intervention and the dependent variables measuring cognition and
memory. The method of statistical analysis is also stated (multivariate analysis of
covariance (MANCOVA) and a 95% confidence interval) in order to justify and
communicate the rigor of the results. Unusual or new methods and research designs are
paid particular attention, such as the development of novel training paradigms for the
study of memory in mice (N13), or the use of music as a retrieval cue for emotional
memories (N14). In cases where a cause and effect are being inferred from an animal
model, such as the development of a model of prenatal alcohol exposure in mice (N7),
the animal model is described in detail in order to justify the inference of results between
animal experimentation and human memory. Above all else, the research design is
described in order to expose the logic by which the hypothesis is being experimentally
tested.
7.3.2.4 Confirmation/disconfirmation. The results of experimentation are stated
as confirmation/disconfirmation of the hypothesis. In Table 49, the results show that the

205
experimental group had significantly increased performance over the control group in
every skill area examined, which confirms the prediction that a twelve-week
neuroscience-based, cognitive-skills computer-training program would improve the
cognitive processing of 40 elementary students in grades two through four with specific
learning disabilities. In the case of results that do not achieve statistical significance, the
hypothesis is disconfirmed or rejected. In comparison to the descriptive finding that
results from a research question-driven inquiry, confirmation or disconfirmation of a
hypothesis makes a pronouncement on a pre-determined set of possible results, the
statistical likelihood that there is or is not a relation between various phenomena of
impairment and improvement and memory performance. The result resolves the
epistemic conflict presented by the hypothesis.
7.3.2.5 Implications. The results are interpreted in terms of their implications for
the epistemic conflict about the memory-related phenomenon implied in the state of
domain knowledge and hypothesis. Confirmation of the hypothesis, that the training
intervention will improve cognitive processing of students with specific learning
disabilities implies that such training can improve academic performance, has
implications for positive social change. In other dissertations, the confirmation or
disconfirmation of hypotheses has implications for the current understanding of a
memory-related phenomenon, such as when finding that amphetamines enhance
emotional memory encoding and consolidation but impair retrieval suggests the
reconsideration of the use of amphetamines for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder
(N4). Not all abstracts include an implications component.

206
7.3.2.6 Summary of hypothesis form. The hypothesis functions as the central
component of inquiry, in relation to which the other components are defined and related.
The current state of domain knowledge exhibits some epistemic conflict in its knowledge
of the relation between memory and other phenomena. A hypothesis is proposed which
would resolve the conflict and is tested according to a research design that leads to a
confirmation or disconfirmation of the hypothesis. The result is evaluated according to
the correspondence of the research design to the hypothesis and its validity and reliability,
leading to implications for the domain knowledge of memory or its application.
7.3.3 Goal form. Four abstracts present their questions in the epistemic form of a
goal. A goal is an aim or desired result that the researcher is setting out to achieve
through the research, formulated in relation to an epistemic obstacle that the domain faces
in pursuing knowledge of a memory-related phenomenon. The epistemic obstacles
concern the means of studying or applying memory, rather than the phenomenon of
memory itself. These dissertations develop models and tools for studying and applying
memory. Table 50 shows the structure of a goal-centered abstract, defined according to
the components of inquiry.
N46: Validation of Alternative Morris Revision-IV Paragraph for Logical Memory Subtest Older Adult
Version
Problem
Although the Wechsler Memory Scale's (WMS) Logical Memory Subtest is one of the
one of the best and most commonly used descriptors of overall memory function and
dysfunction, significant evidence suggests its use on repeated assessments, is
inadequate due to the overall stability seen in studies of test-retest reliability. This
problem has been resolved for earlier versions of the test via the development of
alternate test stimuli (Morris, Kunka, &Rossini, 1997).
Goal
The introduction of an updated version of the WMS, the Wechsler Memory
Scale-4th edition (WMS-IV), calls for additional resources especially for the
specialized assessment of older adults.
Tool/
An alternate paragraph (Morris Revision-IV) for the WMS-IV Older Adult Battery
instrument
Logical Memory Subtest was developed to meet this need
Evaluation
and shown to be psychometrically equivalent. Through collection of normative data,
this paragraph was proven to possess strong interscorer reliability and significant
correlations with the original WMS-IV Logical Memory paragraph for older adults.
Implications
This evidence has been used to establish alternate-form reliability of the Morris

207
Revision-IV paragraph to the extent that it can be used in place of the original for the
clinical practice of memory evaluation.

Table 50. Neuroscience: Structure of a goal abstract
Each component of inquiry is further described in relation to the epistemic question form,
the goal.
7.3.3.1 Problem. The abstract begins by stating the research problem, the
epistemic obstacle that the domain faces in their pursuit of knowledge about memory. In
Table 50 the problem is that the most recent version of a commonly used measurement
tool and descriptor of memory function and dysfunction, the Wechsler Memory Scale –
4th Edition, is in need of alternate test stimuli for its repeated use in assessing older adults’
memory. The problem sets the context for the formulation of a goal, which is an
actionable objective towards solving the problem. The problems are sometimes explicitly
stated, as in this example, but are often implicit in the statements of the goals, as when
proposing “a computational cognitive neuroscience model…which models episodic
memory based on the human brain” (N53) or “novel paradigms involving the integration
of conventional and ethologically relevant forms of reinforcement in the study of fear
conditioning in rats” (N22), which imply the lack of said model or paradigm as the
problem.
7.3.3.2 Goal. As the epistemic form of the question, the goal is the central
component in relation to which each of the other components is defined. In response to
the problem, the goal identifies what needs to be done in order to find a solution or to
move beyond the domain’s obstacles towards the desired epistemic state. The goal in the
abstract above is to create additional resources for the WMS-IV especially for the
specialized assessment of older adults. Other goals in the sample include to “develop the
adaptive training for patients with low visual working memory (VWM) capacity to

208
improve cognitive abilities and healthy individuals who seek to enhance their intellectual
performance” (N32) and to “develop novel paradigms involving the integration of
conventional and ethologically relevant forms of reinforcement in the study of fear
conditioning in rats” (N22). The questions presented as goals, indicated in Appendix C,
generally ask, “What tool can be developed to meet the goal?”
7.3.3.3 Tool. In response to setting a goal, the answer is produced in the form of
a tool or instrument of research, techniques or instruments that are used to accomplish a
function necessary to attain the goal. The research represented in Table 50 proposes a
new tool for the purposes of achieving the goal related to the neuroscientific study or
treatment of memory: an alternate paragraph for the WMS-IV Older Adult Battery
Logical Memory Subtest is developed for the repeated assessment of older adults. Other
tools and instruments in the sample include a computational cognitive neuroscience
model of episodic memory in the human brain (N53) and an adaptive training for
improving the intellectual performance of individuals with low visual working memory
(N32). In other domains, an appropriate reply to the posing of a goal may be a program,
protocol, or other design that is applied towards achieving the goal.
7.3.3.4 Evaluation. Evaluation is the means by which the tool is determined to
have achieved the stated goal. In the example, the implementation of the alternate
paragraph takes the form of analysis of normative data for interscorer reliability and is
evaluated according to its correlation with the original paragraph that is being replaced.
N53 implements the computer model of the brain by running the Morris Water Maze task,
“a well established biological experimental test of distal reward learning” and comparing
results to biological rat experimental data and other models. The adaptive training for

209
those with low visual working memory (N32) is implemented in an experimental setting
as well. The evaluation shows whether and how the tool works to achieve the goal.
7.3.3.5 Implications. The conclusion of the inquiry is stated in terms of the
implications of the tool’s ability to achieve the goal: that alternate form reliability of the
Morris Revision-IV paragraph has been established and can be used in place of the
original for the clinical practice of memory evaluation. In the case of the adaptive
training for persons with low visual working memory, the conclusion is that the training
can significantly improve cognitive function and may be useful for enhancing the user
performance on neuroprosthetics devices (N32).
7.3.3.6 Summary of goal form. This small subset of neuroscientific dissertations
organizes inquiry relative to the epistemic obstacles that neuroscience faces in the study
of memory and its clinical application. New tools are designed to meet goals related to
the problems arising in the study or clinical treatment of memory. Through
implementation and evaluation of the tool, implications can be drawn about the utility of
the tool or knowledge to the motivating problem.
7.3.4 Discussion. Three forms of questions have been identified in the
neuroscience sample of dissertation research on memory. As epistemic forms, they are
differentiated by how they structure the components and relations of inquiry. Chief
among the components and relations of inquiry is that of the “question” to the “answer.”
Each epistemic question form has a corresponding answer form; together, they constitute
the basic epistemic structure of the inquiry, in relation to which the rest of the
components of inquiry are defined. Just as question content, the expression of the
indeterminate situation motivating inquiry, conveys the criteria for the answer (that it

210
resolve the indeterminacy), the form of the question conveys the expectation for the form
of the answer. Research questions demand answers in the form of findings to fill the
epistemic gap; hypotheses require confirmation or disconfirmation to resolve the
epistemic conflict, and goals solicit the development of tools in order to overcome
epistemic obstacles.
Additionally, each of the forms of inquiry corresponds to certain question content
areas, as described by the query-subject pairings identified in Chapter Six. Together,
form and content produce a profile of three areas of memory-related research, as defined
by what is being asked about memory (question content) and how it is being asked
(question form), indicating the domain’s indeterminate epistemic situation and the
epistemic structure for how to resolve the indeterminacy (Table 51).

Table 51. Neuroscience: Question profile
The first form in which the question presents is the research question. Research
questions emerge from familiarity with the state of knowledge in the domain related to
the phenomenon of interest. They identify a domain knowledge deficit and poses whator how- questions to fill the knowledge deficit. They do so by means of a series of
experiments designed to produce sequential or componential results that, when
interpreted together in relation to the knowledge deficit, produce findings that fill the
domain’s epistemic gap, thus extending the state of knowledge about memory. The
research question-finding structure is indicative of descriptive inquiry. This form of

211
inquiry is concerned with description of the nature of memory as a physical phenomenon.
It seeks basic scientific understanding of phenomena such as memory: what they are,
what are their parts and processes, how they are organized, and how they function.
The query-subject pairings that describe question content in research questionfinding dissertations provide a snapshot of the point at which we encounter descriptive
neuroscientific research on memory. Several dissertations ask queries of (2)
instance/identification about the neural correlates of memory. This indicates that much
of the initial work of identifying the different types of memory, differentiated according
to their neural correlates, or patterns of neural activity, has already been accomplished.
Neuroscientists have a strong understanding of the different types of memory, their basic
functions, and what they look like in the brain. The focus of the research has moved on
to describing the neural mechanisms of memory, or how memory actually functions at the
neural level. At an even finer level of description, researchers are also seeking to know
the role of X in memory, where X can be defined at the anatomical level (e.g.
hippocampus, medial entorhinal cortext) or neuronal level (e.g. proteins, RNA). By
posing research questions that identify the boundary between what is known and
unknown and producing findings that continue to push the boundary further out, the
neuroscientific phenomenon of memory is being mapped out.
The second question form identified in neuroscientific dissertation research about
memory is the hypothesis. The hypothesis question form offers an explanation for
observed phenomena in the form of propositions about the relationship between
dependent and independent variables. Like research questions, hypotheses emerge from
the state of domain knowledge about a phenomenon, but rather than seeking to fill a

212
knowledge deficit as research questions do, they seek to resolve an epistemic conflict by
isolating the relationship relative to independent and dependent variables that can then to
subjected to correlative analyses or controlled experiments in order to get confirmation or
disconfirmation of the hypothesized relationship. The hypothesisconfirmation/disconfirmation form of question and answer frames determinative
inquiry. In contrast to descriptive scientific knowledge of the neuroscientific bases of
memory, this type of knowledge is about the conditional (whether or how if P then or if
Q then P) or biconditional (whether or how if P then Q and if Q then P) between memory
and other phenomena.
While hypotheses are occasionally used in conjunction with queries of (4)
character/description in situations where enough is known to produce an epistemic
conflict, the predominant correspondence is with (12) conditionality – Y and memory
questions and (13) biconditionality – Z and memory questions. The relationship between
memory and the other phenomena may vary in strength and direction, with conditional
inquiries generally concerning the causal relationship between phenomena and enhanced
memory and biconditional inquiries the likely causal relationship between phenomena
and impaired memory. Together, form and content describe the subset of neuroscience
that is interested in the negative effect of memory and age, diseases and disorders, and
traumatic brain injury on memory, as well as the causal positive effect of cognitive
interventions, drugs, and other phenomena such as stress on memory. By formulating
hypotheses, which are whether- questions, about these relations, the epistemic conflicts
related to the tentative relations are resolved.

213
The third form of question in neuroscientific research about memory is the goal.
Goals are formulated in response to a problem in the domain, either related to the ability
to conduct research on memory or the clinical treatment of memory-related problems.
Goals articulate the aim or desired result that the researcher is setting out to achieve to
overcome the problem in the form of what- questions, asking, what tool will achieve the
goal and thus solve the problem? The appropriate form of reply to a goal is the
development of a tool, an instrument or technique that is designed, implemented, and
evaluated in order to establish that it meets the established goal. The goal-tool form of
question and answer describes prescriptive inquiry. This form of inquiry is essentially
pragmatic, aimed at solving specific memory-related domain problems rather than
producing knowledge of the phenomenon of memory or its relations to other phenomena.
Goals produce knowledge in the form of (6) rationale/explanation of how
memory models or instruments solve the pragmatic problem: how a new type of animal
model integrates conventional and ethologically relevant forms of reinforcement in the
study of fear conditioning in rats (N22), or how a computational cognitive neuroscience
computer model enables the study of episodic memory of the mammalian brain (N53).
The goal-tool form of question and answer will be discussed further in relation to the
computer engineering domain, for which this is the primary form of inquiry.
7.3.5 Summary of neuroscience forms. Three question forms are identified in
the neuroscience sample. Paired with the corresponding answer forms, they describe
three distinct epistemic structures for organizing the components of inquiry and their
relations. Research question-finding inquiries produce descriptive knowledge of the
neural bases of human memory by formulating questions to fill the epistemic gaps of

214
domain knowledge about memory. Hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation inquiries
produce contingent knowledge of relations between memory and phenomena of
impairment or enhancement such as age, diseases, traumatic brain injury, cognitive
interventions, and drugs, by formulating hypotheses about how to resolve an epistemic
conflict. Finally, the goal-tool form of inquiry produces practical knowledge by
formulating goals to overcome the domain’s epistemic obstacles to the study of memory
or its clinical treatment. Together, the three basic form-content areas constitute a
question profile of neuroscientific research about memory.

7.4 Literature
Two epistemic question forms are found in the sample of 20 literature abstracts:
topic and theme (Table 52). The two forms are distinguished by the manner in which
they organize inquiry, as manifested in the components of inquiry and relationships
between the components.

Table 52. Literature: Question forms
7.4.1 Topic form. Seventeen of the twenty literature abstracts express their
questions as being about a topic. The topic question form is utilized in critical literature
dissertations to establish an epistemic focus for the inquiry. Similar to the neuroscientific
use of the research question form, the topic represents the gapped epistemic picture of
memory in the domain that is seeking to be filled, but through the critical analysis of
literary texts rather than scientific experimentation. Table 53 shows the structure of a
typical topic-driven literature abstract according to the components of inquiry and their

215
relations.
L5: History as Myth and Memory: Bassani, Ginzburg, Levi, and the Re-membering of Fascism
Topic
In my dissertation, "History as Myth and Memory: Bassani, Ginzburg, Levi,
and the Re-membering of Fascism" I examine how post-war literature has
affected the ways in which Italy has dealt with the memory of Fascism's twenty
year rule.
Methodology
I begin by analyzing both the political and the cultural components that contributed to
Premise
the emergence of a dominant Resistance narrative in the immediate post-war years,
focusing in particular on the role that Neorealism played in the formation of this
narrative in Renata Viganò's novel L'Agnese va a morire, and Roberto Rossellini's
film Roma città aperta.
Theory
Through my reading of Benedetto Croce's historicism, as well as theories of cultural
memory by scholars such as Pierre Nora, Maurice Halbwachs, and Jan and Aleida
Assmann,
Premise
I show how Giorgio Bassani's Il giardino dei Finzi-Contini, Natalia Ginzburg's
Lessico famigliare, and Primo Levi's Il sistema periodico created an alternate and
competing memory of the Fascist ventennio.
Thesis
I finally conclude that after World War II, the position of Italian Jews became a
privileged one from which to explore moral and ethical issues concerning the period
of transition that followed the conflict, as well as to question dogmatic truths on the
public memory of the war.

Table 53. Literature: Structure of a topic abstract
Each component in the abstract is described in relation to the topic as an epistemic form.
7.4.1.1 Topic. The abstracts generally begin by describing the topic of the
research. Topic is defined in the literature domain as the matter being discussed, the
matter within a text, set of texts, discourse, or conversation. The topic serves to provide
the inquiry with an epistemic focus, informing methodological choices such as the
selection of texts for analysis (do they pertain to the topic?) and analytical approach to
the texts (how should the texts be analyzed, relative to the topic?). In the example in
Table 53, the topic is “how post-war literature has affected the ways in which Italy has
dealt with the memory of Fascism's twenty year rule.” The literature domain’s questions
presenting in topic form are indicated in Appendix C.
7.4.1.2 Methodology. Descriptions of methodology describe the approach to the
literary texts by which the textual evidence is produced in support of the argument being
made about the topic. In the abstract above, the brief methodological statement identifies

216
a cultural phenomenon as manifested in literary form (“the political and cultural
components that contributed to the emergence of a dominant Resistance narrative in the
immediate post-war years”), the texts selected for analysis (“Renata Viganò's novel
L'Agnese va a morire and Roberto Rossellini's film Roma città aperta.”), and the
analytical focus (the role that Neorealism played in the formation of the dominant
Resistance narrative in the selected texts). Methodological statements in other abstracts
also describe the rationale for selection of literary texts (L3; L8; L14; L15), the
framework for analysis (L9; L10), methods for reading the texts (L10; L14; L15), and
methods of presenting the textual analyses (L12; L19).
7.4.1.3 Premise. The argument constructed about the topic is built upon premises
or propositions. In the example above, the premises are: that a dominant Resistance
narrative emerged in the immediate post-war years; that Neorealism played a role in the
formation of this narrative in certain texts selected for critical analysis; and that another
set of texts created an alternate and competing memory of the Fascist ventennio.
Throughout the topic-driven abstracts, the premises consist of the propositions related to
the thesis about “memory” that result from the critical readings of the literary texts:
premises about how and to what effect authors use characters (L6), shared tropes (L15),
narratives (L15; L11), genre (L3; L20), and subjectivity (L1; L14).
7.4.1.4 Theory. In addition to describing methodology, the abstract in Table 53
identifies the theories of “Benedetto Croce’s historicism, as well as the theories of
cultural memory” as shaping the argument about the role of literature in relation to
history and cultural memory. Literary theories are the systems of related ideas that serve
as the critical lenses through which works of art are viewed and discussed. They provide

217
a body of values and assumptions about the texts that shape the types of premises that the
thesis statement can build its conclusion upon. The abstracts in the literature sample
employ theories of historicism (L5; L9), ecocritical theories (L11), postmodernism (L6;
L10; L20), and theories of memory (L15), to support the premises leading to the thesis
statements.
7.4.1.5 Thesis. Questions about the topics are answered in the form of a thesis, a
statement built upon premises that must be proven in order for the conclusion being made
in the thesis to be upheld. Thesis statements are original arguments made about the topic,
constructed from their interpretation of the selected literary texts. The premises that
emerge from the literary analysis in Table 53 build to the thesis statement, that: “…after
World War II, the position of the Italian Jews became a privileged one from which to
explore moral and ethical issues concerning the period of transition that followed the
conflict, as well as to question the public memory of the war.” Serving as the conclusion
to the argument that rests upon the outlined premises, the thesis statement is typically
located at the end of the literary dissertation abstract. The thesis statements in this
sample make arguments about how literary texts construct, or reconstruct (L10; L20),
“forget” (L4; L12; L3) or disrupt forgetting (L18), or to subvert dominant discourses (L2;
L19), thus reflecting on how literature engages with memory but also on how memory
engages literature, pushing the boundaries of form, narrative, genre, and subjectivity.
7.4.1.6 Summary of topic form. The majority of literature dissertations in the
sample organize inquiry by selecting an epistemic focus, the memory-related topic, for
the construction of an argument to be made based on analysis of selected literary texts.
The methodology shapes the approach to the texts and the shape of the argument, while

218
theory offers a framework for understanding the relationship between memory and text,
history, cultures, and subjectivity. These create a lens for textual analysis, from which
the premises of the argument, as backed by textual evidence, can be constructed. The
thesis statement stands as the conclusive statement of the argument.
7.4.2 Theme form. Three abstracts in the literature sample present the content of
their memory-related questions in the form of a literary theme, a central thought or idea
that recurs or is incorporated throughout a literary work. These are the creative writing
dissertations, two novels and a collection of short stories that identify memory as a
central theme of the works. Table 54 shows the structure of one of the theme-driven
abstracts, according to the three main components of this type of inquiry.
L16: Veiled Men: A novel
Topic
Veiled Men is about a woman's struggle to regain her sense of belonging, having lost
her memory after being injured in a violent attack.
Theme
The focus of the novel involves the collectivity of memory and the way
patriarchal culture ignores and ultimately punishes women's anger and desire.
The protagonist's scattered patches of memory, which she discovers are not her
own but those of her loved ones, suggest that that history is a shared experience.
Interpretation
Multiple narratives including letters, diaries, orally transmitted stories and gossip
reflect the multiple selves women inhabit when seeking to belong to patriarchal
culture and act autonomously within it. The protagonist, Kate, realizes that her anger
and her sexuality have moved her husband and family to blot her out, to impose an
identity upon her more palatable to them, after her assailant has made her a blank
page. Through her search among the textual remains left by friends and family,
culminating in the discovery of her husband's secret diary, she is able to identify
herself and her attacker, and revise her identity in a position of power.

Table 54. Literature: Structure of a theme abstract
Each component is described in relation to the theme, which, as the epistemic form,
organizes the inquiry.
7.4.2.1 Topic. The abstracts begin by describing the basic topic or plot of the
literary fiction work, what it is “about.” Veiled Men is about a female protagonist’s
struggle to regain her identity after a violent attack leaves her with amnesia (L16).
Another novel in the sample describes its plot as being about the protagonist’s quest to

219
reunite the romantic relationship he had with his fourth-grade teacher (L7). The third
dissertation, a set of short stories, is about “the importance of myth, memory, tradition,
and place within a Southern context” (L17). Whereas critical literature dissertations
define “aboutness” relative to a topic, the creative writing dissertations define it in
relation to literary themes.
7.4.2.2 Theme. The themes of a literary fiction text are the central ideas explored
in a literary work, as presented in the text by the author and interpreted by the reader.
The memory-related theme emerges from the author’s production of the creative work,
providing an epistemic focus for the writer’s exploration via production of the text. In
the abstract above, the themes are the collectivity of memory and punishment of women’s
anger and desire by patriarchal culture. Other themes in the literature sample include
“memory and memoir, sports iconography, gender roles and community” (L7) and
“characters’ animalistic nature and their desire to maintain traditions that are on the cusp
of fading out entirely” (L17). The questions presenting as themes are indicated in
Appendix C.
7.4.2.3 Interpretation. In response to the implicit presentation of the question as
a literary theme, readers produce knowledge in the form of an interpretation of the theme
as a general idea or meaning of the work. The interpretation points back to the theme by
describing the ways in which the theme is revealed: through plot points or character
development (L7); through the use of narrative techniques (L16); or by playing with
language, genre, or form (L16; L17). In Veiled Men, the theme of “the collectivity of
memory,” that “history is a shared experience,” is revealed through the use of multiple
narratives and textual remains that “reflect the multiple selves women inhabit when

220
seeking to belong to patriarchal culture and act autonomously within it” (L16). The
literary interpretation of the work constitutes the explanation or explication of what the
work means through an apprehension of theme, context, form, narrative, symbolism,
characters, imagery, tone, and other dimensions of the work.
While authors generally do not interpret their own work for the reader, most
creative writing doctoral programs require presentation not only of the created work of
literary fiction, but evidence of the writer’s understanding and execution of their craft in
the form of a critical reflection of their own work. This takes the form of a critical essay,
serving as an introduction or accompaniment to their creative work of fiction, or
sometimes takes the form of a separate qualifying exam that situates their writing in
relation to their literary influences.
7.4.2.4 Summary of theme form. Three creative writing literature dissertations
present their questions in the epistemic form of a theme. The topic of the creative work
serves as the context for the development of the work’s themes, which function as an
epistemic focus for the author’s explorations of the topic. Themes are subject to the
reader’s interpretations, provided, in this academic context, by the authors themselves in
the form of critical reflections on their own creative works.
7.4.3 Discussion. Two epistemic question forms are found in the sample of
literature dissertations. In combination with the corresponding answer forms, they
describe two differing structures for organizing inquiry according to its components and
relations. Paired with the corresponding descriptions of question content (Table 55), they
form a question profile of the literature domain’s research about memory according to
what is being asked (content) and how it is being asked (form).

Table 55. Literature: Question profile
The dominant form in which the literature questions present is the topic, a subject, matter,
or question dealt with in a text, discourse or conversation. The topic question form is
utilized in literature dissertations to provide an epistemic focus for the construction of an
argument about a memory-related phenomenon via critical analysis of literary texts. The
appropriate response to a question posed as a topic is a thesis statement, the conclusion of
the argument, formulated based upon a set of premises that are supported by close
readings of the literary texts as aided by the lens of literary theories and methodologies
for approaching the text. The topic-thesis structure describes a type of critical inquiry.
This form of inquiry dissects literary texts in order to make a critical argument about
what the text does or how it functions relative to the phenomena of interest. In regards to
memory as one such phenomenon, the content of the topic-thesis inquires is described by
the query-subject pairings in Table 55, mainly queries of (6) rationale/explication about
the literary construction of memory or literary uses of memory. The query-subject
pairings, in conjunction with the topic-thesis form, suggest that the literature domain
produces knowledge of how memory is constructed in literary texts and what it functions
to accomplish for its agents of remembrance. By proscribing the memory-related topics
as the matter of interest in critical readings of a literary text or group of texts, the
literature dissertations result in thesis statements about how memory functions in literary
texts and how literary texts, in turn, use memory.
The second form of question is the theme. Themes are the central thoughts or

222
ideas that recur or are incorporated throughout a literary work, functioning to provide an
epistemic focus for the author’s exploration, here of memory-related phenomena, in the
production of a creative work. The answer to a theme takes the form of the reader’s
interpretation of the theme or themes in the context of reading the literary texts that have
been produced, but is provided by the author in the dissertation abstract due to the
requirements of the academic context. The theme-interpretation structure characterizes
creative inquiry in the literature domain. This form of inquiry seeks to foster direct
experience of abstract phenomena such as memory by posing queries of (15)
acquaintance that produce direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of memory,
knowledge that is produced by the reader’s interpretation of the theme.
Topic-driven critical inquiries produce descriptive knowledge of how memory is
constructed in literary texts and how the texts use memory to challenge history, reclaim
the present, and imagine the future. Theme-driven creative inquiries produce direct
knowledge of the collective nature of memory through an invitation to become
acquainted with the work of literary fiction that is presented. The difference is between
Wilson’s (1983) concepts of “first-hand” and “second-hand” knowledge. Knowledge is
of two types: that which results from a person’s first-hand experience, the body of one’s
own ideas as framing one’s encounters with the world, or knowledge as gained secondhand by depending on cognitive authorities for knowledge outside the range of direct
experience (Wilson, 1983). Critical topic-thesis literary inquiries produce second-hand
knowledge, subject to scholars’ critical consideration of whether cognitive authority can
be conferred onto the dissertation authors and their research. Creative themeinterpretation literary inquiries produce texts that are sources of first-hand knowledge. In

223
reading and interpreting the novels and short stories, readers are experiencing memory
themselves and thus constructing knowledge of the nature of memory in an unmediated,
direct fashion.
7.4.4 Summary of literature question forms. Two question forms are found in
literature, corresponding to two forms of inquiry. Topics provide an epistemic focus for
the construction of a critical argument about memory’s functions and uses in literary texts.
Themes provide an epistemic focus for the production of a creative work of fiction about
the nature of memory, which is then subject to interpretation by the readers. The two
epistemic question-answer structures and their corresponding content produce a question
profile of the literature domain’s approach to memory as two sides of the same coin:
criticism and creation.

7.5 Computer engineering
Two epistemic question forms are identified in the computer engineering abstracts
about memory: goal and hypothesis (Table 56). The goal question form provides a
framework for inquiry in relation to which all of the other components of inquiry are
identified and defined. A single anomalous dissertation, incorrectly categorized as
belonging to the computer engineering domain, employs the hypothesis form.

Table 56. Computer engineering: Question forms
7.5.1 Goal form. Nineteen of the twenty abstracts in this domain present the
question in the epistemic form of a goal. The goal question form has already been
discussed as describing a small subset of neuroscience dissertations about research and
clinical treatment of memory, but will be further discussed here, as it is the sole form,

224
excepting one outlier, employed in the computer engineering sample. The goal is the
central component in computer engineering abstracts, serving as the organizing
component in relation to which the other components of inquiry are defined. Table 57
shows the structure of a typical computer engineering abstract.
CE10: Low-power methodology for fault tolerant nanoscale memory design
Problem
Millions of mobile devices are being activated and used every single day. For such
devices, energy efficient operation is very important; low-power operation enables not
only long battery time but also improves energy efficiency of the servers that
communicate with the mobile devices. However, reduced noise margin due to low-power
operation and process variation due to nano-scale transistor feature sizes increase the
number of errors in both mobile and server devices. Thus, low-power issues and
reliability are strongly related.
Goal
This work focuses on reliable, low-power methodologies for SRAM memories. It is
the first to consider SRAM cell optimization for power and reliability
simultaneously.
Tool
The main contributions are the following. To guide parametric hard faults, this work
addresses energy optimality and yield considering redundant spare rows and columns.
This work also describes a method for soft error tolerant low-power memory design using
an architectural technique to avoid Multiple Bit Upset (MBU) at low voltages. Then
methods using dynamic voltage scaling for soft error tolerant low-power memory designs
are investigated.
Evaluation
This thesis results in the improvement of memory power consumption and increases the
reliability of memory arrays. Using cell optimization, redundancy utilization, interleaving
techniques, and adaptive dynamic voltage scaling, memory reliability is improved and
power reduction is reduced by 10%-40% depending on the method applied without
sacrificing error tolerance.

Table 57. Computer engineering: Structure of a goal abstract
Each component of the abstract is described here in relation to the epistemic nature of the
goal.
7.5.1.1 Problem. A problem states the topic of inquiry, whether existing in the
scholarly literature, in theory, or in practice, a condition to be improved upon or a
difficulty to be overcome in order to attain some desired end goal or state; it is an
epistemic obstacle to greater knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The central
problem regarding memory that computer engineering research attempts to solve is, how
should computer memory be optimized? Typically, the specific formulation of the
problem is expressed in terms of limitations in the current memory technologies or

225
inefficiencies in their implementation in the memory hierarchy. In Table 57, the problem
is that low-power operations and process variation due to nano-scale transistor feature
sizes leads to increased errors in mobile and server devices. Unlike in the neuroscience
domain, where problems may be implicit in the statement of goals, the computer
engineering dissertations explicitly state the problem that they are addressing in specific
detail, outlining the real-world computing use case and the ways in which the memory
system is preventing optimal computing performance. The precise formulation of the
question as a problem serves as the frame for the statement of the goal.
7.5.1.2 Goal. A goal is an aim or desired result that the researcher is setting out
to achieve through the research, formulated in relation to an epistemic obstacle that the
domain faces in pursuing knowledge of a memory-related phenomenon. All of the
computer engineering abstracts are variations on the desired outcome of optimized
memory, defined according to the particular type of computing device and use case
targeted for study. The specific goal, or desired outcome, that guides the inquiry is
formulated in relation to the particular use case that constitutes the problem, as well as
the approach to the problem. The example in Table 57 asks, what are reliable, low-power
methodologies for SRAM memories? The memory-related goal is stated relative to the
obstacle: as finding a way to maximize low-power operation while minimizing the errors
(maintaining reliability) that accompany the technology. The goal is to optimize memory
while minimizing power consumption and maximizing reliability. Other examples of
goals are: to optimize on-chip memory of embedded systems (CE17); to optimize
performance and energy of DRAM memory systems (CE11); or to optimize power and
reliability of SRAM cell memory simultaneously (CE10). The computer engineering

226
questions presenting as goals are indicated in Appendix C. The what- and howquestions can be converted to goals in the form of to- statements. In CE18 the question is,
“what is the behavior of the buffer-on-board memory system?” which can also be stated
as a goal: “To determine the behavior of the buffer-on-board memory system.”).
7.5.1.3 Tool. Questions presented in the epistemic form of a goal are answered
or responded to by the development of a tool to overcome the problem. Computer
engineering problems demand solutions, in the form of the design of tools or techniques
for optimizing memory. In Table 57, the techniques developed to solve the problem of
low power, high reliability memory for mobile devices are: cell optimization, redundancy
utilization, interleaving techniques, and adaptive dynamic voltage scaling. The solution is
framed directly in response to the formulation of the problem statement, describing
several of its methods as “soft error tolerant low-power memory design.”
7.5.1.4 Evaluation. Finally, evaluation of the proposed tool, whether the goal
has been achieved and the epistemic problem is resolved, is reported. Does the solution
maximize low-power operation and minimize errors, compared to the current baseline
system performance? Yes, “memory reliability is improved and power reduction is
reduced by 10%-40% depending on the method applied without sacrificing error
tolerance.” By the criteria set forth in the statement of the problem, the tool is validated.
7.5.1.5 Summary of goal form. Computer engineering dissertations organize
inquiry around a goal that emerges from the memory-related problem, an epistemic
obstacle to attaining desired knowledge of memory. In response to the goal, a tool is
developed, implemented, and evaluated for whether and how it meets the goal and moves
towards resolving the problem.

227
7.5.2 Hypothesis form. One dissertation abstract in the computer engineering
sample presents its question in the form of a hypothesis and its answer in the form of
confirmation/disconfirmation of the hypothesis. CE13 asks whether the atomic
locomotion movements in a virtual reality system with a semi-natural locomotion
interface require a user's spatial cognitive resources, measured in terms of working
memory. The analysis of question content in Chapter Six identifies this dissertation as an
outlier, posing a query of (11) correlation about semi-natural locomotion and spatial
cognitive resources (working memory) while the rest of the sample poses queries of (6)
rationale/explication about memory optimization. An interview with the researcher
confirms that he does not identify as belonging to the computer engineering domain. The
current analysis of question form also identified this dissertation as an outlier, presenting
the question and answer in the epistemic structure of a hypothesisconfirmation/disconfirmation inquiry, whereas the rest of the sample presents as
problem-solution inquiry. This suggests that the epistemic form is another useful
measure against which questions can be compared in relation to knowledge domain
boundaries.
7.5.3 Discussion. The single form in which computer engineering questions
about memory are presented is the goal. The pairing of question form and content
produces a question profile of the computer engineering domain’s research about
memory according to what is being asked and how (Table 58).

Table 58. Computer engineering: Question profile
Computer engineering research about memory formulates questions as queries of (6)
rationale/explication about memory optimization, further subcategorized as relating to
memory systems, memory technologies, memory models, and memory circuits. In
response to the queries of (6) rationale/explication, the research must explain how the
optimization tools and instruments function to overcome the specific obstacles to
memory optimization for the use case in question.
As discussed in the context of the neuroscience domain, goals articulate the
desired result that the researcher is setting out to achieve in order to overcome the
epistemic obstacle that the domain faces, as presented in the problem. The basic problem
in computer engineering is that the rate at which processor technology is developing is
not matched by innovations in memory systems, which limits the overall performance of
the computer system. The goal of the research is thus to optimize memory for varied use
cases. The appropriate form of reply to a goal is the development of a tool that will
achieve the goal. Together, the goal-tool form of question and answer structure
prescriptive inquiry. This form of inquiry emerges from a specific use case and aims to
resolve the problem; its interest is in the optimal application of memory rather than the
knowledge of memory itself. Given the time-bound nature of the goals, in terms of the
use cases they refer to and the currency of the technologies, the goal-tool form of inquiry
does not produce incremental knowledge of computing memory in the form of general
principles and abstract truths, but case-based knowledge that is not transferable to other
use scenarios. As computer memory technologies and systems continue to evolve and the

229
societal context and technological infrastructure for computing changes, the knowledge
produced by the problem-solution inquiries will become historical and obsolete.
7.5.4 Summary of computer engineering forms. One question form is
identified in the computer engineering sample. Computer engineers formulate questions
in the form of a goal, an aim or desired result that the researcher is setting out to achieve
in order to overcome an epistemic obstacle towards resolution of a problem. The
appropriate response is to develop a tool to achieve the goal, which should be
demonstrated by its evaluation. Inquiries utilizing the goal-tool structure of inquiry
produce prescriptive knowledge of how to solve the problem of memory optimization, a
rationale for the tool proposed to attain the goal.

7.6 Comparing forms of domains’ questions about “memory”
Table 59 summarizes the epistemic forms that questions take in the sample of
neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering research on “memory.” Each form
indicates norms of how to ask and answer questions, which process, of expressing and
resolving an indeterminate situation, constitutes inquiry and the production of knowledge.

Table 59. “Memory”-related question forms in three domains
Each domain is distinct in its presentation of the question, with only one form, goal,
utilized in more than one domain. Neuroscience presents questions in the form of
research questions, representing the gapped epistemic picture, or known unknowns that
the domain is trying to fill about memory as a neuroscientific phenomenon. It also

230
presents questions in the form of hypotheses, which are proposed answers to fill the
indeterminate epistemic picture that the domain has of the relationships between memory
and other phenomena of impairment or enhancement. Finally, neuroscience presents
questions in the form of goals, desired aims related to overcoming epistemic obstacles
that prevent the resolution of memory-related research and clinical problems. Together,
the three forms indicate that neuroscience asks about memory by: identifying the
boundary of what is known and extending it by posing research questions that organize
series of experiments about the “known unknowns”; proposing hypotheses to examine the
relationship between memory and phenomena that may impair, enhance, or otherwise
effect it; and establishing goals to overcome obstacles to studying memory and treating
memory-related diseases and disorders. The form of the question thus conveys
expectations for what constitutes an answer, including the mode of its production and
form of presentation. The research questions solicit findings to fill the gapped epistemic
picture, hypotheses are confirmed or disconfirmed, and goals are met by the development
of tools to overcome the epistemic obstacle.
In the question forms, we see traces of what one dissertation author (N29)
describes about neuroscience as an area of study: that it has theoretical and
methodological roots in psychology, here represented by the hypothesisconfirmation/disconfirmation inquiries about the relation between memory and other
phenomena of impairment and enhancement, but has rapidly developed as its own field of
study due to the advances and increased accessibility of brain scanning technologies such
as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
represented by the research question-finding structure of inquiry. The central role that

231
technology plays in studying the vastly complex human brain is reflected in the small
subset of goal-tool inquiries that are interested in memory models or instruments for
research.
The literature domain presents questions in the form of memory-related topics, a
manner of presenting the gapped epistemic picture in a domain that produces knowledge
of memory selectively, rather than incrementally as neuroscience does by posing research
questions. The topic serves to provide an epistemic focus for the construction of a critical
argument built upon analysis of literary texts and culminating in the thesis statement. A
small subset of creative writing dissertations pose questions in the form of memoryrelated themes, which represent a broader and more vague gapped epistemic picture that
gives greater allowance for writers to explore the literary nature of memory. Themes
convey that knowledge is produced first-hand, by the reader’s interpretations of the
themes based on direct engagement with the text. At the domain level, the two forms
delineate two ways of asking about memory in literature: critically, by framing inquiry as
an argument about what certain literary texts say about memory, or creatively, by making
inquiry a relation between the author’s production of a text with memory-related themes
and a reader’s interpretation of the textual themes.
Computer engineering uniformly presents its questions in the form of goals, aims
or desired results for overcoming epistemic obstacles to the study of memory or its
clinical treatment. A goal provides an actionable framework for the development of a
tool that overcomes the obstacle to the desired state of about memory. As computer
engineering is concerned with the practical application of computer memory, mainly how
to optimize memory systems for higher computing performance, setting a goal provides

232
the framework for the development of optimization techniques and criteria for their
evaluation.
Question content is practically limitless in its possible query-subject categories,
but question form is likely limited to a small number of variants, of which we have
identified five: research question, hypothesis, goal, topic, and theme. Some, if not all, of
these forms are certainly not limited to the domains in which we have identified them.
For instance, goals are identified as present in neuroscience and computer engineering
and are likely to be found in other practically oriented domains or sub-domains.
Research questions and hypotheses are common to all natural sciences and many social
science inquiries. It is certain that question form itself will not differentiate a large mixed
sample into distinct domains, but in conjunction with question content, it can help to
group like research with like on the basis of the method of inquiry in addition to the
subject. In combination with question content, form adds a dimension of complexity to
the characterization of a domain’s questions.
By thinking of other contrasting domains, a few possible forms may be derived:
mathematical conjectures, points of law in jurisprudence, events in journalism. An
analysis of domains more similar to each other than the ones chosen here may reveal that
the epistemic forms can be characterized more finely than the broad characterization of
forms in the current study. For instance, hypotheses may be more finely characterized
according to direction (positive, neutral, negative), or whether simple (one dependent and
independent variable) or complex (multiple independent or dependent variables).
Question form, like question content, is relative to the sample, which is taken as an
indication of validity of this comparative method of analysis rather than a challenge to its

233
reliability.
This treatment of domains’ question formulations as having content and form
presents a more specific picture of the nature of inquiry than subject- or topic- oriented
descriptions, particularly as it closely relates to methodology. Palmer (2005) notes the
importance of considering user groups relative to “types of research problems” when
considering how to define a domain:
But, if we are to forge ahead with a domain orientation, it would be advantageous
to address the question of gauge, to ask if there are optimal network parameters or
ways of defining a user group that are particularly cogent for given types of
research problems. For example, understanding the information use patterns of
certain cross-domain groupings based on practices and roles
(experimentalists/modelers rather than biophysicists; authors of texts/text analysts
rather than literary scholars) can help inform the design of collaborative
information environments (p. 1140).
Palmer specifically notes that a focus on the type of research problem may distinguish
authors of texts from text analysts, rather than grouping them together as literary scholars.
Our analysis of question forms in literature confirms this precise differentiation: authors
engage in theme-interpretation inquiry that is creative in nature, while literary critics
engage in topic-thesis inquiry that is critical in nature. Classifying domains’ question
formulations according to form, in addition to content, adds an epistemological
dimension to the primarily ontological definition of knowledge domains.

7.7 Summary of findings and conclusion
The identification of question forms in this chapter responds to research questions

234
3a, 3b, and 5a: what are the forms of the domains’ question formulations take, how do
they compare, and what information do the comparisons convey about how to answer?
As with the comparative analysis of question content in Chapter Six, the comparative
analysis of question form produces both theoretical and empirical findings. Chapter Six
demonstrated a theoretical conception of the question in which question content
communicates the domain’s indeterminate situations relative to the phenomenon of
interest through the formulation of subject and query, or what the inquiry is about. This
chapter further demonstrates that question form conveys how inquiry is organized or
components of inquiry are defined, as well as illustrating the relationships among the
components of inquiry. Question form and answer form together frame the epistemic
structure for inquiry. Adapting Derr’s (1982) definition of questions as linguistic devices
or tools used to make epistemic determinations about the world to the social
epistemological context of knowledge domains, question forms are not linguistic devices
or tools, but epistemic devices or tools used to make epistemic determinations about the
indeterminate situations identified by the question content. The importance of the
question as a theoretical concept in LIS is reasserted by showing the ability of the
question to convey information about what the answer should be about, but also about
how the answer should be produced.
Chief among the empirical findings, comparison of the dissertation research about
“memory” in neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering for the epistemic forms
in which questions are presented leads to the identification of five different forms that, in
conjunction with the query-subject descriptors of question content, produce question
profiles of each of the domains. Neuroscience produces descriptive knowledge of

235
memory as a neuroscientific phenomenon through research question-finding inquiries,
and determinative knowledge through hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation inquiries
of the effects of phenomena of impairment and enhancement. A small subset of the
neuroscience research also produced prescriptive knowledge through goal-tool inquiries
about memory models and instruments. Literature is a dual-sided coin, with critical
knowledge of how memory is constructed in and used by literary texts being produced by
topic-thesis inquiries and creative knowledge of memory itself being produced by themeinterpretation inquiries. Computer engineering produces prescriptive knowledge of
memory optimizations for various use cases through goal-tool inquiries. Each question
form indicates a different approach to inquiry and the production of knowledge, a
different way of “seeing” memory.
Dillon (1990) says that to understand the question, one must understand the
answer that follows and the assumptions that precede it. Having analyzed the content and
form of questions and what they indicate about the answers that follow in Chapters Six
and Seven, we now proceed to ask what the question formulations convey about the
assumptions that precede the questions and what they indicate about knowledge domains
as the context for inquiry.

236

CHAPTER 8: QUESTIONS’ ASSUMPTIONS

8.1 Introduction
Questions have a fundamental relationship to information (Mackay, 1969;
Halloran, 1983) and relevance (Brożek, 2011), but research on questions has long been
thwarted by an essential paradox: in order to ask a question, one must know what can be
known (Flammer, 1981). This dissertation proposes that the question paradox is a
product of the cognitive view of questions as indications of individuals’ information
needs that can be resolved by recasting questions as social epistemological tools of
inquiry. In the social epistemological paradigm, questions are defined as tools used to
make epistemic determinations about the world (Derr, 1982) within the context of
knowledge domains. Chapters Five, Six and Seven identify the question formulations
present in neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering dissertation research about
“memory,” showing that the domains can be differentiated by the content and form of
their questions, or what and how they ask about “memory,” and that content and form
convey information about what and how to answer. Each domain is shown to have a
distinct question profile, composed of categories of question formulations according to
content, the indeterminate situations motivating inquiry, and form, the structure for
inquiry.
This chapter addresses research questions 4b and 5b about questions’
assumptions: what information do the comparisons between questions contents and forms
convey about the assumptions that precede the questions? Dillon (1990) describes the
practice of questioning as comprised of three ordered elements, each comprised of an act

237
(of utterance) and a sentence: assumptions, questions, and answers. Having considered
questions and answers in the analyses of content and form in Chapters Six and Seven, we
now turn to the consideration of assumptions, those presumptions or presuppositions that
the questioner is communicating by the question and the asking of it (Dillon, 1990). In
this chapter, the differences in domains’ question content and form are compared in order
to make visible the implicit assumptions of each knowledge domain relative to the
production of knowledge about “memory.”

8.2 Question content and ontological commitments
In the terms of Kearsley’s (1976) insight, that questions convey information not
just request it, what information is being conveyed by the domains’ question content
about the assumptions that precede the questions? Comparative analysis of the querysubject pairings describing neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering questions
about “memory” suggests that question content conveys ontological commitments: about
what can be known about “memory”; its substance, features and relations as the object of
research. Knowledge domains are normally defined implicitly by their ontological
theories, or theories of what objects exist in the world (Hjørland, 2010). The formulation
of question content relies upon the belief in the existence of the objects or phenomena in
the world comprising the subject and that the type of determination being made about the
objects can be made or known. Question content thus communicates ontological
commitments to the existence of certain classes of objects or phenomena with certain
types of features and relations between them and other objects or phenomena. Question
content conveys information about domains’ ontological beliefs.

238
Derr’s (1984) assertion, that questions have “conceptual presuppositions,” which
are “logically antecedent conditions of questions” (p. 187), can be interpreted as an
attempt to identify the ontological commitments of the question for what they indicate
about what constitutes a relevant answer. Derr (1984) lists eight types of conceptual
presuppositions: existence, identity, properties, relation, number, location, time and
action. Dillon’s (1984) more extensive and ordered classification scheme of research
questions (Table 25) includes the first four of Derr’s classes, while the remaining four
can be subsumed into the category of “properties.” The types of conceptual
presuppositions (Derr, 1982) and classes of logical antecedents (Dillon, 1984) are of
interest for what they indicate to information retrieval systems designers about what
constitutes a relevant answer to the posed question. The current analysis of the
ontological commitments indicated by question content is of interest for what they
indicate about the domains’ construction of “memory” as an object of research. Guba
and Lincoln (1994) state the central ontological question as, “what is the form and nature
of reality and, therefore, what is there that can be known about it?” (p. 108). In question
terms, one could ask, “what is the form and nature of reality and, therefore, what
questions can be asked about it?” Or, conversely, “what questions are being asked, and
therefore, what can we infer about the form and nature of reality?” In the current analytic
scheme, the question becomes “what query-subject pairings are being posed, and
therefore, what can we infer about the form and nature of reality in the domain?”
Each of the query-subject pairings within a domain will be discussed in terms of
the ontological commitments of the question content category, or what information the
category conveys about what “memory” is – its entities, features, and relations. A

239
summary description will be given of the domain’s construction of “memory” as an
ontological object of study. Finally, the three domain constructions of “memory” will be
compared in order to make more visible the implicit ontological commitments of the
domains that constrain the types of indeterminate situations that are expressed through
the question content.
8.2.1 Neuroscience. The six main query-subject pairings and the questions
occupying each pairing can be found in Appendix C, Tables 1 to 3. Overall, the main
query-subject pairings utilized in the neuroscience approach to memory indicate
ontological commitments to memory as: material, processual, multiple and localized in
structure, and malleable.
8.2.1.1 Memory as material. Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix C list the
neuroscientific questions posing first-order (3) substance/definition – neural correlates of
memory and (4) character/description – role of X in memory questions, where X is
defined at the anatomical or neuronal level. These questions are ontologically committed
to memory as being of material substance, composed of the firing of electro-chemical
signals between neurons, the nerve cells of the brain. Each type of memory, whether
performed as the recitation of historical facts (semantic memory) or autobiographical
events (episodic memory), riding a bicycle (procedural memory), or salivating at the
ringing of a dinner bell (associative learning) can be associated with patterns of neural
activity. Neural activity is studied at the anatomical level of the structures that make up
the memory centers of the brain, which is measured as patterns of electrical signals
throughout the brain, particularly the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum, as
well as at the neuronal level of the movement of chemical neurotransmitters between

240
cells. The taxonomy of memory types that have been identified as having distinct neural
correlates is shown in Figure 2, with the bottom row identifying the anatomical loci of the
type of memory above.

Figure 2. Memory systems of the brain and their anatomical loci (adapted from
Squire, 2004)
This classification of memory was established based on a long history of empirical work
and discussion (Squire & Wixted, 2011), but is not fixed; it represents current domain
understanding of the organization of memory, which is subject to change. Nevertheless,
it illustrates the biological or material basis of memory, that the different classes of
memory are distinguished by their physical location in the brain. At the neuronal level,
(4) character/description – role of X in memory questions produce descriptive knowledge
of genes and their production of the proteins that enable memory and learning. The
questions are likewise ontologically committed to the materiality of memory; memory is
a neurobiological process that occurs at the neuronal level of the human brain.
8.2.1.3 Memory as process. The (4) character/description – neural mechanisms
of memory questions (Appendix C, Table 3) are ontologically committed to memory as a
process of construction, not as a static object that exists in the brain. The questions in
this query-subject pairing seek to define the neural mechanisms of information

241
processing by which acquisition, storage, and recall of memories occur. They construct
memory not as an object to be apprehended in a static state, akin to a file that is filed
away and pulled out when needed, but as constructive process, occurring in stages of
encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, and subject to additional processes such as
updating and extinction. As a process, memory is subject to distortion, interference,
conflicting signals, and other forces; the mechanisms of these forces constitute the
subject of this subset of questions.
8.2.1.4 Memory as localized and multiple. Neuroscientific (3)
substance/definition – neural correlates of memory and (4) character/description – role
of X in memory questions (Appendix C, Tables 1 and 2) assume that memory is not a
unitary system, but comprised of multiple memory systems, each centrally localized in
different anatomical structures as represented in Figure 2. This understanding can be
traced back to the seminal case of patient H. M., whose case is often cited as ushering in
the modern era of memory research (Squire, 2004). After undergoing an experimental
neurosurgical procedure to remove his hippocampi in an attempt to control epileptic
seizures, H. M. suffered from a type of amnesia in which he could not make new
memories, but did retain his memories from before the surgery and also retained his other
perceptual and cognitive abilities. Extensive research on the case of H. M. and other
related research has led to the knowledge that there are multiple types of memory
(semantic, episodic, procedural, etc.), localized in different anatomical structures of the
brain (hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, etc.) and distinct from each other, such that
injury to an area of the brain affecting one type of memory does not affect other types.

242
8.2.1.4 Memory as plastic. The (13) biconditionality – Y and memory questions
(Appendix C, Tables 4 and 5) are ontologically committed to memory as a plastic process.
These questions presume that memory can be impaired by conditions that affect the brain
such as neurodegenerative diseases and disorders, traumatic brain injury, and the natural
effects of age. As a material phenomenon grounded in the biological substrate of the
brain, injury to or degeneration of the brain negatively impacts memory. Conversely,
neuroscience now also knows that the synaptic connections that form memories are
plastic in nature and can be strengthened by cognitive interventions: strategies of selfreferential imagination (N20), emotion regulation during autobiographical recall (N27),
reward and punishment motivation (N42; N53). Others interventions are
pharmacological in nature, such as the effect of amphetamines on emotional memory
(N4), alcohol on dentate gyrus dependent learning and memory (N7), and chronic
treatment with serotonin on retention and efficiency of rule-guided behavior (N13).
These questions are ontologically committed to memory as affected by cognitive
processes and biochemical substances, with the effect being observable in behavioral,
neuropsychological, biochemical, and neurological terms. The assumption behind these
questions is that memory is not a static object, but a plastic process, one that can be
influenced by interventions that capitalize upon existing neurocognitive knowledge of
learning and memory.
8.2.1.5 Summary. The content of neuroscientific questions about memory
construct memory as a material phenomenon, reducible to biological events, patterns of
electrical signals between neurons and the expression of proteins. Memory is not unitary,
but composed of multiple memory systems, with each type being localized in different

243
anatomical structures. Rather than a static object to be filed away, memory is a plastic
process of acquisition, storage, and retrieval, which can be impaired or enhanced by other
phenomena that impact the brain. These are the ontological assumptions about memory
that are conveyed by the content of neuroscience questions.
8.2.2 Literature. Tables 7 and 8 in Appendix C list the questions in the five main
query-subject pairing categories of question content in the literature sample of
dissertation research about memory. The query-subject pairings indicate that the literary
approach to memory is ontologically committed to: memory as abstract, memory as an
act, and memory as subjective.
8.2.2.1 Memory as abstract. Whereas the neuroscientific conception of memory
can be reduced to material, biological events, literature conceives of memory as an
entirely abstract phenomenon. Literature questions about memory construct “memory”
as something that exists entirely in the minds and imaginations of individuals, with no
material substance or shape. This is best evidenced by how literary questions treat
memory as crossing physical boundaries of time and space. Memories can be shared by
individuals of many generations within a family (L16; L17), among groups of people in
different times and places with shared experiences such as those of enslavement (L12;
L15) or colonial domination (L4; L8). They can also be shared among persons with
common historical contexts, such as those having grown up during Fascism (L5; L19), or
even more broadly, those with a cultural knowledge of Italian classical culture (L6) or the
events of Mexican independence (L20). Material artifacts, such letters, diaries, other
evocative objects, or physical environments may serve as triggers to memory or attempts

244
to capture or preserve memories, but memory itself exists apart from the material objects,
as an abstract phenomenon.
8.2.2.2 Memory as act. The literary questions about memory are ontologically
committed to the act of memory, where to remember the past is to accomplish something
in the present. The (6) rationale/explication – literary use of memory (to challenge
historical memory) questions construct memory as a critical act that serves as a means to
reclaim or reassert one’s identity or truth against the power of the official historical
account. Memories do not objectively exist but are produced by some person or group of
persons, whose act of remembering and manner of remembrance is a choice, not a
deterministic outcome of personal or historical events. Literary texts can retrieve
memories that have been lost or forgotten in official history (L10), challenge the narrative
of the past (L2), and create alternate and competing memories (L5). Through these uses
of memory in literary texts, often by those marginalized or oppressed by history, memory
serves as a corrective tool applied to official historical narratives.
The (6) rationale/explication – literary use of memory (to negotiate trauma)
questions are ontologically committed to memory as reconstructive in nature, used to
“negotiate the fragmentation that characterizes the traumatic aftermath” (L1) or to
“renegotiate the reality of the past, present, and future” (L15). In choosing how and what
to remember of one’s past trauma, the victim reclaims agency, which loss is often the
defining feature of a traumatic event. In setting the terms of remembrance, the victim’s
sense of self is reconstructed in relation to the trauma so that its power can be dissipated.
8.2.2.3 Memory as subjective. The literary construction of question content is
ontologically committed to memory as requiring subjects, agents of remembrance who

245
continually face the choice of whether and how to remember or forget individual or
collective experiences. The agents of memory exist in specific places and times:
contemporary Spain and Italy, post-Fascism, post-liberation Zimbabwe, post-apartheid
South Africa, and Mexico during centenary and bicentenary commemorations of
Mexico’s independence. Their memories are subject to their location in time and space:
the constructions of gender (L3; L15; L16) and race (L4), possession or lack of power
(L8; L12), ethnic identities (L2), cultural history (L5; L6; L9; L18; L19; L20), and place
(L17). Agents can assert their agency by choosing how to wield memory relative to their
experience and location: to memorialize trauma, disrupt forgetting, renegotiate reality, or
create counter-memories. Through these actions, agents reclaim, renegotiate, and
reposition their identities with relation not only to the past, but the present and future.
8.2.2.4 Summary. Literature questions are ontologically committed to memory as
an abstract phenomenon, existing in the minds of individuals, ethic or cultural groups,
generations of families, and nations across the concrete boundaries of space and time.
Memory is action-oriented, utilized to accomplish things by the agents of remembrance:
to disrupt forgetting, to reclaim one’s agency after a traumatic event, to counter the
dominant historical record, to create alternate realities. Above all, the literary
construction of memory is from the perspective of some specific person or group.
Memory requires a subject, whose identity, history, needs and desires shape the nature of
the memory and the manner of its application.
8.2.3 Computer engineering. The questions in the computer engineering sample
are found in Appendix C, Table 11. Computer engineering question content indicates

246
that the domain is ontologically committed to memory as: abstract process and material
object; hierarchically structured; and inherently limited in nature.
8.2.3.1 Memory as abstract process and material object. Computer engineering
(6) rationale/explication – memory optimization questions are ontologically committed to
memory as both abstract process and material object. Computer memory systems require
both hardware and software, which is depicted by the common metaphor of hardware as
machinery and software as instructions; both are required for the machine to run.
Software programs are mathematical and logic-driven sets of instructions, based upon
models of expected behavior, that execute every action, from monitoring the computer’s
functionality and booting the operating system to using applications and saving files. A
piece of code serves as instructions that initiate a computing process. Yet memory is also
constituted of hardware, in the form of the memory technologies, material objects that
exist internal, and sometimes external, to the computing processing unit. The term
“memory” is used to refer to both the hardware components of the memory system and
the software that runs the system. The abstract process relies upon the material object,
while the material object is designed for the abstract process.
8.2.3.3 Memory as a hierarchical system. The (6) rationale/explication –
memory optimization questions are ontologically committed to memory as organized into
a hierarchical system, with “memory” referring to both the entire system and its
component parts. Computer memory systems are hierarchies of storage devices
differentiated primarily defined by speed, measured in terms of how many cycles it takes
to execute an instruction. The basic memory hierarchy is comprised of, from fastest to
slowest: CPU registers, caches, main memory, and disks (Figure 3).

247

Figure 3. Computer memory hierarchy
Specific memory technologies occupy the levels of the hierarchy at the intersection of the
axes of cost per byte and access speed, versus capacity. A few questions approach the
issue of optimization at the level of the entire memory system, while most pursue
optimization by focusing on a specific memory technology at some level of the hierarchy,
mostly at the level of main memory technologies such as SRAM or DRAM. Whether by
analysis of the entire memory system, proposals for new memory system configurations,
or specific optimization techniques for existing systems, the questions are all
ontologically committed to the basic hierarchical structure and a belief in its potentially
optimized ideal state.
8.2.3.4 Memory as inherently limited. The (6) rationale/explication – memory
optimization questions are ontologically committed to the inverse relationship between
memory capacity and speed, as depicted in Figure 3. The vertical and horizontal axes at
which the levels of the memory hierarchy are located place the two main desirable
characteristics of memory in tension with each other. Memory technologies with large
capacity are slower, while those with smaller capacity are faster. The top tier of the
memory hierarchy represents a small amount of fast, expensive memory, while the

248
bottom tier represents a large amount of slow, cheap memory. The inverse relationship
between capacity and speed necessitates the memory hierarchy, the computing
architecture in which different types of memory are called upon to perform different
memory tasks, depending upon the speed and capacity requirements. Computer
engineering questions essentially establish the requirements for building memory systems
that reflect the desired balance between capacity and speed for the particular use case
scenario in the form of additional constraints or requirements such as cost (CE1, CE4,
CE16), power consumption (CE1, CE2, CE9), temperature (CE11; CE16), ease of
programming (CE3), and reliability (CE10, CE18).
8.2.3.4 Summary. Computer engineering question content constructs memory as
both abstract process and material object, reflecting the origins of computer engineering
as a hybrid of the computer science and engineering domains. The question content also
indicates an ontological commitment to memory as hierarchically structured, comprised
of many types of memory with inherent limits, encapsulated by the inversely proportional
relationship between memory technologies’ capacity and speed.
8.2.4 Domain comparisons. Comparison of the ontological commitments of
domains’ questions about “memory” indicates that neuroscience, literature, and computer
engineering have distinct ontological assumptions about “memory” as a topic of research.
The ontological commitments of each domains’ question formulations are summarized in
Table 60 and further discussed in terms of what they indicate about the domains’ beliefs
related to: the substance and features of memory, their structure, the conditions of their
existence, and related phenomena.

Table 60. Ontological commitments of question content
8.2.4.1 Substance and features of memory. Comparison of the query-subject
pairings makes visible the differences between each domain’s definition of “memory,” of
its essential substance and qualities. At the most basic level, question content reveals
ontological commitments to the substance and features of memory. Neuroscience
conceives of memory as a material process. It has physical substance, taking the form of
neurons firing electrical signals across synapses, located in the anatomical structures of
the brain, and produced by the genetic expression of proteins. Memory is essentially a
biological event. Far from being an object-like picture of a moment to be filed away for
later retrieval, though, the question content indicates that neuroscience understands
memory as a continual process of encoding, consolidation, and recall, and even possible
extinction. Neuroscience questions presume that memory is malleable or plastic, that the
synaptic connections of memory can be strengthened by use or degraded by disuse or
injury. Furthermore, memory is distributed across different regions of the brain, not
stored in single location, according to type.
In the literature domain, memory is abstract in nature, functioning as an invisible
but real force shaping of the identities and histories of individuals and collectives. In
contrast to the neuroscientific conception, memory cannot be seen, measured, recorded,
or reduced to physical matter; it exists in the minds of those who seek to make sense of

250
their history and identity. The abstract substance of memory is, however, often
manifested in the concrete materiality of objects of commemoration or memorialization,
or the products of memory such as the literary texts analyzed and produced by the
domain. Literary memory is an action, wielded by agents to accomplish something in its
forgetting, denying, representing, challenging, reconstructing, or imagining the past.
Literature questions conceive of memory as subjective, as belonging to a specific subject
or agent of remembrance. The literary commitment to agency drives the literary
characterizations of memory as illusive, porous, and a site of contest.
The computer engineering domain question content conceives of memory as
material object. Computer memory takes the form of hardware devices – DRAM,
SRAM, disk drives, flash drives, etc. – that are physical, tangible objects. They can be
installed or removed from a computer system and require electrical currents running
through hardware components of the computer in order to execute the read/write
instructions. Memory is one component of the hardware that, along with software,
constitutes a computer system. Its substance is equally comprised of abstract processes
in the form of software, the machine-readable instructions that direct the deployment of
which memory devices are used for which tasks. Memory has many qualities, desirable
and undesirable, which are in constant tension – speed, capacity, cost, ease of
programming, volatility, robustness, power consumption, and proneness to error – that
can basically be reduced to two main, opposed qualities: capacity and speed.
8.2.4.2 Structure of memory. Analysis of question content reveals each domain
to have a distinct conception of the structure of memory, corresponding to the domain’s
definition of the substance of memory. Neuroscientific questions presume that memory is

251
structured according to the localized patterns of neural activity that are aligned with the
type of memory (Figure 2). Memory’s structure, its division between sensory, short term,
and long term, and the further division of long term memory into declarative and
nondeclarative, is subservient to the anatomical structure of the brain and its division of
labor. Computer engineering questions rely on the conception of memory as a hierarchy
of different types of memory technologies, each more or less suited to different types of
tasks. As depicted in Figure 3, the different types of memory within the hierarchy are
structured according to capacity and speed. Memory technologies that are high speed
have low capacity, while those with high capacity have low speed. This basic rule
necessitates the existence of the memory hierarchy, in which different types of memory
technologies are deployed for different types of tasks in order to optimize the
performance of the computer. Of the three domains’ questions, only those in the
literature domain do not indicate the structure of memory as a significant facet of the
phenomenon.
8.2.4.3 Relations. A subset of third-order neuroscience questions ask not about
memory itself, but the relations between memory and other phenomena, thus expressing
ontological commitments to the types of phenomena that are related to memory and the
nature of the relationships. In (12) conditionality – Y and memory questions, the
relations between memory and diseases and disorders, age, and traumatic brain injury,
are conditional relationships, meaning that impaired neural activity or performance of
memory is determined to be conditional to the presence or absence of the impairing
phenomena. The (13) biconditionality – Z and memory questions are committed to an

252
even stronger causal relationship between improved memory and phenomena of
enhancement, such as cognitive interventions or drugs.
Both the literature and the computer engineering abstracts indicate an general
ontological commitment to relations between “memory” and other phenomenon, but
these relations are not reflected in the content of the questions and are not the direct
object of study. For instance, a review of the literature domain’s questions suggests that
there is a presumed relationship between the phenomenon of memory and identity, as
well as between memory and history, but these relations remain general presumptions
and do not constitute the indeterminate situations that the inquiry is seeking to resolve.
Similarly, computer engineering questions presume a relationship between computer
memory and system performance, but this relationship is not the direct object of inquiry;
rather, the direct object of inquiry is the tools of memory optimization that seek to
improve memory and thus system performance.
8.2.4.4 Conditions of existence. The three domains’ question formulations about
“memory” can also be compared according to the conditions under which “memory”
exists. The content of neuroscientific questions indicates that memory requires neural
function. Neuroscience questions are interested in “healthy” or “normal” memory, or that
pattern of neural activity that characterizes memory in its unimpaired state, as well as the
relationship between phenomena and impaired or enhanced neural functioning. Neural
function, whether impaired, normal, or enhanced, is the basic condition of the existence
of neuroscientific memory.
The literature domain’s question content indicates that memory requires an agent
or subject to whom the memory belongs. The memory of an event is not unified,

253
objective, and factual, but multiple, subjective, and experiential. The existence of agency
in relation to memory dictates that individuals or groups must choose whether and how to
remember or forget, and opens up the phenomenon of as a site of contest and negotiation
between different agents or groups of agents. The dependence upon agency also allows
an elision and interchange between individuals and collectives, private and public
memories, acceptance and resistance, identity and history, truth and fantasy in literary
texts. Literary memory relies upon the agents of its remembrance.
The content of computer engineering questions indicates that computer memory
requires software and hardware to function. The individual memory technologies, the
hardware of the memory system, cannot run without software to coordinate its integration
into memory hierarchy and computer system as a whole. Likewise, the software exists
specific to the computer system and memory hierarchy that it is written or adapted for.
Both are required in order for computer memory, which is required for any and every
action, to function.
8.2.4.4 Discussion. Comparison of question content in neuroscience, literature,
and computer engineering makes visible the differences in the domain’s ontological
construction of and commitments regarding memory: its substance, features, structure,
and conditions of its existence. These differences support the notion that domains ask
different questions, according to content or what they ask, and that the differences in
question content convey the ontological differences regarding “memory” as an object of
research between the domains. Each knowledge domain’s perspective offers a specific
lens through which memory is viewed, or by which “memory” is seen.

254
At the same time, by considering multiple domains’ ontological constructions of
memory as represented by their question content, what emerges is a fuller picture of
“memory” than can be had from any single domain’s perspective. At times, differing
domains can even seem to speak to each other, in the sense that an existing approach or
conception in one domain seems to find its way into another domain, as a new line of
inquiry, or even an upending of the existing research direction. For instance, early
neuroscientific conceptions of “memory” adhered to the “file retrieval” metaphor, in
which memories were thought to be stored away likes files in a file cabinet, and
unproblematically retrieved when needed. At the same time, literary knowledge of
memory has long viewed “memory” as a changeable thing: unstable, subject to
manipulation, or simply incomplete. Neuroscience has since come to understand what
literature has long known: that memory is malleable, that they can be distorted by
intentional or unintentional misinformation, through the neural mechanisms of synaptic
plasticity, the strengthening or weakening the synapses across which neural connections
travel. While computer engineering research is concerned with computer memory rather
than human memory, one can reflect on the metaphorical relation between the two types
of memory, particularly as the creation and naming of computer memory is a product of
human activity, and even more so as the lines between humans and computers as separate
entities continue to blur. One can imagine lines of research about, as is already
represented in techno-futuristic films and novels, the ability to download knowledge into
human brains (the film, The Matrix), or the erasing of traumatic human memories (the
film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), or capturing an individual’s memories in
order for them to live on by being inserted in another form (Rudy Rucker’s novel,

255
Software). Different domains may speak to each other, either intentionally or
coincidentally, in a manner that produces novel directions for inquiry.
8.2.4.5 Summary. The comparison of domains’ questions, according to their
query-subject pairings, demonstrates that questions have ontological commitments about
memory’s substance, features, structures, relations, and conditions of existence. These
ontological commitments, derived from a comparative analysis of question content,
produce a picture of domain ontology relative to the state of knowledge about “memory”
in each domain. Neuroscience constructs memory as a biological process, multiple and
localized in structure, and subject to impairment or enhancement. The literary
construction of memory is of an abstract act, wielded by subjects in order to challenge
history, or reclaim or remake one’s identity. Computer memory is both material object
and abstract process, reflecting the substance of computers as hardware and software,
structured for maximum efficiency and optimal performance. Comparative analysis of
question content produces a profile of what each knowledge domain asks about “memory”
and the ontological commitments of those questions.
Simultaneously, the three knowledge domains’ conceptions produce knowledge
of “memory” as a multi-faceted phenomenon of inquiry: human and machine; resistant
yet always subject to change, systematic and structured, but also unordered and elusive.
The multi-domain topical approach that is taken by the current analysis is offered as a
means of relating different domains’ constructions of a shared topic of interest, a way of
communicating across discipline-specific languages in a manner that the proliferation of
multi- and inter-disciplinary centers, programs, and institutional structures of research

256
suggest is the current frontier of knowledge production and an important complement to
the production of deep subject-specific knowledge.

8.3 Question forms and epistemological presuppositions
While there are multiple query-subject categories of question content in
neuroscience and literature, the within-domain categories share similar ontological
commitments across domain categories. If differing within-domain categories of
question content share ontological commitments, what differentiates them from each
other? Within-domain categories of question content may share an ontological reality
even between the different indeterminate epistemic situations that constitute the question
content, but they differ according to how the indeterminate situation is to be resolved.
This is manifested in the form of domains’ questions about “memory.” Reflecting the
characteristics of the question as a device or tool for organizing inquiry (Mackay, 1960),
question forms are defined by how they structure the components of inquiry towards the
production of knowledge. They reflect how epistemic determinations are made,
providing a framework for the practices by which knowledge is deemed justified belief.
The epistemic form thus communicates the unstated domain assumptions about the nature
of producing and justifying knowledge, or the question’s epistemological presuppositions,
“assumptions about the grounds of knowledge – about how one might begin to
understand the world and communicate this as knowledge to fellow human beings”
(Burrell & Morgan, 1979, p. 2). These are the fundamental, most often unstated
assumptions about what can be known and how it is known, centered on the question,
“What is the nature of the relationship between the knower or would-be knower and what
can be known?” (Guba & Lincoln, 1994, p. 108). Other central questions include: What

257
are the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge? What are its sources,
structures, and limits? What makes justified beliefs justified?
Zwart (2008) demonstrates how this comparative epistemological perspective can
serve to highlight different ways of knowing in relation to the subject of “nature.” Zwart
compares the “epistemological profiles” or “styles” that characters in various works of
literature including Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, Ibsen’s play “The Wild Duck,” Jack
London’s The Call of the Wild, and Jules Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days,
exhibit in “knowing” plants, animals, and the natural environment: scientific,
experiential, and intuitive. Each epistemological profile allows nature to emerge only
under certain conditions, which methodological approach forces critical reflection on the
structure and reliability of knowledge forms. The comparative epistemological approach
is particularly apt for knowledge organization, which is by its definition concerned with
understanding the differences between knowledge domains’ in terms of the manner and
type of knowledge they produce in the context of organizing the knowledge products of
inquiry for intellectual access.
For a question to be valid, and able to be validly answered, its presuppositions
must be true; for this reason, one must know a question’s presuppositions, in order to
know whether the question is being validly answered (Dillon, 1990). Similar to the
determination of questions’ ontological commitments, questions’ epistemological
presuppositions are made highly visible in comparison to contrasting domains’ questions.
Questions’ epistemological presuppositions, along with the ontological commitments, are
what largely constitute the implicit dimension of the question that is the domain context.
As a linguistic tool or device, the epistemic forms are defined by their functions related to

258
the production of knowledge, chiefly in conveying the kinds of claims about memory that
can be made in reply to the question, what kind of evidence can be used to support the
claims, the kinds of warrant by which evidence may be linked to the claim, and the
manner of validating the answer. Each of the domains will be described according to the
epistemic forms of their questions and what the forms presuppose about the nature of:
“knowing” memory, evidence, and justification. The three domains’ constructions will
also be compared in order to make even more visible the epistemological presuppositions
that are communicated by the domains’ questions about “memory.”
8.3.1 Neuroscience. Tables 1 through 7 in Appendix C list the dissertation
questions in each question content category, with epistemic forms indicated in the last
column. Neuroscience presents its questions in three epistemic forms: research questions,
hypotheses, and goals. All three forms are grounded in the scientific method for
producing knowledge, a systematic method for investigating the natural world by making
empirical observations, posing questions in the form of hypotheses that potentially
explain the observations, testing hypotheses via experimentation, and analyzing the
results to form conclusions about the hypotheses. The question forms, when paired with
the forms of the answers, define three structures for inquiry that largely correspond to the
distinct content-driven areas of neuroscientific research about memory: research
question-finding inquiries produce knowledge by asking (3) substance/definition – neural
correlates of memory, (4) character/description – neural mechanisms of memory, and (4)
character/description – role of X in memory questions; goal-tool inquiries ask (6)
rationale/explication – memory models and instruments questions about the study and
clinical treatment of memory; and hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation inquiries ask

259
(12) conditionality – Y and memory and (13) biconditionality – Z and memory questions
about the relation between memory and phenomena of impairment or enhancement. The
three question forms of inquiry are distinguished by their epistemological presuppositions
about the nature of: “knowing” memory, evidence for knowledge claims, and justification
of answers.
8.3.1.1 Research question-finding presuppositions. Twenty-eight of the fiftyseven neuroscience dissertations present their questions in the form of a research
question, questions about a topic that are framed, based on a familiarity with the topic, as
a perceived knowledge gap or deficit of knowledge about the topic (Farrugia, Petrisor,
Farrokhyar, & Bhandari, 2010). The responses or answers to questions presented as
research questions take the form of findings that fill the epistemic gap or extend the
boundary identified in the research question. As a structure for inquiry, the research
question-finding form presupposes that knowledge of memory is obtained through
scientific observation, beginning with observations of (3) substance/definition about the
neural correlates of memory and progressing to observations of (4) character/description
about memory’s neural structures (role of X in memory) and the neural mechanisms of
memory. Memory is “observed” according to various methods for measuring biological
activity: neurophysiological data about how memory functions in the brain (N24; N50;
N28; N37; N3; N8); neuropsychological data concerning its cognitive and behavioral
manifestations (N5; N19; N29; N35; N39; N41); neuroanatomical data about how
memory is structured in the brain (N30); and sometimes a combination of methods (N38).
These observations are technologically enabled, relying on scientific instruments for
measuring the biological manifestations of memory such as functional magnetic

260
resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to measure blood flow or PET or CT scans to measure
electrical activity, and laboratory instruments for analyzing brain lesions.
The research question-finding structure for inquiry presupposes that experimental
results are the primary source of evidence supporting the truth status of the observational
findings. Given the technologically enabled nature of “seeing,” how does the scientist
know what constitutes an observation of memory? Experiments are conducted in order to
measure neural activity during a memory task and compare it to baseline resting neural
activity. If the difference between the two states of activity achieves statistical
significance, then what is seen achieves the status of an experimental observation of
memory. Research question-finding inquiries are structured as a series of experiments,
anywhere between two and six in number, that are organized as components or sequential
parts of one research design intended to make sense of a series of observations in a
manner that sheds light on the epistemic gap identified by the research question. The
following description of a research design demonstrates that the three experiments seek to
verify individual observations, which together produce a finding relative to the research
question, “What are the behavioral and neural variations in semantic memory retrieval?”
In three studies, we found evidence that while conceptual knowledge is grounded
in neural substrates, several factors contribute to variations in semantic memory
retrieval. In Chapter 2, we used the logic often used in neuroimaging studies of
semantic memory by demonstrating overlapping chromaticity effects (e.g., greater
response to colored than grayscale stimuli) in the left lingual gyrus for both color
perception and color knowledge. Chapter 3 investigated whether the mapping
between perception and memory varied across contexts and participants…. In

261
Chapter 4, we used a training paradigm to investigate the role of feature
diagnosticity (i.e., features that best distinguish between two otherwise similar
categories) in semantic representations…. Collectively, this work suggests that
semantic representations, integral to a memory system often thought of as free of
contextual constraints, contain meaningful variations across contexts, people, and
use. (N29)
In this example, each of the three component studies demonstrates some type of variation
in semantic memory retrieval: color variation, contexts and participants, and features.
Together, they demonstrate that while grounded in neural substrates, semantic memory
retrieval is subject to meaningful neural and behavioral variations. Each experimental
result determines whether what is being “seen” is a scientific observation of the
hypothesized memory-related phenomenon. The set of experimental results, interpreted
as a group, together offer as evidence supporting the finding as a response to the research
question.
These findings are justified as domain knowledge at two levels: at the level of the
individual investigation, according to whether they appropriately respond to the question
by filling the epistemic gap or pushing the epistemic boundary presented in the research
question; and at the level of domain knowledge, according to its coherence with what is
already known about the memory-related phenomenon. The difference is between
justification according to the internal logic of the inquiry and relative to the external state
of domain knowledge about the phenomenon. The finding, that semantic memory
retrieval differs across sources such as contexts, people, and use, is justified according to
the internal logic of the inquiry in that it fills the epistemic gap identified by the research

262
question, of characterizing the behavioral and neural variations of semantic memory
retrieval. At the level of external justification relative to domain knowledge, the finding
is set in contradiction to the current domain thinking about semantic memory being “free
of contextual constraints” (N29). In order to achieve the status of knowledge within the
domain, the finding, whether confirmatory or contradictory to what is currently known,
must be explained relative to the domain state of knowledge. Contradictory findings may
result in a reinterpretation or reframing of previous understandings, or may seek to refute
the previous findings through the strength of their own inquiry process.
8.3.1.2 Hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation presuppositions. Twenty-five
of the fifty-seven neuroscience dissertations present their questions in the form of a
hypothesis, a conjecture about how to fill an epistemic gap identified by the neuroscience
domain about memory and formulated as a tentative relationship between independent
and dependent variables. Responses or answers to questions presented as hypotheses take
the form of confirmations or disconfirmations of the conjecture about how to resolve the
epistemic conflict. As a structure for inquiry, hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation
questions presuppose that knowledge of memory is obtained through experimental testing
of hypotheses about the relationship between impaired or enhanced memory and its
potential causes. In contrast to the research question-finding structure for inquiry, which
utilizes experimentation to determine what constitutes an observation of memory, these
inquiries utilize experiments or quasi-experiments to test whether a hypothesized
relationship can be said to exist between memory and other phenomena. Experiments are
the fundamental tool for producing scientific knowledge, which process is characterized
by minimization of subjective bias, manifested in the controlled nature of the experiment:

263
the definition of independent and dependent variables, control of the experimental setting,
and careful measurement and interpretation of resulting empirical data. Neuroscientific
inquiries posing hypotheses about the relationship between memory and phenomena of
impairment or enhancement derive knowledge, in the form of confirmation or
disconfirmation of the hypothesis, by comparing experimental and control groups relative
to the memory-related phenomenon of interest. The causal relationship between memory
and phenomena of impairment is tested by causal comparative quasi-experiments, whose
content is characterized by queries of (12) conditionality about Y and memory. These
causal comparative inquiries seek to assign causality to diseases and disorders, traumatic
brain injuries, age, and individual differences by testing whether the differences between
pre-existing groups’ memory activities and performances are statistically significant.
Queries of (13) biconditionality test hypothesized differences between randomly assigned
experimental and control groups in order to determine whether the independent variable,
such as cognitive interventions or drugs, can be claimed as a causal explanation for
enhanced memory. In this manner, hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation inquiries
presuppose that knowledge is derived through experimental or quasi-experimental testing
of hypothesized relationships.
The hypothesis-driven inquiries rely on empirical measures of memory as
evidence supporting the confirmation or disconfirmation of the hypothesis. Empirical
evidence minimizes subjective bias by being open to examination by other independent
members of the knowledge domain of its assumptions, methods of obtaining the evidence,
and manner in which the evidence is tied to the hypothesis. The empirical evidence for
confirmation or disconfirmation of the relationships between memory and other

264
phenomena takes the form of statistically significant differences in experimental and
control groups’ measures of memory, whether measured as neural activation, cognitive or
behavioral performance, or anatomical features. In the following example, the empirical
evidence supporting the hypothesis, that retrieval and definition of events from memory
differs between older and younger adults, is the comparison of the patterns of neural
activity during autobiographical memory retrieval between older and younger adults:
Our results highlight key differences in brain activity during autobiographical
memory retrieval in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, and in the
functional connectivity between these regions and the hippocampus. Further, our
results demonstrate age differences in event definitions during perception and
retrieval. We conclude by highlighting how these findings relate to the processes
of memory retrieval and event segmentation. (N26)
The difference in empirical measures of memory between age groups, obtained via
experimentation, serve as evidence to support the confirmation of the hypothesis, that
there are age differences in event definitions during perception and retrieval. In this
manner, the presentation of questions in hypothesis form presupposes that the source of
evidence for confirmation or disconfirmation is empirical measures of statistically
significant differences in memory between experimental and control groups.
The confirmation or disconfirmation of a hypothesis is justified as domain
knowledge according to whether the experimental results can be accepted as valid and
reliable by domain standards. Reliability refers to the repeatability of experimental
findings and is a measure of the objectivity of the scientific method. Validity is of two
types, internal and external, and refers to the credibility of the research, with internal

265
validity referring to the condition that the observed differences between groups can be
said to be a direct result of the manipulation of the independent variable, and external
validity referring to the ability of the findings to be generalized to groups outside of the
experimental setting. In the example above, the experimental result’s reliability is
established by descriptions of the experimental design, procedures, and data analysis.
Internal validity is established by justifying the researcher’s choice of instruments for
measuring memory and domain-normative use of the instruments and analysis of the
resulting data. Finally, external validity is established according to the sampling method
and the appropriateness of the scope of the generalization in relation to the sampling
method. Hypothesis-driven inquiries thus justify the confirmation/disconfirmation of the
hypothesis as domain knowledge according to the validity and reliability of the research
design logic, methods, and procedures used to obtain the experimental results.
8.3.1.3 Goal-tool presuppositions. The goal-tool structure for inquiry is the
single form of inquiry in the computer engineering domain and is described in more
detail in Section 8.3.3. Briefly, neuroscience inquiries presenting their questions in the
form of goals, related to epistemic obstacles to the study of or clinical assessment of
memory, respond by developing tools for overcoming the obstacles. These inquiries
presuppose that: knowledge of memory is obtained through the development of tools for
studying or assessing memory; the design of the tool is evidence in support of its
attaining status as domain knowledge; and the tool is justified as domain knowledge
according to its efficacy in attaining the goal that motivated its development.
8.3.1.4 Summary. The three epistemic forms in which neuroscientific
dissertations present questions about memory possess differing epistemological

266
presuppositions about how memory can be known within the domain. Questions
presenting as research questions presuppose that knowledge of memory is obtained
through scientific observation, supported by evidence in the form of several experimental
results that, interpreted holistically, form a finding. Findings are justified as knowledge
according to whether and how plausibly they fill the epistemic gap or push the epistemic
boundary identified in the research question and whether they cohere with the greater
understanding of memory in the domain. Questions presenting as hypotheses presuppose
that memory is known through scientific experimentation, that the source of evidence
confirming or disconfirming the hypothesis is statistically significant differences in
empirical measures of memory between groups defined by the independent variable
(hypothesized causes of memory impairment or enhancement), and that the confirmation
or disconfirmation is justified as knowledge by the reliability and validity of the
experiment. Finally, the neuroscientific questions presenting as goals presuppose that
knowledge of memory is produced by developing tools, which are justified as knowledge
by the efficacy of their design in overcoming the epistemic obstacle identified in the goal.
The three question-answer forms indicate that neuroscience engages three ways of
“knowing” memory: through observation, testing of its relation to other phenomena, and
development of tools for its study and treatment.
8.3.2 Literature. Tables 8 through 11 in Appendix C list the literature
dissertation questions by content, with the epistemic form of presentation, theme or topic,
identified in the right-hand column. Themes and topics represent two related stages or
levels of the literary production of knowledge, with theme-driven creative inquiry
producing literary texts, such as novels or short story collections, and topic-driven critical

267
literary inquiries analyzing the literary texts produced by theme-driven inquiries. The
two forms differ according to the presuppositions they indicate about: what constitutes
knowledge of memory, or the manner of knowing; sources of evidence supporting the
answer; and criteria for validation of the knowledge claims as answers to the questions.
8.3.2.1 Topic-thesis presuppositions. Seventeen of the twenty literature
dissertations present their questions in the epistemic form of a topic and produce
knowledge in the form of a thesis. These inquiries presuppose that knowledge is
produced by argumentation, the presentation of an argument, defined by Kemerling
(2011) as a set of two or more propositions related to one another in such a way that all
but one of them (the premises) provides support for the remaining one (conclusion or
thesis). The propositions in literary arguments offer rationales or explications about the
literary construction of memory, identifying the literary devices by which memory is
constructed in texts, and the literary uses of memory, interpretations of how the literary
constructions serve to accomplish actions such as negotiating trauma or challenging
historical memory. These propositions, once logically connected to each other, become
premises in support of a conclusive thesis about memory. Literary knowledge of memory
based on argumentation is inferential in nature, relying on logical reasoning to move from
the premises, derived by textual analysis, to the interpretive conclusion (thesis) of the
argument about the literary nature of memory.
Topic-thesis inquiries claim the critical analysis of literary texts as evidence to
support their arguments about memory. The strength of the argument relies on the
quality of the literary analysis: the originality and acuity of the thesis and the clarity and
skill with which it is supported as the logical conclusion to the premises. The concluding

268
thesis statement, that “memory and witnessing are deeply entwined with the linguistic,
which, by imploding into the poetic, offers the possibility of reconciling the imaginative
intervention with the (obliquely) referential,” is supported by literary analysis of “the
poetics of traumatic hindsight”:
This thesis will provide a comparative analysis of the poetics of traumatic
hindsight and the literary devices that three texts – Anne Michaels's Fugitive
Pieces, Linda Hogan's Solar Storms, and Toni Morrison's Beloved – utilize to
signify the necessity of a retrospective gaze towards the atrocious past. The thesis
investigates the ways in which each text negotiates the fragmentation that
characterizes the traumatic aftermath, particularly as a result of the incomplete
nature of traumatic history inscribed as absence of knowledge. (L1)
The evidence supporting the claim resides in interconnecting premises about the
“incomplete nature of traumatic history inscribed as absence of knowledge,” how the
texts negotiate the fragmentation of trauma by employing a “poetics of traumatic
hindsight” and “literary devices,” and that these necessitate “a retrospective gaze towards
the atrocious past.” As a form of argumentation, the critical analysis of literary texts is
secondhand knowledge, dependent on the cognitive authority of another, the dissertation
author. Knowledge derives from second-hand experience of memory in the form of
critical arguments about the construction of memory or its use in literary texts. The
dissertation author’s analyses and interpretations of the literary texts, rather than the texts
themselves, are offered as evidence for the memory-related argument presented in the
thesis statement.

269
Literature dissertations asking topic questions justify their theses about the literary
construction and use of memory as knowledge according to the strength of the argument.
The determination of an argument’s strength is two-fold: it must have true premises and
valid inferences (Kemerling, 2011). Evaluating the truth of the premises entails
considering whether the premise is reasonably supported by the evidence provided: can
the premise be believed, considering the textual evidence provided? If all the premises
can be deemed true, then justification is a matter of the validity of the inference between
premises and conclusion (thesis). In the example above, the researcher infers, from the
premises about how the three texts “negotiates the traumatic aftermath” in a manner that
necessitates “a retrospective gaze towards the atrocious past,” that “memory and
witnessing are deeply intertwined with the linguistic, which… offers the possibility of
reconciling the imaginative intervention with the (obliquely) referential.” The status of
the thesis as domain knowledge depends on whether this inference meets the domain
standard of a valid inference.
8.3.2.2 Theme-interpretation presuppositions. Creative literature dissertations
are structured according to the epistemic framework of theme-interpretation inquiries:
they present questions in the form of a theme or motif, a central thought or idea that
recurs or is incorporated throughout a literary work, and produce knowledge in the form
of an interpretation of the theme. Posing queries of acquaintance about the nature of
memory, the three creative writing dissertations locate the source of knowledge of
memory in the reader’s unmediated apprehension of memory as a theme in a literary
work of fiction. In other words, readers “know” memory by directly encountering it in
the text. Distinct from any of the other forms identified in the three-domain sample,

270
theme-interpretation inquiries produce first-hand knowledge of memory, defined by
Wilson (1983) as knowledge that results from direct experience, with the body of one’s
own ideas framing one’s encounters with the world. In reading a novel or short story that
has memory as a main theme and forming interpretations of the significance and meaning
of the theme, readers produce knowledge based on their own personal experience of
memory in the text. Knowledge derives from first-hand experience of the phenomenon
of memory in literary texts.
Theme-interpretation inquiries presuppose that the literary texts are themselves
the primary source of evidence supporting the knowledge claims that take the form of
readers’ interpretations of the literary themes. Readers draw upon the content and form
of the text, what is being revealed about memory, and how (through what literary
devices) it is being revealed, to support their thematic interpretations of memory:
Multiple narratives including letters, diaries, orally transmitted stories and gossip
reflect the multiple selves women inhabit when seeking to belong to patriarchal
culture and act autonomously within it. The protagonist, Kate, realizes that her
anger and her sexuality have moved her husband and family to blot her out, to
impose an identity upon her more palatable to them, after her assailant has made
her a blank page. Through her search among the textual remains left by friends
and family, culminating in the discovery of her husband's secret diary, she is able
to identify herself and her attacker, and revise her identity in a position of power.
(L16)
The reader’s interpretation is here articulated by the author of the text, due to the
requirements of the doctoral degree in creative writing, which requires not only

271
production of a literary work of creative fiction, but also critical reflection on the work,
offered in some supplementary form such as a critical essay that accompanies the
dissertation. In the critical essay, the author speaks on behalf of the reader, offering a
description of his or her own literary techniques and the intention towards which they are
applied relative to the themes of the work.
How do readers of literary texts justify their interpretations of the memory-related
themes present in texts? Since knowledge is derived from direct experience of memory
in the text, readers’ interpretations are justified according to the quality of readers’
experiences. The depth of experience and force of impact that the text has on the reader
is justification for the validity of their interpretation. Authors cite the readers’ enjoyment
and connection with the text as an explicit intention in producing the text, stressing that
“the key to good writing is entertainment,” that they write to create a “new experience”
for their reader (L17), and that they craft the language and structure of text with a desire
to “treat” their reader to “fresh language” or by doing something new with plot, instead of
“the same old plot line” (L16). Different readers are expected to have different
experiences of the text, leading to distinct interpretations of the themes, but the authority
of one interpretation over another is judged by the depth of the reader’s experience.
8.3.2.3 Summary. The two epistemic forms in which literature dissertations
present questions about memory convey differing epistemological presuppositions about
how memory can be known in the literature domain. Questions presenting as themes
presuppose that knowledge of memory is obtained through direct experience of memory,
that the source of this direct experience is the literary text itself, and that the knowledge
claims, in the form of readers’ interpretations of the themes, are justified according to the

272
depth of the experience of the text. Questions presenting as topics presuppose that
memory is known through argumentation of a thesis, that the source of evidence
supporting the thesis is critical analysis of the texts, and that the thesis is justified as
knowledge by the truth of the premises upon which it is built and the validity of the
inference connecting premises to thesis. Together, the two form-related subsets of
literature dissertations suggest that the literary way of knowing memory is both creative
and critical in nature.
8.3.3 Computer engineering. Table 12 in Appendix C lists the dissertation
questions according to the single epistemic forms in which computer engineering
questions present: goals. Goals are aims or desired results that inquirers set out to achieve
through the research, formulated in relation to epistemic obstacles that the domain faces
in pursuing knowledge of memory. The response or answer to goals takes the form of
tools developed to overcome the obstacles to domain knowledge. The goal-tool structure
for inquiry indicates that the computer engineering approach to memory presupposes that
knowledge of memory: is obtained through implementation of the tool; relies on the
tool’s design as its source of evidence; and is justified as knowledge according to its
efficacy in attaining the goal.
8.3.3.1 Goal-tool presuppositions. What does the computer engineering
domain’s presentation of questions in the form of goals reveal about how memory is
known in the domain? Posing queries of rationale/explication about memory
optimizations, computer engineering inquiries locate the source of knowledge about
memory in the development of tools and techniques for optimizing memory. The process
of writing code, whether designing software to run the computer systems and applications

273
or architecture of the computer system itself, is an iterative process of analysis, design,
implementation, and evaluation. Coding is bound by the constraints of the computer
system and its components, as well as the aims or desired functionalities of the tool that is
being developed. Whether developing memory systems-level approaches to optimization
such as hybrid memory systems for servers (CE15), memory models for the different
levels of the memory hierarchy such as cache memory (CE7), or optimizing techniques
for the application and integration of specific memory technologies such as SRAM (CE9;
CE10), knowledge derives from the coding process, from the design process of creating a
solution to inefficient memory.
Questions presented in the form of goals require that the answer present in the
form of tools. The goal-tool structure for inquiry presupposes that the design of the tool
is the primary source of evidence supporting the proposal of the tool as knowledge. In
the following example, the goal of creating a memory system for servers with a small
amount of DRAM and large amount Phase Change Memory (PCM) in order to capitalize
on their complementary characteristics is met by the proposal of two hybrid memory
systems, described according to their design:
In this dissertation, we propose two hybrid memory systems for servers. The first
system (called Rank-aware Page Placement or RaPP) is a hardware-driven page
placement policy. The policy relies on the memory controller (MC) to monitor
access patterns, migrate pages between DRAM and PCM, and translate the
memory addresses coming from the cores. The second system (called Rankaware Cooperative Cache or RaCC) is a software-driven policy for object
placement in server clusters that implement cooperative memory caches. RaCC

274
monitors object popularity and leverages that information in placing the objects.
(CE15)
As an epistemic form for inquiry, a goal is an open-ended question; it can be met in many
different ways, by the use of many different tools. Given that the number of tools that
could be designed to meet a goal is theoretically unlimited, the description of the design
of the tool developed and proposed in the research serves as the necessary evidence to
demonstrate that the design does indeed attain the goal towards which it is being applied.
In the example above, two hybrid memory systems for servers are described: a hardwaredriven system called Rank Aware Page Placement (RaPP), and a software-driven one,
Rank Aware Cooperative Cache (RaCC). Descriptions of their basic designs, of how
they function to implement memory, serve as evidence that supports the proposal of these
systems to attain the goal of creating a memory system for servers that combines DRAM
and PCM. The details related to how it does reveals the logic and organization of the tool,
opening it up to evaluation of manner in which it attains the goal.
Computer engineering dissertations presenting questions in the form of goals
respond by developing tools, in the form of techniques, for memory optimization. Since
the nature of development for computer memory is that it is always looking ahead,
anticipating the increasing processing demands on computer systems, advancements in
memory chip capabilities and processing speeds, and the development of new memory
technologies, coding often relies on simulators that allow researchers to develop tools for
systems that do not yet exist in material form. In order for the tools that are developed in
relation to the memory-related goals to be justified as domain knowledge, the simulator
must be accepted as a reasonable representation of the imaginary computer system’s

275
behavior. Researchers may modify pre-existing simulators to meet the criteria of the
system that fits the use case that they are designing for, but if no simulator exists that
models behavior close enough to the type of system being imagined, the researcher must
create a simulator from scratch (CE15). Simulation results are compared to community
benchmarks, in order to justify the validity of the simulator and the experimental results
that it produces (CE2).
Given that the simulator is accepted as modeling the behavior of the computer
system in question, the tools produced by goal-driven inquiries are ultimately justified as
domain knowledge according to the efficacy with which they attain the goal that
motivates the research. If the technique for memory optimization succeeds in reaching
the specific aim or desired result as specified in the goal statement, then it is justified as
knowledge. In order to determine whether the tool attains the goal, it needs to be
implemented and evaluated in relation to the motivating goal. In the above example, the
two proposed hybrid systems are implemented and evaluated, which results show:
…that our hybrid memory systems provide robust and consistent memory
performance without sacrificing energy. Based on our experience and results, we
conclude that Phase Change Memory (PCM) is a promising main memory
technology for future servers, especially when combined with a small amount of
DRAM. (CE15)
The justification of the two hybrid systems is articulated in relation to the initially stated
goal of creating a memory system for servers with a small amount of DRAM and large
amount of PCM in order to capitalize on the complementary advantages of each.
8.3.3.2 Summary. The computer engineering domain presents its questions in a

276
single epistemic form, the goal. Inquiry driven by a goal has distinct epistemological
presuppositions about the domain approach to “knowing” memory. Questions presenting
as goals related to optimization of computer memory presuppose that knowledge of
memory is obtained through the development of tools for optimizing memory, that the
design of the specific tools or techniques proposed serves as the source of evidence as to
its status as justified belief, and that the tool is justified according to its efficacy in
attaining the goal that motivates and organizes inquiry.
8.3.4 Domain comparisons. Comparison of the epistemological presuppositions
of domains’ questions about “memory” indicates that neuroscience, literature, and
computer engineering have differing assumptions about how “memory” is known. The
epistemological presuppositions of each domains’ questions are summarized in Table 61
and further discussed in relation to: how “knowing” occurs, the relation between knower
and known, the sources and functions of evidence, and the nature of justification.

8.3.4.1 Ways of “knowing.” Comparison of the epistemic forms in which
domains present their questions about “memory” makes visible the domain-based manner
of knowing, the epistemological profile or style of the domain. First and foremost, the

277
epistemological profile of a domain is defined by asking: what is knowledge in this
domain and what are its scope and limits? For research question-finding and hypothesisconfirmation/disconfirmation neuroscientific inquiries, knowledge derives from direct
observation of memory as well as indirect inference of memory based on tests of
memory’s relations with other phenomena. Both kinds of knowing rely on empirical data,
enabled by technologies that are used to “see” memory directly, as with MRI images or
PET scans, or to infer its characteristics based on measurements of its cognitive or
behavioral manifestations. Research question-finding inquiries produce directtechnologically-enabled knowledge of memory, while hypothesis-confirmation/
disconfirmation inquiries produce indirect, inferential knowledge based on its
measureable relations to causal phenomena. Neuroscientific knowledge of memory,
according to an interview with a dissertation author, is thus limited by the inherent
limitations of the technologies for observing and instruments for measuring memory, as
well as researcher competence in the collection of data and its interpretation (N29).
The dependence on technologies and instruments of “seeing” memory accounts
for the subset of neuroscientific goal-tool inquiries, which seek to develop and validate
the tools and instruments of the domain, their appropriate uses, and the interpretation of
the empirical data they produce. The nature of neuroscientific knowledge of memory is
thus entirely dependent on the tools and instruments for gathering empirical data about
memory. Objective scientific knowledge of memory is obtained through the continual
development and improvement of tools and instruments and active debate about the
interpretation of resulting data. The two question forms, research questions and
hypotheses, are thus united by their reliance on tools and instruments to collect empirical

278
data about memory yet differentiated by the directness or indirectness of the empirical
data; the third question form of goal concerns the tools and instruments themselves.
Literary knowledge of memory is also characterized by two question forms that
presuppose different ways of knowing: knowing though experience and knowing through
argument. Knowledge of the nature of memory is derived, in theme-interpretation
inquiries, from direct experience with memory, through firsthand interpretation of
literary themes in creative works of literary fiction. To be immersed or actively engaged
in a literary text, as a work of art, is to experience propositional truth firsthand, through
one’s own senses. This form of knowledge is limited in scope by what one can directly
experience of memory in the text, as is all firsthand knowledge, but is counterbalanced by
the authenticity of direct experience. In contrast, the secondhand knowledge produced by
critical topic-thesis inquiries, constructs its inquiry as an argument, a series of
propositions about memory that emerge from the analysis and interpretation of a group of
literary texts, where all but one of the propositions serve as premises leading to the final
proposition, a conclusion in the form of a thesis statement. In these inquiries, the scope
of knowledge is limited to what can be supported by the analysis of the text. These two
ways of knowing, the creative and the critical, both characterize the nature of literary
knowledge of memory: as commonly deriving from texts, yet differentiated by whether
the knowledge is firsthand, produced on one’s own cognitive authority relative to the text,
or secondhand, by conferring cognitive authority to another’s analysis of the texts.
The computer engineering domain presents questions in the form of goals related
to memory optimization and responds in the form of developing tools to apply towards
the goals. Knowledge of memory derives from the process of development that ends in

279
production, utilization, and refinement of the form of the tool itself; it is in the iterative
development of the tool, as means to overcome the epistemic obstacle, that memory is
known. Code is written, tested, evaluated, rewritten, and retested, in order to determine
the final form of the memory solution. The scope of knowledge of memory in computer
engineering is limited by the ability of the simulator to model the parameters of the
imagined system, as well as by the requirements of the use case for which the solution is
developed.
8.3.4.2 Relationship between knower and known. Comparison of the
epistemological presuppositions of question forms reveals that the forms differ according
to the relationship between the knower or would-be knower and known. Research
question-finding and hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation inquiries presume
independence between the knower and known, that any would-be knower can objectively
“know” memory by following the bias-minimizing logic and procedures of experimental
research. The principle of reproducibility that is part of the bedrock of experimental
science presupposes that experimental observations and test results are the objective
product of research, rather than the subjective view of individual researchers. In contrast,
the literature domain’s question forms presume the exact opposite: that the relationship
between knower and known is one of necessary dependence, and that what is known
about memory depends on the subjective experiences of the knower. Memory cannot be
objectively known, but is always filtered through the experiences, existing knowledge,
social location, and specificity of the possessor; memories belong to individuals or to
groups with similar experiences. This dependence opens up the space in literary texts for
multiple and conflicting memories, resistance towards the dominant discourse,

280
reconstruction of past events, and even the opening up of possibilities for the future.
The goal-tool form of inquiry, found mainly in the computer engineering domain
but also in the neuroscience domain, presumes that the relation between knower and
known is somewhere between dependence and independence. The precise tools proposed
to attain memory-related goals are not the unique possession of the respondent, being, in
theory, producible by any domain member, but there is level of individual creativity in
the development of the particular tools, out of an infinite number of possibilities, that
suggests a relation between knower and known.
8.3.4.3 Evidence and justification. The five epistemic forms utilized in the three
domain sample convey differing assumptions about what counts as evidence in support of
a “memory”-related knowledge claim and what the evidence does in order to support the
claim. Evidence is defined as "information bearing on the truth or falsity of a
proposition" (Audi, 1999, p. 293), which we situate within a specific knowledge domain.
With sufficient evidence, the proposition or knowledge claim is justified as knowledge;
evidence is that which justifies belief.
The type of information that constitutes evidence differs according to the form of
inquiry. Both research question-finding and hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation
inquiries rely on experimental results, the statistically significant differences in empirical
measures of memory, as the primary source of evidence. In research question-finding
inquiries that seek to establish what constitutes an observation of memory, the
statistically significant differences are within-individual differences. These quasiexperimental causal comparative inquiries seek to establish statistically significant
differences between neural activity or cognitive/behavioral performance during a

281
memory task and the baseline measure, in order to support the claim that a legitimate
observation is being made. Evidence for the neural correlates of a type or aspect of
memory or the observation of a neural mechanism are constituted of experimental results
that show that there is a significant difference between the neural activity or performance
measured during the memory task as compared to before or after the task. In contrast,
hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation inquires rely on the experimentally obtained,
statistically significant between-group differences in neural activity or
cognitive/behavioral measures as evidence to support the claim that a causal relationship
exists between the phenomenon represented by the experimental variable and memory.
For both forms of inquiry, the knowledge claims, about what constitutes an observation
of memory or relation between memory and other phenomena, is justified by the validity
and reliability of the experiment.
The topic and theme inquires both rely on literary texts as sources of evidence for
supporting the thesis statement or literary interpretation as knowledge claims. Where
they differ is in the status of the text as a direct or indirect source of evidence. Topicthesis inquiries produce critical analyses of literary texts in which the texts are excerpted,
described, discussed, and utilized to build an argument about memory. The evidential
status of the literary texts is filtered through the critical literary analysis and is thus an
indirect source of evidence, with the critical analysis itself serving as the direct source of
evidence to support the argument encapsulated by the thesis statement. In themeinterpretation inquiries, the literary texts, in the form of the creative works of fiction
produced, are themselves the direct sources of evidence, offered to the readers for their
interpretation. Knowledge of memory is justified by readers’ direct interpretation of the

282
memory-related theme within the literary text. For both literary forms, the literary text
stands as the central source of evidence, whether directly experienced or indirectly
through another’s analysis of the texts.
The goal-tool form of inquiry is the only form that crosses domain boundaries,
employed unanimously in computer engineering inquiries but also employed by a small
subset of neuroscience inquiries. In this form of inquiry, the primary source of evidence
supporting the proposal of a new tool is the design of the tool or technique. By
describing the construction of the tool and the plan for how it will function to meet the
stated goal, whether a new instrument for assessing older adults’ memory performance
(N46) or model-driven memory optimizations for high performance computing systems
(CE6), the design of the tool justifies its proposal as domain knowledge.
8.3.4.4 Summary. The comparison of domains’ question and answer forms,
which together provide an epistemic structure for inquiry, demonstrates that question
forms convey epistemological presuppositions, including assumptions regarding what can
be known, its scope and limitations, the relation between knower and known, and the
source of evidence and justification. The differences in question forms sketch the
epistemological profiles or styles of the domains relative to the study of “memory.” The
five forms characterize distinct ways of knowing. Research questions and hypotheses
presuppose that knowledge derives from scientific experimentation directed towards
discovery or confirmation, while topics and themes assume that knowledge derives either
from direct experience or critical argumentation. The fifth form, goals, presupposes that
knowledge derives from the development of tools. It characterizes the approach of the
entire computer engineering domain, as well as the subset of neuroscience that concerns

283
epistemic obstacles to the study and treatment of memory. The comparison of forms
supports the notion that domains not only ask about different things as embodied in
question content, but ask differently, as is embodied in the question forms identified.
At the same time, the three knowledge domains’ epistemological profiles
emphasize that “memory,” as an object of inquiry, is subject to myriad ways of knowing:
through observation, testing, argument, experience, and design. Each way of knowing
corresponds to certain categories of question content, which is to say that different things
can be “known” by different manners of “knowing”: each way of knowing brings to light
a distinct facet of the phenomenon of “memory.” The domain comparative methodology
exposes different approaches to producing knowledge about “memory” as a common
topic of inquiry, between and within domains, as indicated by the epistemic structures
created by their question-answer forms.

8.4 Question relevance and social factors
Hjørland and Hartel (2003b) characterize knowledge domains as having
ontological, epistemological, and social dimensions. Chapter Six and Section 8.2 of this
chapter demonstrate that question content gives an indication of domain ontology, in the
form of the ontological commitments of the questions’ queries and subjects, or what the
domain knows memory to be. Likewise, Chapter Seven and Section 8.3 of this chapter
demonstrate that question form indicates domain epistemology, in that the use of a
particular form indicates presuppositions about how the domain knows. The two
dimensions of knowledge domains, ontology and epistemology, are reflected in the
knowledge domains’ question formulations. The question then arises as to the third
dimension, of whether and how the sociological dimension of knowledge domains,

284
defined by Hjørland and Hartel (2003b) as being “about groups of people working with
some objects by applying some approaches,” is reflected in the domains’ question
formulations.
The answer to this question is not found in the data collected and analyzed for the
current study. The sociological dimension of a knowledge domain, when considered as a
dimension apart from the ontological or epistemological, refers primarily to the social
infrastructure of the knowledge domain: the intellectual influence of mentors, colleagues,
institutional training; the existence of funding and other types of support for certain types
of research; the norms and mandates of publication; the realities of career development
and advancement. These sociological dimensions are not well captured by the
knowledge products of inquiry, but are better studied by ethnographic study of question
formation. Methodologically, investigating how the question manifests the sociological
dimension of the domain is likewise not evidenced in the knowledge products of inquiry
(dissertation abstracts) that serve as the main data for the current analysis.
One possible explanation of the manner in which the sociological dimension may
manifest in domains’ questions will be suggested as a topic for future research. The
social dimension of the knowledge domain may determine, of all of the possible
questions that could be asked according to the content and form requirements of the
domain, which are “relevant” to the domain and thus “worthy” of asking. A study of
what factors determine the “relevance” of questions is likely to reveal the influence of the
social forces listed above and more: funding and resource availability; the influence of
dissertation chairs, advisors, and other mentors; consensus about the “hot” topics in the
domain; convergence with other domain developments such as theoretical or

285
methodological trends, or technological advances; and the formal and informal
associations between researchers within and across knowledge domains. Socially
relevant questions, thus described, may function as a filter for the broader set of
ontologically and epistemologically relevant questions in any given domain.

8.5 Summary of findings and conclusion
Research questions 4b and 5b ask, what information do question content and form
convey about the assumptions that precede the question? The analysis of neuroscience,
literature, and computer engineering question formulations about “memory” show that
question content conveys ontological commitments to the kinds of entities that exist in
the domain’s reality, their substance, features, and relations. Question content indicates
domains’ ontologies. Furthermore, a comparison of the three domain’s five question
forms presuppose epistemological beliefs about what constitutes knowledge, how it is
derived, its sources and limits, the nature of the relationship between knower and known,
and the nature of evidence and justification. Question form indicates domains’
epistemologies. Together, question content and form characterize distinct types of
inquiry into “memory” – descriptive, determinative, prescriptive, creative, and critical –
that produce knowledge of different facets of “memory” – its mechanisms and properties,
uses, relations to other phenomena, and its very nature.
While not directly investigated in the current study, it is further proposed that
question relevance reveals the social dimension of the domain. What is meant by this
proposition is that determinations of which questions, of all those that are ontologically
and epistemologically correct, are most relevant to the domain and thus pursued by

286
researchers, are subject to the structures, resources, and influences of the knowledge
domain as a social unit of knowledge production.
The question paradox states that in order to ask what one does not know, one
already has to know (Flammer, 1981). In the context of knowledge domains and the
comparative domain analysis of questions, the paradox is resolved: in order to ask a
question, one already has to know what to ask (question content) and how to ask it
(question form). Knowing what the indeterminate situations are and how to structure
inquiry relative to the topic infers that one also knows what will resolve the
indeterminacy and how produce that knowledge. Knowing what and how to ask also
presumes that one knows the tacit ontological and epistemological assumptions that
constrain and enable the inquiry. In a sense, knowing what and how to ask is a
microcosm of domain members’ competence in inquiry, an expression of members’
knowledge of and ability to work within the domain’s assumptions to produce relevant
domain knowledge. While the comparative ontological and epistemological analyses
offered in this chapter are basic and may suffer from the broad differences between three
such contrasting domains, they serve as evidence for the ability of questions to convey
information about the knowledge domain context, namely the tacit ontological and
epistemological assumptions of the domain that serve as the context for inquiry and the
production of knowledge.
Questions convey information as well as request it (Kearsley, 1976) – about the
answers that follow and the assumptions that precede the questions (Dillon, 1990). The
current investigation demonstrates that questions are social epistemological tools of
inquiry, wielded in relation to domains as units of and contexts for the production of

287
knowledge. The precise relationship between question elements and the ontological,
epistemological, and social dimensions of knowledge domains is further explored in
Chapter Nine: A social epistemological model of domains’ question formulations.

288

CHAPTER 9: A SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL MODEL OF
DOMAINS’ QUESTION FORMULATIONS

9.1 Questions as tools of inquiry
This dissertation proposes a social epistemological conception of questions as
epistemic devices, tools used to transform indeterminate situations into determinate ones
in relation to knowledge domains as social units of knowledge production. A
comparative analysis of three domains’ questions formulations provides a picture of the
way in which questions are utilized to express the indeterminate situations that motivate
inquiry and to convey the epistemic structures for resolving the indeterminacies.
Questions are tools of inquiry and as such, they indicate in their formulations what they
are meant to do. This chapter reflects on the status of questions as tools, objects designed
to organize inquiry towards the production of domain-justified knowledge. Based on the
empirical findings about the question formulations of the neuroscience, literature, and
computer engineering domains’ dissertation research on the topic of “memory,” a
theoretical model is developed of the manner in which questions are designed to convey
information – about the answers that follow and assumptions that precede – to organize
inquiry in a manner that adheres to norms and practices of the domain asking the question.
The empirical findings, which form the basis of the theoretical model, are here
summarized in relation to the idea of the question as a tool of domain inquiry, followed
by the presentation of the model and discussion of its implications for theory and practice.

289

9.2 Summary of empirical findings
A question analysis was conducted on the knowledge products of three
knowledge domains’ research on a common topic – neuroscience, literature, and
computer engineering dissertations abstracts and full-text dissertations on “memory” – in
order to identify, categorize, and compare the question formulations in each domain and
to consider what information they convey about the answers that follow and assumptions
that precede the questions. The question formulation categories that comprise the
question profiles of each domain demonstrate that questions take different shapes
between and even within the domains, such that the question formulations function to
convey information about the expectations for an answer and the domain assumptions
upon which the question and answer are produced.
9.2.1 Neuroscience. Of the three domains, the question profile of neuroscience
contains the most and most diverse question formulation categories. Table 62 shows that
the neuroscience question formulations can be divided into three distinct categories in
accordance to question content and form.

Table 62. Summary of empirical findings, neuroscience
The first type of question formulation, asking research questions about the neural
correlates, neural mechanisms, and role of X (various anatomical and neuronal
structures) in memory, coalesce around several indeterminate situations in the domain.
They can be characterized by the broad questions: what are the different types of
memory? Where are they located? How does memory work, at the neural level? These
question formulations accompany descriptive inquiry, in which scientific experimentation
serves to establish what constitutes an observation of memory’s neurobiological
occurrence in the human brain. The first category of question formulations indicates that
the answers should resolve the indeterminate situations identified in the question content,
and that the answer should take the form of a finding that extends the boundary of what is
known about memory in the domain. The finding is justified based on the internal logic
governing the design of the experimental studies, as well as relative to whether the
answer furthers the state of current domain knowledge.
The second category of questions formulates goals related to memory models and
instruments. These inquiries confront the indeterminate situations related to the tools for
observing memory, asking, why or how should certain tools be used to observe and
measure memory? The prescriptive style of inquiry of these questions seek to resolve
existing epistemic obstacles to the study or clinical treatment of memory through the
design and validation of new tools, which are evaluated according to the efficacy with

291
which they meet the goal. The third category of neuroscience inquiry formulates
hypotheses about Y and memory (Y = diseases and disorders, traumatic brain injury, age,
and individual differences) or memory and Z (Z = cognitive interventions, drugs, mode of
presentation, stress). The question formulations indicate that their answers must resolve
epistemic conflicts about whether relations between memory and phenomena of
impairment and enhancement can be proven to exist. These determinative inquiries ask,
what are the conditions that impair or break memory, and can memory be fixed or
enhanced? The experimental results are judged according to the reliability and validity of
the experiments that produced them.
The three neuroscience question categories share ontological beliefs about
memory: that it is a material process that exhibits plasticity; that there are multiple
memory systems that are localized to particularly brain regions; that it requires neural
functioning to exist. That the three types of question formulations share common
ontological commitments suggests that the ontological dimension is the commonality that
binds the sample together as neuroscientific research. What differentiates them are the
epistemological presuppositions of the different question and answer forms, the epistemic
structures within which each of the three groups resolves the indeterminate situations that
characterize them. Though they share a common ontological reality, the three areas of
research differ according to the how of inquiry: the ways of “knowing,” sources of
evidence, and criteria for justification of knowledge. This confirms Hjørland and
Hartel’s (2003b) assertion that knowledge domains are primarily ontologically defined.

292
9.2.2 Literature. The question formulations found in the literature sample divide
sharply into two categories: the critical inquiry of literary criticism and the creative
inquiry of creative writing (Table 63).

• Knower and known:

• Evidence: literary texts
• Justification: Quality of
experience

Table 63. Summary of empirical findings, literature
The first category formulates questions in the form of topics having to do with the
indeterminate situations related to the literary uses of memory and literary construction of
memory. They ask, to what end do literary texts wield memory and how is it the end
accomplished in the text? These are the indeterminate situations that this type of question
formulation requires the answer to resolve. Critical inquiries produce arguments about
the text or group of texts, built as a series of claims or premises that conclude in the
answer form of a thesis statement. The thesis is justified as having resolved the
indeterminate situation based on the soundness and strength of argument that the texts
support the premises and conclusion.
A second small subset formulates questions as literary themes that characterize
the indeterminate situation as being about the nature of memory. Themes are resolved in
creative inquiries by the production of interpretations of what the literary texts have to

293
say about the nature of memory, as produced by the readers’ direct encounters with
memory in the texts. The interpretation is justified as knowledge according to the quality
of the readers’ direct experiences of memory in the text, such that the deeper or more
engaged a readers’ experience, the greater weight that is given to their interpretation as a
resolution of the thematic indeterminate situation.
9.2.3 Computer engineering. The question formulations in computer
engineering are variants of a singular focus: the optimization of the computer memory
system (Table 64).

Table 64. Summary of empirical findings, computer engineering
Computer engineering’s question formulations are presented as goals related to memory
optimization. The indeterminate situation is singular: how can memory be optimized for
system performance? Every question formulation in the sample is a variation of this
question, even as each differs according to the established parameters of the use case, the
level of the memory hierarchy being addressed, and the approach being taken. Inherent
in these questions is the existence of epistemic obstacles to the optimization of memory.
The specific goals formulated in relation to this broad question are resolved by the
development of a tool that functions to overcome the obstacle, whether in the form of a
memory system overhaul, novel approaches to structuring the memory hierarchy, models
for integrating new memory technologies, or even the redesign of hardware components

294
like memory circuits. The tool that is developed and implemented is evaluated according
to its efficacy in overcoming the epistemic obstacle and attaining the goal.
9.2.4 Summary. The question profiles of the three domains are produced by the
categorization of their contents (the expressions of the indeterminate situations
motivating inquiry), and forms (the epistemic structure for resolving the indeterminate
situations). By locating a question formulation within a question category, it is evident
that the “shape” of the category – its characterization of question content and form –
functions to “shape” the content of the answer and the manner of its production. Thus the
question formulations function to organize inquiry according to the assumptions of the
knowledge domain or subdomain of origin.

9.3 A social epistemological model of domains’ question formulations
The empirical findings emerging from the research questions provide the basis for
the theoretical model in Figure 4. The following propositions further explain the terms
and concepts employed in the model and their relations. Since the empirical findings are
about the question formulations present in scholarly domains’ questions, the model
specifies that its context is the realm of scholarly inquiry and knowledge, though it is
surmised that non-scholarly – “everyday” or “common sense” – domains of inquiry may
adhere to the same model.

295

Figure 4. Social epistemological model of domains’ question formulations
Proposition 1.1. Inquiry produces knowledge; knowledge is defined in
relation to the inquiry. Inquiry is defined as the directed or controlled transformation of
an indeterminate situation into a determinate one (Dewey, 1938), which is conducted
through the asking and answering of questions, in accordance with the norms, practices,
and structures of the knowledge domain or domains of origin. The result of competent
inquiry is the production of knowledge (Dewey, 1938). Inquiry and knowledge are thus
in a complementary relationship: inquiry produces knowledge, and knowledge exists only
in relation to the inquiry. As knowledge does not exist objectively but in relation to an
inquiry, it requires an inquirer or knower, whether the knower is an individual or
collective knower. The knowledge that results from inquiry may be externalized in the

296
form of knowledge products, such as dissertations, abstracts, and articles in the scholarly
context, or may remain internal to the questioner.
Proposition 1.2. Inquiry and the production of knowledge are carried out in
the context of knowledge domains. The defining context of knowledge and inquiry is
the knowledge domain. Whereas the terms “knowledge” and “inquiry” are used in the
cognitive paradigm to refer to individuals and their individual investigations, here the
terms are understood as reflecting the social epistemological context of the knowledge
domain. The components of inquiry identified in Chapter Seven: Question forms, in their
relation to one another and particularly to the components of the question and answer,
reveal the epistemic structure of inquiry. This structure begins and ends with the current
knowledge that the domain possesses about “memory.” In the neuroscience and
computer engineering abstracts, the questions are posed relative to what is already known
in the domain, as when research questions and hypotheses are formulated relative to
epistemic gaps in the state of domain knowledge, or goals are formulated to overcome
epistemic obstacles stated as domain-level problems. Inquiry is always framed relative to
the existing knowledge about “memory” in the knowledge domain, as is reflected in the
question content as an expression of the indeterminate situation regarding “memory” in
the domain. Conversely, “knowledge” is the sum of all that is known about the objects or
phenomena in the world as collectively possessed, in the sense of being produced,
justified, and communicated, by the entire body of the knowledge domain. Inquiry
produces knowledge, and knowledge begets more inquiry.
As a context for inquiry, knowledge domains have definable borders, reflecting
that there are social norms for the production of knowledge. However, the boundaries are

297
nebulous, as knowledge domains are in a constant state of growth and change, due to the
absorption of new knowledge or other influences outside the domain.
Proposition 2.1. Questions solicit answers; answers are defined by the
questions. Much like knowledge and inquiry, questions and answers are complementary,
two sides of the same phenomenon. Questions and answers are formulated in relation to
each other, so much so that the question is most precisely formulated only in the full
knowledge of the answer. For this reason, the knowledge products of inquiry, such as the
dissertation abstracts studied in this investigation, are an especially apt source of data for
the study of questions and answers: they present the questions and answers in their final
form rather than in the midst of development. The empirical findings confirm Dillon’s
(1990) assertion that questions convey information about the answers that follow. The
content of the question identifies the indeterminate epistemic situation that needs
resolution; the answer is that which resolves the indeterminate situation. Likewise, the
form of the question indicates the manner in which the inquiry should be conducted in
order to justify belief in the resulting knowledge, including the form that the answer
should take and the criteria by which it should be evaluated as justified belief.
Proposition 2.2. Questions and answers are formulated in the context of a
knowledge domain. Questions and answers are not idiosyncratic in their formulations,
but are formulated within the perspective of the knowledge domain and according to its
social epistemological norms and practices. The implication of this proposition is that
knowledge domains can be characterized by the questions that they ask and the answers
that they produce. In this manner, domains can be described by their question profiles,
which can serve as concise representations of knowledge domains. This proposition

298
emerges from the central empirical finding of the comparative question analysis: that
neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering have distinct question profiles, and
that the different categories of question formulations require answers to be produced and
formulated accordingly (Tables 62-4).
There is no such thing as a question formulated outside of the context of
knowledge domains, only one that asks or answers poorly according to domain standards.
While questions and answers are complementary entities, it is possible to properly
formulate a question for the domain but still arrive at an invalid answer due to the
improper handling of the inquiry. However, it is unlikely, if not impossible, that a
domain-appropriate answer would result from an improperly formulated question.
Questions may be formulated between two or more knowledge domains, reflecting a
multi- or inter- or cross-disciplinary approach. These sorts of questions may eventually
differentiate enough from the existing domains of reference to form a new knowledge
domain, particularly when aided by technologies that enable new categories of questions
to be formulated. This is seen in the split between first order and third order question
formulations in neuroscience. Third order questions, extending from the traditional
psychological tradition, produce determinative inquiry through confirming or
disconfirming hypotheses about the conditional or biconditional relations between
memory and impairing or enhancing phenomena. According to an interview with one
author (N29), the growth in widespread accessibility to brain imaging technologies is
credited with the current flourishing of modern neuroscience as its own discipline apart
from psychology, as is represented by the first order questions posing research questions

299
that produce descriptive findings about the neural correlates, neural mechanisms, and
role of X (anatomical or neuronal structures) in memory.
Proposition 3. Question content reflects domain ontology. Domains are
described as having three dimensions: ontological, epistemological, and social (Hjørland
& Hartel, 2003b). The dimensions describe the types of assumptions that structure the
practice of inquiry within the domain. The comparative question analysis finds that these
assumptions are tacitly manifest in the domain’s question formulations. Comparative
analysis of the content of question formulations, comprised of a query posed about a
subject, reveals ontological assumptions about the substance, features, structures,
relations, and conditions of existence for “memory.” For instance, literature inquiries
posing queries of rationale/explication about the literary uses of memory, asking how
literary texts function to negotiate trauma or challenge historical memory, assume that
memory is an abstract act, subjectively held, and in the end, malleable. Implicit in the
query-subject pairing are ontological commitments to “memory” as an object of inquiry
and the world that it inhabits. The implication of this proposition is that if presented with
a list of a domain’s question formulations, one could infer the ontological commitments
of the domain by identifying the subjects and queries that comprise the question content,
particularly if viewed in contrast to another domain.
Proposition 4. Question form reflects domain epistemology. Whereas domain
ontology reveals what can be known in the domain, epistemology tells us how it can be
known. Domain epistemology constricts the forms in which question content is
presented in a manner that structures the components and relations of inquiry. For
instance, a hypothesis demands confirmation or disconfirmation and orients the inquiry

300
according to the rigor of experimental science, while a goal requires a tool or instrument
to be designed and evaluated in order to solve a practical problem. The question form is
indicative of the ways of knowing that are appropriate in the domain, which in turn
indicates the appropriate form of the answer and the criteria for evaluating the answer as
justified belief, by domain standards. Domain epistemology determines the epistemic
form of the question, which subsequently organizes inquiry according to the
epistemological presuppositions of the question form. Conversely, identifying the
epistemic question forms utilized by the domain gives a broad indication of the domain’s
epistemological orientations.
Proposition 5. Question relevance reflects domain sociality. This proposition
is the sole proposition not based directly on the empirical findings of the comparative
question analysis, but is inferentially determined and proposed for future study. In the
broadest sense, any question that is formulated in accordance with the ontological and
epistemological assumptions of the knowledge domain is a domain-relevant question, and
any answer produced accordingly is a relevant answer. In a narrower sense, the relevance
of questions and answers, the determination of whether the question is “worth” asking
and the answer “worth” knowing as judged by the domain, are a product of the domain’s
social dimension or social values. Relevance, in this narrower sense, is determined by a
confluence of dynamic social forces such as the influence of advisors and mentors,
funding and resource availability, systems of reward including tenure requirements,
awards, conference and publication guidelines, and other manifestations of the domain’s
social infrastructure. Some aspects of the social dimension’s influence on question
relevance may be explicit (publication or funding guidelines) while others are implicit

301
(departmental culture); some are formal (doctorate requirements) while others are
informal (influence of colleagues). The social dimension of the domain ultimately judges
some possible questions as more relevant than others.
These propositions support the conception of questions as domain tools for
organizing inquiry according to the ontological, epistemological, and social assumptions
of the knowledge domain. In its current state, the model is a static picture of the question
formulations of a single knowledge domain engaged in inquiry and the production of
knowledge. Additional analyses of domains, both cross-domain and topical comparisons
and historical studies, will provide more data for the potential further development of the
model, particularly in regards to the formulation of questions between domains and the
evolution of domains over time. Other dimensions of questions may also emerge as
indicative of domain assumptions, requiring their addition to the model. For instance, the
function of questions may be indicative of a knowledge domain’s axiological
assumptions, related to the value of knowledge and its proper use. With further
development and testing, a social theory of questions may emerge, offering a social
epistemologically informed addition to existing models and theories of information
behavior.

9.4 Implications of the model
The proposed model recasts the question as a social epistemological entity and
tool of inquiry. It views the opacity of questions as informative – of the knowledge
domain context and what that implies about the nature of inquiry and the production of
knowledge – rather than problematic. In resolving the question paradox, the social
epistemological conception of the question reasserts the centrality of the question in the

302
following bodies of theories and practices seeking to explain humans’ interactions with
information in the context of inquiry and the production of knowledge.
9.4.1 Domain analysis. The question analysis of Chapters Five, Six, and Seven
demonstrate that domains’ questions communicate the indeterminate epistemic situations
of the domain regarding memory and the epistemic structures by which knowledge can
be produced to resolve the indeterminacy. One of the implications of this finding is that
producing a question profile can be considered as a tool or interpretive context for many
of the eleven approaches suggested by Hjørland (2002b), including approaches such as
producing literature guides and subject gateways, producing special classifications,
empirical studies, bibliometrical studies, historical studies, and epistemological and
critical studies. For instance, the production of literature guides and subject gateways can
be initially organized according to the categories of question formulations that constitute
the question profile. Question formulations may then be translated into domain-specific
language, as well as restructured or reorganized according to the discretion of the
information specialist as suitable to the level of expertise and purposes of the target
audience. Here we see the distinct value of the information specialist as separate from
the subject specialist, as a translator that goes between the subject content as represented
in the information resources, the subset of the domain audience as the user group
(undergraduate students, graduate students, etc.), and the knowledge structures of the
domain context, in order to provide access to the domain universe of documents.
As demonstrated in the question analysis in previous chapters, the process of
identifying questions and classifying them according to content and form groups of like
research with like, providing descriptive characterizations that can serve as the basis of

303
discussions of identifying domain boundaries and defining the central concerns of the
domain versus those that are peripheral. The process and results of analysis can serve as
a reflexive exercise, a method for considering evaluating the state of knowledge in the
domain and whether and how the domain’s own image of its knowledge production
measures up to the picture produced by a question analysis of its research, with the
representativeness of the sample guiding the interpretation of the results. If the sample is
taken to be representative of the domain’s production at a given point in time, the
resultant question profile is a current snapshot of domain knowledge. A sample of
research across time will show the evolution of questions, producing a sort of “history of
questions” of the knowledge domain. The question profile can serve as a visualization
technique for representing the questions asked and knowledge produced by a domain or
domains, a “question map” of the domain. Within a domain, the same technique can be
used to characterize and compare research-producing bodies such as journals, publishers,
research labs or centers, graduate schools, doctoral programs, etc.
All of these reflexive exercises also apply to topical research, which is identical in
form to domain research, but orthogonal to it in terms of content. The current
investigation is a brief and limited example of topical question analysis, producing an
overall question profile of “memory” as pursued by three domains. In terms of within
domain topics, reviews of research such as those published in the Annual Review of
Information Science and Technology (ARIST) annual publication series from 1966 to
2011 could be produced and organized by applying this question analytic method to the
review of relevant literature. In fact, question analysis may be a productive technique for
organizing literature reviews of any scope and size, from small group of articles, to the

304
reviews of subfields of research, to the characterization of entire knowledge domains or
multiple domains.
9.4.2 Document relevance. The orientation towards domains’ questions that is
suggested by a social epistemological model of domains’ question formulations offers a
contextual grounding for the study of what constitutes a relevant document in any given
knowledge domain: documents provide evidence for the knowledge claims being
produced in response to the questions being asked. The primary relevance criterion is
epistemic and relative to the question. This explains how two groups with contrasting
knowledge claims can call upon the same document as evidence to support their claims:
the two groups are asking different questions and construct the epistemic relevance of the
same document differently. Relevance is recast as a relation primarily between
documents and the domain-based questions that they are being applied toward, and only
within that primary context, as between individual questioners and documents. By
implication, the production of indexing systems for documents can be guided by the
question, “what questions does this document pertain to?” rather than simply, “what is
this document about?” This approach highlights the inherent contextual nature of
questions and their capacity for revealing the social epistemological nature of inquiry as
aligned with what Hjørland (2001)identifies as the request-oriented, rather than
document-oriented, view of document “aboutness.”
9.4.3 Question negotiation. In addition to domain analysis, the proposed social
epistemological model of domains’ question formulations resolves the question paradoxrelated unease of existing theories of information behavior by reframing the question as
seeking to participate in a knowledge domain rather than as reflecting the questioner’s

305
internal state of information need. A detailed example will demonstrate this process.
Consider Taylor’s (1968) model of question negotiation, in which the information
intermediary is called upon to negotiate the inquirer’s question, from the question
representing the “compromised need,” stated in terms of the inquirer’s expectations of the
information system, back towards the “visceral need,” which is the “actual, but
unexpressed need for information” (p. 182). The paradox of the question is present in the
very notion of a “visceral need” and the impossible imperative for the information
intermediary to negotiate back to the inquirer’s “visceral need,” for how would either of
them know whether and when they have attained an acceptable answer to a question that
asks about precisely that which is not known?
What ends in the paradox of the question in the cognitive model of question
negotiation becomes informative in the social epistemological model. In the social
epistemological model of domains’ question formulations, Taylor’s (1968) four stages of
question negotiation may be reframed towards the knowledge domain context as follows:
1. The visceral question arises in the inquirer as an inexpressible sense of an
indeterminate epistemic situation in the domain of participation.
2. The conscious question is the within-brain expression of the domain’s
indeterminate epistemic situation.
3. The formalized question is the formal statement of the domain’s indeterminate
epistemic situation.
4. The compromised question is the domain’s question as presented to the
information system.

306
In the social epistemological model, question negotiation entails the identification of the
knowledge domain in which the questioner is seeking to participate, proceeding to
translation of the individual question into domain terms. Once the domain has been
identified, the cognitive idiosyncrasies or situational specificity of the questioner can be
taken into consideration in relation to the domain. The struggle of both the individual
questioner to formulate a question and the information intermediary to understand the
question is unlocked by a re-orientation to the common context of the knowledge domain
rather than the disconnect between the questioner’s and intermediary’s internal cognitive
states. Domain-based question negotiation differs from the current strategies of question
negotiation in that the negotiation is not towards the individual’s visceral question, but
towards the identification of the knowledge domain and its norms of question formulation.
Taylor (1968) finds that information intermediaries solicit five general types of
information in an attempt to negotiate the question: (1) determination of subject; (2)
objective and motivation; (3) personal characteristics of inquirer; (4) relationship of
inquiry description to file organization; and (5) by soliciting information in the general
categories listed here, anticipated or acceptable answers. The social epistemological
reorientation of question negotiation suggests that the most important general category,
even before or simultaneous with determination of subject, is the determination of the
knowledge domain. Identification of the knowledge domain immediately restricts the
determination of subject (and query, and question form) to the normative domain
categories of question formulations. After this determination, the individual inquirer’s
objective and motivation and personal characteristics can be considered, and finally, the
question can be adapted to the information system requirements.

307
9.4.4 Information retrieval design. The following example demonstrates the
way in which or how social epistemologically informed question negotiation may be
translated into practical guidelines for the design of information retrieval systems.
Imagine that a questioner approaches an information intermediary, whether reference
librarian, search engine, or a database search function with a question about “vaccines
and autism.” In a poorly negotiated encounter, the information intermediary will simply
present the questioner with a de-contextualized series of documents that are topically
related to vaccines and autism. This is the typical result of a keyword search in a search
engine or digital library: a series of results, ordered by relevance as determined by the
search engine’s algorithm, but giving no indication of the perspectives (knowledge
domains) from which the results emerge. Does the document represent the growing antivaccination movement’s perspective? The perspective of the corporate lobby? Or a
public health perspective? In a well-negotiated encounter, the intermediary will
determine (1) that the questioner is seeking documents relevant to a specific perspective,
or (2) that that the questioner wants to learn about all the perspectives. In either case,
even the acknowledgment of different perspectives – the epistemological dimension – is
more than is indicated by a typical de-contextualized list of results.
Information retrieval that is based on the domain-based approach to question
negotiation would present the questioner with a series of statements identifying the
assumptions of different knowledge domains’ related to the topic, offering a
contextualized and easily comprehensible way of indicating which knowledge domain the
questioner is most closely aligned with. For instance, the question “Should I vaccinate

308
my child?” could return the following follow-up statements, one or more of which can be
chosen to refine the question:
•

I want to know what the medical research says about the benefits and potential
risks of vaccination.

•

I am worried about the potential danger of vaccinations to my child’s health.

•

I worry about the deterioration of herd immunity.

•

I don’t believe that the government should interfere with my religious or personal
rights.

The following question formulations could then be offered as domain-based variations of
the stated question, as they emerge from the sets of assumptions identified:
•

What do medical experts say about whether I should vaccinate my child?

•

What are the chances that my child will get autism (or other potentially
harmful effects to my child) if I vaccinate them?

•

What are the potential harmful effects to society if individual parents opt out
of vaccinating their children?

•

What right do school districts and the government have to determine whether
parents have to vaccinate their children?

By this method, the questioner gains a sense of the different formulations that their
question could take, in a manner that does not require them to be able to identify the
knowledge domain or domains with which they are most closely aligned but simply
requires them to recognize which version or versions of the question are most akin to

309
what they are asking10. The resulting relevant documents will then present their
information in reference to the underlying knowledge domain assumptions.
The social epistemological approach to question negotiation suggests that an
initial question should be negotiated by producing domain-based variants of the question
that locate the formulation in relation to specific knowledge domains and their
ontological and epistemological assumptions. Search results in the Google search engine
have gone in this direction, offering among its early results, a box called “People also
ask,” which offers the option to preview the search results for other questions that are
presumably related to the initial question. A search for “should I vaccinate my baby” in
Google returns the following related questions in the “People also ask” box:
•

When do babies get their shots?

•

Are vaccinations mandatory in the US?

While the precise method for producing these related questions is unknown, our approach
suggests that question analyses of knowledge domains can inform the selection and
formulation of the related questions according to a diversity of domain approaches to the
topic, rather than or in addition to related questions. The domain-based questions
reformulations listed above, which are variants of the question based on the
epistemological and ontological assumptions of different domains (medical, parenting,
public health, governmental domains) are more aptly reformulations than related
questions, perhaps best described as “Did you mean…” rather than “People also ask.”

10

Alternately, the first set of statements designed to draw out inquirers’ assumptions may be skipped
entirely, with the inquirers directly shown the epistemically informed question formulations related to the
initial keyword search.

310
The domain-based approach offers several advantages over the existing practice
of question negotiation. First, having the option of choosing among various question
formulations of the topic provides a method for determining the knowledge domain of
inquiry without the inquirer having to directly state it. Second, it makes visible the
process of negotiation, which is often done intuitively or invisibly by the information
intermediary, with little revealed by the intermediary between receiving the stated
question and providing search results. The question formulations (one could think of
them as variants of the stated question) are more straightforward for the information
intermediary to present and easier for the questioner to comprehend than a series of
abstruse follow-up questions or prompts. Finally, this method inculcates a greater level
of neutrality into intermediation that, whether human or digital, largely masks the values
and biases that influence the question negotiation and search results, by making visible
the possible domain formulations of the questions and the underlying assumptions.
Overall, the focus of question negotiation is shifted towards a coordinated identification
of the proper domain formulation, rather than attempting to translate the visceral question
into system terms, through the lens of the intermediary.
Inquiry-based learning. Emerging from the constructivist theories of learning
by Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, and others who consider the learner an active, meaningmaking subject rather than a passive recipient of information, inquiry-based learning is a
pedagogical method that is centered around the asking and answering of learnergenerated questions. Inquiry-based learning is built upon the assumption that the most
effective way to learn is by asking and answering questions, rather than simply
memorizing content. Armed with question profiles of knowledge domains, teachers can

311
guide students more clearly as to how to ask domain-relevant questions, how to produce
domain-relevant answers, and upon what assumptions the question and answer
formulations rest. Document relevance is then understood in terms of its relation to the
nature of inquiry in the domain. In this manner, learning to ask the “right” sorts of
questions is not simply the first stage of learning how to be a historian, chemist, or
engineer, but encapsulates the entirety of domain approach to the production of
knowledge.
Several categories of research that can be seen as falling under the broad umbrella
of inquiry-based learning: discipline-based inquiry, project-based inquiry, problem-based
learning, challenge-based learning, and inquiry-based teaching (Friesen & Scott, 2013).
The social epistemological model of domains’ question formulations is reflected in these
research categories, which, apart from their differing emphases on the learner or teacher,
are all variations of the epistemic question forms identified in our question analysis.
Discipline-based inquiry and inquiry-based teaching encompass modes of inquiry and
knowledge production across the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, while
project-based inquiry, problem-based learning, and challenge-based learning are all likely
variant formulations of the goal-tool mode of inquiry identified in our analysis, reflecting
the more frequent use of inquiry-based learning in domains engaging in prescriptive
inquiry. Our analysis shows that the literature domain is also engaged in inquiry, though
of a less obvious sort than neuroscience and computer engineering, and that literature
students can also benefit from inquiry-based learning that gives them the experience of
learning what the literature domain is about by engaging in the practice of literature
scholars, whether literary critics or creative fiction writers. At the same time, the

312
question analysis reveals that critical literary inquiries are structured as an argument
relative to a topic-thesis framework, which suggests that lectures are a relevant
pedagogical technique because they demonstrate how to construct literary arguments.
Inquiry-based learning requires knowledge of the nature of inquiry in the domain, which
is partially revealed by question analysis of the sort developed in this dissertation.
The social epistemological model of domains’ question formulations adds an
enriching perspective to Kuhlthau’s (2007) Guided Inquiry Design, an approach to
designing and implementing inquiry-based learning in schools. The Guided Inquiry
Design Framework translates the evidence-based stages of the Information Search
Process (ISP) model (2004) into phases of inquiry, which serves as a framework for
designing student learning at each phase. As Guided Inquiry is essentially a question- or
problem-based method of learning that is domain-based by nature, there is a natural
affinity between it and the social epistemological model of domains’ question
formulations. Table 65 shows how each stage of the ISP and corresponding Guided
Inquiry phase can also be paired with the specific stages of question and answer
formulation as suggested by the social epistemological model of domains’ question
formulations.

The stages of question formulation orient the stages of the ISP and phases of Guided
Inquiry towards the knowledge domain context. The last column in Table 65 offers
specific guidelines for teaching the inquiry process through the lens of domain-based
question formulation: from familiarization with the question categories, to selection and
exploration of a specific category, to formulation of the question and its answer, and
presentation and evaluation of the question according to domain norms of justified
knowledge. Orientation towards the existing relevant domain context translates the
generalized Guided Inquiry Design phases into actionable and teachable steps.

9.5 Conclusion
Questions convey information (Kearsley, 1976) about the domain’s expectations
that the answer resolves the epistemic indeterminacy expressed in the question content,
and that is produced within the epistemic structure indicated by the question form. The
elegance and efficiency of communication within a domain dictates that the foundational
assumptions of inquiry go unstated; however, their traces are evident in the formulation
of the question as a tool for organizing inquiry. A social epistemological model of
domains’ question formulations resolves the paradox of the question by transforming the
impossible imperative for questioners to state precisely what they do not know, into an
invitation to the practice of questioning as it already exists within the knowledge domain.
The social epistemological model of domains’ question formulations proposed in this

314
chapter emerges from empirical findings of the comparative domain analysis of question
formulations about “memory” in neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertations. It reasserts the centrality of the question as a concept for library and
information science, but reframes the question as a social epistemological tool, one
whose ideal state is relative to the standards of the knowledge domain rather to the “true”
representation of the individual’s visceral need. The model simultaneously offers a
method for the study and representation of knowledge domains according to their
inquiries and the resultant knowledge, and the reframing of individual information
behavior as socio-cognitive in nature, as an interplay between individual subjectivity and
the social lenses through which individuals construct a shared reality with others.
The model suggests that the tension between the stated question and its implicit
context is resolved by making the context explicit, and that the context is the knowledge
domain rather than the individual’s “problematic situation” (Wersig, 1979). By
reclaiming the direct study of questions but from a social epistemological perspective, the
reliability of the question is re-established. Questions convey information about the
knowledge domain’s assumptions related to memory as an ontological object of inquiry
and the ways of knowing about memory. Their formulation is a means of participating
in, or seeking to participate in, a knowledge domain with standards and norms of justified
belief. The proposed model is an initial attempt to capture the social epistemological
nature of questions by representing the relationship between question structure and its
communicative functions in conveying knowledge domains’ assumptions about the
nature of inquiry and the production of knowledge.

315

CHAPTER 10: CONCLUSION

10.1 Overview: The paradoxical nature of questions
This dissertation seeks to re-establish the centrality of the question as a core
concept for library and information science (LIS) by re-framing the question as a social
epistemological tool of inquiry rather than an indication of an individual’s information
need. One broad characterization of library and information science as a knowledge
domain is that it provides intellectual and physical (including digital) access to the
universe of recorded knowledge; it organizes knowledge products in order that they may
be “found” when needed, for the production of new knowledge. Library and information
science research has long acknowledged the importance of the question in soliciting
documents relevant to the formulation of an answer and the difficulty that questioners
have in formulating effective questions. Since the cognitive turn in LIS research,
questions have been more an obstacle than an effective means to finding relevant
documents, unreliable indicators of individuals’ “problematic situations” (Wersig, 1979),
“information gaps” (Dervin, 1992), and “anomalous states of knowledge” (Belkin, 1980).
The essential inability for questioners to formulate effective questions is captured by
what Flammer (1981) identifies as the paradoxical nature of the question: that in order to
ask a question, the questioner already has to have knowledge – of what can be asked and
how to formulate the question in order to solicit an appropriate answer.
By reframing the question from a social epistemological perspective rather than a
cognitive one, the solution to the paradox is revealed as present in its very formulation.
In order to ask a question, the questioner already has to know what can be asked and how

316
to formulate the question. Viewed from a cognitive perspective, this is an impossible
demand to make of the questioner. How can one state what one does not know? But
once the question is reconceived as a social epistemological object, a tool of knowledge
domain-based inquiry, the statement of the question paradox is revealed to reflect
Kearsley’s (1976) observation that “questions also convey information as well as request
it” (p. 355-56), about the indeterminate situations relative to the object of inquiry in the
domain and the epistemic structure for resolving the indeterminacy. A social
epistemological conception of the question locates individual questioners and their
question formulations as relative to the knowledge domains that are the context for
inquiry and the social production of knowledge. What one is seeking to know by asking
and what one needs to know in order to ask are two different kinds of knowledge
(Flammer, 1981). The former is the knowledge that resolves the indeterminate epistemic
situation represented by the domain’s question, acquired through competent inquiry,
while the latter is knowledge of the domain practice of inquiry, which must already be
possessed in order to formulate the question.
The overarching question that guided this inquiry is: how do knowledge domains’
question formulations about “memory” compare and what do they convey about the
answers that follow and the assumptions that precede the questions? Specifically, the
research questions ask: what are the contents and forms of domain’s question
formulations on the topic of “memory,” how do they compare, and what information do
the comparisons convey about the answers that follow and the assumptions that precede?
By these questions, the inquiry is directed towards producing knowledge of how domains
differ in terms of what they ask about “memory” (question content as expressing

317
indeterminate situation) and how they ask (question form as indicating epistemic
structure), and what the comparisons indicate about questions as tools of domain-based
inquiry.
The current comparative study of knowledge domains’ question formulations
about “memory” produces empirical findings on the formulation of questions about
“memory” in three domains: neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering. A
question profile is constructed for each domain, while comparison between the domains
produces a profile of the topic of “memory” as pursued by the three domains.
Additionally, comparisons between the domains reveal the the relationship between
question formulations and the nature of inquiry in the domain. The major findings are
highlighted and synthesized below, providing a picture of the overall significance of this
research. The limitations of the study are detailed, particularly as they suggest a future
direction for research into the domain-based and question-related criteria for relevant
documents.

10.2 Identifying the implicit questions that drive inquiry
Chapter Five details the development of a method for identifying the explicit and
implicit questions that motivate and organize inquiry from the knowledge products of
inquiry and application of the method in a sample of three domains’ dissertation abstracts.
Implicit questions are made explicit based on the principle that all knowledge has an
indirect question correlate (Hookway, 2008). The precise formulation of the question
relies on adaptation of the erotetic definition of questions, as having a communicative
function and logical structure, to a domain level of discourse. The neuroscience,
literature, and computer engineering dissertations’ question formulations about “memory,”

318
as derived from the dissertation abstracts, are listed in Appendix B. They constitute the
main data source for the formation of domains’ question profiles. This method
establishes a consistent and theoretically informed procedure for determining domains’
question formulations about “memory” from the dissertation abstracts, which can be
applied to the knowledge products of other domains.

10.3 Question profiles
Chapter Six and Chapter Seven categorize the neuroscience, literature, and
computer engineering dissertations’ question formulations on the topic of “memory”
according to content and form, producing three domain profiles and six question
categories. The neuroscientific profile of memory-related research, summarized in Table
51, is composed of three question categories: (1) descriptive research question-finding
inquiries about the neural correlates of memory, the neural mechanisms of memory, and
the role of X in memory; (2) prescriptive goal-tool inquiries about memory models or
instruments; and (3) determinative hypothesis-confirmation/disconfirmation inquiries
about Y and memory (where Y are impairing phenomena) and Z and memory (where Z
are enhancing phenomena). According to this question profile, neuroscientific research
about memory is focused around several central questions:
1. What is the neurological basis of memory – what are its types, where is memory
located, and how does it function at the neural level?
2. What tools can be developed to overcome obstacles to the neuroscientific study of
memory, as well as its clinical assessment?

319
3. Do neurological diseases, disorders, age, and traumatic brain injury impair
memory? How so? Can cognitive and pharmacological interventions improve or
enhance memory? How so?
While the question profile is general, based only on fifty-seven dissertation abstracts over
a five-year period, it demonstrates the ability of question analysis to determine the
“known unknowns” or indeterminate epistemic situations that motivate neuroscientific
inquiries into memory and the epistemic structures within which knowledge is produced.
The three question categories reflect neuroscience as a domain that is simultaneously
building up pure knowledge of memory at the neural level, but also applying this
neuroscientific knowledge to the existing study of the human brain, particularly in
regards to the assessment and treatment of the effects of brain disorders or injury on
memory performance. The technologically mediated nature of neuroscientific inquiry
into the memory is reflected in the inquiries aimed at developing new tools to overcome
obstacles to the measurement and modeling of memory. Neuroscience constructs
memory as a material process, the knowledge of which is incrementally built through
scientific observation and experimentation.
Literature dissertations about memory fall into two question categories (Table
55): (1) critical topic-thesis inquiries about memory’s functions and the literary
construction by which the functions are accomplished, and (2) creative themeinterpretation inquires about the nature of memory. The content and form of these
questions describe literary inquiry into memory as asking:

320
1. How is memory constructed by literary texts and towards what purposes? How
do literary texts challenge historical memory? How do they negotiate individual
and collective trauma?
2. What is the nature of memory?
The literature domain thus engages in two complementary forms of inquiry and produces
two complementary forms of knowledge, critical and creative. In both types of inquiry,
memory is constructed as an abstract phenomenon, the object of agents’ perceptions of
their own individual past or events in the collectively held past, malleable and subject to
the purposes of the perceiver as written by the authors of the literary texts.
The computer engineering domains’ questions formulations are of a single type:
prescriptive goal-tool inquiries into the optimization of computer memory systems and
technologies (Table 58). The unifying question for the domain is how can computer
memory be optimized, according to the systems criteria of the use cases in question?
These inquiries produce knowledge of memory as both material object (hardware) and
abstract process (software), reflecting the hybrid nature of the domain as a combination
of computer science and engineering. The hybrid nature is also reflected in the manner of
producing knowledge: through the use of computer simulations to produce abstract
representations of material computer systems in order to predict the behavior of potential
optimizing solutions.

10.4 Questions and answers
The question analysis of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertation research about “memory” supports the proposition that knowledge domains
ask different questions and ask them differently. A formal comparative analysis of the

321
question formulation categories asks, what are the formal similarities that can be
observed across the specific instantiations of question content and form and their relation
to the answers that follow? First, the content of the question determines what constitutes
an answer. If question content is an expression of the domain’s indeterminate situation,
then the answer must resolve the indeterminacy. Question content is expressed as some
type of query about a subject, for example, a query of rationale/explication about the
literary uses of memory. This indeterminate situation can only be resolved by an
explanation about how the literary text uses memory. In this manner, the question
content reveals precisely the information that should constitute the content of the answer.
Second, the form in which the question is presented indicates the form in which
the answer should be produced and presented. Question form indicates the epistemic
structure of competent inquiry towards the production of knowledge, presented as a
specific form of answer. Five question forms are identified in the three domains, which,
in combination with the corresponding answer form, produce different frameworks for
inquiry (Table 66).

In addition to the question and answer, the abstracts display other components of inquiry,
which are defined in relation to the question. Literary questions that present in the form
of a topic produce knowledge by building an argument, consisting of a series of premises
and building to a thesis statement on the topic. Theory and methodology shape the

322
manner in which texts are approached as sources of evidence for the argument. In short,
the question form (topic) dictates the form of the answer (thesis) and the other
components of inquiry that shape the manner of its production.

10.5 Questions and assumptions
Dillon (1990) asserts that questioning “entails sentences just before, so to speak,
and sentences just after – assumptions and answers” (p. 131). Having analyzed the
content and form of questions for what they convey about expected answers in Chapters
Six and Seven, Chapter Eight seeks to make visible the unstated assumptions of domains’
question formulations that emerge through comparative analysis of content and form.
Domains’ question formulations are shaped by, and thus indicate in their comparative
differences, the ontological and epistemological assumptions of the knowledge domain.
Question content implies ontological commitments about “memory” as an object of study
in the domain (Table 60): its substance, features, structures, relations, and conditions of
existence. Three distinct facets of “memory” emerge from the ontological commitments
of the domains’ question formulations. Neuroscience constructs memory as a material,
biological process, multiple and localized patterns of neural activity that are subject to
impairment and enhancement through the mechanism of synaptic plasticity. Literature’s
conception of memory assumes that it is an abstract act, a subjective possession of agents
of remembrance that is performed in order to challenge history, reclaim one’s identity, or
create a new possibility for the future. The computer engineering question formulations
are committed to a dualistic view of memory: material and abstract, hardware and
software, always advancing but ultimately limited in its balance between capacity and
speed.

323
Likewise, question form reveals epistemological presuppositions about the
production of knowledge about “memory” in the three domains (Table 61). The question
forms in the three domains reveal five ways of “knowing” about memory, each assuming
different relationships between knower and known, sources of evidence, and measures of
justification. Neuroscientific inquiry into memory entails three approaches: scientific
observation of memory as a neurological phenomenon, experimental testing of the
relationship between memory and other phenomena, and the development of tools for the
further study of memory and clinical treatment of memory-related problems. The literary
ways of “knowing” are complementary: argumentation of how memory functions and
what it is used for in literary texts, on the one hand, and direct encounter of memory in
literary texts, on the other. Computer engineering question formulations convey that
memory is known through the development of tools for its optimal performance.
In terms of the social dimension of knowledge domains, it is proposed that
questions formulations can also convey information about the social assumptions of the
domain related to relevance, namely what constitutes a relevant question in the domain,
and why. Verification of this proposition is not presented in the current empirical study,
but is proposed as a future topic for research. In this manner, we find that questions are
social epistemological objects, possessing the properties of the knowledge-producing
domain that utilizes it.
The empirical findings detail the manner in which the precise question
formulations of each domain outline the different approaches to “knowing” or “seeing”
“memory,” within and between knowledge domains. The question serves as the linchpin
of inquiry, the entity connecting, constraining, and enabling all of the elements of inquiry

324
within the framework of the knowledge domain’s ontological, epistemological, and social
assumptions. The reconceptualization of questions as tools of inquiry and question
formulations as epistemological objects on which knowledge domains’ assumptions are
inscribed, is presented in Chapter Nine and visualized in Figure 4 as a social
epistemological model of domains’ question formulations. The model has implications
for areas of LIS research and practice including but not limited to domain analysis,
question negotiation, information retrieval, and inquiry-based learning. Most
fundamentally, the reconceptualization of questions as inherently social epistemological
in nature suggests a similar reframing of relevance as a fundamentally social epistemic
phenomenon rather than an individual cognitive one. Armed with a social
epistemological model of domains’ question formulations, renewed focus can be applied
to the notion of relevance as a relation between questions and documents.

10.6 The practical utility of a social epistemological model of questions
The question profiles of neuroscience, literature, and computer engineering
dissertation research about “memory” produced in Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight
demonstrate the utility of question analysis as a method for characterizing knowledge
domains according to what and how they ask. A theoretical model is proposed that
relates the categorical aspects of question formulations (content, form, and relevance) to
the dimensions of knowledge domains (ontological, epistemological, social) as the
context for inquiry and the production of knowledge. The model has particular
implications for several areas of LIS professional practice. It suggests that question
analysis be added to the stable of methods available for those conducting domain
analyses, for the practical sake of those who provide information to specific domains

325
through the practices of knowledge organization. For the area of information
intermediation, the model suggests that question negotiation and information retrieval
systems design re-orient themselves towards the existing norms of domains’ question
formulations rather than seeking to negotiate back towards the “visceral need” (Taylor,
1968) or failing to make visible the assumptions of documents deemed relevant to the
stated question.
In the pedagogical realm, the social epistemological model of questions supports
inquiry-based learning by providing a characterization of knowledge domains according
to what and how they ask, which can serve as guidelines for educators to design
curriculum that teaches how to conduct and evaluate research in any given knowledge
domain. Ultimately, the understanding of questions developed in this dissertation, as
social epistemological tools of inquiry, clarifies the notion of “relevance” as a relation
between the document and the question, rather than a determination of the individual
information seeker.

10.7 Limitations of the study
Several limitations constrain the interpretation of the current research’s findings.
The study of knowledge domains’ question formulations, as determined from the
knowledge products of domain inquiry, reflects several necessary limitations to the scope
and nature of the research. The most serious limitation of the study is that the question
analysis is built upon the questions that motivate and organize inquiry, but these
questions are largely implicit and must be derived from the knowledge products of
inquiry. Erotetic theory is utilized to develop a method for identifying the implicit
question from the components of inquiry presented in dissertation abstracts in a manner

326
that is focused on the epistemic function and structure of the question. Based on the
study’s results, this is deemed an apt method for dealing with the implicit nature of the
scholarly question and preferable to ignoring the question altogether, given its importance
in determinations of document relevance. The peripheral risk of taking the implicit or
tacit question as the direct object of study is that, as an abstract representation of the
indeterminate situation motivating inquiry with respect to the domain, the question
formulations may favor conceptual purity over empirical reality. Even the primary
identification of question formulations is one step abstracted from the data. Once the
question formulations are coded, categorized, further analyzed for what they indicate
about the domain-relative nature of inquiry, the question has become an even more
abstracted representation of the inquiry. Situated as it is in a web of relations to other
question formulations in the domain or in other domains of comparison, it is necessary to
constantly ask whether the question categories reflect the reality of the domain. This is
best accomplished by careful sampling, being attuned to the purpose of the question
analysis – it is meant to inform the construction of an index or classification system? For
what type of user, and in what context? – and soliciting feedback from subject experts.
The method for determining the implicit questions from the dissertation abstracts
produces a static view of domains as represented by their question formulations rather
than a dynamic view of the process of question formation; it is a study of domains’
questions rather than the processes by which these questions were formed. The research
produces a picture of domain norms, rather than any understanding of how and why
individual questioners seek to conform to, challenge or defy domain norms of
questioning. Brice Heath (1982) and Goody (1978) demonstrate the necessity and power

327
of ethnographic approaches to reveal the social substrate of questioning, though their foci
emphasize the social dimension rather than the epistemological or social epistemological.
If the intent is to conduct research into question formation as a social epistemological
process, which research could provide valuable insight into the socio-cognitive
dimension of questioning, ethnographic methods will have to be employed.
The two main bodies of theories that form the theoretical framework of the
research also present some inherent limitations. As a theory and methodology for library
and information science, domain analysis is ultimately oriented towards the production
and use of documents rather than study of the social epistemological phenomena
themselves. A broader sociological approach to the social dimensions of knowledge,
such as is suggested by the study of information-related phenomena as social practices
(Lloyd, 2010), gets closer to the social foundations of cognition. The current research is
limited to the study of the domain, as reflected in their question formulations, without
considering the other elements of a “community of practice” (Wenger, 1998) – the
community and shared practices that constrain and enable the production of the questions.
Ideally, the profiles of knowledge domains that emerge from question analysis should be
interpreted in conjunction with approaches more practical, such as empirical user studies
and bibliometrics studies, and more theoretical such as epistemological and ethnographic
studies of domains’ knowledge practices, to give a full and deep understanding of the
knowledge domains.
Erotetic theory (Brożek, 2011) is called upon in order to provide a theoretical
conception of the question that can be utilized to identify implicit questions across
diverse domains and to formulate them according to the epistemic functions and

328
structures of the knowledge domain. Lacking the formal training of a philosopher, it is
difficult to cast a critical eye on the conceptualization of the question and the finer points
of Brożek’s (2011) argument of the semantico-pragmatic nature of questions as a class of
expressions. As a result, the current use of erotetic theory is admittedly pragmatic in
nature, with the main thrust of Brożek’s (2011) theoretical conception of questions
utilized to our purposes without a deep dialogue with the tradition from which it emerges.
This is perhaps a necessary skill for LIS – or “information studies” – researchers, who
call upon the theories and methodologies of other disciplines to shed light on the full
range of phenomena emerging from human interaction with information. A similar
situation is found in other “studies” fields such as gender studies, ethnic studies,
environmental studies, American studies, etc. and is justified by the definition of the field
as having a topical focus that is best served by multi-disciplinary approaches.

10.8 Future research: Question analysis of domains and document
relevance
The theoretical model emerging from this study merits further research in order to
further extend and refine its representation of question formulations as domain-based
tools of inquiry. As discussed in Chapter Nine, future research may entail the
application of question analysis to single domains at one point in time or over a period of
time, with an emphasis on different types of domains than those studied in the current
research. Alternately, future studies may entail question analysis of a single topic across
domains, but with a greater scope and level of detail than was attained in the current
study. Both of these methods would serve to test the model’s central assumption, of the

329
social epistemological nature of questions, and to refine the variables and relationships
identified in the model’s propositions.
The present investigation asks, what kinds of questions does a knowledge domain
formulate about a topic? What information do the question formulations convey about
the answers that should follow and the assumptions that precede the questions? In
addition to further developing the theoretical model of domains’ question formulations,
future research will revisit the original impetus for the interest in questions as a topic of
study for LIS that remained out of the possible scope for the current investigation: their
relation to document relevance, or what information questions convey about what
constitutes a relevant document and the epistemic criteria for relevance. The interest that
LIS takes in questions is, after all, ultimately pragmatic. The ultimate importance of the
question is in its ability to convey the requirements for an answer and, subsequently, the
criteria for documents relevant to the production of an answer. The question reveals the
nature of the entire inquiry, constraining and enabling the production of knowledge by
establishing the normative domain standards for the production of knowledge. Having
established that questions are tools of domain-based inquiry, additional research will be
conducted to explore the relationship between domains’ question formulations and the
criteria for what constitutes a relevant document. Rather than assume that relevance is a
cognitive property of the individual questioner, relevance criteria will be investigated
with respect to the epistemic nature of knowledge domains’ question formulations. This
research serves as the first step towards an overarching goal of examining how relevance
should be understood as the relation between the question – in its social epistemological
context – and a document.

330

10.9 Conclusion: The informative nature of questions
Questions are the functional interface of inquiry (Horne, 1983), the tool by which
questioners align their thinking, information seeking, and research with the domain
standards for knowledge production. A deep understanding of questions is thus of
fundamental importance to the design of systems and services that provide access to the
organized universe of knowledge, but the utility of the question as a theoretical concept
has been stymied by the paradox of the question: that questioners must know enough to
ask about what they do not know. This dissertation resolves the question paradox by
shifting from a cognitive to a social epistemological approach that understands the
question as a tool of inquiry. Questions are informative of the knowledge domain as a
context for inquiry and the domain criteria for what constitutes an answer and how the
answer should be produced, which in turn inform the criteria for relevant documents and
their use in the production of knowledge. By making visible the knowledge domain as
the context for question formulation, the essentially social nature of knowledge is
acknowledged, and the informative nature of the question is unlocked. As a result, the
centrality of the question as the underlying and organizing force of inquiry becomes
readily apparent: in the alignment of the traditional focus of librarianship and
documentalists on subject expertise with the current trend towards social epistemological
as a foundational philosophy for LIS, in the reorientation of cognitive theories and
models such as question negotiation towards the social context of knowledge domains,
and in the clear definition of relevance as a relation between questions and documents.
The pursuit of a deeper understanding of questions, in all of their omniscience and
specificity, simultaneously produces knowledge about knowledge domains and the

331
products of their inquiries, as well as the formal nature of information- and knowledgerelated phenomena themselves, such as questions and question formulation that emerge
from the comparative study of knowledge domains.

Abstract segment
Using Hebb's theory of neuroplasticity and the
principle of automaticity as theoretical bases, this
experimental study examined the effectiveness of a
specific 12-week neuroscience-based, cognitiveskills computer-training program on the cognitive
processing of 40 elementary students in grades 2-4
with specific learning disabilities (SLD).
This study aims to further elucidate whether verbal
memory will be more severely impacted than
nonverbal memory in this same bilingual pediatric
TBI population. 18 children (M age =11.67 years
(SD =3.7), 61% males, 50% bilingual) were
assessed as part of a longitudinal study evaluating
neuropsychological outcomes in moderate/ severe
pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) at 3 m (Time
1) &12 m (Time 2) post-injury.
This dissertation presents the results of three
original research studies characterizing the effects
of acute, moderate doses of amphetamines on
emotional memory in healthy humans.
Using functional and structural neuroimaging
techniques, I investigated the neural basis of
conceptual memory networks in healthy adults and
in patients with memory impairments resulting
from neurodegenerative disease.
This dissertation tested the hypothesis that PAE
leads to impairments in dentate gyrus-dependent
learning and memory, which is associated with
NMDA receptor--dependent LTP deficits and
NMDA receptor subunit composition alterations in
the dentate gyrus.
Across three experiments, I sought to (1) identify
neural signals at retrieval corresponding to
veridical memory and subsequent distortion and
(2) determine if retrieval preferentially reinforces
memory for information originally studied or
information generated at retrieval.
This thesis tested predictions that the hippocampus
is important in humans for remembering
overlapping spatial events, and that flexible
navigation of spatial routes is supported by key
prefrontal and striatal structures operating in
conjunction with the hippocampus.
Using an associative memory paradigm of faces
and names, the present study was conducted to
investigate the memory deficits reported by ill

GWV in a nationally representative sample
comprised of both ill and well GWV.
The present study sought to determine whether
participants with moderate to severe traumatic
brain injury (MOD/S TBI) would quantitatively
and qualitatively differ from participants with no
brain damage (NBD) in phonemic and semantic
verbal fluency, and whether the potential
differences may be attributed to working memory
(WM) and information processing speed.
Based on prior research, we hypothesized that in
both experiments stress would impair memory
updating.
In this thesis I combine information from each of
these approaches to uncover the role of GC in
learning.
The purposes of the current study were to
investigate the neural substrates of working
memory and object location memory (OLM) after
traumatic brain injury (TBI).
The three studies presented in this dissertation
investigated the practical utility and mnemonic
mechanisms of a novel cognitive strategy designed
to capitalize on self-referential processing: selfimagination.
The work encompassed in this dissertation serves
as an initial investigation for the role of histone
lysine methylation mechanisms in regulating gene
activation and suppression in the medial temporal
lobe (MTL) that includes entorhinal cortex (EC),
hippocampus, and amygdala during memory
consolidation.
This series of experiments developed novel
paradigms involving the integration of
conventional and ethologically relevant forms of
reinforcement in the study of fear conditioning in
rats.
This dissertation aims to characterize the neural
processes in association with the updating and
storage of spatial information.
Using fear conditioning tasks, wherein subjects
learn that a once neutral stimulus predicts an
aversive event, we explored how the acquisition of
an associative memory for a stimulus both depends
upon and affects gamma oscillations.
I investigate how place cells resolve conflicting
neuronal input signals by developing
computational models that integrate synaptic
inputs on two scales.
The present work investigated age differences in
the retrieval and definition of events from
memory.
The overarching aim of this dissertation was to

sample.

severe traumatic brain injury (MOD/S TBI)

examine how emotion regulation goals in

at both a behavioral and neural level.
We aimed to characterize the neural signature of
“successful” cognitive aging (SCA), defined by
working memory performance.
The second goal is to develop the adaptive training
for patients with low visual working memory
(VWM) capacity to improve cognitive abilities and
healthy individuals who seek to enhance their
intellectual performance.
This work examines how episodic memories
accumulate across longer time scales and multiple
presentations by extending classic work of withinlist effects of lists comprised of once-presented
items.
This dissertation describes a series of four
experiments that use electrophysiological
techniques to deconstruct familiarity memory in
order to reveal the underlying operations of
fluency.
This dissertation investigates the functional
processes of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) and
the striatum (the input nucleus of the basal
ganglia) during associative learning and memory.
This dissertation addresses the age-related
reorganization of spatial and verbal working
memory using three different, but complementary,
methods.
Suspecting that Bekkers and Stevens failed to
consider a concept that was not available to them,
electrical compartmentalization of distal dendrites
and regenerative NMDA spikes, I reexamined
their predictions with inclusion of factors required
for dendritic spikes during signal read-out.
The ability to hold information in mind over a
short period of time for future use is referred to as
working memory (WM). This term typically refers
to the maintenance of item information, such as
locations or words. More recently, investigators
have emphasized the importance of rules that
establish relationships between those items and the
pending response. This dissertation presents a
series of studies investigating how our brains are
able to flexibly hold or change the relevant rules
held in mind.
The present dissertation aims to delineate the
influence of reward and punishment motivation on
human declarative memory encoding and its
underlying neural circuitry.
Baseline data for 71 individuals with consensusdiagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
enrolled in the Measuring Independent Living in
the Elderly Study (MILES) was utilized to
investigate patterns of verbal and visual learning

modulate autobiographical recall at both a
behavioral and neural level.
What is the neural signature of SCA, as
defined by working memory performance?
What adaptive training can be developed
for patients with low VWM capacity to
improve cognitive abilities and healthy
individuals who seek to enhance their
intellectual performance?
How do episodic memories accumulate
across longer time scales and multiple
presentations?
What are the underlying neurocognitive
interactions between fluency and
familiarity memory?
What are the functional processes of the
MTL and the striatum (the input nucleus of
the basal ganglia) during associative
learning and memory?
How do spatial and working memory
reorganize due to aging in the human brain?
Whether Bekkers and Stevens alternate
hypothesis, that information could be stored
by the bound-but-blocked (non-conducting)
state of the NMDA receptors, is confirmed
with inclusion of factors required for
dendritic spikes during signal read-out

and memory, as well as cognitive predictors of

In light of this shortcoming and more
contemporary findings indicating a role of the 5HT system in facilitating behavioral therapy for
fear and anxiety related conditions, this
dissertation will examine how new learning
associated with the extinction of fear related
memories may be mediated via actions involving
5-HT3 receptors and possible changes in
GABAergic neurotransmission.
This thesis seeks to understand normative
developmental aspects of memory systems
implicated in psychopathology of anxiety and
post-traumatic stress disorders. A common single
nucleotide polymorphism in brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, BDNF Va166Met, is
highlighted due its associated role in aberrant fear
learning in both humans and animal models, as is
the developmental transition into and out of
adolescence, when anxiety and affective disorders
are most prevalent in human populations.
Here, we wanted to further characterize the
contribution of Cdh1 to learning and memory at
both developmental and adult stages.
The present study examined prospective memory
(ProM) and the relationship between ProM and
everyday functioning in 33 Parkinson’s disease
(PD) patients and 26 demographically comparable
adults.
To explore the role of small RNAs in memoryrelated synaptic plasticity we carried out massive
parallel sequencing to profile the small RNAs of
Aplysia.
This dissertation will demonstrate how
psychostimulants can modulate memory processes
and create addiction-like memories in mice.

The, current study largely replicated findings from
previous work that showed associative inference is
possible with and without awareness.
It has been suggested that visual attention can only
be affected by consciously perceived events;
however, we identified three novel and surprising
results about the nature of attention and how it can

We find little evidence to support temporally

supports the view that if the hippocampus is
initially involved in learning a memory, it will
always be necessary for accurate retrieval of that
memory.
A computational cognitive neuroscience model is
proposed, which models episodic memory based
on the mammalian brain.
One hypothesis that has been proposed to account
for these inconsistent findings is that the response
of some brain regions subserving working
memory (WM) task performance to parametrically
increasing WM load, most critically dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, may in fact be non-monotonic in
nature; that is, at sufficiently high loads activation
in these regions may begin to decrease…. To date,
this hypothesis has not been directly tested;
however, I report here the results of a series of
studies using the self-ordered working memory
task that clearly demonstrate such an 'inverted-U'
in healthy participants that is absent in patients

This dissertation introduces PHiLOSoftware , a Low Power,
High Performance, Reliable, and Secure Virtualization Layer
for On-Chip Software-Controlled Memories. PHiLOSoftware
allows designers to build memory allocation policies to
efficiently manage the distributed on-chip memory resources at
a high level.
A hardware verified simulation suite is developed to accurately
model and evaluate the behavior of this buffer-on-board
memory system. A study of this design space is performed to
determine optimal use of the resources involved.
The memory hierarchy extends from on-chip caches through
persistent storage in I/O subsystems, and we analyze and
develop models of shared data and cache use to understand
how parallel applications interact with hardware and why
parallel scalability is often poor. Through this lens of these
memory models, we develop dynamic optimization techniques
for disparate layers of the memory hierarchy.
This dissertation presents a novel cache prefetching model, out
of context cache prefetching, that allows for prefetching data
beyond context switch boundaries by predicting the next
runnable process…. The goal of Out of Context Cache
Prefetching and Inter-Context Eviction Prefetching is to
eliminate context-switch misses.
This thesis presents four different approaches to design and
analyze robust low voltage SRAM: SRAM analysis method
improvement, SRAM bitcell development, SRAM peripheral
optimization, and advance device selection.
There is a large body of research in the psychology domain
regarding the structure of cognitive resources. In particular,
Baddeley's multi-component model of working memory
describes a separation between the resources used for verbal
and non-verbal storage and processing. It is likely that seminatural locomotion techniques (in virtual reality systems)
require some of these resources, which will then be
unavailable for concurrent tasks. A pair of studies was
conducted, investigating the cognitive resource requirements
of several atomic locomotion movements by manipulating the
user interface and field of view.
In this dissertation, we have devised an innovative approach to
dynamically set supply voltages and refresh cycle for Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM) and 1T1C embedded
Dynamic Random Access Memory (eDRAM). The approach
helps us to reduce power consumption.

P: Programming languages implement memory (or consistency)
models that require other memory references to be executed in
order, beyond those guaranteed to execute in order by the
relaxed consistency model processor, i.e., they have a stricter
memory model. An extreme example of a stricter memory
model is the sequentially consistent memory model. A stricter
model is thought by many to be easier to reason about than a
relaxed model. Current processors provide fence instructions
that allow these stricter orders to be enforced.
A: We present a flow-based fence insertion algorithm for
effectively enforcing the orders required.
P: Spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs)
have potential for low power, nonvolatile dense memory and
logic. But many proposals require fine grain integration with
CMOS, thereby increasing fabrication costs and circuit
overhead.
A: We introduce magnetic memory and logic circuits (mLogic)
that have minimal connections to CMOS.
P: Main memory capacity is becoming a critical issue for modern
server systems. Unfortunately, current trends suggest that
meeting these capacity requirements using DRAM will not be
ideal. DRAM consumes significant amounts of energy (idle,
refresh, and precharge energies) and will soon reach its density
limit. Many researchers in industry and academia point to
Phase-Change Memory (PCM) technology as a promising
replacement for DRAM. PCM is byte-addressable as DRAM,
but presents higher density and lower idle power consumption
than DRAM. However, PCM is also slower than DRAM and
has limited endurance. For these reasons, hybrid memory
systems that combine a small amount of DRAM and a large
amount of PCM have become attractive.
A: In this dissertation, we propose two hybrid memory systems for
servers. The first system (called Rank-aware Page Placement or
RaPP) is a hardware-driven page placement policy.
P: The emerging Phase Change Memory (PCM) technology is
drawing increasing attention due to its advantages in nonvolatility, byte-addressability and scalability. It is regarded as a
promising candidate for future main memory. However, PCM's
write operation has some limitations that pose challenges to its
application in memory. The disadvantages include long write
latency, high write power and limited write endurance.

memory models in parallel

How, conceived as spaces of memories, do the United States and Mexico become the
loci of cultural becoming for France and the United States?
L18
How does the European postcolonial and migrant literature I read claim the history of
the Jewish Question and Holocaust memory as critical resources for Europe's new
migrants and diasporic communities?
To challenge historical memory
L2
How are the uBumbano using the idiom of heritage, as well as a traditional idiom of
kinship that has come to be handed down as a Zulu language for mediating social
relations by the uBumbano, in ways that challenge the centrality given to Shaka in
narrations of the past?
L5
How has post-war literature created an alternate and competing memory of Fascism's
twenty-year rule?
L10
How do postmodernist narratives of memory in Graham Swift's Waterland, Salman
Rushdie's Midnight's Children, and Amitav Ghosh's The Shadow Lines retrieve the
stories of those who have been lost or forgotten in official history and refigure the
temporal and spatial imaginary?
L20
How do writers use highly imaginative crónicas as a means to uphold or challenge
official memory and history and to propose "alternative" readings of the nation during
Mexico's centenary and bicentenary commemorations of Independence of 1910, 1921,
and 2010?
To negotiate trauma
L1
What are the poetics of traumatic hindsight and the literary devices that three texts
utilize to negotiate the fragmentation that characterizes the traumatic aftermath and
signify the necessity of a retrospective gaze towards the atrocious past?
L3
How do these women writers use various aesthetics in portraying the landscape of
memories to represent, redefine, and transcend repetition, trauma, and loss, and to
renegotiate the reality of the past, present, and future?
L15
How does a woman writer memorialize her own traumatic history, when it happens to
be part of a larger History dominated by male narratives (as far as Holocaust and
slavery go), or when it is altogether silenced (as is the case for madness and
institutionalization)?

How are memory and history embedded in images of the built environment? How, in
turn, does this spatialization of the past contribute to a criticism of traditional linear
narration?
How does intergenerational, trans-temporal trauma become re-narrativized and reenvisioned over time in four symbolic sites of slavery (five countries)--Africa (Ghana
