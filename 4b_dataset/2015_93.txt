Dedications
To my parents who nurtured my curiosity, listened to me talk about what I thought was
important (or in-te-rest-ing), and ensured I developed a perspective on life that values
critical thinking as well as kindness: I hope to do justice to all the love and care you’ve
put into me and Bud, not only with my work, but with the way I live. Thank you for
being such wonderful role models for every aspect of life and for providing unending
support for all my endeavors. Thank you for listening.
Daddy-O, it has been so helpful and grounding to get to hear your perspective on this
process. Who knows what will happen 30 years from now with the next in the Magee
line, but I will do what I can to ensure we all continue to be smart and respectful thinkers
like you.
Momma, you have helped me navigate one of the trickiest parts of life so far with your
unfailing support and wise reminders to focus on the long-term big picture. Thank you
for helping me to “just keep swimming” and for your regular reminders of your love.
Bud, thank you for being a fellow explorer in this world. I am so glad I’ve got someone
who shares my perspective and interests, whether it be for music, information policy, or
college sports. Your pursuit of continued education inspired my own, and I look forward
to our next set of adventures. I’ve got your back too.
Te amo, mi familia.
Greg, you were such a wonderful surprise during the dissertation process. I am so grateful
for the support, kindness, and understanding you continue to show me. I love you and
can’t wait to get to all that’s just around the bend with you. “You and me, we’re in a club
now.”
To the teens who helped me develop this dissertation, as well as those I’ve worked with
over the years: thank you for continually renewing my optimism for the future with your
thoughtfulness and kindness, and for sharing your ideas and perspectives with me. I

Abstract
The Everyday Life Information Ecologies
and Continuums of Technology Use of Teens from an Urban Setting
Rachel M. Magee

This dissertation examines how teens from an urban setting interact with technology as a
part of their everyday lives, and how people, practices, values, and technologies intersect
within the contexts of their technology use. Attention is focused on their continuums of
technology use, ranging from heavy use to non-use. The participants include nineteen
teens from an urban area in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, who
participated in the study during the 2014-2015 academic school year. This research
employs a variety of methods to learn more about these participants’ experiences with
technology, including a survey, voicemail and photo diaries, a creative activity, and a
semi-structured interview. The resulting data is analyzed using thematic analysis and
directed qualitative content analysis, as well as supplemental visual analysis. Several
contributions come from this analysis, including a deeper understanding of how teens
express values impacting their continuums of technology use, a portrait of teens’ diverse
uses of smart phones, and a description of audience as key factor for teens’ content
creation and sharing literacy practices. The work also identifies four factors that influence
teens’ decisions to use or limit their technology use: local policy and access, affective
state, life stage and goals, and relationships. These contributions and their implications
are discussed, as well as details about how these concepts can contribute to future work
and engagement with teens in research, practice, and personal settings.

1
CHAPTER 1: PROBLEM STATEMENT AND FRAMING
1.1 Problem Statement
Fueled by popular conceptions of those with access to technology, much
conversation about today’s teenagers, or teens, assumes they are skilled and frequent
technology users. Early descriptions discussed youth as “‘native speakers’ of the digital
language of computers, video games and the Internet” (Prensky, 2001, p. 1). However,
researchers are increasingly challenging the notion that all youth exhibit advanced
technology enthusiasm and expertise (Selwyn, 2009; Agosto & Abbas, 2010). While
American teens today are “growing up in a media ecology where digital and networked
media are playing an increasingly central role…there are a diversity of ways in which
U.S youth inhabit a changing and variegated set of media ecologies” (Ito et al., 2010, p.
30). Additionally, the methods of access and numbers of technologies are increasing:
recent work shows that as of 2015 in the United States, “nearly three-quarters of teens
have or have access to a smartphone,” with 91% of teens going “online at least
occasionally;” from this group, 94% go online via a mobile device at least daily (Lenhart
et al., 2015, p 3).
One element of these variegated experiences with information and technology is
what I have come to think of as continuums of technology use. These continuums range
with different levels of use and non-use, and are often framed as technology adoption and
non-adoption or rejection. Individuals have different continuums of use with different
technologies; an individual may use her phone quite regularly, but might interact with her
e-reader once a week. Research into the different levels of technology use typically
focuses on specific types of technologies, such as computers in general (Selwyn, 2006) or

2
social network sites (SNSs) (Hargittai, 2007; Lampe, Vitak, & Ellison, 2013). In contrast,
the concept of continuums of use acknowledges the idea that individuals have a variety of
experiences with a variety of technologies. Continuums are important to examine not
only because they highlight the diversity of technological experiences, but also because
technology practices are an important part of information practices. These continuums of
use operate within what Nardi & O’Day term information ecologies (1999). These
ecologies are generated when people, values, and technologies combine with practices,
and are systems that develop “in a particular local environment” (Nardi & O’Day, 1999,
p. 49). As such, the resulting information ecologies are varied and contextual.
This dissertation work centers on the information ecologies in the everyday lives
of teens from an urban setting, following in the steps of Savolainen (1995), who
pioneered the concept of Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS), and Agosto and
Hughes-Hassell (2006a, 2006b), who extended the ELIS concept to teenagers’
information needs. The ELIS theory takes into account the idea that our interactions with
information often occur outside of work situations (Savolainen, 1995). Employing this
perspective places value on everyday life contexts and priorities. For school-aged youth,
school can be considered equivalent to work (Agosto & Hughes Hassell 2006a, 2006b),
thus ELIS experiences occur outside of school. Taking this perspective recognizes the
importance of a variety of experiences, broadening from the significant research focus on
academic contexts (Gasser, Cortesi, Malik, & Lee, 2012; Kuhlthau, 1991). However, it is
important to consider that life contexts are not distinct, and scholarly work finds that
academic, social, and personal contexts can overlap and inform practices that span across
those contextual boundaries (Gasser et al., 2012). Influenced by social factors as well as

3
increasingly available technology and media, the blurring of these contexts has myriad
implications, including that for those interested in academic outcomes, studying nonacademic contexts is important and revelatory. More broadly, information practices are
increasingly unbound by location, technological constraints, and timing, meaning that
research into these practices needs to take this flexibility into account and examine
multiple contexts of use, from work to school to home to social settings.
In addition to focusing on the importance of the everyday life contexts, this
dissertation acknowledges that many teens are at a formative time in their lives,
experiencing biological, cognitive, and social changes (Subrahmanyam, & Šmahel,
2011). Teens are often developing individual identities while still remaining connected to
their family units, playing with rules and boundaries, and exercising their independence.
As Turkle highlighted, this exploration of identity also occurs online (1997). Human
centered traditions in both Information Science and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
call for an understanding of the ways people use and experience technologies and
systems, as well as how values impact these experiences. Teens are an important group
that deserves such attention. However, research with youth is sometimes seen as difficult
or hard to conduct. This rises from multiple perceptions, including the difficulty of
working with ethics review boards to achieve approval for study with youth (Rode,
2009), or as critiqued by Amato and Ochiltree (1987), the perceptions of youth
participants’ developmental, experiential, or communicative skills . Other researchers
describe teenagers as “tough” (Bassett, Beagan, Ristovski-Slijepcevic, & Chapman,
2008). Likely influenced by these perceptions, doing research with youth is sometimes
overlooked.

4
Within this understudied group are teens, whose experiences are sometimes
studied via the reminiscence of adults. McMillan and Morrison conducted an engaging
study examining how college students, who they argue are “close enough to childhood to
remember it well,” recall growing up with internet technologies (2006, p. 74). This is
valuable, but it is also important to examine experiences of teens while they are actually
experiencing them. When research does work directly with teens, it may not treat them as
independent, self-aware participants. Hazel argues that research with youth “has
traditionally neglected the views and voices of the young people themselves,” treating
them as “passive subjects whose opinions are peripheral to the understanding of the
issues which fundamentally affect them” (1995, p. 2).
Gasser, Cortesi, Malik, and Lee describe research examining the concept of
information quality from an adult perspective as “adult-normative,” and note that studies
with this perspective posit that “information quality is defined by what makes
information valuable for adults” (2012, p. 31). Hazel frames this kind of work as
“grounded in the socio-legal concerns of the adult researcher” and focused on the “‘care’
of children, rather than directly involving the active participation of young people in the
fieldwork,” which “mirrors” societal paternalistic attitudes to youth (1995, p. 2).
While research that emphasizes adult perspectives has its place, work that engages
with youth perspectives is vital for understanding their practices and needs. In one
example, the Berkman Center’s Youth and Media Project worked with the Pew Research
Center to connect the voices and perceptions of young people collected in in-person focus
groups to large-scale survey data (Madden, Lenhart, Cortesi, et al., 2013). Ethnographic
work like boyd’s examination of youth and social media (2008, 2014), the extensive set

5
of case studies reported on in Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out (Ito et al.,
2010), and Livingstone’s examination of youth content creation (2008) also serve as
inspiring examples. By deeply engaging with teens’ perspectives on technology, research
can help reveal important gaps in the dialogue between teens and the rest of their world,
and could also reveal new strategies for information provision, implications for design of
technological systems and devices, and opportunities for supporting teens’ use of
information and education via those technologies.
The ELIS and information ecologies perspectives contribute to a compelling
framework for examining teens’ everyday life continuums of technology use because
they call for a broadening of the contextual elements that are considered in this work.
Information and technology practices are now integrated into mobile, dynamic
environments that blur the lines between contexts and purposes as well as social
relationships and values. These environments involve potentially staggering amounts of
information and an ever-growing number of technological devices and systems. This is
particularly important as “few studies to date have sought the ‘big picture’ in identifying
the multiple and interrelated influences on young people’s internet use” (Livingstone &
Helsper, 2010), or technology use more broadly construed.
1.2 Research Questions
In order to help find that “big picture” and develop a rich understanding of teens’
experiences with technology and the ways they contribute to their everyday life
information ecologies, this dissertation is focused on the following research questions:
1)

How do the people, practices, values, and technologies in teens’ everyday lives
inform and/or interact with their continuums of use?

6
2)

What choices and preferences do teens have about their everyday life technology
access and continuums of use?

3)

How do teens’ choices, preferences, and contexts impact the role of information
in their everyday lives?

1.3 The Study
To address these questions, I developed and implemented an original research
study, working with teens from a large city in the Mid-Atlantic region in the United
States. I began recruiting participants in December 2013 and finished data collection in
June 2014 (all data was collected during the same academic year), ending the study with
a total of 19 participants. These participants came from a variety of neighborhoods,
academic backgrounds, and ranged in age from 15-18. One participant self-identified as
Asian, twelve self-identified as Black/African American, one as Black/African American
and Hispanic/Latino, two as Black/African American and American Indian/Alaska
Native, one as Hispanic/Latino, and one as Caucasian. One participant’s demographics
are unrecorded, and more details about the participants are available in Table 2 in
Chapter 3. During the study, all participants were attending high school. Participants
enrolled in the study for approximately two weeks, during which time they completed a
survey, a voicemail and emailed photo diary study, a creative activity where the
developed an artistic response to a prompt, and a semi-structured interview. The
participants responses were analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006),
directed qualitative content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) using Schwartz’s values
theory (2007), with additional supplemental visual analysis (Banks, 2001).

7
1.4 Key Terminologies
This study includes a variety of terms that I briefly discuss here for the purposes of
orientation. Note that some terms are addressed in more detail in later parts of the
dissertation.
1.4.1 Teens. Varying terms including youth, teenagers, teens, adolescents,
minors, and young adults, are used to refer to the participants of this study, and they all
have slightly different connotations. Both adolescent and minor have adult tones that can
seem to indicate a removed or even authoritarian perspective. I designed this study to
engage with teens, and to value their perspectives, attitudes and experiences. As such, I
want to avoid terminology that has these kinds of implications. Additionally, for the
purposes of this research, the terms youth and minor are too broad as the participants
were 15-18 years of age. I have and will continue to use teens to refer to the study
participants, as this has an approachable tone and it is more commonly used than other
available terms by young people themselves. When discussing other scholars’ work, I’ve
taken care to employ the terminology they use, and so the section on relevant work
includes a variety of terms, most often youth. Additionally, when discussing the
implications of this work and my own future work in Chapter Seven, I use the term youth.
This is because I believe the discussions in this section are relevant for work with a wider
variety of ages, and because I do not plan to limit my future work to teens alone.
1.4.2 Urban. The participants in this study all lived in a large city in the MidAtlantic region of the United States. Various literatures and organizations refer to this
kind of area as urban (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2010), and the federal government uses
the term for their classifications of localities (United States Census Bureau, 2015; United

8
States Department of Agriculture, 2013). However, there is some discontent with the
term, typically expressed in popular culture outlets and connected with tensions in the use
of this terminology to euphemistically refer to individuals of Black/African American
descent (Nolan, 2012). There have been critiques of how the term has been used for
marketing (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2010; Quinn & Pawasarat, 2001), as well as in the
music industry (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2010). I am sensitive to the complicated
nature of the term, but am using it for this work because it is the most commonly used
terminology for research conducted in this kind of context. This allows for comparison
with other research conducted with teens from these areas. In this study, the term is used
to refer only to the kind of place where the participants lived, rather than the teens
themselves – an important distinction. This classification is based on the 2010 Census
classification of an urbanized area, which is defined as “50,000 or more people in a given
area” (United States Census Bureau, 2015). It is also important to note that the teens in
this study did not use this terminology, but there was no emic term that was preferred.
1.4.3 Continuums of use. I use continuums of use to indicate that there are many
different levels of technology use, and that individuals have different levels of use with
each technology with which they interact. Having high levels of interaction with one
technology does not necessarily mean high levels of use of another. This terminology
includes all levels of use, including heavy, moderate, light, infrequent, low, and
importantly, non-use of technology. While frequency is an important element,
continuums also acknowledge that there are differences in practices and kinds of uses.
Wyatt argues that “users of digital technologies need to be conceptualised along a
continuum with degrees and types of involvement that may change” (Wyatt, 2014, p. 2).

Building on the literature examining technology non-use, I selected the terminology of
“continuums of use” for a variety of reasons. A continuum is “a continuous thing,
quantity, or substance; a continuous series of elements passing into each other” (OED
Online, 2015). This helps to clarify that I do not consider technology use to be binary, as
use or non-use. The plural indicates that there are multiple continuums for multiple
technologies. Selwyn discusses “the fluidity of people’s relationships with technology”
(2006, p. 289), and I feel that this terminology recognizes that flow. This also allows for
discussion of changes in technology use over time, such as the practice of limiting
technology use. More details on terminology for technology use levels are discussed in
Chapter Two, Section 2.4.
1.4.4 Values. There are many different ways to conceive of values, as evidenced
by the wide variety of research approaches to the concept discussed in Chapter Two,
Section 2.5. For the purposes of this study, I rely on Schwartz and Bilsky’s work
describing values as “(a) concepts or beliefs, (b) about desirable end states or behaviors,
(c) that transcend specific situations, (d) guide selection or evaluation of behavior or
events, and (e) are ordered by relative importance” (1990, p. 551). More details on values
and the ways individual values are defined in this study are available in Chapter Three,
Section 3.6.2 and throughout Chapter Four.
1.5 Structure of the Dissertation
This document reports on the design, implementation, analysis, and contributions
of the study described above. The structure of the document is as follows:
Chapter Two goes into more detail about the ELIS theory (Savolainen, 1995) and
the information ecologies perspective (Nardi & O’Day, 1999), putting these frameworks

10
in conversation with literatures from information science and computing/HCI work. The
chapter starts with a broad perspective on technology use, then narrows to discuss work
specifically examining teens – both their technology practices and their information
practices. The chapter ends with a discussion of some of the open opportunities for future
research.
Chapter Three focuses on the methods used for data collection, including the
survey, diary study, creative activity, and semi-structured interview, discussing why they
were selected and how they were organized for the study. This chapter also goes into
detail about how recruiting was conducted, and includes information about the teens who
participated in the study. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the analysis
methods used, including thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006), directed qualitative
content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) using Schwartz’s theory (2007) as a
framework for coding, and supplementary visual analysis (Banks, 2001).
Chapter Four discusses the information ecologies of the teens in this study,
discussing the local environments of the participants and then detailing their various
values expressions. The chapter includes a discussion using values as a lens to frame how
teens discuss the other elements of their information ecologies, including people,
technologies, and practices. The chapter concludes by describing how teens’ values in
relation to their perception of technologies impacts their continuums of use.
Chapter Five extends on the discussion of teens’ practices by examining teens’
continuums of technology use and makes connections between the participants’
technology practices and their information practices. It first addresses the participants’
diverse smart phone practices, then touches on the ways teens use technology for

11
informational and communication purposes. It next discusses how social factors impact
teens’ literacy practices, and how teens engage in the full spectrum of information
literacy skills through content creation and sharing. The chapter concludes with a
description of four factors that influence teens’ technology limiting and non-use
practices.
Chapter Six includes a discussion and interpretation of the findings of this
research, as well as a presentation of implications of this work for a variety of
stakeholders invested in supporting teens, including parents, family, and caregivers;
library staff and educators; and researchers.
Chapter Seven concludes this dissertation with an overview of the findings of the
study, a discussion of the limitations of this work, and a description of opportunities for
future work. The chapter concludes by sharing a creative activity submission from one
the participants in the study.

CHAPTER 2: CONTEXTUALIZING RELEVANT LITERATURE AND
EXISTING GAPS
2.1 Introduction
In this section, I go into detail about how the different literatures that examine
teens’ everyday life technology use and information practices relate to the framing of this
dissertation, making connections between computing/HCI research and information
science. These works are organized topically. I first address general research on
technology use, touching on the implications of a human-centered orientation to research,
and contextualizing the ideas used to frame this dissertation research. Next I discuss the
ways values have been examined in research and interact with technology use, and other
factors that impact technology use. I then focus on continuums of technology use,
ranging from non-use through heavy technology adoption. Next I discuss research that
examines teens and technology, first focusing on large scale work, and then addressing
studies of technologies and technological practices as well as physical contexts of
technology use. I then discuss domestic HCI research, and work examining teens and
everyday life information practice. Next I address gaps in the literature, discussing study
contexts and the lack of focus on teens, as well as the focus on academic settings, closing
the discussion of literature with a description of some of the issues associated with
studying teens using an adult perspective. Finally, I conclude the chapter by detailing the
ways these various literatures come together to inform my perspective on this dissertation
project.

13
2.2 A Human-Centered Orientation and Its Implications
Both HCI and Information Science have developed increasingly sophisticated
ways of researching how technologies, systems, and the people that use them interact.
Both research domains have amplified their emphasis on studying users in an effort to
improve the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of technologies and
systems. Within both domains, this is associated with a de-emphasis on work settings and
an increasing focus on new contexts of practice. Within HCI, this is seen as an important
element in the transition from second wave HCI to third wave HCI. Susanne Bødker
describes second wave HCI as having a focus on “groups working with a collection of
applications” and contrasts this to “third wave HCI” in which
“the use context and application types [of computers] are broadened, and
intermixed. Computers are increasingly being used in the private and public
spheres. Technology spreads from the workplace to our homes and everyday lives
and culture (Bertelsen, 2006). New elements of human life are included in the
human-computer interaction such as culture, emotion and experience (Norman,
2002)” (Bødker, 2006, p. 2).
The importance of the individual and society using a technology is seen in
multiple approaches and perspectives, including participatory design and user-centered
design. Indeed, the “H” in HCI stands for human, and the domain as a whole is invested
in designing with people in mind. The term human-centered computing is a newer
approach to computing that aims “for the design of computing systems with a human
focus from beginning to end” (Jaimes, Sebe, & Gatica-Perez, 2006, p. 1). As computing
technologies enter more people’s lives, design communities increasingly recognize the
importance of developing technology for and with people.
There has been a similar trajectory within Information Science. Here, the concept
of information practice builds upon the history of research into information seeking and

14
behaviors, growing with expanding interest in human-centered work. Work studying the
ways people interact with information has in some instances been termed research into
information seeking, implying a directed choice that unfortunately washes over the
myriad information practices that exist. According to Case, “information seeking is a
conscious effort to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your knowledge”
(2007, p. 5).
During the mid-1960s, many scholars shifted to the term information behavior to
indicate more fluidity in the way people interact with information outside of simple
seeking (Savolainen, 2007, p. 112). Information behavior can be described as
“encompassing information seeking as well as the totality of other unintentional or
passive behaviors (such as glimpsing or encountering information), as well as purposive
behaviors that do not involve seeking, such as actively avoiding information” (Case,
2007, p. 5). Savolainen (2007) examines the differences between information behavior
and information practice, and argues for adoption of the term information practice, which
is informed by social constructionism and accepts that people may not be conscious of
the ways in which they interact with information. He argues that the term information
practice serves as a “major alternative to the dominant discourse” but that it has not made
much impact on the field (Savolainen, 2007, p. 127). Despite this lack of widespread
adoption, I use this term because it places importance on the social factors influencing
information ecologies, and allows for recognition of continuums of technology use.
In contrast to the constraint implied by the perspectives associated with terms like
seeking and behavior, and similar to HCI’s widening from an early focus on computing
systems to consideration of the people who use them, in the late 1980s the domain of

15
Information Science began to coalesce around the idea that users deserved in-depth study
and research focus. Dervin and Nilan’s landmark work Information Needs and Uses put a
spotlight the fact that most Information Science work employed a systems-centered
perspective when defining needs and uses, and highlighted approaches documented in
Information Science research literature published in the late 1970s and first half of the
1980s that “demand[ed] new ways of looking at users and linking systems to them”
(1986, p. 24). As Dervin and Nilan state, “the struggle to break out of worldviews that
constrain professional views of users have been forged on many fronts, with each small
step enriching the next” (1986, p. 24).
This dissertation endeavors to extend on this trajectory by examining technology
and information practices informed by Everyday Life Information Seeking theory,
introduced by Savolainen in 1995. Recognizing people and the diversity of contexts in
which they conduct information practices, the ELIS concept accounts for the idea that
information seeking often occurs outside of work situations: “practices of nonwork
information seeking may be associated with a plethora of important activities not related
to professional tasks, for example, health care and hobbies” (1995, p. 259). Using Pierre
Bourdieu’s concept of habitus (1984), Savolainen describes “the habits of information
seeking” as contributing to a “part of mastery of life, often rooted in an unconscious level
and not wholly subject to reflection” (1995, p. 265). Savolainen states that “the concept
of ELIS refers to the acquisition of various informational (both cognitive and expressive)
elements which people employ to orient themselves in daily life or to solve problems not
directly connected with the performances of occupational tasks” (1995, p. 267).

16
Building on the shared human-centered attitude that exists in both HCI and IS,
this work extends the “everyday life” focus of the ELIS theory to the domain of HCI,
raising the non-work, non-school contexts of information practice to the same level of
importance as academic and work pursuits. To do so, this work combines ELIS theory
with the information ecologies framework introduced by Nardi and O’Day (1999). These
authors identify four main elements of information ecologies: people, practices, values,
and technologies, which operate within local environments. This approach emphasizes
that there are important social factors in how we experience technology, and that a single
technology does not operate in a vacuum but is impacted by and impacts other
technologies. The authors also argue that the term ecology recognizes the continued
evolution of our socio-technical experiences.
Connecting these two perspectives helps to frame how we think about people and
the technologies in their lives. For many people, information practices, including
technology practices, are now integrated into a dynamic and unbounded environment that
blurs the lines between contexts and purposes, social relationships and values. This
involves potentially staggering amounts of information, and includes an ever-growing
number of technological devices and systems. Indeed, these are important perspective
when trying to develop a more holistic understanding of how people interact with
technologies to access, use, create, and share information.
2.3 Contextualizing ELIS and Information Ecologies
Recognizing that our experiences with technologies and information are so fluid
and integrated, this dissertation seeks to focus on information ecologies in teens’
everyday lives as an important example of where everyday life information practices

17
occur. Savolainen’s (1995) work contributed a new perspective that expanded what was
considered when researching how people interacted with information. Rather than
focusing only on work tasks, this approach recognized the importance of understanding
how people engage with information about their personal interests, hobbies, and health.
Agosto’s and Hughes-Hassell’s (2006a, 200b) work directly connects this perspective to
teens by considering their academic tasks as similar to work. The ELIS perspective is
concerned with the ways and reasons individuals interact with everyday life information
needs. While the theory was first proposed in 1995, working to understand these kinds of
information interactions is still a relevant goal.
Wireless connectivity and mobile devices have made information interactions in
our everyday lives more common, and have helped to blur the lines between the various
kinds of information needs and tasks with which we engage. Skills and practices that
youth develop in one context – personal, social, or academic – can influence the ways
they interact in the other contexts (Gasser et al., 2012; Ito et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2013).
Consequently, learning more about everyday life practices has implications for our
understandings of technology and information use in a variety of settings. The
information ecologies (Nardi & O’Day, 1999) framework provides a structured way of
examining and understanding a variety of the factors that impact these use settings. The
technologies that were studied when the framework was introduced may be different than
today’s wide variety that teens access and use. However, the framework still usefully
prompts researchers to pay attention to the surrounding contextual factors (people,
practices, values, and technologies in local environments) and to recognize that
technologies are not used individually, but rather in conjunction with other technologies.

18
Newer research has continued to acknowledge the interconnectedness of these
factors. The Connected Learning Research Network has proposed an agenda for research
and design (2013) that “advocates for broadened access to learning that is socially
embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political
opportunity” (Ito et al., 2013, p. 4). The Connected Learning agenda classifies connected
learning experiences as production-centered, describes them as having shared purpose
among community members, and as openly networked, taking advantage of “online
platforms and digital tools” (Ito et al., 2013, p. 12). One of the key elements of the
Connected Learning perspective is an emphasis on ensuring that non-dominant and
vulnerable populations have access to learning, “[leveraging] the opportunities afforded
by new media in the service of a more equitable education system” (Ito et al., 2013, p.
87). In addition to presenting the research and design agenda, the authors present nine
cases studies that demonstrate how connected learning operates for a variety of young
people and youth communities. These case studies share the perspectives of teens who
engaged in Connected Learning experiences through libraries, schools, and online
gaming and fan communities. Their stories demonstrate the positive outcomes associated
with Connected Learning, including personal artistic growth, new conceptions of job
opportunities, and academic achievement.
Connected Learning shares some of the major priorities embedded in the ELIS
and information ecologies frameworks. Like ELIS theory, Connected Learning places
emphasis on the importance of personal interests. Similar to the information ecologies
framework, Connected Learning recognizes that social relationships and contextual
factors have an impact on the ways people engage with information and technology. This

19
dissertation uses ELIS theory and the information ecologies concept to frame analysis of
the everyday life technology experiences of teens from an urban setting. The overlaps in
priorities between this framework and Connected Learning provide useful opportunities
to better understand how teens engage with information, media, and technology for a
variety of purposes, including their educational growth and success.
2.4 Research Examining Technology Use: Use and Non-use, Adoption and Rejection
Within this research framework, this dissertation examines everyday life
information practices, including the choices, decisions, and preferences individuals have
regarding technologies. Scholars have discussed technology use and non-use in multiple
ways. Most research in this area employs terms that focus on one or two elements of
continuums of use. Roger’s (1963) concept of the diffusion of innovations, which
introduced the term early adopter, and the Technology Adoption Model, or TAM (Davis,
1986), are two approaches that focus on the uptake of technology, emphasizing the word
adoption. At the extreme end, studies focus on describing technology overuse as an
addiction in various communities and with a variety of technologies, including youth and
mobile devices (Walsh, White, & Young, 2008, p. 77), as well as adults and online
auctions (Turel, Serenko, & Giles, 2011) and general internet addiction (Young, 1998). In
contrast, Lenhart et al.’s 2003 study categorized multiple types of individuals that do not
use the Internet, including net evaders, net dropouts, and the truly disconnected (2003, p.
3). Other terms emphasize the active choices involved in technology practice. These
include terms include technology refusal (Baumer, Ames, Brubaker, Burrell, & Dourish,
2014; Marwick, 2011), technology rejection (Abrahamson, 1991; Walker, Craig-Lees,
Hecker, & Francis, 2002; Fuchsberger, Murer, & Tscheligi, 2014 ), technology resistance

20
(Fisher & Wesolkowski 1999), and technology limiting (Baumer et al., 2014). Recent
work examining Portuguese early adults’ non-use of SNSs describes four types of nonusers: resisters, rejecters, surrogate users, and potential converts (Neves, de Matos,
Rente, & Martins, 2015). These terms highlight that distinctions exist in the ways and
reasons people decide not to adopt a technology. Selwyn has argued for more subtlety in
this discussion, with avoidance of terms that may marginalize individuals or assume
certain perspectives about their relationships to technology (Selwyn, 2003).
Researchers also discuss technology users and non-users (Hargittai, 2008;
Tufekci, 2008; Lampe et al., 2013), though these terms have also been criticized for
emphasizing a dichotomy rather than acknowledging the variety of reasons for non-use or
low-use (Selwyn, 2006). Researchers have also discussed frequency of use (Willoughby,
2008), full-spectrum use, (Ching, Basham, & Jang, 2005) and patterns of use (Brown &
Bobkowski, 2011); these terms get closer to the spirit of the phrase continuums of use,
which is the terminology employed in this work. Importantly, much of the discussion of
continuums of use is in relation to the digital divide. Though the digital divide concept
has been criticized as overly simplistic (Agosto, Abbas, & Naughton, 2012; Selwyn,
2006; van Dijk & Hacker, 2003), much of the research into continuums of use has been
prompted by attempts to better understand the social and structural mechanisms that
influence non-use or low-use of technology. Researchers are now demonstrating that
access is not the only factor influencing why individuals have low use or non-use
technology use continuums (Hargittai, 2008; Selwyn, 2006; Witt, Massman, & Jackman,
2011). I now discuss multiple studies that examine these continuums, with an eye to all
frequencies of use.

21
Much research into adoption, use, and rejection focuses on specific groups or
locations. This includes older adults (Czaja & Sharit, 2008), comparison between adult
age groups in work situations (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000), and comparison by ethnicity
(Dupagne & Salwen, 2005). Technology adoption in work settings has also been a main
area of focus, following along with general computing research trends. Hannan and
McDowell (1984) discuss technology adoption in banking firms, and there is a significant
body of work examining technology adoption in farming or agricultural settings, such as
Besley and Case’s (1993) work examining adoption by economically disadvantaged
farmers in developing countries. In addition to research focusing on work settings, there
are multiple studies that examine adoption in specific geographic locations, such as
northern Mozambique (Bandiera & Rasul, 2002).
Recognizing subtle distinctions in use is stressed in Selwyn’s work examining the
non-use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in everyday life (2003).
Selwyn details the following four “established discourses of excluded and peripheral
users of technology,” including: discourses of material and cognitive deficiency,
technophobia, ideological refusal, and diffusion theory (2003, pp. 102-105). He argues
that each of these discourses assume ICT use to be an “inherently desirable and beneficial
activity for all individuals” (2003, p.106). Selwyn takes an empirical approach in his
2006 work that critically examines the concept of the digital divide and highlights the
agency expressed in many individuals’ choices not to use computers, or to use them
sparingly. Selwyn conducted a survey of 1001 adults from England and South Wales (21
– 96 years of age), finding that while 46.7% of the participants used computers “fairly
often” or more, 38.4% were “absolute non-users” (2006, p. 277). Interviews were

22
conducted with non-users, lapsed users, and rare users, and found “four broad themes for
non-use…no interest or need, no knowledge, barriers (e.g. lack of time, old age, poor
health), or no access to a computer” (Selwyn, 2006, p. 281). In conclusion, Selwyn
argues “whilst the opportunities to access and use computers are undeniably structured
and mediated by factors relating to the household, family, workplace as well as age, class
and gender, we cannot deny individual agency in contributing to the fluidity of people’s
relationships with technology” (2006, p. 289).
While some studies of continuums of use focus on computers or other
technological devices, a growing number of studies specifically examine these practices
in relation to social network sites. Tufekci’s (2008) work uses a mixed methods approach
to compare users and non-users of social networking services. This study finds that
individuals who were non-users of these technologies had distinct attitudes toward
practices characterized as “social grooming,” including “gossip, small-talk and
generalized, non-functional people curiosity” ranging from “incredulous to hostile”
(Tufekci, 2008, p. 544). Additionally, these users tended to highlight privacy concerns. In
contrast, SNS users tended to be higher users of what Tufekci terms the “expressive
Internet”, which she describes as “the practice and performance of technologically
mediated sociality” (2008, p. 547). This is in contrast to non-users’ perception of SNS
use as a matter of efficiency. More generally, this study indicates that, at least with regard
to SNS use, individuals’ attitudes and opinions influence their use of technology, though
users and non-users reported similar numbers of very close and somewhat close friends.
Tufekci argues for “[differentiation] between the different modalities of Internet
practices,” as though users and non-users showed different tendencies of use of the

23
expressive Internet, their use of the Internet for instrumental purposes was similar (2008,
p.560). Further, “the lack of overlap between instant message non-use and SNS non-use
shows that SNS non-users are not reticent toward communicating via the Internet, nor are
they closed to the possibility of genuine social interaction through online methods”
(Tufekci, 2008, p. 560).
Hargittai’s 2008 work on the differences between users and non-users of SNS
finds that qualities of gender, race and ethnicity, and parental education are each
associated with SNS use. This study uses survey methods to examine 1,060 early college
age students’ SNS use patterns. Hargittai finds that women are more likely to use SNS
than men, and that “both context of use and experience with the medium are related to the
adoption” of SNS (Hargittai, 2008, p. 285). In addition to examining SNS use in general
terms, Hargittai examined the use of specific services, including Facebook, MySpace,
Xanga, and Friendster. Race and parental education each played an important role here;
in this sample, Hispanic students are less likely than White students to use Facebook, and
while there is an apparent “positive relationship between parental schooling and the use
of Facebook and Xanga…a negative relationship between parental education and the use
of MySpace” is observed (2008, p. 289). The author highlights that these findings may
indicate “systematic differences” in site adoption, and that examining SNS without
recognizing the differences in user populations is a significant challenge, as “aggregated
SNS use statistics hide important differences” (Hargittai, 2008, p. 292).
Facebook and Facebook users receive a significant amount of research attention.
Junco examines inequalities in college students’ use of Facebook in his 2013 work with
survey data from 2,359 respondents from a public university in the northeast United

24
States. Based on their responses, he finds variations in how these students used the site:
“the results from this study suggest that while men, African Americans, and those from
lower SES use Facebook with the same frequency, there are differences in how they use
the site that could disadvantage them psychosocially and academically” (Junco, 2013, p
2334). For example, students from a lower SES background were “less likely to use it for
communication and connection” (Junco, 2013, 2335). This highlights once again that
access to a technology does not solve problems of inequality. The kinds of uses that
people engage in once on the site have implications for both the opportunities and
disadvantages that influence their lives.
Lampe, Vitak, and Ellison (2013) examine heavy, light, and non-users of
Facebook, acknowledging that though individuals might be users of a system, their
practices may differ from other users. The authors find that the more individuals agreed
with statements describing Facebook’s utility, the more likely they are to use the site.
Among those who do not or no longer use the service, they find that individuals “did not
see the benefits of joining or felt that the benefits of participating were not worth the
costs” (Lampe et al., 2013, p. 8). Contrary to other research, the authors also find a
difference in the levels of bonding social capital, with non-users and heavy-users
reporting higher levels than light users, who had relatively low levels. This work
highlights the importance of social factors in examining technology use, and
demonstrates that different continuums of use are correlated with diverse experiences and
perspectives.
Agosto, Abbas, and Naughton (2012) conducted an extensive literature review as
well as focus groups to examine teens’ social network and ICT selection practices, and

25
found six major categories of factors. The literature review identified relationship factors,
social factors, and self-protection factors as important elements in ICT choices. The
authors also identified information/communication, systems, and recipient factors, which
are less commonly examined in the literature. The authors found social network theory
helpful in developing an understanding of ICT selection practices, resulting in a model
showing teens’ preferred communication media. Teens preferred face-to-face
communication and calling for deep information exchange and informal communication
with close friends and immediate family. Small information exchange and urgent
information needs were addressed with texting, and as information needs become less
urgent, social networks and email become more preferred. Formal communication with
teachers, employers, and other adults in official positions also occurs via email. The
authors highlight that “the fact that these teens used such a wide range of ICT selection
criteria indicates that teens’ social media selection decisions need to be viewed as
complex and [varied] according to context” (Agosto, Abbas, & Naughton, 2012, p. 1119).
Blair, Fletcher, and Gaskin (2015) focus on how and why adolescents make
decisions between texting and calling, working with 41 adolescents to develop a
conceptual decision-tree of the factors that inform their decision-making process. Factors
include whether texting is an option, whether there are restrictions due to time and place,
if the content to be shared is emotional or lengthy, and whether the receiver is proficient
with cell phones. The authors find that teens perceived texting to be easier than calling
because it maximizes the opportunities for multitasking, minimizes required forethought,
and accommodates their peers’ preferences. The authors find that “adolescents’ decisions
were based on a combination of cognitive and social factors as well as a combination of

26
rational and default reasoning (Wolff & Crockett, 2011, as cited by Blair, Fletcher, &
Gaskin 2015)”. Like many others, this study demonstrates the deep importance of social
factors in teens’ technology use.
2.5 Values and Technology
Values are another important element in why and how people use or do not use
technology. There have been a multitude of ways researchers have examined values,
including focusing on how values can be used to inform technology design, and how
values impact technology use and connection with information artifacts. As Fleischmann
notes, “values serve as bridges between the individual and the social” (2014, p. 2), and
taking this into consideration has implications for a variety of research areas.
Within the computing research community, a variety of approaches to
understanding values and using them to inform design have developed. Early work
identified social institutions, attitudes, and practices as sources of bias in computing
(Friedman & Nissenbaum, 1996). One of the emerging approaches from this early work
is Value Sensitive Design (Friedman, 1996; Friedman & Kahn, 2002), which argues that
designers can develop technical systems with the goal of minimizing bias and supporting
values that have moral and ethical importance (Friedman, 1996, p. 90). Addressing these
human values takes multiple steps, and work in this area emphasizes the importance of
identifying direct and indirect stakeholders and the potential benefits and harms for each
stakeholder group when making design decisions to begin incorporating values
(Friedman, Kahn, Borning, & Huldtgren, 2013). The Values in Design (VID) community,
as Knobel and Bowker put it, “sees design as a process in which constraints impose new
directions for innovation, and values are a source of constraints” (2011, p. 28). Similarly,

27
the developers of reflective design argue that “reflection on unconscious values
embedded in computing and the practices that it supports can and should be a core
principle of technology design” (Sengers, Boehner, David, & Kaye, 2005, p. 49).
Cockton (2004) focuses on the idea of delivering value to individuals using technologies
in his description of Value-Centred Design. While there are many ways to think about
these approaches, values are increasingly important to the ways researchers examine the
design of technical systems. Cheng and Fleischmann (2010) have developed a metainventory of values, identifying connections between 12 values inventories. Shilton,
Koepfler, and Fleischmann (2014) highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of
methods to surface values for the purposes of social computing research. Values have
been examined in a variety of fields, including “psychology, sociology, anthropology,
science and technology studies, and information science” (Cheng & Fleischmann, 2010,
p. 1). Scholars with philosophy and ethics backgrounds also discuss human values
(Fleischmann, 2014).
In addition to work examining the connections between values, design, and
various research approaches, there is also important work that evaluates how values
inform whether and how people interact with technologies. Vasalou, Oostveen, and
Joinson (2012) examine location tracking technology, combining a domestic context with
an examination of technology non-adoption. This study finds that the parenting values of
parents in the UK are both supported and undermined by location tracking services, and
highlights that values are an important contributor to technology use or non-use. While
this study is focused specifically on supporting parents, it highlights the importance of
engaging with values surrounding technology practices. Further, the authors point out

28
that “critical to this debate should be the acknowledgement that our personal beliefs,
needs and values are motivating forces in the technologies we choose to use” (Vasalou,
Oostveen & Joinson, 2012, p. 13).
Schwartz’s values theory has been used in a number of studies, and has been
validated with samples from 67 countries by Schwartz (2007). In one case study of the
adoption of a key card based attendance management system at a primary school
(Isomursu, Ervasti, Kinnula, & Isomursu, 2011), the authors used Schwartz’s values to
compare values of different stakeholders. This study examined the values of parents as
well as teachers and importantly, the participating students, and found that participant
groups had different relevant values. While the children and teachers in the study most
often focused on how the new technology supported helpfulness, parents most valued the
increased security of the new system. As the authors state, “these observations show that
experienced value is highly dynamic” (Isomursu et al., 2011, p. 196). They also discuss
“three angles” for examining values and technology, pointing out that users have “generic
value priorities” that “exist before the use is in contact with the evaluated system,” that “a
technology…can provide value simply because it exists,” and that “the users actually
experience the value created by the system or service by using it” (Isomursu et al., 2011,
p. 198). The authors demonstrate that values not only exist before use of a technology,
but also during and after use; research examining values can be improved by taking this
malleability into account.
Hsieh, Chen, Mahmud, and Nichols (2014) employed Schwartz’s theory to
examine the ways values might predict interest in various types of articles, in order to
ultimately support content targeting online. Working with survey responses from 185

29
Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, the authors found that the emphasis of universalism
values, which include concern for the environment, “predict interests in reading about the
environment”; similarly, the expression of values associated with achievement “predict
reading about work” (Hsieh, Chen, Mahmud, & Nichols, 2014, p. 985), indicating that
“our values also influence our reading interests” (p. 986).
In a work that synthesizes many of these approaches, Fleischmann details the
ways values, technology, and information science connect in his book Information and
Human Values (2014). He highlights that “individuals hold values, but others influence
the formation of those values. Families, groups, and societies tend to share common
values, although not necessarily universally” (Fleischmann, 2014, p. 2). With the
understanding that people have different kinds of values and that they prioritize them
differently, he details different approaches to understanding values, then focuses on how
values interact with education, technology, and communication. Fleischmann reminds
that “values are properties of people, but they can also be properties of information and of
technology” (2014, p. 61). Fleischmann concludes by calling for additional research that
examines values in our networked information society, noting that “people, information,
and technology are not typically independent actors” (2014, pp. 67-68). This kind of
work is crucial because “not only does research on information and human values have
important intellectual implications, but it also has critical practical and societal
implications” (Fleischmann, 2014, p. 69). Better understanding the ways values interact
with information and technology is an important goal, and this dissertation makes strides
in this direction by focusing on the values of teens from an urban area.

30
2.6 Additional Factors Connected to Technology Use
In additional to values, gender, age, socio-economic status (SES), and other social
factors all play a role in how individuals make choices about technology use. Gender is
an area that is often examined in relationship to technology use. Willoughby’s
participants reported using the Internet at comparable rates (93.7% of girls and 94.7% of
boys) (2008). However, men have been found to rate their online skills more highly than
women (Hargittai & Shafer, 2006). Content creation, particularly sharing on the web, is
related to gender (women are less likely to participate), but when controlling for skill,
these differences no longer exist (Hargittai & Walejko, 2008). Women are more likely to
use SNS services (Lenhart & Madden, 2007), and in Willoughby’s study, boys used
computer games significantly more than girls (2008).
Across all adults, age is an important factor predicting computer use. Older
individuals tend to have lower levels of Internet use (Lenhart et al., 2003) and computer
use (Selwyn, 2006). Though research takes a wide range of ages into account, the
participants in Willoughby’s work had a significant decrease in computer game use for
both boys and girls from early high school to late high school, while there was an
increase in Internet use for girls over time (2008). Similarly, lower levels of income and
education are also linked to lower levels of engagement with the Internet (Lenhart et al.,
2003). However, low parental education, which is sometimes used as a proxy
measurement for SES, especially when studying youth (Lien, Friestad, & Klepp, 2001), is
linked to higher frequency of use of computer games and the Internet (Willoughby,
2008). On the other hand, the number of computers in the home (more computers

31
presumably indicates higher SES) has also been linked to higher frequency of use of
computer games and the Internet (Willoughby, 2008).
Importantly, gender, age, and SES are not the only factors to consider. Agosto,
Abbas, and Naughton find that the “context of a communication event” is a significant
element in how teens make social media and ICT decisions (2012, p. 1122). While
Selwyn (2003) highlights that agency and choice are also often involved in non-use and
low-use of technologies, and he argues that using technology is not inherently beneficial
for all individuals. There are other scholars that take issue with the structural factors that
influence technology use continuums. Speaking about the differences in online content
creation related to gender, Hargittai and Walejko argue that the issue is troublesome
because “as online content becomes increasingly important in setting social, political and
cultural agendas, the existence of such a participation gap will have increasing
implications for social inequality” (2008, p. 253). Further, content creation is one
important element in media literacy, in addition to the ability to access, to analyze, and to
evaluate (Livingstone & Helsper, 2010, p. 311). It is clear that technology use is linked to
literate information use. Sonia Livingstone argues that “the social consequences of these
activities – participation, social capital, civic culture – serve to network (or exclude)
today’s younger generation” (2004, p. 8). These works are beginning to reveal a
complicated picture of teen technology and information access and usage, which has
significant implications for the way youth participate in learning, online life, and even
civic citizenship.
These works indicate that contextual elements are significant when examining
how and why people use or do not use technologies. It is apparent when examining the

32
above literature that structural elements of technology access, technologies themselves,
social relationships, individual practices, and values surrounding technologies all
contribute to young people’s technology ecologies, playing important roles in
technological and informational practices. Motivations for technology use, including the
seeking, finding, evaluating, using, creating, and sharing of information, are also key
elements in these ecologies. The following studies examine technology in relation to
teens, as well as teens’ everyday life information practices, filling in the story on teens’
socio-technical experiences.
2.7 Teens and Technology: Large Scale Work
There are many kinds of stakeholders invested in understanding how teens use
technology, including parents and family advocates, educators, librarians, health
professionals, and politicians. In part because of this strong interest, multiple
organizations are invested in conducting research with youth and presenting carefully
designed approaches to improve and support their interactions with technology. Several
organizations have put significant effort into developing these kinds of reports, focused
on general technology interactions, as well as health and learning.
The Pew Research Center has a long tradition of conducting nationally
representative survey work with teens and youth from the United States to learn more
about how they use technology. They have built an extended picture of how teens and
youth using technology have developed and changed practices over the course of their
research. One of their significant reports with this age group, Teens and Technology, was
released in 2013 (Madden, Lenhart, Duggan, et al., 2013). For this project, the Center
conducted surveys with 802 teens aged 12 – 17 years old. This report highlights that in

33
2012, 78% of teens [had] a cell phone, and almost half of those (47%) [had] own
smartphones” (Madden, Lenhart, Duggan, et al., 2013, p. 2). Additionally, the work
reports that 74% of teens reported that they had access to the Internet on mobile devices
at least occasionally (Madden, Lenhart, Duggan, et al., 2013, p. 2).
This report was updated with the Teens, Social Media, and Technology Overview
2015 report (Lenhart et al., 2015). This newer report highlights that in 2015 for teens ages
13 – 17, “92% of teens report going online daily – including 24% who say they go online
‘almost constantly,’” which they credit to the popularity and accessibility of mobile
devices. At this point, “nearly three quarters of teens have access to a smart phone”
(though this did not necessarily indicate ownership, just access), and 91% now go online
with mobile devices at least occasionally (Lenhart et al., 2015, p. 2). These reports
present important data and also allow for comparison over time. When taken together, it
is clear that teens are increasingly interacting with technology, particularly with mobile
devices.
In addition to their research into technology use in general, they have also
specifically studied relevant concepts like privacy. The Pew Research Center also worked
with the Youth and Media team from the Berkman Center in their report Teens, Social
Media, and Privacy (Madden, Lenhart, Cortesi, et al., 2013). They contextualized their
survey data from 802 teens and their parents (the same data used for the Teens and
Technology 2013 study) with focus group data from 24 focus groups with 137
participants, collected by the Berkman group. This report finds that while teens are
sharing more on social media than they did previously, they do take steps “to shape their
reputation, manage their networks, and mask information they don’t want others to

34
know,” and that “in broad measures of online experience, teens are considerably more
likely to report positive experiences than negative ones” (Madden, Lenhart, Cortesi, et
al., 2013, p. 2). This kind of work provides a data-based perspective that distinguishes the
reality of youth practices from concerned popular discourse.
The Kaiser Family Foundation similarly focused on a nationally representative
sample in their work with 2,002 youth aged 8 – 18 years old (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts,
2010), which builds on similar survey work conducted in 1999 and 2004. Their most
recent report highlights that over the five years since their previous study, youth
increased their levels of engagement with media, consuming 10 hours and 45 minutes of
media content in 7 ½ hours per day with the help of multitasking (Rideout et al., 2010, p.
2). They attribute this increase in part to the “transformation of the cell phone into a
media content delivery platform,” which is coupled with fact the at the time of the study
five years previous, 66% of 8 – 18 year olds own smart phones (Rideout et al., 2010, p.
3). The authors highlight several demographics that predict differences in levels of media
use. “Media use shoots up dramatically for the 11 – 14 year old group,” while “boys
consume more media than girls,” which is mostly explained by their engagement with
console and computer games (Rideout et al., 2010, p. 37). Further, “substantial
differences in media consumption occur between White youth and Black or Hispanic
youth, with the latter two groups consuming nearly 4 ½ hours more media daily”
(Rideout et al., 2010, p. 37). This report highlights that youth use of technology has
continued to change over time. Additionally, it points to important differences in use that
may have implications for youth learning and development, and as such deserve further
study.

35
Other work at this scale focuses on how technology impacts the lives of youth in
specific arenas. The Center on Media and Human Development at Northwestern
University focuses on teens, health, and technology in their nationally representative
survey of 13 – 18 year olds (Wartella et al., 2015). The report highlights that today’s
teens have unprecedented connectivity, but like generations before, are dealing with a
wide variety of health concerns. They focus on how teens use the internet to access health
information and how they make determinations about using information. They find that
teens are “most likely to use the Internet for health promotion and preventative health,
rather than for diagnoses, treatment, or information for friends and family members”
(Wartella et al., 2015, p.2) with fitness and nutrition as the most commonly searched
kinds of information (Wartella et al., 2015, p. 3). They also state that “there are
substantial digital and health divides among youth” (Wartella et al., 2015, p. 4). More
than half of youth from low income backgrounds have experienced a serious health issue
in their family. Despite this exposure to health issues, it is less likely for them to have had
a health class or have access to a digital tools that could support information seeking, as
compared to teens from a high income background. The authors conclude by highlighting
that “the Internet is not replacing parents, teachers, and doctors; it is supplementing
them” (Wartella et al., 2015, p. 31). This helps to address concerns that youth might not
be getting to the information they need, but the authors also point out that the disparities
associated with income are of significant concern. They encourage policy makers
concerned with health to consider technology access an important part of lessening this
gap.

36
The Aspen Institute Task Force on Learning and the Internet, with support from
the MacArthur Foundation, released a report in 2014 describing the various stakeholders
invested in youth and learning, and presenting recommendations for policy and praxis to
better support learners. The twenty members of the task force came from “education,
technology and the civic sphere to reimagine learning” (Aspen, 2014, p. 10). They make
five main recommendations or principles for this kind of work:
1) “put learners at the center of the networks that can enhance and
accelerate their learning”
2) “ensure equity of access to the resources that young people need to
pursue their learning goals”
3) make networks “interoperable to ensure that learning resources are not
isolated”
4) support the development of “media, digital, and socio-emotional
literacies” for learners
5) “created a trusted environment that will protect children’s safety and
privacy online without compromising their ability to learn” (Aspen,
2014, p. 36).
In addition the report presents 26 action steps for helping to achieve these five main
goals. The report emphasizes that “business, as well as governments, educators, parents
and other stakeholders need to step forward and answer this call for action” (Aspen,
2014, p. 86), demonstrating again how better understanding and supporting youth
technology use can have wide-ranging impacts.

37
2.8 Teens and Technology: Design and Context
Academic research has added depth to the understandings developed by broader
research and work examining youth and technology. This is crucial, because information
practice, and technology use in particular, is not a simple element in everyday life. Teens
use a range of technologies to mediate the access, use, creation, and sharing of
information. This integrated environment, which is also informed by social relationships
and values, requires more holistic ways of examining the full range of young people's
information practices, which can be couched in terms of information ecologies (Nardi &
O’Day, 1999). However, research that examines teens and technology often employs
specific foci that impact our understandings of this type of phenomena. This narrow focus
may make it more difficult to develop a holistic perspective that accounts for the various
media and technology environments teens experience. Scholarly work typically focuses
on individual technologies, such as web-based chat or social media, or specific contexts,
such as the domestic context or the context of homelessness. Research into non-use and
rejection of technologies has typically been framed through examination of the digital
divide and social media.
2.8.1 Studies of technologies and technological practices. HCI work often
examines specific types of technology practices. In one of the historically significant HCI
works to present teens’ perspectives from naturalistic research, Grinter, Palen, and
Eldridge (2006) focus on how teens use chat technology. The authors complete a review
of existing work on SMS and IM, finding that the two technologies are often framed as
having the same features of use. They also describe empirical studies of SMS and IM
usage completed with teens in the US and UK. The authors note that “contrasting [IM

38
use] to SMS usage serves as a valuable counterpoint. Specifically, reanalyzing the
technologies with respect to each other highlights how their features (not just the
application features, but also underlying infrastructural and physical properties) shape
social practice” (Grinter et al., 2006, p. 444). For example, the authors discuss how the
differences in the physical experience of using a computer versus a phone led to varying
practices, with phone based conversations affording more privacy than conversations
held on a computer in a shared family space. The authors highlight that their work adds
“to an understanding about domestic communications and the role that technology plays
in the household. At home, technology is being used in ways that researchers are only
just beginning to understand” (Grinter et al., 2006, p. 444). This points to the importance
of studying technology use in the domestic setting, an important part of everyday life for
teens. The authors also highlight to the importance of examining technologies in light of
other technologies. This contrasts with many studies specifically focusing on one
technology or system, and aligns with the information ecologies perspective (Nardi &
O’Day, 1999). Chat technologies may now be less distinct, since smart phones and other
mobile devices can be used for these kinds of conversations. However, this study was one
of the first to examine these practices in depth, and helped to expand the HCI focus on
teens’ perspectives. Additionally, comparing and contrasting the ways people use a
variety of technologies, rather than individual technologies alone, is important for
developing broader and more theoretical understandings of technology use. This work
serves as an exemplar these kinds of multi-technology examinations.
Buhler, Neustaedter, and Hillman (2013) also focus on teens in their study
examining video chat use. The authors examine multiple platforms for video chatting,

39
and find that teens use these services for a multitude of activities including shared
homework sessions, show and tell, performances, gossip, flirting, and expression of
sexuality. These diverse uses of video chat highlight multiple ways technology is used to
support social interaction for teens. This study demonstrates the importance of examining
everyday life technology use outside of academic contexts, and again highlights that
practices developed in one context inform the practices in others, as seen in how teens
use video chat to complete school work together.
Social media has served as a lightning rod for studies about teenagers in multiple
fields, including the domains of education, psychology, communication, IS, and HCI.
Social media studies are one area where everyday information practices, often with a
specific focus on technological practices, are examined. In their paper from the
psychological perspective examining youth blogging and mental health, Boniel-Nissim
and Barak (2013) find that adolescents who use the interactive online format of blogging
experience improvement on measures of mental health, and that those adolescents who
composed blogs that were open to commenting experienced the most improvement in
these measures. This is an example that demonstrates that non-work, non-school
activities are important for young people, even when framed from an adult-normative
perspective that emphasizes health and safety. This also reinforces the idea that social
experiences (in this case, commenting on blogs), are meaningful and deserving of study.
Researchers are also examining the ways that social media technologies provide
an arena for teens to experiment with their identities and presentation of self. In her
foundational 2008 article, danah boyd examines teen use of social networking
technologies. She focuses on how youth express their identities via these sites, and how

40
they integrate social networking practices into their lives. This research is based on
ethnographic work with teenagers typically between the ages 14 – 18, and focuses on use
of MySpace, one of the earliest popular social network sites for teens. She explains that
teenagers gravitate toward these sites because their friends use these services. The teens
go through the initial phase of creating their profile, and then are able to practice their
identity performance through their profiles, also participating in communities. Privacy
plays an important role for teenagers, and balancing their relationships with their friends
with the responsibilities they feel to their parents creates a tension in social network use.
She concludes that “teens today face a public life with the possibility of unimaginably
wide publicity. The fundamental properties of networked publics – persistence,
searchability, replicability, and invisible audiences are new difficulties for both teens and
the adults concerned for their well-being and development” (boyd, 2008, pp. 137-138).
She argues that “as a society, we need to figure out how to educate teens to navigate
social structures that are quite unfamiliar to us because they will be faced with these
publics as adults” (p. 138). She advocates for education and support, and I would extend
her argument further to suggest that design and system development should also take
teens’ perspectives into account.
Continuing to build on her work with teens and their engagement in networked
publics, boyd has also published it’s complicated: the social lives of networked teens
(2014). In this work, boyd presents insights from more than a decade of work with teens,
focusing on addressing high stakes ideas that inform public perceptions of their needs,
practices, and vulnerabilities. She shares teen perspectives to explain their interactions
online with regard to identity, privacy, addiction, danger (sexual predators), bullying,

41
inequality, and literacy. She argues that “rather than fighting to reclaim the places and
spaces that earlier cohorts had occupied, many teens have taken a different approach:
they’ve created their own publics” (boyd, 2014, p. 201), using social media and
networked technologies to connect with peers and their broader social worlds. She argues
for helping youth develop “skills and perspective” in contrast to “resisting technology or
fearing what might happen if youth embrace social media” (boyd, 2014, p. 213). “It
behooves us all to move past assumptions about today’s youth” (boyd, 2014, p. 198) and
the ways they interact with technology. Connecting with their perspectives, as she models
with her work, is an important way to do so.
Other researchers have taken a similar approach to youth perspectives. Mallan
examines how youths “oscillate between exhibition and inhibition, self-exposure and
self-preservation, authenticity and deception” (2009, p. 51). She begins by pointing out
that
“many adults may come to see young people as being at risk, reduced to ‘one who
can be hurt.’ Anxieties about young people’s participation with SNS and other
online platforms often centre on the unknown capacity that new technologies have
to create change or to disrupt” (Mallan, 2009, p. 51).
Mallan describes her empirical work with 150 Australian students 13 – 16 years old. She
conducted semi-structured focus groups over the course of a year, and focused on four
areas: constructing a profile, friends and community, exposure and relevance, and privacy
matters (2009, p. 55). She concludes that though
“students in our study tended to describe their social networking activities in
terms of modes of being and of making choices, their comments also indicate that
they are well aware of exercising or not exercising control over their online
activities” (Mallan, 2009, p. 63).

42
She frames online social network use as presenting both risks and pleasures, including
“the promise of building community, making and maintaining friends, communication,
and recognition,” and suggests that “the technology itself is a key player in shaping how a
community can operate in complementing offline identity and social activities” (Mallan,
2009, p. 64). Mallan’s work serves as an example of a technological study that places
primacy on the voices of youth, in contrast to an adult normative perspective. This is
particularly relevant in the discussion of risks and pleasures, which coincides with
Livingstone & Helsper’s discussion of online risk and opportunity (2010).
2.8.2 Physical contexts. As discussed above, academic and school settings serve
as a prime context for research focusing on teens. Gasser, Cortesi, Malik, and Lee frame
personal, social, and academic areas as contexts for studying youth, recognizing that
these contexts are “not mutually exclusive and may overlap in many cases;” their work
highlights that examinations of youth often focus on an academic context (2012, p. 8).
Others have highlighted the need for research into youths’ informal information practices
(Dresang, 1999; Ito et al., 2013); however, much research still maintains a focus on
academic outcomes and contexts. This focus also occurs in many areas related to
research, such as grants, publishing venues, and conferences, and to some extent, signals
adult priorities for youth. However, there are some research streams that examine other
contexts. Within HCI research, which historically focused on work settings (Bødker,
2006), the focus on the home context is often framed as domestic HCI, while other active
research strands focus on homelessness as an orienting perspective (Woelfler & Hendry,
2009, 2010, 2011).

43
Katz, Felix, and Gubernick (2013) compared adolescent technology use in
populations from two different schools: one public school in New York City, and one
private Episcopal boarding school in Concord, NH. Based on comparisons of the
populations’ use technologies, including cellphones, computers, games, television, and
SNSs, The authors state “contrary to the presumed homogenization of information goods
consumptions and communication patterns, the adoption and patterns of technology use
are shaped by the individuals’ residing environment and context” (Katz et al., 2013, p
20). This study highlights the importance of considering context and social factors when
considering teen technology use.
Similar to Savolainen’s ELIS approach, domestic HCI works to examine
technology use in everyday home situations. Because of this focus on the home, domestic
HCI typically focuses on family technology use. Though this may incorporate teen
practices, it situates them within the life of the home, and thus tends to emphasize adult
perspectives and concerns. Brush and Inkpen (2007) specifically examine the sharing of
technology in homes. This study serves as an example of work that examines practices
surrounding multiple technologies, “including TVs, music players, phones and
computers; where they were situated within the home; and the degree of shared
ownership and use” (Brush & Inkpen, 2007, p. 109). This research reveals patterns of
shared use, individual ownership, specialized individual ownership (multiple instances of
the same device, e.g.: laptops for home, work, and travel), as well as distinctions between
“public” and private use areas. The authors observed significant amounts of sharing, and
found the use and non-use of profiles (accounts) on computers to be particularly diverse.
Brush and Inkpen distinguish between a single shared profile used to access a shared

44
computer, families with multiple profiles that they only use one for access, and families
that use multiple profiles (5 of 15 families). The authors relate this variety to family
values, including trust, as well as the enjoyment of personalization of shared devices.
This work demonstrates the complexity of everyday life technology environments, and
highlights that social relationships and family values play an important role in each
family member’s technology practices.
Ames, Go, Kaye, and Spasojevic (2011) examine the way families use
technology, and contrasts the values and practices of middle class families with those of
working-class families. This work employs ethnographic methods, and finds distinctions
between the values surrounding technology, while recognizing that the valuing of “family
togetherness…children’s education, health, and well-being” transcend class (Ames et al.,
2011, 7). Pointing out that structural differences, such as longer working hours, can
contribute to differences in values, the authors highlight that the practices surrounding
many of the same technologies examined by Brush and Inkpen, such as televisions and
phones, differed by class. This study highlights that home structures are important to
consider in research, as “parents not only negotiate their own relationship with
technology, but their children’s as well” (Ames et al., 2011, p. 1), and also points to the
importance of examining diverse backgrounds, such as class, when studying technology
practices.
However, an important consideration when studying values and design is that not
all individuals will have the same values, needs, and wants. In their study examining the
technology experiences of female domestic violence survivors living in a shelter,
Dimond, Fiesler, and Bruckman find that “the experiences of domestic violence survivors

45
illustrates that technological design often embeds and reflect a harmonious family view”
(2011, p. 420). This is a potential issue when considering that not all families have or
prioritize this type of family life. Teens may be victims of domestic violence as well as
other difficulties at home, such as sexual abuse, verbal abuse, or problems like difficulties
expressing their sexual identity or exploring their identity at large. As Coontz (1993)
discusses, the myth of the happy family has never been particularly accurate, even when
we look back on what many discuss as happier times. The distinction between real family
experiences and value-laden family views is important to remember when studying youth
in domestic and family contexts.
In addition to HCI work examining the realm of the domestic, the technology
practices of individuals who are homeless is a dynamic research stream that specifically
examines teens’ technology practices. Woefler and Hendry developed an active research
program that has evaluated the technological practices of youth experiencing
homelessness (2010), discussed the design of technologies for these populations (2011),
and specifically focused on the role of information for this community (2009). These
studies serve a vital role in informing design and policy development. Teens from all
kinds of backgrounds deserve this same amount of contextualized research focus, as they
may have different needs and desires for their technology and information use. These
studies serve as examples for placing youth voices and values in a primary place in
design, technology, and information conversations.
2.9 Teens and Everyday Life Information Practice
Savolainen’s work prompted researchers to examine non-work information
seeking, framed as “everyday” queries and topics, including personal health and hobbies.

46
While Savolainen’s work focused on adults, the idea of examining the diverse contexts of
practice remains important for work with teens. Agosto and Hughes-Hassell extend
Savolainen’s ELIS work to teens by framing school as work, and outside of school as the
everyday in their work examining “the everyday life information needs of urban
teenagers” (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006a, p. 1394). In the first of their two
companion articles focused on this topic, Agosto and Hughes-Hassell present their
theoretical model of the everyday life information needs of urban teenagers, derived from
qualitative work with “twenty seven-Philadelphia young adults aged 14 through 17”
(2006a, p. 1397). The authors developed a model of 28 information needs topics,
including categories ranging from academics and college to career, sexual safety, and
heritage/cultural identity. Combining the 28 topics with Havighurst’s 11 development
tasks (Havighurst, 1972), led the authors to their theoretical model indicating that “urban
teen ELIS behaviors support the development of the social self, the emotional self, the
reflective self, the physical self, the creative self, the cognitive self, and the sexual self”
(2006a, p. 1399), which are all influenced by “personal situation and cultural setting”
(2006a, p. 1399), highlighting the importance of deep, contextually-based inquiry.
Continuing on their work described above, Agosto and Hughes-Hassell also
developed an empirical model which moves from the urban teen ELIS needs to the
different selves discussed in Part 1. Agosto and Hughes-Hassell detail each of the 28
needs topics, which are ordered into different selves; for example, the emotional self
includes the needs topics of familial relationships, emotional safety, and religious
practice (2006b, p. 1419). The authors note that their findings are similar to other work,
and state that

47
“participants in this study tended to have the same types of information needs as
previous researchers have found with more advantaged, nonminority groups of
teens. This finding is significant because it suggests that teenagers have similar
information needs across socioeconomic, ethnic, cultural, and geographic
boundaries” (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006b, p. 1424-1425).
The authors also highlight that the fact that they used so many data collection methods
led to deep data that allowed for “fuller participation across the participant pool” (Agosto
& Hughes-Hassell, 2006b, p. 1425). Additionally, based on the stimulating data
uncovered by these collection methods, the authors state that “the study also shows that
the often-ignored urban teen population can provide rich data for analysis” (Agosto &
Hughes-Hassell, 2006b, p. 1425). These works demonstrate that teens from a variety of
backgrounds have diverse information practices that span many topics. The implication
of this diversity is that research into teen information practices must recognize that all
types and topics of information have relevance for study.
Researchers out of the University of Washington have also focused on everyday
life information behavior with a variety of young ages. Head and Eisenberg (2011)
employ an everyday life perspective to understand how college students conduct
research, finding that college students employed a hybrid information seeking strategy for
their everyday life information needs, relying on search engines as well as friends and
family. Meyers, Fisher, and Marcoux discuss a new approach for examining the everyday
information behavior of “tweens” aged 9 – 13 (2007). Their work emphasizes the
importance of designing developmentally appropriate research that incorporates the
physical, social, and cognitive needs of early adolescents. The researchers employed the
use of a Tween Day model to mitigate issues of attrition and site availability, conducting
a five hour data collection session in one day. At their first site, a community youth

48
center, 16 participants experienced two audio-recorded focus groups, individual
interviews, and a WebQuest creative activity. Additionally, the team employed the
Tween Day approach at a church ministry and an elementary school. Their experiences
reveal an effective methodology that attempts to design research that is developmentally
appropriate, recognizes multiple levels of consent and assent, balances researcher
authority, prioritizes context as an important part of all research, and recognizes that the
research process can be fun (Meyers et al., 2007, pp. 325-326). Though this methodology
provides an interesting way to collect data, the authors observe that “additional data
points over the span of the participants and a wider range of data collection procedures”
would expand the capabilities of this approach (Meyers et al., 2007, p. 324).
2.10 Gaps in the Literature
I will now address some of the larger issues associated with studies of technology
and information, including the lack of research engaging with teens and their
perspectives, the strong focus in work that does engage with youth on academic contexts
and performance, and the issues associated with relying on adult perspectives to
understand teens.
2.10.1 Study populations and the lack of focus on teens. As the human-oriented
research described above indicates, understanding people is a key element for successful
design and access. While some of the above work does an admirable job of examining the
practices of teens, and despite the value in studying the lived experience of teenagers,
research often focuses on other populations. Children receive a healthy amount of
research focus, though as a group they are similar to teens – somewhat difficult to study
in terms of access, study design, and ability to control or manage their own participation.

49
Within HCI research, this focus on children is sometimes discussed as Child-Computer
Interaction, a term supported by the recently launched International Journal of ChildComputer Interaction (P. Markopoulos & J.C. Read editors), HCI for kids (Bruckman,
Bandlow, Dimond, & Forte, 2012), and CHI for kids/CHIkids (Druin, 1996).
Unfortunately, “studies about the Internet and young people often focus primarily
on pre-teen children” (Mcmillan & Morrison, 2006, p. 74); teens do not enjoy the same
level of attention. HCI does include rich work examining families and domestic
technology, but this often centers on parents, parenting, and the relationship between
adults and children. In Ames et al.’s work (2011), the researchers gathered deep data
about the differences in the ways these families conceptualize technology in their homes.
While these authors are specifically examining class structures, they argue that
“many of us find ourselves designing for those most like ourselves – largely
middle-class values – or we make incorrect assumptions based on stereotypes
about those who are different. Explicitly attending to what difference there are,
acknowledging the similarities, and actively and sympathetically trying to make
sense of the whole picture is the best way to overcome these obstacles” (Ames et
al., 2011, p. 10).
Teens are arguably one of the most stereotyped groups of people, considering popular
culture portrayals. The time period of adolescence, which involves a unique combination
of independence and family dependence (Havighurst, 1972), as well as in-depth identity
exploration (Erikson, 1968), would benefit from researchers applying the attitude
promoted by Ames et al. (2011).
While teens remain an understudied population, college-aged students are
common subjects in many research areas, to the point that some ethics review boards
require justification for working with these kinds of participants. This focus on students
contributes to the resulting research focus on searching in highly structured academic

50
information seeking situations. In her article assessing multiple user studies and
developing a model of the information search process, Kuhlthau highlights this
characteristic in the studies she used to develop her model: “all of the studies were
conducted in field situations with actual library users…For the most part, the subjects
were students in universities, colleges, and secondary schools who had been assigned a
term paper” (1991, p. 364). Mcmillan and Morrison take an inventive approach to
understanding “how the Internet has become an integral part of young people’s lives” by
“analyzing autobiographical essays written by 72 young adult college students” (2006, p.
73). The authors make the argument that these participants are “close enough to
childhood to remember it well” (2006, p. 74), presumably including teenage years in their
focus. However, there is value, including increased validity, to examining the lived
experience of teenagers with the same deep focus as Mcmillan and Morrison during
rather than after young people’s experiences growing and learning.
2.10.2 Study contexts and the focus on academic settings. Even when teenagers
are participants, research often employs a narrow focus on contexts that fall short of
contributing to holistic understandings of teens’ technology and information practices. In
Information Science, when studies do focus on teenagers, they are often centered on
academic information work, typically examining how searchers behave when performing
academic tasks such as writing a research paper, as seen in the studies surveyed by
Kuhlthau (1991).
Kuhlthau’s (1991) integrative model of the information search process (ISP)
highlights the importance of studying how users approach information seeking. The
model is based on five previous studies of information seeking “conducted in field

51
situations with actual library users, most of whom were responding to an imposed rather
than a personally initiated information need” (1991, p. 364). This model bridges the
information seeking environments of high school, college, and public libraries, but does
not address non-academic information seeking or practices. Kuhlthau points out the value
of studying affective needs in addition to cognitive needs, stating that “an information
search is a process of construction which involves the whole experience of the person,
feelings as well as thoughts and action” (Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 362). While users in the five
studies had different experiences and situations, Kuhlthau argues that “the central
premise of all this research is that the uncertainty which initiates the ISP causes confusion
and doubt and is likely to be accompanied by feelings of anxiety” (Kuhlthau, 1991, p.
369-370). This model demonstrates that learning more about youths’ process (both
cognitive and affective) can inform the design of information systems and technologies.
In an early formative study, Fidel and her coauthors examine the way that high
school students visit and search the web for information for classwork (Fidel et. al, 1999).
The research team observed and interviewed eight high school students (11th and 12th
graders) from Seattle, WA. The researchers observed the ways that these students worked
on four assignments, all related to horticulture. The authors discuss the ways students
prepared for searching and the search process, stressing that “for the participating
students, searching was both a social and an academic event” (Fidel et al., 1999, p. 28).
The authors also detail the students’ opinions about the web, including sources of
frustration and how the students felt that web could be improved. Based on the fact that
“the participating students were ‘average’ youth” (Fidel et al., 1999, p.33), the authors

52
highlight the importance of effective training and support during the search process, as
well as the design consideration of graphical elements to improve searching.
Fidel extended on her work with the concept of human information interaction,
presented in her 2012 book Human Information Interaction: An Ecological Approach to
Information Behavior. Fidel describes human information interaction (HII) as focusing
on humans, or “actors,” who interact with information, broadening emphasis from just
the system and recognizing their participation in these experiences” (2012, p. 4). She
highlights that “this approach is particularly important in cases where nonusers avoid the
system because it does not fit their needs” (Fidel, 2012, p. 4). Fidel also advocates for
“positioning the environment at the center of analysis” (2012, p. 5) as a key element of
the ecological approach, which “focuses on a community of actors rather than on
individuals or on all humans” (2012, p. 8). The “purpose of HII research is to improve the
interaction” (Fidel, 2012, p. 13), building on human information behavior research. Fidel
highlights different research areas that examine HII in context with computing
technology, including HCI, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), human
factors, and social informatics, and proposes cognitive work analysis as a technique for
connecting design communities and the interests and priorities of HII.
Like Fidel’s early work, multiple scholars have continued to examine technology
use in academic settings, adapting their focus as new technologies and services become
available. Rather than focusing simply on use, Forte and Bruckman (2007, 2009) have
focused on participatory media, such as wikis, which allow youth to not only access
information, but to create information resources, contributing to new literacy skills.
While they found that there are barriers to collaborative writing in academic settings,

53
such as cultural and institutional issues (e.g. employing more traditional assessment
methods for newer, collaborative writing) the design of the collaborative tool may also
serve as a barrier (Forte & Bruckman, 2007). However, the authors also find that while
wikis may have the barriers discussed above, they provide significant learning
opportunities (Forte & Bruckman, 2009). These opportunities include “transforming the
value of citation, creating a need to deeply engage with content, and providing both a
need and a foundation for assessing information resources” (Forte & Bruckman, 2009, p.
42). Wikis can be seen as an example of the blurring of the lines between purely
academic contexts and a more public world, represented by the fact that wikis are often
publicly accessible. Indeed, this public-ness can create a desire to develop an information
resource for a public readership, not simply an academic output (Forte and Bruckman,
2009). Not only do these works demonstrate the importance of deep study of teens’
practices, but they also show how networked technologies are contributing to the blurring
of the lines between academic and other contexts.
While it is important to understand and support learning, education, and
structured information search, much of a teen’s development and experience occurs
outside the classroom. In HCI, studies focusing on teens also experience the same focus
on educational environments; Computer-Supported-Collaborative-Learning (CSCL) is
one area that includes multiple of studies of youth in educational situations. And again,
while studies of the home are an active research stream with HCI, these usually focus on
the study of family or children, rather than including a specific focus on teens. However,
there are some issues associated with the work that does examine teen practices.

54
2.10.3 The issue of studying teens using an adult perspective. While there are
some technologies and information resources targeted to tweens, teens, and other young
age cohorts, for the most part, teens exist in a world where technologies and systems are
made for adults. Further complicating the issue, this adult perspective does not only occur
in design, but also influences the development and reporting of academic work that
examines teens and technology. In their report reviewing work on information quality
and youth, Gasser, Cortesi, Malik, and Lee highlight that “researchers from various
disciplines are asking how young users navigate-or in the view of their parents and
teachers, should navigate-the increasingly diverse information ecosystem with its various
quality levels and spectrums” (2012, p. 18, emphasis added). They describe research from
an adult perspectives as “adult-normative;” these are studies in which “information
quality is defined by what makes information valuable for adults” (Gasser et al, 2012, p.
31). While this is somewhat expected from academic work, there is a lack of work that
actively engages with teen perspectives and shares those perspectives via scholarly
publications and presentations. The focus on adult perspectives is apparent when
examining HCI work that is explicitly intended to support parenting via technology, an
important stream of research (Rode, 2009; Yardi & Bruckman, 2011, 2012). More
generally, an adult-normative perspective sets the tone for work examining technology
design and use in families, placing a primacy on parents’ perspectives (Ames et al., 2011;
Yardi & Bruckman, 2011). This is also evident in the focus on educational objectives and
academic work in Information Science research.
Some work makes strides towards representing youth voices, often bolstered by
an underlying ethnographic perspective that informs research (boyd, 2008; Livingstone,

55
2008). This is also seen in the extensive set of case studies reported on by Ito et al. (2010)
in Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out, which each approach examining
youth, technology, and media in ways that value teen perspectives. Ito et al. explain their
approach in a way that makes their connections to ELIS clear: “we work to understand
how media and technology are meaningful to people in the context of their everyday
lives” (Ito et al., 2010, p 4). Additionally, some design research in the HCI community
works to engage their users via deep qualitative methods, going so far as to have them
explicitly inform or fully participate in the design process. This same attitude may be
relevant for studying teens’ technology and information practices – deeply engaging with
their perspectives may enable us to reframe our basic research assumptions and attitudes
that might be influencing or biasing the way we research and report on our findings.
2.11 Bringing It All Together: What This Study Contributes
While many of the above studies examine vital elements of teens’ information
practices, including technology practices, and the contexts in which they occur, there is
still need for work that examines these concepts with a holistic and integrated approach.
Further, as demonstrated by much of the above work, the social forces surrounding
information practices, including continuums of technology use, are important to consider.
We need to examine technologies in relation to one another (Grinter et al., 2006), but it is
also important to examine technologies in relation to the information practices they
support or potentially hinder. Additionally, there is much to be gained by designing
research that endeavors to support teens’ agency and recognizes that their opinions and
perspectives can help reveal new and different ways to educate, advocate for, and design
for teens.

56
Developing a deeper understanding how youth incorporate information practices,
including the continuums of their technology use, into their lives, can have important
implications for information providers, technology designers, educators, parents, and
importantly, teens themselves. Both the Information Science and HCI fields contribute to
developing this knowledge, and both fields have user-focused research streams that
provide a useful orientation for this work. This human-focused orientation places value
on understanding people by studying their practices, often employing qualitative
methodologies such as in-depth interviews, diary studies, and ethnographies. This
dissertation operates in this this arena by integrating ELIS theory (Savolainen, 1995) with
an information ecologies (Nardi & O’Day, 1999) perspective to better understand teens’
perceptions and priorities. This ethics review board approved study design is discussed in
depth in Chapter Three.

57
CHAPTER 3: STUDY DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND RESEARCH AND
ANALYSIS METHODS
3.1 Introduction
This dissertation works to integrate the study of teens’ everyday life contexts,
their information ecologies, and their diverse continuums of technology use, placing a
primacy on teens’ perceptions of their experiences. Understanding how teens organize
and experience technology, while accounting for relationships, practices, and values,
helps deepen our understanding of teens’ lives by incorporating social and contextual
factors to gain a richer description of the roles of technology and information practices in
their everyday contexts. By deeply engaging with teens’ perspectives and working to
support their agency in terms of how they participate in research and describe their ideas
and perceptions, this work reveals important gaps in our understandings of teen life and
technology use, as well as implications for the design of technological systems and
devices, and opportunities for supporting teens’ use of information via those
technologies.
In order to answer the questions described in Section 1.2, this work employs a
multi-method design to learn more from teens about their technology experiences and
information ecologies. In this chapter, the study design is described in depth, with detail
about the survey, diary study, creative activity, and semi-structured interview methods
used. All institutional review board approved study recruitment material and instruments
are available in the appendices. In addition to a discussion of the study design, this
chapter includes discussion of the rationale behind the selection of the recruiting
organization. Also included are a description of the eligibility requirements for

58
participation, and some details about the participants that completed the study. This
chapter concludes with a description of the ways data was prepared for analysis, as well
as a description of the analysis methods used: thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006)
and directed qualitative content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005), and supplemental
visual analysis (Banks, 2001).
3.2 Study Design
Best asks, “how can researchers develop more sensitive and empowering ways to
study youth and children?”(2007, p. 19). In this spirit, this dissertation aims to develop an
understanding of teen perspectives and needs through a variety of somewhat traditional
methods, as well as through some less common approaches. These include a survey that
addressed demographics, technology access, and internet skills, as well as a weeklong
diary study that included daily voicemail audio recordings and emailed photos of the
technologies participants use at home. The study also employed a creative activity where
participants developed an artistic output that described their overall relationship with
technology, and a semi-structured interview that focused on participants’ everyday
experiences with technology, as well as discussions of their diary responses and creative
outputs. Combining a variety of approaches allowed for multiple perspectives on
technology use experiences; the diary and survey addressed “in the now,” current
experiences, while the interview and creative activity left open the opportunity for
contemplation and reflection, as well choice about how participants engaged in selfexpression. This study design was approved by Drexel University’s ethics review board
and meets their human subjects ethical review standards.

59
Recognizing that participating in this study involved a time commitment (an
expected 4 hours and 20 minutes at the maximum per student), participants were
remunerated based on the number of study activities they completed, up to $30 for all
study activities. This remuneration amount was calculated based on the expected time
each activity requires and Pennsylvania state minimum wage rates (United States
Department of Labor, 2013). All but two of the participants qualified for remuneration
for each activity. Those who didn’t complete the full study completed everything with the
exception of the creative activity. The reimbursement schedule follows below in Table 1:

At the beginning of each interaction participants were reminded of the
opportunity to decline to answer any individual question, as well as to withdraw from the
study at any time. In order to reduce the burden of participation, the diary was completed
via voicemail, allowing participants to call and record audio entries at their convenience.
The creative activity was intended to be open-ended and personally engaging, designed to

60
encourage participants to express themselves in a method of their own choosing. While
some participants may have seen this as a difficult activity, the wide variety of choice
seemed to help mitigate these issues, allowing for those with lower interest to select
activities that required less involvement. Additionally, most of the participants expressed
an immediate idea about how they would like to complete this activity. Because the type
of output was the participant’s choice, those who wished to become more involved or
extend their creativity had the opportunity to share with an appreciative audience. There
is some precedent for teen participants enjoying artistic methods in a variety of research
contexts; at the request of her study’s teenaged participants, Jill Woelfer recently
coordinated a show of their artwork made during her dissertation (Guzman, 2013).
Indeed, several participants asked to send revised versions of their creative activities even
after their participation was technically complete, signaling their investment in the artistic
portion of the study.
These methods combine to give a rich, contextually informed picture of the
participants’ everyday life information ecologies, and provided participants with open
opportunities to exercise their agency and self-expression. More detail about each method
follows below.
3.2.1 Survey. The short survey took approximately 10 – 20 minutes to complete,
and probed basic demographics, current technology ownership and access, and Internet
skills, using Hargittai and Hsieh’s 10-item Internet skills survey instrument (2012). The
full survey instrument is included in the Appendix.
3.2.2 Diary study. Diary methods are one way to gain naturalistic data while also
accommodating for privacy and self-reflection (Carter & Mankoff, 2005). In this work,

61
the diary study included two parts: a one-week voicemail study, completed at once daily
for seven days, and a photo-based catalog of technologies used during the study, emailed
before the interview. The one-week diary has been shown to be effective with teens
(Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006a, 2006b; Moran-Ellis & Venn, 2007), as have audio
recording based diaries (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006a, 2006b; Sargeant & Gross,
2011; Wills, 2012). Voicemail diaries allow for naturalistic and less-obtrusive data
collection (Palen & Salzman, 2002). In this study, the use of voicemail was intended to
ease teens’ burden of participation and allow for deep data collection in the participants’
favored environment.
3.2.2.1 Voicemail. Incorporating mobile technologies into diary studies promotes
situated responses and lowers the difficulty of participation, allowing for diary keeping in
many locations at many times and giving participants more control over the process. This
approach can also ease the difficulty for researchers, allowing them to review data more
quickly while easing the complexity of coordinating interviews or other interactions
using diary entries as a prompt. When participants made their daily phone call to record
their voicemail, they answered the following questions:
1.

Think about your day and tell me about the technologies you used today.
Walk me through what you’ve used, starting from when you woke up.

2.

Now I’d like you think about which of the technologies that you used
today stand out in your day. Please tell me which technologies come to
mind, and tell me why they stand out.

62
3.

Thinking about those technologies that stand out, please tell me the more
detailed story of your experience with one of them today. What were you
doing and why? How did using that technology make you feel?

In addition to the accessibility and ease of phone-based diaries, this recording approach
allowed for listening to diaries while the study was on-going, reducing time between the
act of recording and the interview. This also enabled me to review the diary responses
mid-study, allowing the opportunity for prompts when diaries were not completed, as
well as review of recordings before the final interview.
3.2.2.2 Photos. Participants were asked to email photographs of the technologies
they used outside of school as a part of the diary study. These images provided insight
into the set-up of participants’ technology environments outside of school, as well as
helping them to identify which technologies they did or did not use during the course of
the diary study. This helped operationalize non-use and low use of technology.
Photo-based diaries have been effective with data collection about everyday life,
and when completed via mobile phone are “less onerous…than completing a paper-based
time-use diary” (Plowman & Stevenson, 2012, p. 547). Further, photos have the
capability to work as “pointers” that trigger recall (Carter & Mankoff, 2005, p. 4) and
provide “peripheral information” that while seemingly unrelated to the study can prompt
important discussions (Carter & Mankoff, 2005, p. 5), which may have helped give
participants concrete examples to use when describing their technology experiences.
This played out well in the study, as a number of participants referenced their
photographs during the interview process.

63
3.2.3 Creative activity. In an effort to promote participants’ reflection and allow
for choice in method of self-expression, this study design also included a creative
activity. This was inspired by approaches intended to stimulate creativity and expression,
also described as studies where “participants make things” (Gauntlett & Hozwarth, 2006,
p. 82). These approaches, typically rooted in artistic techniques, range from writing
poetry and making photographs (Szto, Furman, & Langer, 2005) to creating characters
with Lego building blocks (Gauntlett & Hozwarth, 2006). These techniques can result in
reflective, contemplative, and composed data, which can be used to deepen our
understanding of what is important to participants. In contrast to diary studies, these
techniques may be particularly well-suited to thinking about experiences over time,
contributing to developing richer understandings of context and emotion.
The creative activity portion of this study was intended to actively engage teen
participants and give them an opportunity to contribute to the research process on their
own terms. This was connected to a number of research traditions, including approaches
that involve participants in the design process, such as cooperative design (Greenbaum &
Kyng, 1991), participatory design (Schuler & Namioka, 1993), and work focused on
design for children, such as cooperative inquiry (Druin, 1999). Similarly, some critical
youth researchers consider youth to be co-researchers, developing and working towards
shared goals in a collaborative manner (Best, A. L., 2007, Cahill, 2007; Dresang, 2012).
Cultural probes techniques (Gaver, Dunne, & Pacenti, 1999) place value on active,
creative participation, and in other domains, creative and expressive methods (Gauntlett,
& Holzwarth, 2006; Szto et al., 2005) emphasize the importance of eliciting participants’
perspectives in a creative manner. Before the participants met with the researcher for a

64
final interview, they were asked to complete a creative activity, developing an output that
expressed their response to a prompt. I introduced the creative activity as a way to help
me understand their relationship to technology in general and asked them to respond to
that and the following:
“Think about your experiences with technology. What do you like and dislike
about technology? If you could change technology in any way you wanted to,
what would you do?”
The type of response was up to the participants’ choice, and could include but was
not limited to a photo essay, drawing, short story, poem, dance, or song. Participants were
given an extensive list of possible outputs as a part of the study instructions (see the
Appendix 2 for the full list). David Gauntlett describes creative and visual methods as
enabling “people to communicate, in a meaningful way, about their identities and
experiences, and their own thoughts about their identities and experiences, through
creatively making things themselves, and then reflecting upon what they have made”
(Gauntlett & Hozwarth, 2006, p. 82). In this spirit, this project was intended to engage
participants in their preferred method of expression, as well as allow them to make
composed, conscious decisions about what information they shared.
3.2.4 Interview. The interview portion of this study probed information practices,
rules and guidelines for technology use, and discussion of less-used and no-longer used
technologies. The interviews also provided participants the opportunity to discuss the
themes that arose from the diary study and to explain their creative activity. As Hazel
(1995) highlights, young people are increasingly recognized as capable of and competent
at “reporting their views.” Further, as Wills (2012) discusses, spoken word methods, such
as interviews, “can reveal narratives which incorporate experiences, feelings,

65
interactions, and stories.” This made an interview an appropriate way to end this study by
providing context for the other data and allowing for a deep focus on important themes
that arose in participating. Hitchings (2012) argues that the interview is an important
approach for investigating everyday practices, and that, as his title states, “people can talk
about their practices.” The interview portion of the study was intended to help address the
social contexts and values that inform teens’ practices, give participants the opportunity
to share what they deem important, and to confirm and validate participants’ responses in
other study activities. I conducted interviews with each participant individually, resulting
in a total of nineteen. The interviews ranged in length from approximately 26 minutes to
71 minutes, with an average length of 44 minutes. All but one interview were 30 minutes
or more in length. The 30 – 40 minute range was the most common with seven interviews
falling into this category.
3.3 Recruiting Organization
To recruit participants for this study, I coordinated with the Mid-Atlantic Youth
Connection (a pseudonym), or MYC, an organization that supports workforce
development and connects young people with work experience and internship
opportunities. This non-profit organization has been in existence since 1999 with the
mission of bringing together organizations and individuals to support the development
and the success of youth entering the local workforce. They use research-based models to
provide teens and young adults with on-the-job experience and career development
resources.

66
One program offered by the MYC brings teens together with local paid
internships. In order to participate in this program during summer 2013, individuals had
to meet the following requirements:


Be a resident of the large city in the Mid-Atlantic region supported by the
program



Have prior work or leadership experience



Be at least a high school freshman and no more than high school senior in
the 2012-13 school-year



Have the ability to complete all employment eligibility documentation

In general, the MYC employment programs work with youth in families that qualify for
Temporary Assistance for Needy Family support (Office of Family Assistance, 2013), a
public funds program supported by both federal and state funds that provides financial
assistance to low income individuals and families that are pregnant or supporting
children. While this is not a specific requirement for the individuals in the internship
program, staff of the MYC estimated that 80% of the interns invited to participate in the
study qualifed for this program based on their families’ income levels. In order to recruit
participants for this study, a representative of MYC emailed the full list of summer 2013
interns on my behalf, reaching approximately 6,000 teens and young adults in a large,
urban area.
3.4 Participants
To be eligible to participate in this study, individuals had to have worked as an
intern with the MYC, been between the ages of 13 and 18 at the time of study, and not
yet graduated from high school. This effectively targeted high school aged students,

67
helping to ensure that participants were in similar social contexts. As most of the interns
in the MYP program are older teens, these requirements also helped to focus the age of
participants to older teens between 15-18 years of age. Twenty-one participants enrolled
in the study, with 19 completing a final interview and 2 withdrawing from the study.
These enrollees’ data was not used for analysis, as these individuals did not complete
enough of the study to qualify for remuneration, and there is little information available
to contextualize any collected data. Of the participants that completed their participation,
five were male and fourteen were female. Twelve self-identified as Black/African
American, one as Caucasian, one as Asian, one as Hispanic/Latino, one as Black/African
American and Hispanic/Latino, and two as Black/African American and American
Indian/Alaska Native. One participant’s information is unrecorded (more details available
in Section 3.5). The full demographic breakdown is shown in Table 2:

3.5 Data Management
After the completion of data collection, audio data was transcribed into textual
data. For some of the audio recordings, I completed this process, but the majority were
transcribed by Scribie, an online transcription service recommended by multiple
researchers. I verified the quality of the transcriptions from Scribie against audio
recordings and was pleased with the quality of their work. I also created electronic files
representing survey responses and included these in the analysis processes described
below. Textual data was analyzed using NVivo 9 (QSR International, 2011) qualitative
analysis software. I also used the Microsoft Word processing program for notetaking and
some simple coding tasks. While they were a relatively small portion of the set of data, I
scanned the creative activity images contributed during data collection for analysis. In
addition to these images and objects, teens also contributed images of the different
technologies they used each day. All participants had the capability to email digital
images for this portion of the study, so these files were already digitized for supplemental
visual analysis. As a note, throughout the study I used my personal cell phone as the
recording device for archiving voicemail messages. Later in the data collection phase, I
had to transition to a new phone after a device failure. The new system did not record
voicemails as clearly as the phone I had pilot tested, so some of the voicemail messages
from the later part of the study were difficult to transcribe. However, I was able to use
notes taken during the recording process to support the analysis. Additionally, one
participant completed the survey but kept her responses after our final meeting, and was
unable to provide them later. Where this data is discussed, her responses are marked as
unrecorded.

70
3.6 Analysis
Analysis consisted of two large-scale techniques used on the textual data, as well
as a supplemental analysis of visual data. Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) was
used to address all of the research questions, and directed qualitative content analysis
(Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) based on Schwartz’s values theory (Schwartz, 2007) enabled a
rigorous analysis of the ways these participants expressed values in their conversations
about technology use. Each approach is detailed below.
3.6.1 Thematic Analysis. Analysis methods were selected with the research
questions in mind. The first stage of the analysis process relied heavily on thematic
analysis techniques discussed by Braun and Clarke (2006), and this analysis informed all
findings and addressed each research question. After transcribing all the audio data
(interviews and diaries), I followed with Braun and Clarke’s general description: reading
and rereading data that was in textual form, then open coding data with an inductive,
realist stance, in order to focus on the “experiences, meaning and the reality of
participants” (2006, p. 81). I conducting coding across the participants rather than within
the information from individual participants, as would be done in narrative analysis.
Following the phases, I then found themes, reviewed the themes, and developed cohesive
definitions and names. Braun and Clarke identify 6 phases of analysis, described below in
Table 3:

Description of the Process
Transcribing data (if necessary), reading and re-reading the data,
noting down initial ideas.
Coding interesting features of the data in a systematic fashion
across the entire data set, collating data relevant to each code.
Collating codes into potential themes, gathering all data relevant
to each potential theme.
Checking if the themes work in relation to the coded extracts
(Level 1) and the entire data set (Level 2), generating a thematic
‘map’ of the analysis.
Ongoing analysis to refine the specifics of each theme, and the
overall story the analysis tells, generating clear definitions and
names for each theme.
The final opportunity for analysis. Selection of vivid, compelling
extract examples, final analysis of selected extracts, relating back
of the analysis to the research question and literature, producing a
scholarly report of the analysis.

3.6.2 Directed qualitative content analysis. In addition to the thematic analysis,
I employed a directed qualitative content analysis approach (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) by
building a codebook based on Schwartz’s values framework (2007). This was informed
by the work I completed with Jes Koepfler on her dissertation (2014) examining values
expressed by SNS user groups with a stake in the issue of homelessness. This analysis
was prompted in particular by the second research question focusing on people, practices,
technologies, and values as elements of information ecologies (Nardi & O’Day, 1999).
While people and technologies are relatively apparent in the data, and along with the
practices of interest, are all addressed in the thematic analysis, values can be somewhat
harder to identify and evaluate, necessitating a theoretical framework for analysis.
Hsieh and Shannon (2005, p. 1285) identify seven steps of qualitative content
analysis:

72
1) “Formulating the research questions to be answered”
2) “Selecting the sample to be analyzed”
3) “Defining the categories to be applied”
4) “Outlining the coding process and the coder training”
5) “Implementing the coding process”
6) “Determining trustworthiness”
7) “Analyzing the results of the coding process”
Given that this portion of the analysis is focused on values, I used Schwartz’s indepth work on values to develop these categories. Schwartz describes values as
“desirable, trans-situational goals, varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles
in people’s lives” (2007, p. 173). He has developed a values framework that includes ten
basic values that “are intended to include all the core values recognised in cultures around
the world, covering the distinct content categories found in earlier value theories, in value
questionnaires from different cultures, and in religious and philosophical discussions of
values” (2007, p. 173). This structure of values has been identified in work with 67
different countries (Fontaine & Schwartz, 1996; Schwartz, 2007), so provides a welltested and validated way to conceptualize and discuss values.
Schwartz’s ten values are detailed in Table 4. This figure presents a variety of
information related to the values. It includes the value definitions, which are focused on
the values’ “central goal” (Schwartz, 1994, p. 22). It also includes the exemplary values,
which are “specific values that primarily represent each type;” Schwartz explains that
“when people act in ways that express these specific values or lead to their attainment,
they promote the central goal of the value type” (1994, p. 22). Finally, the figure includes

73
the sources where the values come from, or the “universal requirements of human
existence from which each type is derived” (Schwartz, 1994, p. 22). These sources
include organism, which represents “universal needs of individuals as biological
organisms,” interaction, which represents “universal requisites of coordinated social
interaction,” and group, which refers to the “universal requirements for smooth
functioning and survival of groups” (Schwartz, 1994, p. 22).

Schwartz highlights that “people differ in the importance they attribute to the ten
values. However, the same structure of motivational oppositions and compatibilities
organizes their values” (2007, p. 12, author’s emphasis). Schwartz organizes the values
into a model of the relations between values, seen in Figure 1 below. This model

75
highlights those connections and conflicts between values as a “motivational continuum,”
stating that “the closer any two values are in either direction around the circle, the more
similar are their underlying motivations. The more distant any two values are, the more
antagonistic are their underlying motivations” (Schwartz, 2007, p. 12). The ten values are
organized into four main sets: Openness to Change, Self-Transcendence, Conservation,
and Self-Enhancement.

Openness to
Change

Self-Direction

Transcendence

Universalism

Stimulation

Benevolence

Power

Figure 1. Schwartz’s Theoretical Model of Relations Among Values (adapted from
Koepfler, 2014, p. 26, adapted from Schwartz, 2007, p. 270)

These values are organized on two orthogonal dimensions: on the selfenhancement versus self-transcendence dimension, “power and achievement values
oppose universalism and benevolence values” while on the openness to change versus
conservation dimension, “self-direction and stimulation values oppose security,
conformity, and tradition values” (Schwartz, 2007, p. 11). Importantly, “people differ in

76
the importance they attribute to the ten values. However, the same structure of
motivational oppositions and compatibilities organizes their values” (Schwartz, 2007, p.
12, author’s emphasis).
Additionally, though the circular graphic representation has lines separating
values, “at a more basic level, values form a continuum of related motivations,” and the
values that touch each have what Schwartz calls “shared motivational emphases”
(Schwartz, 1994, p. 24). This means that they have similarities in what is considered
important for their achievement. For example, “stimulation and self-direction – both
involve intrinsic interest in novelty and mastery” and for “self-direction and universalism
– both express reliance upon one’s own judgement and comfort with the diversity of
existence” (Schwartz, 1994, p. 24-25). Schwartz goes on to state that “the motivational
differences between value types are continuous rather than discrete…values from
adjacent types may intermix rather than emerge in clearly distinct regions” (Schwartz,
1994, p. 25). According to Schwartz, this is especially true for hedonism values, which
can “[relate] both to Openness to Change and Self-Enhancement” (Schwartz, 1994, p.
25). Additionally, Schwartz explains that “the location of tradition outside
conformity…implies that these two share a single motivational goal – subordination of
self in favor of socially imposed expectations” (Schwartz, 1994, p. 24).
In order to accommodate for the potential blurriness of different values, I chose to
use the larger values sets (Openness to Change, Self-Transcendence, Conservation, and
Self-Enhancement) for my main codes, and coded individual values whenever they were
salient, which was the case the great majority of the time. I also allowed for each
statement to be coded with multiple values, which in particular addressed the complexity

77
of hedonism by allowing for me to indicate when Self-Enhancement values were also
relevant to a statement.
Building on Koepfler’s approach (2014), which was structured based on Cheng’s
(2012) technique for identifying values, I examined the full textual data set to look for
these four main values categories by seeking out values objects and the locus of values to
determine the underlying values in the text, defined by Cheng (2012), and described by
Koepfler (2014, p, 60) as:


“Values object(s): the thing that is being evaluated/judged/desired”



“locus of value(s): the evaluative portion of the communication text that expresses
one or more values through evaluation, judgment, opinion, wish, or desire”



“underlying values: the types of values that are expressed most saliently that point
the coder to the appropriate values sets for coding”
For example, one participant stated (all names used in this document are

pseudonyms):
“Studying this in our history, that the social, the gap between the poor and the
rich, that it was so wide that the poor barely even had a space on the chart or
anything. So I was always sayin’, I wish that it could be more balanced out, then
everybody can get more access to technology” (Chamroeun, M, 16).
In this particular statement, the values object is “access to technology” – this is what he is
evaluating. The locus of values is centered in the statement “I wish that it could be more
balanced out, then everybody can get more access.” The underlying values here
communicate prioritizing universalism values of social justice and equality, which fall
under the Self-transcendence category; as such, this portion of text would be coded under
the “Self-Transcendence” code. An important note is that not all statements will have a
values object, locus of values, and underlying values, so this analysis is based only on the

78
portion of the data set that is identified as having embedded values. This approach
allowed me to develop a sense of the underlying values each participant expressed, and
get a larger picture of the values that teens express when discussing technology. Chapter
Four goes into more detail about these findings and their implications.
3.6.3 Visual analysis. The visual data contributed during the study was evocative,
and worthy of a dedicated analysis that supplemented the analysis focused on languagebased data. As Banks suggests, “it is difficult to imagine how social research could
proceed using nothing other than visual methods. The principal academic disciplines that
employ field-based research methods are inherently language- and text-based in their
construction and execution of research programmes…[Visual analysis] has to be seen as
only one technique to be employed by social researchers”(Banks, 2001, p 177).
Referencing Wright (1999), Banks highlights the importance of examining both the
content and the context of images (2001, p. 10). Agosto described an iterative coding
process informed by Banks (2001), with her initial coding focused on describing the
content of drawings, and “later rounds of coding [leading] to the development of category
codes that were context-dependent…the coding final scheme therefore includes both
content-descriptive and context-dependent codes.” (Agosto, 2013, p. 64) I used a similar
iterative approach, describing the image and then connecting it with the appropriate
context. I employed this approach with the creative activity outputs developed for the
study by participants (collages, visual timelines, and one drawing), as well as with the
emailed digital photographs of the technologies participants used during the course of the
study.

79
This was possible because in part because in addition to the visual data created for
the study, many participants described their visual artifacts during their interviews, so
there was also textual data available for direct triangulation with the visual data. I was
also able to rely on the substantive language-based data that served as the main body of
data for analysis for additional context. Ultimately, these visual sources added context
and depth to my understanding of the participants’ daily lives and relationships with
technology by allowing me to see what they wanted to share, and giving them
touchstones to reference during discussion.
3.7 Methods and Results in the Dissertation
In the remaining chapters of this dissertation, I will go into detail about the
findings to come out of these analyses and discuss their implications, as well as open
opportunities for future work building on this study. Chapter Four addresses the content
analysis, examining the importance of values and the participant’s information ecologies.
Chapter Five focuses on the outcomes of the thematic analysis, going into detail about the
technology and literacy practices of the participants, and describing four factors which
impact teens’ continuums of use. Chapter Six discusses in more detail the implications of
these findings, and Chapter Seven concludes this dissertation with overview of the
contributions of this work, its limitations, and opportunities for future work.

80
CHAPTER 4: TEENS’ INFORMATION ECOLOGIES: PEOPLE, PRACTICES,
TECHNOLOGIES, AND VALUES
4.1 Introduction
In order to develop a better understanding of how teens use technology in their
everyday lives and how technology impacts their engagement with information, it is
important to consider the contextual factors that influence their technology options,
choices, and preferences. With this work, I set out to develop a more nuanced
understanding of the factors that influence and are influenced by teens’ interactions with
technology. In this chapter, I detail how I used Nardi & O’Day’s (1999) concept of
information ecologies to conceptualize and analyze the stories and perceptions teens
shared with me. This framing encourages examination of the people, practices,
technologies and values that come together in a local environment (Nardi & O’Day,
1999). Using this approach recognizes the complexity of factors that can impact teen
technology use and the roles of context and society in individual and group technology
use. One research participant, Chamroeun, described in an interview the importance of
technology in his life in a way that highlights the interconnected nature of different
factors:
“Technology has played a huge role, 'cause without the laptop or any of those
things, I wouldn't be able to finish any work. I wouldn't be able to go to [my
school] because if I can't do no work and if I get fired at [my job], they'll have to
kick me off of school, because the job actually supports my tuition… so, what
actually is supposed to be a $12,000 tuition turns out to be a $700 tuition for my
parents. And it just makes me feel good about myself 'cause my parents won't
have to pay too much for me” (Chamroeun, M, 16).
As he describes, the importance he places on technology and the ways he uses it are
connected to his family life, work experiences, personal economics, and academic

81
contexts. Chamroeun’s case is typical in its complexity and exemplifies why I employed
the information ecologies approach to better understand my participants’ information and
technology practices. Thus, this chapter focuses on addressing the following research
question:
How do the people, practices, values and technologies in teens’ everyday lives
inform and/or interact with their continuums of use?
In this chapter, I first describe some of the distinguishing factors of the
participants’ local environments. I then focus on discussing values, framed using
Schwartz’s values theory (2007), and go into more detail to discuss how values interplay
with the people, technologies, and practices in teens’ everyday lives. Please note that as
above, all names used are pseudonyms, and in relevant cases, identifying features (such
as school and organization names) have been changed.
4.2 Local Environments
As Nardi & O’Day (1999) discuss, the people, practices, values and technologies
that make up information ecologies all exist within particular local environments. There
are some commonalities in the local environments of the participants in this study, but
there are also a number of distinguishing factors that contribute to each teen’s unique
context.
4.2.1 Commonalities in Local Environments. I met all participants through a
local organization, the Mid-Atlantic Youth Connection, which connects a wide range of
youth to internship and job opportunities. All participants had completed a paid
internship the summer before participating in the study, and were contacted by the
organization on my behalf. All participants lived in a large metro area in the Mid-Atlantic

82
region of the United States. None of the teens had yet graduated high school, and all
mentioned an intention to attend college (community or 4 year college), even those who
were relatively young. In an effort to meet them where they were most comfortable, I
used public transportation to visit their neighborhoods to conduct the study, and met with
each participant in a local library of their choosing. Like me, many of the participants
relied on public transportation for mobility in the area, and most knew the transit system
very well.
While the study started in winter and the season impacted how a few participants
were able to take part, the majority of the participants in this study were enrolled in the
last third of the 2014 school year. Subsequently, a number of participants were engaged
in preparing for prom, graduation, and going to college during their participation, and this
informed the topics of discussion during the study. Though many participants emphasized
the importance of their education, they also mentioned the importance of social
interaction at school. As Malcolm explained:
“What I get out of [school] is more of like the social aspect, I interact through
friends and stuff and making connections with teachers. I mean yeah, I go there to
learn of course. But for me, what'll get me up and get me motivated is knowing
that I'm out there go see so-and-so and have fun with them” (Malcolm, M, 17).
Malcolm appreciated the opportunity to interact with his peers at school, citing it as what
kept him looking forward to attending. In addition to the importance of fun social
interactions, he also notes the importance of developing relationships with his educators,
hinting at the other kinds of social interactions he values in his academic environment.
4.2.2 Distinguishing Factors in Local Environments. While these similarities
exist, each participant had experiences, relationships, and contexts that informed their

83
own unique local environments. In this section I discuss two factors that varied across the
participants: their academic contexts and their socio-economic status.
4.2.2.1 Academic contexts. Although the participants all lived in the same
metropolitan area, they lived in many different neighborhoods and attended many
different schools. This is in contrast to the many studies that work with teens from one or
two schools, typically recruiting participants with the help of school administration.
Ultimately, I found that the diversity in academic contexts allowed me to think more
broadly about the impact of educational environment on teens’ everyday lives. Teens in
this study attended public schools, public magnet schools, charter schools, private schools
with various structures, and also participated in homeschooling. Not all teens went into
detail about the kind of school they attended, but most discussed these specifics.
More than half of the participants in this study attended public schools, with many
of these participants attending public magnet schools. These institutions are schools that
typically emphasize specific curricular areas, such as performing arts, technology, and
health careers. In this region, many of these magnet schools use a performance standard
to determine admissions, meaning that students must apply and meet minimum standards
in order to attend, usually a minimum GPA and in the case of a curricular focus,
presentation of a portfolio or an audition.
In addition to the strong contingent of students in public educational institutions,
several participants discussed attending private schools and academies. Chelsea discussed
being a “lifer” at her private school, having attended for all of her K-12 education. She
described her own central role in the student body:

84
“I run five clubs at school, I'm part of eight. I'm a part of a group of 12 students
that run the entire upper school. Umm, we make decisions based on what the
administration and students bring to us and we help basically figure out how the
school's going to deal with it on the student end” (Chelsea, F, 18).
Poppy discussed the ways her education was organized differently than traditional
schools:
“I'm home-schooled but I go to a blended center so I go to school like three days
out of the week and I think that's fun because, I can stay home and do work and I
can go to a center and like you know still interact and not be home all day”
(Poppy, F, 15).
Chamroeun and Afia also had an unusual educational context. Their private schools
collaborated with area companies to allow their students to work to contribute to their
tuition costs. Afia described her experience:
“In my school, you have to work to go there. The school will get good jobs. So we
work with big companies...the company gives the school like $30,000 and they
pay half of our tuition. And then our parents will pay the rest” (Afia, F, 15).
These participants discussed a variety of educational settings, each of which had an
impact on their everyday life. These different contexts contributed different physical
locations and daily practices to the local environments of the participants.
4.2.2.2 Socio-economic factors. Participants also touched on how finances
impacted their ability to access and use technologies. There were multiple ways these
factors arose in the study, including personal and family financial resources, and the
relationship between work experiences and technology use. Participants described
circumstances where their own financial resources impacted the variety of technologies
they had access to and how they were able to maintain and repair their devices. Imani (F,
17) put it simply when talking about her plans for future technology purchases: “I love
Apple products, they're just expensive for a 17-year-old's budget.” Sammie shared how

85
frustrated she was with the financial circumstances surrounding the broken screen on her
smartphone:
“I can't even touch the screen, it make me feel like I put all this money into one
phone to get fixed, and then, it happened again, so I'll say this is the last time I'm
paying for my iPhone to get fixed, after that I might go to Android. So, I felt kinda
bad, like I can't really use my phone and I'm paying the bill for it” (Sammie, F,
18).
The money Sammie had invested in her phone, its maintenance, and service was being
spent on a device that did not work the way it should. Sammie felt constrained by her
financial situation, and the combination of her resources and her history with iPhones led
her to consider changing phone brands, with the hopes of preserving future monetary
resources.
Though some participants described their limited personal finances, Chelsea was
able to leverage her understanding of technology to increase her financial resources. She
turned “babysitting into babysitting 2.0” by incorporating PayPal, electronic invoicing,
and the capability to accept credit card payment for her work as a care provider. She
explains:
“I kind of created a system which is a lot more flexible for the parents and like
I've picked up parents because I have a PayPal reader. I started off, when I was
just taking cash, it was two different families and maybe like twice a month for
each of them, and now I have five or six bookings a week…I've like upped the
business and I have about a spread of 10 different families. So productivity is a
bliss” (Chelsea, F, 18).
For Chelsea, her understanding of technology and creative approach to her work
connected her with a sense of achievement. While these are certainly personal
achievements, it is also important to consider that Chelsea also had both a mother and
father with graduate degrees. Parental education can be used as a proxy for socioeconomic status (Lien et al., 2001). Chelsea was the only participant in the study to have

86
both parents with this high level of education, and in connection, presumably similarly
high levels of financial resources (an idea supported by the fact that she attended one
private academy for all of her K12 education). While one other participant had a mother
with a graduate degree, all other parents identified by participants in the study had levels
of education ranging from some high school through graduation with a college degree,
with achieving a high school diploma the most common level of education.
On the other end of the spectrum, Chamroeun (M, 16) had a family background
with fewer financial resources, which ultimately meant he had very little exposure to
technology when he was young: “at age 14, that's when my whole life changed with like
the technology." In addition to starting at his high school at this age, which connected
him to work experience with a technology company, he explained:
“My dad managed to get a raise at that time, and we actually managed to save up
and afford all the technology we have nowadays, which is a whole huge new step.
It just feels so weird from before, because I'm used to having nothing, to having
so much now” (Chamroeun, M, 16).
Chamroeun’s family finances resulted in limited experience with technology, which
changed drastically because of new financial resources and a different educational
setting.
More than half of the participants talked about their work experiences, which
relate to their technology use in multiple ways. Several participants worked as babysitters
and care providers. Others had administrative office jobs, including two who worked for
non-profits oriented to supporting youth, and one participant worked as an organizer of a
youth program at a public library. One participant worked at a grocery store, where she
often supervised self-checkout machines. Another participant had developed an
entrepreneurial approach to work, selling clothing to peers when able to coordinate the

87
operation with a friend. Two participants had employment coordinated through their
educational institution to support their tuition. These various jobs are relevant because
working has the potential to increase teens’ financial resources, which in turn impacts
their ability to access to technology (while also understanding that for many teens, paid
work is a necessity to support basic living costs). Having to be at work would likely
impact how much free time teens had to use technology, but those that worked did
describe interacting with technology during free time for their own personal interests and
hobbies.
Working had another important impact - a number of the participants in the study
talked about how their work experiences informed their ability to access and use
technologies. For Chamroeun, his job represented a way to support his family and
contribute to his education, but also connected him to opportunities to interact with new
technologies outside of school:
“I finally had access to technology and all of that... And everything, all, like,
laptops, and I have my own desk phone and all of that. It was just new to me, so I
didn't know how to work any of that stuff, so it was a whole new experience”
(Chamroeun, M, 16).
Chamroeun was exposed a great variety of new technologies through his work
experience. This was influenced by the fact that he was working for a technology
company in a position coordinated by his school, rather than an entry level position.
Raymond (M, 17) talked about his personal technology use changing because of his
experience with technology at work:
“I had a job [at a local university] last year in the admissions office where my
mom works, and uhh, like I worked on the computer the whole time, like that was
my job…I guess after that I started to use the computer a little bit more cause I
knew like how to do stuff a little bit more…you could say the job influenced my
computer use” (Raymond, M, 17)

88
Raymond was exposed to different tasks that he could complete with a technology he
already used, and was able to incorporate his new skills into his own personal technology
use. For the participants in this study, engaging in work impacted their everyday life
technology use by providing income to support the purchase and use of technology (but
also potentially limiting their available free time), as well opportunities to learn new
techniques for technology use and to experience new technologies.
4.3 Values and Technology
Values can be more difficult to identify than people or technologies but they are
important components of information ecologies. In order to capture values in my data, I
used Schwartz’s values theory (2007). This provided a structured and validated way to
identify and classify the values participants expressed. Schwartz has validated his
framework using samples from 67 different countries (2007), and a number of studies use
his theory to analyze how values connect with technology design (Koepfler, Shilton, &
Fleischmann, 2013), the use of technology (Ames et al., 2011), and engagement with
information artifacts (Fleischmann, 2014; Hsieh et al., 2014). More detail about these
studies and other work examining values and technology use can be found in Section 2.5.
Like all individuals, the teens in this study prioritized values in a variety of ways. Their
patterns of expression reveal that values connect to teens’ concerns and excitement about
technology. In this section, I discuss how I used Schwartz’s approach to classify the
values expressions of the participants in this study. I go into detail about the four main
values categories, and discuss how these differing values expressions relate to the
participants’ concerns for their technology access and use.

89
4.3.1 Types of values expressions. Using Schwartz’s theory, I examined teens’
statements that included judgments, opinions, wishes, and evaluations to see what kinds
of goals they prioritized. I then connected these priorities to their relevant values, using
Schwartz’s categories. The ten individual values and their related values sets are included
below in Table 5. For a more detailed discussion of these values relate and the approach I
took for coding and analysis, please see Chapter Three.

90
To help demonstrate how I developed an understanding of values from individual
statements, I’ll return to Chamroeun’s statement from the start of the chapter:
“Technology has played a huge role, 'cause without the laptop or any of those
things, I wouldn't be able to finish any work. I wouldn't be able to go to [my
school] because if I can't do no work and if I get fired at [my job], they'll have to
kick me off of school, because the job actually supports my tuition… so, what
actually is supposed to be a $12,000 tuition turns out to be a $700 tuition for my
parents. And it just makes me feel good about myself 'cause my parents won't
have to pay too much for me” (Chamroeun, M, 16).
He emphasizes that he uses technology to complete his work, which through an
agreement with his school, contributes a sizeable portion of his tuition costs, thus
reducing his parents’ financial burden. Using a values perspective to analyze his
statement reveals important connections between his perceptions and practices.
Chamroeun discussed a positive feeling about his accomplishment of completing his
work and contributing to his own education. This has connections to Self-Enhancement
values: not only is he achieving personal success, but he is also earning financial
resources to help support him educational goals. While the most salient value set here is
Self-Enhancement, it is also evident that Chamroeun is glad to be helping his parents,
which has connections to Conservation values of security and tradition. Because he sees
technology as a main factor in how he is able to achieve these goals, he is describing
technology as a vehicle for Self-Enhancement.
Below I go into detail about how teens express values across the four main types
of values, making connections between their perceptions and their technology use.
Because expressions can reference multiple values and priorities, these statements are not
necessarily easy to place into simple, cut and dry categories, but thinking about which
goals are most relevant, or salient, to the speaker allows for fruitful analysis and

91
discussion. It is important to emphasize that individuals (even researchers) have different
ways of placing importance on values, and that Shwartz’s theory is not intended as a
method for judging the desirability of values. As I was analyzing this data I made sure to
remain reflexive about how my own values inform my understanding and priorities, and
to refrain from judging participants’ values expressions. I thought carefully about my
own values and made sure to engage with examples of the values that I prioritize less.
This was important for developing my awareness and skill for identifying all values
expressions and correctly classifying them. This helped ensure that I was addressing all
kinds of values in the data, rather than simply those that resonated with my own
perspective. Before coding the data (each time I did this step), I made sure to read the
descriptions of the values to ensure that I was consistent in my analysis. I also returned to
the definitions and examples if I had difficulty with classifying a values expression.
4.3.1.1 Openness to change values. Openness to Change values are generally
focused on the individual/self, and indicate preference for self-direction, change, and
exciting and novel or enjoyable experiences. All of the teens in this study placed a
significant amount of importance on the values categorized under the Openness to
Change values set, as these kinds of values were the most commonly expressed values
across the participants. While this is likely related to their developmental stages as well
as their increasing independence and opportunities to pursue the goals associated with
Openness to Change values, it is also likely connected to the fact this study focused on
their individual perspectives and inquired into their technology use preferences. Here
participants described technology as a tool to enable their pursuit of new experiences,
self-expression, and independent action and direction, as well as enjoyment.

92
Chelsea highlighted that technology allowed her to access new opportunities and
to increase her independence, both important elements of the Openness to Change set of
values. She wondered:
“Why don't I run more clubs or be a part of more? Why don't I take opportunities
outside of school?...I guess, the thing I came up with is, "I can't manage it by
myself,"…and I was like, ‘I need to find a way to be more independent with my
schedule and everything.’ So that's kind of when I started like using a lot of apps
and finding ways to create systems and how to figure out what to do” (Chelsea, F,
18).
Chelsea emphasized a desire to achieve independence and self-direction, and described
using technology to support her efforts to achieve these goals. Technology allowed her to
develop her own management techniques and processes, which allowed her to engage
with activities and opportunities available in her everyday life. Emma (F, 16) saw
technology as a tool to support her creativity:
“My view is technology is an extension of our brains, so we can use it for
whatever our purposes are, and like for me, I use it mainly to create things and
build things. I really love taking pictures and editing them with technology, and
making them better and making them more interesting. So I see technology as like
another paintbrush” (Emma, F, 16).
Here Emma emphasizes self-directed artistic expression and creativity as her goals, and
describes technology as something she can use to help her achieve them. Emma used
technology to explore her creativity, helping to fulfill her Openness to Change priorities
and goals.
Technology also provided participants with opportunities to access enjoyable
experiences, which fulfills Openness to Change values via hedonism. Sammie (F, 18)
discussed how she enjoyed movies: “I love watching movie Sundays, it's the best time. I
go on Netflix, watching movies all the time.” Technology allowed her access to the
pleasure of entertainment. Raymond (M, 17) described using technology itself as a

93
preferred activity: “that's what I enjoy doing it. Like my mom, she's always like nagging
me about like 'get off the computer' or something like that, or get off my phone, but it's
just what I like to do.” For these teens, technology connected them to pleasurable
experiences and allowed for the enjoyment of life.
4.3.1.2 Self-transcendence values. Self-transcendence values tend to be focused
on the welfare of others, and include key elements of equality, social justice, and
helpfulness. These were the least commonly expressed values in this study, with a few
participants not making any statements that demonstrate these values, and these values
being the least expressed by the other participants. Again, this is likely related to the
focus on individual experience in this study. Consequently, when these values are
expressed, it indicates to me that the associated goals are important to note for the
participants that brought them up. These values and goals were typically expressed in the
ways participants identified disparities in access to technology, and in their discussion of
technology as an agent to promote equality and common good.
For the teens in this study, technology provides benefits and advantages, and can
be used to support universalism and benevolence values. Participants described how
technology can support and afford helpfulness and access to educational opportunities for
all. Benjamin (M, 15) described using his DJ skills and the associated technology to
perform for individuals with intellectual disabilities: “that was one thing I was proud of
myself doing, 'cause it's like, I was helping out other people. It was real funky. They had
a ball, I had a ball. It was nice.” Benjamin used technology to pursue being helpful, and
he felt rewarded by fulfilling this priority. Charles (M, 17) discussed the learning
potential of the Internet and how it could benefit society at large: “searching the web,

94
you're gonna be educated about everything. The Internet is like a big help to humanity.”
Charles saw value in the way that Internet technology supported people he did not have
consistent contact with, representative of Benevolence values.
However, some teens also pointed out that technology can serve as a way to
separate portions of society, contributing to inequality and injustice. Participants who had
personal exposure or vivid experiences related to inequality tended to emphasize this
quality of technology. After a trip to India, Scarlett (F, 17) reflected on how her access to
technology felt like a privilege:
“’Cause I see like a lot of students like my age, a lot of people, they don't have
what I have. Even a phone, I know a lot of... I met some girls [on a trip to
India]...they don't have any phones to communicate to their parents. They can go
the whole day or two without letting their parents know that they're okay. And
here, I can just text my mom, ‘Hey, I'm home…just letting you know.’ It's kind of
sad seeing that. That's what I noticed from technology over there from here”
(Scarlett, F, 17).
Scarlett felt that the ability to stay in contact with family via technology was valuable,
and was deeply impacted by the realization that young women in India did not have the
opportunity to do so. She compared her own experience with theirs, and made it clear
with her statement that discrepancies in access were an issue of equality and justice.
Chamroeun had experienced low levels of family income for years, which meant that he
did not have access to many technologies until his teenage years. He focused on how
providing access to technology is a concern:
“Studying this in our history, that the social, the gap between the poor and the
rich, that it was so wide that the poor barely even had a space on the chart or
anything. So I was always sayin’, I wish that it could be more balanced out, then
everybody can get more access to technology” (Chamroeun, M, 16).

95
In the eyes of Scarlett and Chamroeun, the ability to access and use technology provides
advantages, but when others do not have access, there are issues of social justice and
equality.
4.3.1.3 Conservation values. While these values also include consideration of
others, conservation values tend to be associated with maintaining the status quo,
respecting traditions, and ensuring safety and security for society. These were the third
most common kinds of values expressed by participants, and were most salient in the
ways participants expressed concern for the impacts technology could have on their
society and their future lives, typically framed as concern for safety and a desire to
protect their sense of humanity at large.
Raymond expressed Conservation values in his creative activity essay, prioritizing
social interaction and relationships over acquiring new technology:
“one thing I do not like about technology is how sought after it has become.
Technology is an incredible thing, yes, but it doesn’t make any sense that the
general public would go out of its way for the new phone, or the new tablet.
People are willing to give an arm and leg for different technologies, and thus
begin to shun their family and friends in favor of that technology. People don’t
even talk to each other anymore” (Raymond, M, 17).
Here Raymond prioritized the goals met by Safety values, which emphasize harmony and
stability of relationships. For him, spending time with family and friends is more
important than dedicating resources to pursuing new technologies. For Raymond,
prioritizing human interaction was important for his understanding of a stable society.
Poppy also emphasized safety values when she discussed the importance of her own
safety when interacting with others online:

96
“I think it's a little weird to just talk to people you that don't know, online of
course, because you don't really know who you could be talking to… you would
be avoiding like a bunch of guys you don't - you never know people's intentions”
(Poppy, F, 15).
For Poppy, technology had the potential to connect her with individuals she did not want
to be in contact with. While she did not say that this situation had happened before, this
was a real concern for Poppy. Sammie shared this perspective in her creative activity
poem:
“Every action ‘social’
Shared with all online
posted For our Friends
And strangers all the time
Designed to add conveince [sic]
It makes life more complex
No one really sure
What will be the effects” (Sammie, F, 18).
Here Sammie highlighted her concerns about the tradeoffs we may experience when
using technology. Like Poppy, she demonstrated concern about strangers online, and she
critiqued technology - because we don’t know how using it will impact us, technology,
which has already failed to deliver on its promise for convenience, could present potential
threat(s) to society. These concerns place importance on the values associated with
security – safety, harmony, and stability.
4.3.1.4 Self-enhancement values. Self-Enhancement values return to a focus on
the individual, with key priorities including personal achievement in accordance with
social standards, and social status and prestige. These values were the second most
commonly expressed kinds of values across the participants. For teens in this study, these
values were most often expressed when they discussed promoting and sharing personal
achievements and pursuing academic achievement and college attendance. These values

97
were also evident in expressions describing pride when demonstrating self-sufficiency,
often in terms of being able to contribute to the financial stability of themselves or their
families, as seen in the statement from Chamroeun analyzed at the beginning of Section
4.3.1. These values also prioritize power over resources. This value was expressed when
participants discussed the desire to efficiently manage the technologies they used, as well
as to the ability technology to maintain control over other elements of their lives.
Benjamin, who performed as a DJ at self-organized parties and posted his original
music online, discussed using Instagram and Twitter to share his work:
“I usually promote some of my music or even some of my parties that I might have
coming up real soon… like if I have a party coming up, I'd put it on [Twitter] so
people could look at it and retweet it” (Benjamin, M, 15).
For Benjamin, technology provided a way to gain recognition and develop his audience.
Imani (F, 17) described research as one of her favorite things to do with technology,
stating that she liked to “look up things that help me academically, like if I don't know a
definition of something or I don't understand a concept.” She saw technology as a way to
support her own academic achievement, placing priority on her productive use of
technology. Similarly, Darya explained:
“My aunt wanted me to go in college for technology 'cause I understand it, like, I
play around with it, so, me, my thing that I really love it 'cause it helps me out a
lot. It helps me search for things like job stuff related, school stuff related, like,
technology is everything to me. I love it” (Darya, F, 18).
Darya described her fluency with technology as an achievement in and of itself, and
described technology as a support for her pursuit of job and school success. Additionally,
her highly positive evaluation demonstrates how hedonism can be connected to SelfEnhancement values.

98
For Self-Enhancement values, power or control over resources are also important
goals. This was evident in the ways that participants discussed technology as a resource,
as well as how they saw technology as a way to manage other resources. Participants
discussed negative perceptions when they felt that they had little control over their
technology. Britni (F, 17) had a preference for Apple computers because at her school
“we've always used Macs, so I've been able to…use them and perfect my skill.” She felt
her experience with these machines afforded her a good level of control over her
experiences. Other participants discussed how technology allowed them better to manage
the time resources. Imani saw technology as important for controlling her use of time: “I
don't know how people can write everything. To be able to type, and I can edit a paper
from iPhone, it is quick, it just makes life a little less stressful.” Poppy (F, 15) also
appreciated technology because with it “you can do so much in like a short period of
time.” For the teens in this study, technology had the potential to connect them to goals
associated with Self-Enhancement, including control over resources and personal
achievement.
4.4 Connecting Values to Other Elements of Information Ecologies
Using values as a touchstone, I will now discuss the other elements of information
ecologies, starting with a discussion of local environments, and continuing with a focus
on people, technologies, and practices.
4.4.1 People. People were also key factors in why and how the teens in this study
engaged with technology. Teens in this study discussed family technology use dynamics
in relation to how they impacted their own technology use. Sharing of devices was a
common and expected part of daily life, but it could also easily lead to frustration and

99
some avoidance of use of the communal technology for the participants. Ayeesha
described how her family’s communal orientation impacted her interactions with her
computer:
“We have a house computer, and I have a laptop. But my mom doesn't like using
the house computer that much, because my brothers and sisters put viruses on it,
and my mom gets upset when I tell them that they can't get on my laptop. So, they
get on my laptop when I'm there. My mom sometimes gets on my laptop. She's not
that good with technology” (Ayeesha, F, 18).
In her current home context, the technology practices of her family impact her own use.
Poppy had a shared tablet at home:
“my parents got it for the family, so it's kinda like whoever wants to use it can use
it. The kids, they always argue over it. I don't really like it 'cause I’d just rather
iPad…They like, bicker over it. They downloaded like a ton of games. They said it
was for the family but the kids kinda take it over, so it's more like the kids' tablet
than the family's” (Poppy, F, 15).
Charles had a less negative experience sharing his own device to allow his ten year old
brother to play games. He explained:
“Yeah. I let him use it sometimes. He cracked my old phone a little bit. He gave it
a little small crack, so I got to monitor him while he uses my phone, though. I
don't let him use it by himself. But, yeah, he uses my phone, too. He actually
wants a phone now” (Charles, M, 17).
Despite the small damage, Charles still chose to share his technology. Afia shared
multiple technologies with her siblings, and felt that the communal use in general worked
in their favor:
“my brother, I use his laptop. And my sister...from day one, the iPad with me and
hers. I'm not really crazy about the iPad. So you could have it for most of the day,
but when I need it, I would like to have it. So yeah, we share things. But it never
gets in the way of our work or anything. So, we all get our work done. So, that's
the good part” (Afia, F, 15).

100
Like others in the study, Afia had a sense of completing work as one of the most
important parts of using technology. When sharing, this productivity was a top priority
for her and her family.
In addition to using technologies for communication, sharing technologies with
the people at home impacted teens’ interactions with technologies. Interpreting these
sharing practices with a values perspective indicates that while they may not always be
entirely happy about it, the participants in this study prioritized Self-Transcendence
through Benevolence values, and Conservation values through Tradition and Conformity
when they shared their technologies at home.
4.4.2 Technologies. In this section I focus on the connections between
technologies and values in the participants’ descriptions of their everyday lives. I discuss
the ways teens’ discussions frame their use of technologies as ecological, and then detail
the ways that these participants connected brands and device selection with their values.
The information ecologies framework is useful for identifying factors relevant to
teens’ technology use, but is also important because teens described their technology use
as occurring within an ecology that included multiple technologies. Cressida (F, 17)
described using multiple devices at a time to complete her creative project: “I was
looking up the information on my phone and then transferring it to the laptop.” For
Raymond (M, 17), his interest in Facebook decreased with the rise of other social
networking services: “And like when the other social media sites started to get more
popular, [Facebook] just got more boring.” In Raymond’s case, using new social media
factored into his decreased use of Facebook. The use of one technology meant less use of

101
another. Chelsea had an entire suite of apps she preferred for her interest in collecting
data about her physical life:
“I use a calorie tracker, and umm, an activity tracker and sleep tracker…those
things are hard to do in like a hard paper…I see the usefulness of these types of
things but in terms of…data points, it's helpful to have in an app” (Chelsea, F,
18).
For Chelsea, these separate applications came together to help her develop a picture of
her own activity and health. Chelsea was able to make connections across her ecology of
her applications for this main purpose.
Close to 75% of the participants touched on their preferences for specific brands
of technologies, and these preferences were often related to their values. The majority of
the participants in the study had preferences for Apple products. Poppy (F, 15) preferred
Apple because “I think it's like it's easier to use. I think Android has to do so much just do
to certain things. It's easy to use.” Poppy selected Apple products because they appealed
to her emphasis on Power and Hedonism values. Ayeesha felt that the cost of repair
and/or replacement was a barrier to using Apple products:
“Now that I think about it, if it wasn't for my school, I never would have used an
Apple computer 'cause we don't have Apple computers in our house. I have too
many brothers and sisters that would just break that poor bad boy” (Ayeesha, F,
18).
Brianna had one of the strongest non-Apple orientations, for much the same
reason as Poppy:
“most of my friends are Apple people and they tell me, "[Brianna], you need to
get a iPhone." No, no, iPhone can't do as much as a Galaxy, Samsung can. So no,
but I do want an iPhone. I wanna have two phones, Galaxy and iPhone… iPhone
for texting, I think. My phone, my Android for music, 'cause it's easy to put music
on an Android, than a iPhone, instead of going through iTunes and all that”
(Brianna, F, 17).

102
Though she felt that her Samsung phone was easier to use and more powerful than
iPhones, she also prioritized social relationships with her wish for a second phone. For
the teens in this study, technologies function as a way to serve and support their various
goals and priorities, including their desire for technologies that enable their control by
working efficiently and easily.
4.4.3 Practices: Opportunities and risks. The participants’ values informed their
perceptions of technology, and as well as their perceptions of current and potential future
technology use practices. These teens’ framed technology as a way to access
opportunities when their values expressions emphasized Openness to Change and SelfEnhancement values. However, when expressing Self-Transcendence and Conservation
values, participants tended to discuss technology as presenting risks. In turn, their use
practices related to these perceptions. Teens expressed comfort using technology when
pursuing opportunities, but tempered their current use and planned future interactions
when faced with risks.
4.4.3.1 Opportunities. When participants emphasized Openness to Change and
Self-Enhancement values, technology was described as a way to connect to opportunities
for new experiences, achievement, and advancement. Several participants framed using
technology as a way to access opportunities. Imani (F, 17) explicitly said so: “I think that
having my email on my phone is the best thing ever. So, it's like taking advantage of a lot
of opportunities because I'm on my phone.” Malcolm (M, 17) discussed using technology
to access opportunities that were otherwise unavailable, including participating in this
study: “opportunities through email and stuff like that. Like this for instance; using it to
getting new opportunities that I otherwise wouldn't have access to if I didn't have email

103
or a phone or something like that.” For these teens, engaging in technology use
connected them with the opportunity to pursue their various goals. Chelsea (F, 18)
described how her fondness for outcomes led her to use heavier use of technology, sitting
at the high end of continuums of use:
“Is that considered overuse if I literally use it 24/7?...It's not like I can't put it
down…If I'm going on a camping trip it's not going to be like ‘I can't leave my
phone’... In order to continue with daily, normal life I need it. Which is like, I feel
like it's a little bit different than technology dependence. I feel like that whole
conversation of like ‘when is it okay?’ If it's helping you be productive,
[technology use] shouldn't be like an awful thing. And like I agree in the time and
place to turn it off or put it down. Again, what if it's useful?” (Chelsea, F, 18).
For Chelsea, using technology for productive purposes justified heavy-use levels. She felt
that smart use was different than dependence, and emphasized that she used technology
in a productive way.
4.4.3.2 Risks. In contrast, when participants focused on the values in the SelfTranscendence and Conservation values sets, they described wanting to protect
themselves and society from the potential risks that could come from reliance on
technology and technology overuse. When these teens placed values on these priorities,
they were less optimistic about technology’s potential impacts. They expressed concerns
about the potential detriment to academic performance and self-enhancement, and even
the potential health impacts of technology use. These participants’ described a preference
for limiting societal technology use and the rapid pace of technology design, and also
limited and envisioned limiting their individual technology use as a way to mitigate the
risks they associated with technology.
Cressida described how she, her mother, and her friend all saw technology as
potential distraction:

104
“My mom… says that she'd rather there'd be no video games at all 'cause then
[my brothers would] be focused on school…my friend did mention…the same
thing…'cause she was saying how she was trying to do her essay, but then she's
like, "Essay or Twitter?"…But if like those resources, I guess, weren't available,
then it would be the opposite” (Cressida, F, 17).
When I asked if that was an issue for her personally, she stated “Yeah, definitely. I get
distracted easily” (Cressida, F, 17). Like her mother and her friend, Cressida saw the
potential value of limiting access to technology to support academic achievement.
Afia expressed worry about the pace of technology development and how it could
impact society, and felt that she would avoid using advanced ubiquitous computing
technologies in the future:
“Technology is like a robot that could do multi-millions of things, which one day,
will take over mankind.... I think we should just leave everything just oldfashioned… as in you come home, you cook, you clean by yourself. That would
create less drama, or less heartache…there's no need for a robot to control your
house. At least, I wouldn't want it. I mean, it will get things done faster, but good
things come with flaws” (Afia, F, 15).
For Afia, the idea of limiting potential technology use was a way to help ensure
independence and limit the negative impacts of relying on technology.
Several participants discussed the potential health risks of technology use. Scarlett
(F, 17) was concerned that the prevalence of technology meant that people were now less
physically active: “So I feel like it has made people become a little lazy compared to like
before. Since we had all these things, I feel people were more active compared to all the
technology we have now.” Nicole (F, 18) described avoiding relying on technology in
order to avoid any potential negative impacts, including medical issues:

105
“Well, I don't really try to rely too much on technology because I know it can
have a negative impact on you. So, I try to do most things human based, what a
human can do and then, if I need technology, I will use it, but I don't really like... I
mean, there's nothing wrong with technology. I love it, but then again, I don't try
to focus too much on it because it can affect you in the long run as far as getting
cancer, all different types of things. So, I just try to do as much as I can as a
person and then if I need technology, I'll rely on it” (Nicole, F, 18).
For Nicole, avoiding heavy use of technology was an important way to maintain her
health and sense of humanity.
For the teens in this study, technology could be used to support pursuing their
goals, but could also present threats to those goals. The participants’ values expressions
connected with different technology practices and perceptions. For those who saw
technology as a tool for opportunity and achievement, use of technology was a desirable
activity. For those who were concerned about the risks that technology presents, use of
technology was something to be limited or avoided.
4.5 Summary
This chapter used an information ecologies (Nardi & O’Day, 1999) perspective,
with values as a main lens, to examine the ways people, practices, and technologies
impact teens’ continuums of technology use. The participants in this study had diverse
local environments, and while they also had diverse values priorities, they most often
emphasized Openness to Change and Self-Enhancement values. There were connections
between teens’ values expressions and the ways they interacted with technologies. The
participants had complex interactions with their families in regard to sharing technology.
They demonstrated that they thought of their own technology use as ecological, and
showed brand preferences with regard to their technology use. When expressing their
value priorities, teens in this study framed technology as supporting accessing

106
opportunities or presenting risks, and some demonstrated levels of interaction with
technology that correlated with these perceptions.

107
CHAPTER 5: TEENS’ CONTINUUMS OF TECHNOLOGY USE
5.1 Introduction
Building on the picture of teens’ information ecologies presented in Chapter Four,
this chapter focuses on teens’ information literacy and technology use practices. Here I
focus on their continuums of use, specifically addressing non-use and technology limiting
practices. One of the main ways I tried to address the complexity of teens’ interactions
with technology was to adopt an open-minded approach and inquire not only into how
teens used technology in ways they perceived as successful, but to also examine tensions
and difficulties they encountered when using technologies, and times they chose not to
use them at all. I focused on what technologies the participants in this research project
had access to, what kinds of use they described in regard to these technologies, the kinds
of practices they engaged in during those interactions, and how their continuums of use
were developed, adjusted, and refined. This chapter centers on these issues, and addresses
the following research questions:
What choices and preferences do teens have about their everyday life technology
access and continuums of use?
How do teens’ choices, preferences, and contexts impact the role of information
in their everyday lives?
Analysis for this study addresses a wide range of topics and themes, but in order
to help scope this chapter and to enable a clear discussion, here I focus on several main
ideas related to continuums of technology use and information practices that were
identified in the thematic analysis. These include how teens in this study defined
technology, how they described their use and interaction with mobile phones, the

108
information and communication practices teens prioritized with their technology use (and
the social connections that impacted their engagement with literacy skills), and finally a
discussion of four factors that informed participants’ continuums of use.
5.2 The Participants Define Technology
Although I was mainly interested in digital technologies and ICTs, I allowed
participants to define what counts as technology for themselves rather than impose my
own definition. During the first meeting to discuss the study, many of the participants
asked what technologies they should include in their reflections, and I encouraged them
to include anything they thought of as technology. This meant that the diary recordings,
creative activities, and interviews were open to discussion of a variety of technical
systems. I was struck not only by how consistently the teens in this study defined
technology, but also by how many of them described participating in the study as an
experience that deepened their understanding of technology and their own use practices.
When providing examples of technology, they did often discuss digital technologies and
ICTs, but were also broad-minded and included domestic technologies like vacuums,
ovens, and blenders, as well as large-scale infrastructures like public transportation
systems and water utilities.
For instance, Britni discussed her reaction to my encouraging her to include
anything she considered technology in her reflections. When asked how she defined
technology, she stated:
“I actually thought about the question a little bit more in depth after we met the
first time, and then I thought about it like, ‘Okay, technology's not just computers
and things like that’…So, technology, basically, microwaves, refrigerator, things
like the coffee maker…” (Britni, F, 17).

109
Prompted by participating in the study, Britni began to consider a variety of tools as
technological. She specifically highlighted the importance of domestic technologies for
her everyday life experience, as did other participants. Raymond explained that for these
tools:
“A lot of people don't look at them as technologies, but you plug them in and they,
you use them and they do things on the, like the inside, which is like what a TV
does, what a computer does” (Raymond, M, 17).
Raymond’s understanding of technology was less about whether it was digital, and more
about how and where the technology’s operations occur. His perspective again
demonstrates that teens are able to think about and describe technology with a broad
understanding, beyond focusing just on ICTs or digital artifacts.
Malcolm (M, 17) had a one of the broadest understandings of technology: “it
don't have to be electronic, but just anything you use as a tool to get something done or
just improve the way you're living.” His statement demonstrates that from his perspective,
technology is more about the outcome of helping or improving life than it is about a
technical specification. Scarlett also described a wide variety of items as technology. In
addition to discussing her bike, smoothie machine, and retainers as such, Scarlett
reflected on the importance of water infrastructure, informed by her experiences visiting
other countries:
“And I use, I would consider the shower as one of the important technologies I
like to use…I like to use the shower here 'cause I could take the time as long as I
want to but I'm trying not to now anymore since my experience in India” (Scarlett,
F, 17).
Scarlett had seen that water was a scarce resource in multiple trips outside of the US,
including India and Guatemala, and had quite a sophisticated understanding of the water
system and infrastructure in the United States as not only a technology, but as a privilege.

110
The teens in this study recognized that technology is not always digital or even
electronic, and named a great variety of technologies that they understood through their
own use experiences.
I also made sure to ask participants how they defined technology at the beginning
of the semi-structured interviews. They described technology with a cohesive
understanding of it as something that was made by people and designed or created to
support efficiency and making life easier. Some teens had even deeper reflections about
the nature of technology and how out understanding of it changes. Emma shared
thoughtful commentary when she touched on the idea that while many technologies are
intended to improve lives, not all have positive effects. She reflected:
“It's hard because when I think of technology, my mind immediately goes to like,
"Oh, computer, iPods." But then when you really look at it, pretty much
everything is technology in some way…it's like the things that we use every single
day…I know there's technologies, like guns are technology… that nasty stuff, that
doesn't make people's lives really...you can go back and forth with the definition,
but I like to think that it makes lives easier. I don't know about that though”
(Emma, F, 16).
Emma’s commentary touches on several key points. She highlights the idea that many
participants described, that technology is meant to improve everyday lives. But she also
wrestles with the reality of how technologies like guns have been detrimental. She
remains unconvinced that technologies always help people, but keeps an optimistic
perspective about efficiency and ease-of-use.
Chelsea also had a complex understanding of technology. She touched on how
time can influence what qualifies as technology: “I guess that concept transcends time. I
mean, currently it's devices and things associated with devices but in the 1900s it was,
like, electricity and spinning wheels, like you know?” (Chelsea, F, 18). Chelsea pointed

111
out that while technology can have a very broad meaning, the current understanding of
what technology is often centers on advanced devices and their associated software. In
line with this focus on digital technology and ICTs, which each of the participants took
up in their diaries and in conversation with me, the rest of this chapter is centered on
interactions with these kinds of technologies.
5.3 Key Technology Use Practices
The concept of continuums of use acknowledges that there are ranges in levels of
interaction with any given technology, and it also encompasses a wide variety of use
practices and patterns. In this section I detail some of the practices that teens in this study
prioritized and emphasized, recognizing what they perceived as important to their
everyday lives. This section includes a discussion of the prevalence of mobile phone use,
and details how teens use technology for various information literacy practices, including
information seeking, access, evaluation, and use. This section also includes a discussion
of the participants’ content creation and sharing practices, focusing on the importance of
audience.
5.3.1 The primacy of mobile phones. Mobile phones and smart phones were the
most discussed technology in this study, with nearly every diary entry including a
discussion of mobile phone use. All but one participant indicated that they owned their
own smart phone, and the one that did not had a traditional cell phone and an iPod touch,
which allowed her to use apps and engage in other “smart phone-like” practices like
messaging. Many participants talked about how important these devices were for their
everyday lives. Britni (F, 17) wrote her creative activity poem from the perspective of her
cell phone, and demonstrated how important this device was to her:

112
“Overall, I enjoy our all day outings
Our midnights conversations and
all the love I get from her.
I am her cellphone, And
she loves me a lot!!” (Britni, F, 17).
Britni’s poem highlighted how she is connected to her phone throughout the day and
night, and that she has deep fondness for this device. Other participants also discussed
how important their phone was by highlighting that it was the last technology they
engaged with each day, and the first they picked up when they awoke. Charles described
his smart phone use in his creative activity rap:
“Everyday I wake up first I gotta check my phone
Its my only entertainment when Im bored at home
Its my only friend when I am all alone
Playing loud music man I swear im in my zone
Communicating with my guys thru my cellular device
What im doing is so wrong but my phone says its right
It keeps me from resting when I am bored at night
If you try to take my phone then we juss might have to fight” (Charles, M, 17).
Charles and Britni both personified their smart phones when they described their
relationships with these devices. This level of engagement indicates that these teens see
their phone as a crucial part of their lives. Charles’s description highlighted that like
many relationships, his interaction with his phone had both positive and negative impacts.
However, he still demonstrates a strong attachment and willingness to protect his
connection with his phone.
Participants preferred to use their phone over other devices, even in cases of
content production that could arguably work more fluidly on a computer. During
Cressida’s (F, 17) research for her creative project, which presented an annotated timeline
of the development of mobile phones, she stated “I used my phone, and I also used my
laptop…and so, I was looking up the information on my phone and then transferring it to

113
the laptop.” Despite having access to a machine with a keyboard where she was
composing her project (as a Microsoft Word Document), she used her phone to research
information and moved it over to the laptop to complete her work. I was surprised by this
preference, as it seemed to me like the work would flow more efficiently on one device. I
similarly noted Poppy’s preference for her phone when producing her fashion blog.
Poppy stated:
“One thing that stood out to me when I was making a blog on the computer, it was
like really hard for me to make one, I couldn't really figure it out. So when I did it
with the app on my phone, I kind of did it in like a few seconds. Like it wasn't hard
at all for me to like set things up on my phone but on the computer it was like so
different than the app was” (Poppy, F, 15).
Poppy tried multiple ways to create her blog and found the app through her phone to be
easier to use than the same kinds of web-based services accessed through her computer.
Like Cressida, she found it easier to interact with information through her mobile device.
While the easy-to-use interfaces and displays were important elements informing
Cressida and Poppy’s preference for their phones, Chamroeun preferred to use his cell
phone because it provided convenience in other ways. He stated:
“I stopped using [laptops] 'cause I found out that it was easier to carry my phone
around. It was just simpler because a lot of things that the laptop can do, ‘cause
my phone can do as well. So it's just simpler. I kept it in my pocket, and instead of
carrying around a huge laptop, I just bring my phone with me” (Chamroeun, M,
16).
For Chamroeun, the computing power of his phone, coupled with its portability, meant
that it was his preferred choice for everyday life technology use. The preference for using
mobile devices was prevalent throughout the full group of participants, and has
implications for how these teens interact with technologies for informational and
communication purposes. Screen spaces for interaction on mobile devices are physically

114
smaller than laptops, and design standards for mobile devices differ from other
technologies in terms of functionality and options. However, the teens in this study
appreciated their ownership of their devices and the mobility associated with them. These
preferences may help explain the trend across US teen population preferring to access
information via mobile devices (Lenhart, et al., 2015).
5.3.2 ICTs: Information and communication as major use priorities. All
participants were very consistent in describing their preferences for technology use to
support information seeking and communication. When I asked Cressida (F, 17) about
her favorite things to do with technology, she immediately and succinctly responded:
“Read. Phone a friend.” Below I go into detail about some of the most interesting
examples of their use, and highlight the importance of audience for encouraging
information literacy practices.
5.3.2.1 Information seeking, access, evaluation, and use. Seeking, accessing,
evaluating, and using information related to personal interests was a significant part of
how the participants in this study engaged with technology. Being able to use mobile
phones enabled participants to have more influence over the information seeking process.
Multiple participants also discussed how they confirmed and validated information.
There were a variety of approaches to the task of evaluation information, with people
making a strong impression on how multiple teens engaged in this process.
Participants discussed many information needs, including academic, personal, and
work-related topics. Having access to mobile smart phones gave participants the ability to
engage with a wide variety of kinds of information on their own terms. Imani (F, 17)
described research as one of her favorite things to do with technology, stating that:

115
“If a teacher uses a big word…I will pull out my phone and I will Google it to find
out what it means in simpler terms. Or even if my friends, say if I don't know what
something means, I automatically Google it. I do that all the time, not just in
school” (Imani, F, 17).
For Imani, learning the meaning of words was an important activity in her everyday life
as well as in her academic life. Having access to her mobile phone allowed her to
immediately engage in information seeking for a variety of purposes.
Scarlett had a similar experience with YouTube, which she described as useful for
addressing many of her information needs:
“When I first started babysitting…I YouTubed ‘How to change a diaper’ and
that's how I learned. So I use YouTube just for like those things. But for
entertainment, I also use it, to actually help me with some things or for math
problems, too” (Scarlett, F, 17).
This statement demonstrates how these teens are addressing various information needs
and contexts of use with individual technologies, potentially contributing to the blurring
of lines between academic, personal, and social contexts (Gasser et al, 2012; Ito et al.,
2010). For Scarlett, accessing YouTube allowed her to engage with multiple areas of
interest, helping her to answer questions about her work and to pursue personal
entertainment and learning success.
Having consistent access to a personal smart phone allowed participants more
control over when and how they accessed information that was important to them. One
participant specifically described the ability to access information via her mobile phone
as a factor in her increased engagement with information. Ayeesha detailed how using
her phone to read on Wattpad, an app that allows individuals to share stories and read
others’ work, was an important part of how she accessed recreational reading. She stated
“I read way more on Wattpad than I have ever read in the library. And I've read a lot of

116
books in the library” (Ayeesha, F, 18). Having her access to reading supported by
technology allowed Ayeesha to increase her reading. This is in part related to the
convenience of accessing reading online rather than having to make a physical trip to the
library. However, Wattpad also offers alternative ways to search for content, provides
access to fiction of a variety of lengths, and provides a platform for members to share
their own stories. This convenience and variety is important to note for librarians,
educators, parents, and others interested in promoting recreational reading.
While increased access to technology afforded participants with the opportunity to
engage with information more often, having a personal mobile phone also supported one
participant in maintaining a portable library that received little use. Charles discussed
how having access to his Bible app, which he did not use often, was still important to
him:
“Sometimes you might like need to read the Word, or be in a situation where you
need to call on God. So, [you] might wanna look at important scripture if that
means a lot to you. And I don't have to go all the way back home or go to a
friend's house that has the Bible, I could just do it right in my phone. So,
technology makes that more convenient for me” (Charles, M, 17).
Charles used his phone to store information he rarely needed, but saw as very important
to have access to when necessary. His mobile phone supported portability and access.
This story demonstrates that technology can be used to support rare interactions with
information, but can provide significant value even when not being used for access in a
traditional way. For these participants, using technology streamlined the process of
finding, accessing, and even storing information. Mobile phones were of particular
importance for the participants, making information seeking and access more convenient
and in some cases, supporting increased levels of engagement with information.

117
The participants in this study also discussed how they assessed and employed
information they found while engaging with their everyday life information needs,
demonstrating a variety of tactics for this kind of work. Nicole (F, 18) was a Beyoncé fan
and looked up information about her “almost every day.” She described the way she
sought and verified information about Beyoncé:
“I research a lot about Beyoncé… I use her website to look up her apparel…and
then if I just want to find like general information I will just use Google to type it
in and find it out… I was on Twitter this morning and I seen some girl say that
Beyoncé and Jay-Z are going on tour this summer. So I was like, ‘Oh, well I'll
look that up to see if it's true.’ Then I went on and then People magazine was
talking about it…so I was just getting as much information as I can… I can't
really go by what everybody says, so I was just going by what the magazines were
saying about it” (Nicole, F, 18).
This story demonstrates deep engagement with topic of personal interest. Nicole’s daily
experience looking for and using information about Beyoncé included a wide number of
sub-topics and sources. Other teens had similar levels of engagement with a variety of
topics, including recreational reading, music composition and sharing, learning about
other musicians, and even swords and sword making. The teens in this study all used
technology to engage with their personal interests and hobbies, many doing so on a
regular basis like Nicole. In addition to showing broad and consistent information access
and use, this story demonstrates Nicole’s evaluation tactics. Instead of trusting
information found on Twitter, Nicole validated the news she found with other sources.
Checking across sources is an approach that approximately 25% of participants
described using for evaluating information. For some participants, this was prompted in
part by guidance from trusted individuals. Emma (F, 15) relied on her father’s previous
direction when assessing information:

118
“I heard this from my dad, that everything that's put out there probably isn't
true…So that's a problem with technology that's a lot of those things that you find
aren't really true. But from what I read on the websites, I kind of cross referenced
in that. When things check out, that makes it credible for me” (Emma, F, 15).
Like Nicole, Emma also made sure to validate information across sources and
purposefully looked for the same ideas in various sources to assess credibility. While the
skepticism in Nicole and Emma’s approaches is heartening, fulfilling every information
need with this level of validation can be too onerous. Adding some balance to the amount
of work invested in addressing information needs is an open area for educators, parents,
and others working with youth to understand and help address.
Emma fully embraced her father’s warnings about the validity of available
information. In contrast, Cressida had a different reaction to the guidelines from her
educators. She explained how she determines what information to use:
“Over the past few years, there's a rule of thumb that all my teachers have taught
me, it's not to go on Wikipedia, uhh, even though it's probably what I usually use.
I usually...well for [my creative activity], I went to just the dot-coms, the like
WikiHows or just the normal things. Or like if I was looking for something in
school, then I would use, like a dot-edu like a dot-gov or a verified dot-com…so
usually, I'll go for the more legit-looking ones, first page materials...” (Cressida,
F, 17).
Cressida used a more traditional heuristics approach for determining what information to
use, relying on web addresses and search results order to assess the available content. She
looked to different kinds of sources for different contexts of information use. For her
schoolwork she focused on educational, government, and verified company sites, as well
as Wikipedia, despite her teachers’ instructions. However, for her everyday life
information needs, she was less restrictive on the kinds of sites she used. The teens in this
study regularly use a variety of sources for their information needs, and demonstrated
multiple tactics for determining which information to use. The variety of techniques

119
indicates that there is room for more guidance on how teens can make these
determinations. For multiple participants, adults (both parents and teachers) were
touchstones for the evaluation process, and working with people in these roles may be an
important way to broaden teens’ understandings of information assessment techniques.
5.3.2.2 Content creation and sharing: The importance of audience. Sharing
content that they had found or created was also important for about one third of the
participants, and the social interactions related to interacting with audience were
discussed by all participants who had engaged in these kinds of literacy skills and
practices. Chelsea highlighted the importance of audience when she discussed the
significant value she found in sharing information with a small group of friends online.
Most of the friends she shared with were already attending college, and they all posted
and discussed articles from the news or their coursework with each other via an online
message board:
“And so all of the different articles we've put together are on it and there's six of
us and we all just post different things…just being able to have the interaction
with people that, again, all really love to have discussions and we all love
hanging out too. Yeah, and being able to connect on that academic but not,
because it's not monitored by an adult or like teachers or anything, it's just us
wanting to discuss current events and things” (Chelsea, F, 18).
While it is clear that her close group of intellectually minded friends was an important
factor in Chelsea’s engagement here, there was also value to be found in the absence of
particular kinds of audiences, namely adults and teachers. Chelsea used technology to
maintain stimulating social interaction with friends, centered on the acts of sharing and
discussing interesting content. In contrast to some of the other ways participants shared
content online, in this instance there was a very small but dedicated audience.

120
Emma had a complex set of practices for sharing her photos online that also
started with a trusted audience. She first went through rounds of selecting pictures and
editing them collaboratively with a close friend who was a fellow photographer:
“I put [the pictures] on actually in an album that only we can see because we do
this occasionally. We go out and take pictures. So, we share them, I shared them
on Facebook with her on a separate like group page that only we could see, and
she commented on what pictures she wanted to be edited… I took those pictures
and then I edited them, and sent them to her over iMessage, and then she posted
them on Instagram, and I kinda do the same thing” (Emma, F, 16).
Emma and her friend interacted though an ecology of technologies, using various contact
platforms and editing tools to prepare their images. After editing the photos, Emma then
went on to share her images more broadly via social media:
“I think people were like, ‘Whoa. That's really cool!’ And I actually I've offered,
since they've seen these pictures of me, I've offered them to take pictures of them,
too, because that's how I want to share out what I can do. I wanna share that with
other people and have them be able to share it with their friends” (Emma, F, 16).
For Emma, sharing of content happened first with a trusted friend, and when she was
happy with the quality of her work, not only did she share her images but she also made
herself available to help others develop similar work. She also received positive reactions
from her audience, which likely influenced her decision to offer her help creating similar
work. This interest in not only sharing content but helping those who saw what she had
created to develop similar work made Emma one of the most engaged in content creation
and sharing. Her successful interactions with a trusted individual and then a larger
audience may be an important scaffold for why she has become so engaged in using these
kinds of literacy skills.

121
Benjamin was one of the most prolific and public content creators and he pursued
opportunities to share his music both online and offline. He relied on his laptop for
producing electronic music:
“Once I'm first starting out, I try to find a melody that I could work with, and then
after that, it's like all straight up after that…so I'll transfer it out and then I just
lay it out, and then I print it to a mp3 file, and I just put it up for somebody else to
see, to listen to” (Benjamin, M, 15).
While all of these processes occurred on one device, Benjamin used a variety of
programs and online services to produce and share his music, demonstrating that he used
multiple technologies in tandem to create his work. Benjamin posted his work on a
variety of sites: “either SoundCloud, Twitter, Instagram, DatPiff, Boxshare, it's just like
basically everything... So if people go on there, it's like, ‘Oh, let me listen to it.’ Mostly
nine times out of 10, the people who listened, they like it” (Benjamin, M, 15). Benjamin
shared more widely and publically than any other participant, and highlighted that most
of his audience appreciated the music he created. Like other participants, this positive
feedback from audiences was likely an important factor in why he shared so much.
Additionally, he felt that his ability to produce content had improved over time, stating:
“Me, I've been doing this for a long time now, it's easy for me. Back then, it wasn't
so easy. Now it's kind of more simple than it was. Now I can see myself doing
more than a lot that I learned or knew in the past” (Benjamin, M, 15).
Benjamin’s confidence in his abilities and understanding of his own growth as an artist
was likely also an important part of why he was such a prolific content sharer.
Britni had an experience that directly demonstrates how these positive interactions
with an audience can encourage confidence, and in turn, an increase in content sharing.
She described the process of beginning to share images she took of herself online, and
how the response from her audience impacted her body image:

122
“My Instagram, it might sound crazy, but I built kind of some self-confidence from
Instagram…I've built some, a little bit because I didn't take pictures as much of
myself. I'll take pictures of everything else but I didn't take pictures of myself for a
very long time. And then when I put one up and then I see how many [likes it
got]…I was like, ‘Oh? Okay.’ Then I put another one, and added some more... So
it was just basically like a process…but it helped me realize, ‘Okay, you are a
pretty individual, and you have more to be proud of than what you think’” (Britni,
F, 17).
Having a positive response from her Instagram followers helped her feel comfortable
sharing more images, and over time, these interactions with her audience impacted not
just her information practices, but also her own body image and self-perception. As Britni
highlighted, her tentative early sharing of pictures of herself was appreciated by her
audience. While popular discourse around teens’ responses to online images often centers
on potentially dramatic and negative effects (MTV.com, 2014), in this case the responses
had a positive impact on Britni. This underlines the importance of how social connections
connect to technology use; had the responses of her audience been different, Britni may
have limited her content creation and sharing (and experienced other negative impacts as
well). As these stories each demonstrate, positive responses to shared online content are
correlated with teens continuing to create and share online. The presence of an
appreciative audience is likely an important element to nurture when promoting teens’
engagement with these kinds of literacy skills and practices.
While many of the teens who shared content online had direct interaction with
audience through the platforms where they shared information, Cressida had a different
understanding of the kinds of audiences that may engage with her work. She discussed
sharing her creative writing and journalistic articles online, and emphasized how it could
be relevant for her future career interests:

123
“I used to write for magazines and stuff like that, so I you know, took what I wrote
and it's online… if I want to write in the future, then I will have to put it up there,
so people will see it and maybe like it and maybe hire me” (Cressida, F, 17).
This adds to the evidence that teens who share their creations online were aware of the
opportunities available through engaging with an audience. For the teens in this study,
these opportunities included intellectual growth, friendship, feedback to improve artistic
work, increased self-esteem, potential career connections and networking, and feelings of
being accomplished and praised. For these teens, social factors were important elements
in how and why they created and shared content online.
The teens that shared online noted the importance of an audience for many
reasons. However, the idea of having an audience influenced other participants to refrain
from sharing online. Scarlett described her decision not to share her fashion creations:
“I've always wanted to do that, but I wanna wait until I get more experience with
things, 'cause I don't want to make something if I know I'm not doing... Like if I'm
gonna do something, I want to do it right” (Scarlett, F, 17).
Scarlett was very aware that her status as a learner may be noticed by an audience, and
wanted to present herself and her work in the best light possible. This demonstrates the
importance of teens feeling comfortable and confident in their work before sharing,
which was highlighted by a number of the stories of those who did share online. Emma’s
approach of sharing content first with a trusted fellow artist might be an appropriate way
to support teens interested in content creation but nervous about perception and feedback.
Chamroeun expressed similar thoughts when discussing game play-through videos
(recording playing sessions to share with other game players and fans online):

124
“The thing was though, when I watch YouTube videos, I watch all these gamers
on it, sometimes it actually inspired me to do videos...I want to make videos, but I
know I'm not, I feel as I'm not gonna be successful as they are, so I just stay back
and just watch their videos… Just thinking about it gets me nervous”
(Chamroeun, M, 16).
Chamroeun (M, 16) imagined that if he shared these videos on YouTube, viewers would
“say bad things,” and this influenced his decision not to pursue this opportunity to create
and share content online. Chamroeun’s perspective indicates that current sharing
mechanisms and norms may not work for all teens. For teens with nervous reactions,
finding safe ways to support sharing can enable exercising these kinds of literacy skills.
Audience was an important part of these teens’ decisions regarding whether to participate
in online content creating and sharing. Recognizing that these technologically mediated
social interactions lead teens to increase sharing as well as avoid it will help open
opportunities to support youth in developing and exercising these kinds of literacy skills.
5.3.2.3 Communication. In addition to using technology for informational
purposes, every participant discussed how communication was a crucial reason they
interacted with technology. Some participants focused on how technology supported
connections with people in a wide variety of places. Brianna (F, 17) highlighted the
possibility of connection via technology: “Twitter, Facebook, Instagram...everything. It's
a way to communicate with other people in different areas of the world.” Scarlett (F, 17)
appreciated the ability to make calls easily: “I like the phone 'cause it's a great way to
communicate with anybody. Now it's better because before you would have to buy a card
to make international calls, but now…you can just make the call instantly.” For Brianna
and Scarlett, the ability to use social media and mobile phones for contact across physical
boundaries was an important quality that encouraged their interaction with technology.

125
Communication was consistently described as one of the participants’ favorite
things to do with technology, and all participants discussed how they used technology to
maintain close connections with friends and family. Malcolm explained that
communication was one of the most important activities he carried out with technology.
He emphasized “staying connected…I think that that's one of the biggest things I use it
for is communicating with other people and just never being out of the loop, finding out
what's going on” (Malcolm, M, 17). Phones were the main way participants discussed
engaging in communication, and they used a variety of techniques, including texting,
messaging, emails, and phone calls. Charles (M, 17) preferred texting, saying “that's how
I communicate with my friends, females, parents, everybody…that's like my main way of
communication.” Afia (F, 15) focused on messaging and emails accessed through her
phone: “it's portable and after school, by the time I check it, I have messages, emails, all
stuff like that. It helps me communicate with people. It helps me get to people faster.”
Jasmine noted that her phone was integral to her communication practices, while her
tablet served other purposes. She explained:
“This is my cell phone, and this is like, my everything. So my cell phone, I usually
text on it, call people, like communication. Then I have my [tablet]; I read on it,
like GPS and everything else. So this one [the phone] is like communicating, and
[the tablet is] just for me to use” (Jasmine, F, 16).
For these teens communicating was one of the vital activities they engaged in with
technology, and phones were the most used technology for this kind of interaction. The
importance of communication contributed to these teens’ high levels of interaction with
their phones.

126
5.4 Factors Influencing Continuums of Use
While I wanted to develop a good understanding of the ins-and-outs of teens’
daily interactions with technology, I was also interested to learn more about the
technologies they did not engage with as regularly, and why that was the case. Rather
than presuming a high level of use by the participants, I adopted a neutral stance about
technology use in the design of this study to enable learning more about the different
levels of engagement teens had with various technologies. The motivations, preferences,
and choices teens described in connection to their continuums of use were complex,
contextual, and changeable. Teens in this study adjusted their technology use in relation
to four factors that I identified as themes during the thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke,
2006) portion of the study. These factors arose from data where teens discussed limiting
their technology use or engaging in non-use. These four factors include the following:
local policies and access, affective state, life stage and goals, and relationships. These
categories are not mutually exclusive, and can overlap and interact. While this is an
inventory of the factors participants discussed in this this study, it is not in the scope of
this work to present a conclusive typology of all factors related to continuums of use, and
I discuss these elements with the hope that this work will contribute to future
examinations of the full spectrum of ways people use technology.
5.4.1 Local policies and access. Local policies associated with physical contexts
impacted the ways teens were able to use technology. All but a couple of participants
had to avoid using specific technologies on school grounds. Brianna (F, 17) discussed her
school’s approach to phones: “usually, we're not supposed to have our phones out unless
they say it's okay.” Raymond’s (M, 18) school had a stronger policy: “you can't use

127
phones, at all.” These kinds of blanket limitations were the most common kind of policy
that the participants described. Unfortunately, these strict policies sometimes meant
missing out on being able to use resources for their coursework. Sammie discussed a
recent project:
“Now I've been using YouTube cause we have this two page essay due…and we
gotta do an essay compare the articles and the videos we watched” but at her
school, “they block YouTube…they say, that's your time, access it on your own
time” (Sammie, F, 18).
Sammie was frustrated because the strict rule made it more difficult for her to complete
her school work, especially given that her mobile phone screen was not working and she
had limited internet access outside of school. Though his school also had strict access
policies, Malcolm (M, 17) described being able to circumvent them: “they don't like us on
social networking at all…if it doesn't pertain to school or something schooloriented,…that's out. And games and stuff, out…but we get around that using proxies, we
put an 'S' in front like.” Malcolm and his classmates had developed workarounds to
access the technologies and platforms they wanted to use. However, in general, the
overall effect of these restrictions was limitation of teens’ ability to choose how and when
they used technology. Despite having their technologies accessible, teens following local
policies limited their technology use. Teens circumventing policies had limited
opportunities for use, with the potential for reprimand for using technology.
Because of the diversity of academic experiences the teens in this study described,
there were a variety of kinds of policies in schools. Chelsea (F, 18) felt that her school
was more open as long as technology was used for coursework: “I would say our
tolerance on campus is pretty high for technology. Again, as long as it's being used
correctly, of course.” Though Chelsea felt more comfortable using her personal devices

128
on her campus, she still limited her technology use to academic tasks in order to follow
the guidelines. Emma went into detail about her experiences at school:
“They just instituted a bring your own device thing at the school which is actually
why I have my iPod Touch…you can only have your devices out at certain
times…they have just like really strict filters on the places that you can go on
which is really annoying” (Emma, F, 15).
For Emma, using her own device allowed her to interact with technology during the
course of her day at school, but following the rules on her campus meant that she could
only do so at specific times. Additionally, even when able to use her device, policies
impacting what kind of information she had access to prevented her from accessing a
variety of content. While there are variations in how these kinds of access policies were
implemented, the overarching result was that for the teens in this study, local policies like
those in schools encouraged them to limit their use. In some stricter cases, teens had to
disengage from technology use completely or risk getting in trouble with teachers or
administrators. For these teens, their authority to determine their level of interaction with
technology is managed and impacted by local policy.
On the other hand, consistent access allowed participants to choose when and how
they interacted with entertainment technologies. Afia (F, 15) described her low level of
television use on school nights: “I have a flatscreen TV in my room…‘you're always
gonna be there.’ I can watch it whenever I want to…I know I have access to it, but it's not
something I go crazy for.” Emma, who typically played simulation games on her
computer, rarely played her brother’s console games. She discussed picking them up
during her summer vacation from school:
“I feel like every year, once I year, I'll turn on the XBox, and I'll be like, "I'm good
at this. I can do this." Actually, this summer, I went through an entire Call of Duty
game by myself, and I beat it” (Emma, F, 16).

129
These stories of low levels of entertainment technology use show that for the teens in this
study, continuums of use can occur over extended periods of time. Importantly, Afia and
Emma were both comfortable with their levels of use of these entertainment technologies.
This demonstrates that low levels of use of technologies can be determined by choice
rather than access levels, which Selwyn frames as the exercise of agency (Selwyn, 2003).
These choices were in part related to their academic work, as these participants adjusted
their engagement with readily available entertainment technologies to accommodate their
school schedules. In general, this factor demonstrates that when participants have access
to a technology, local policy and ready access can contribute to limited levels of
technology use.
5.4.2 Affective Factors. Emotion also came up as a factor in how teens interacted
with technologies. Approximately 75% of the participants described situations where
setting down their phone or walking away from their computers helped them to manage
frustration, typically associated with the inefficiency of the device or software they were
attempting to use. Darya discussed how she would walk away from her computer when
upset:
“I start to get frustrated really big…'cause [the desktop computer will] move
slow, like when it's loading, the browser…I exit out and I go right back in there
and see if it move faster, and if it don't move faster I just stop 'cause it annoys me”
(Darya, F, 18).
Darya described how the slow speed of access to information regularly caused to be upset
with computer. She developed the technique of taking a break to relieve her frustration
when her second attempts at access are unsuccessful. Malcolm had similar experiences
with his phone: “I gotta rely on my phone service and it's ridiculously slow, like

130
sometimes it doesn't even work…and I get irritated... I don't throw my phone but I just
like, I'm done with it” (Malcolm, M, 17). Like Darya, Malcolm would chose to walk
away from the technology when frustrated, though this technique was not always
successful: “that would be like 10 minutes, then I find myself going back and trying to do
the same thing, it just didn't work and getting mad all over again” (Malcolm, M, 17).
Poor access speed was a consistent trigger for participants to feel angry or frustrated, and
the typical response was to step away from whatever technology they were using to take
a break.
While frustration with technology happened when participants were using
technology to access information, it also occurred when participants were developing
content. Benjamin described a negative experience when composing a song:
“There was one time I was working on one song and my laptop completely just
shut off. I didn't save nothing. I'm just saying, ‘Oh my God, I just spent three
hours working on this, and my laptop just shut off on me. That's crazy.’…went in
my room and laid down, 'cause I was just so frustrated I was like, ‘I need to lay
down or something’” (Benjamin, M, 15).
He explained that when he came back to his computer he “just gave up and just started a
whole new project” (Benjamin, M, 15). These kinds of content loss were vivid
experiences for several participants. In some cases, this triggered participants to seek out
new ways to develop content. Chelsea (F, 18) recounted a past experience with Microsoft
Word that prompted her adoption of cloud-based services: “I lost a 15-page paper by
using Word and I was like, ‘Never again’…with Word, it's gone if your hard drive fails.
You don't have to worry about that with Google Docs and Evernote.” Content loss
prompted participants to step away from technology to vent their frustration. This also

131
resulted in shifting to other platforms for future work, stopping use of the platform that
had exhibited failure.
One participant also chose to interact with technology only at certain times
because of the way he acted when using it. Raymond (M, 17) described how his
experiences led him to play games at night:
“It's a, like something I like to do, mostly at night because…I don't want anybody
looking at me like getting frustrated with the games. Cause umm, I'm kinda crazy
with it, a little…I get really like overly concentrated with it.” (Raymond, M, 17).
Raymond did not want to be observed expressing deep engagement or frustration with
games, so he limited his playing times. For these participants, technology itself caused
frustration, and in order to manage their emotional responses, these teens chose to adjust
their levels of use.
Most of the discussion of emotion was associated with participants setting down
their technologies or limiting their exposure to technologies, since they were typically the
trigger for their emotional response. However, two participants had different perspectives
on emotions and continuums of use. Cressida, who developed a creative output that
presented the timeline of cell phone development, demonstrated a moderated perspective
on frustration with technology. She hoped that people would “appreciate what we have
now. 'Cause people are always saying, ‘I hate my phone. It's glitching,’ but I mean, if you
had [one of the early cell phones], then you'd appreciate your phone more” (Cressida, F,
17). Cressida had learned more about how previous phone technology worked, and so
appreciated her current device, even when it didn’t work as effectively as she would like.
This knowledge helped her to mitigate the frustration so many other participants

132
experienced when using their phones. In contrast to the other participants, Britni
described engaging with her phone in response to her emotions. She stated:
“[My phone is] like an outlet to me. So if I'm upset or I'm angry, that's the first
thing I go to. I don't usually talk to anybody about it until after I've…used my
phone or whatever, and then I'll like talk to a physical person…But this is
probably the first thing that I pick up when I'm upset, or even when I'm happy”
(Britni, F, 17).
Changes in Britni’s affective state prompted her to increase her technology use, providing
a safe refuge while she processed her emotions. The other teens’ stepped away from
technology to calm down and manage frustration prompted by their technology use, and
Britni picked up technology to manage her responses to other stimuli. The experiences of
the participants show that technology use can prompt affective states that teens feel are
best dealt with by limiting technology use. However, increased technology use can also
help support some teens while they handle a variety of affective states.
5.4.3 Life stage and future goals. Teens discussed their technology use with
recognition that their current experiences were related to their past and future technology
use. They expressed the understanding that they may change their levels of technology
use in the future, and indeed, had often already shifted their use practices. These ideas
typically arose when participants were discussing their future goals of attending college,
framed through their experiences as late stage high school students.
All of the participants in the study discussed their college plans, and many of the
seniors even knew at the time of their participation where they would be attending
school. Preparing for college was an important part of how these teens determined their
levels of technology use, social media in particular. Jasmine (F, 16) stated “I actually do
not have any social media. I really wanna go to college and I hear that colleges look at it

133
and I just don't wanna jeopardize it in any kind of way.” Jasmine was very cautious about
her potential college attendance, and was unwilling to use technology in ways she felt
might negatively impact her opportunity to attend. Chelsea had a similar story: “I got rid
of my Twitter and my Instagram at the beginning of the college application season, I was
like, I don't wanna, just in case” (Chelsea, F, 18). Chelsea began limiting her technology
use when she started applying to colleges, demonstrating caution about how these
institutions might view her online activities. Rather than avoiding or engaging in full nonuse of social media, Brianna was careful about what she posted online. She was
particularly careful about images and language:
“Pictures, I don't get into all of that, nude or whatever, no clothes showing. No, I
don't get into all of that. That's really it. That's my limit…cursing, that's the limit
sometimes, if I'm not venting…’cause I know colleges look at that stuff, jobs look
at that stuff, a lot of people look at that stuff” (Brianna, F, 17).
Brianna was aware that these kinds of posts might impact not just her college acceptance,
but job opportunities as well. These participants avoided or limited their current
technology use because they prioritized their potential college acceptance and future
career opportunities; awareness of future possibilities impacted their current technology
use practices. In a contrasting example, Ayeesha (F, 18) was about to graduate high
school and wanted to prepare for going to college in the fall, so had developed new
practices online: “I've recently started looking up lectures..’ cause I had to get used to
them... Some of them are really mind-blowing… That's something I've been doing in the
norm. I at least try to do one lecture a day.” Ayeesha had adopted new technology
practices to prepare for her future workload. The stories of these participants demonstrate
that future goals had an impact on the ways they engaged with technology in their current
everyday lives, typically resulting in the limiting of technology use.

134
These future goals and priorities also impacted the ways teens discussed their
future technology use. Several teens in this study imagined that the ways they used
technology would change after graduating high school. Charles (M, 17) anticipated that
his use of his phone would decrease in college:
“I'll probably be on my phone a little bit less because I text a whole lot of class,
but once I get to college, I'm not gonna do that as much because as I want to pay
attention. I'm paying for my education, so it's more important” (Charles, M, 17).
Charles imagined that he would prioritize his courses over the opportunity to connect
through texting. Similarly, Brianna (F, 17) felt that she would have decreased interaction
with social media: “I probably won't be on there as much to even worry about it, 'cause
when I'm in college, I'm focusing on college stuff.” Imani felt that her interest in
technology in general would decrease, but also felt that this was a normal experience. She
stated: “I think I'll become a little bit detached from technology, because I'll be so
busy…I'll be so focused on like getting good grades, that it'll definitely slow down, but
that's just life” (Imani, F, 17). For these participants, college represented a time where
they would prioritize their learning and academic achievement over maintaining their
current continuums of technology use. While potential inaccurate, the consistency of
these kinds of predictions demonstrates again that these teens were invested in their
education, and that they their future goals informed their understandings of their potential
interactions with technology.
5.4.4 Relationships. Relationships are also a key impact on both subtle changes
in levels of technology use, as well as large shifts. Around a third of the participants
discussed how changes in their relationships led to changes in the ways they used
technologies. While a few of the female participants briefly mentioned being in contact

135
with boyfriends via technology, more of the male participants in the study went into
detail about how contacting girlfriends and potential dating partners was related to shifts
and changes in their technology use. Charles (M, 17) explained “see, when I had a
girlfriend, I would text her. I'm single now, so I text my three main texting buddies when I
wake up in the morning.” Charles’ three main texting buddies were young women; as he
put it, “every pretty girl likes to see a good morning text,” and he saw texting in the
morning as a way to “see who cares about you” (Charles, M, 17). However, he was clear
that this pattern of texting multiple friends each morning was different from his practices
when he had a girlfriend. Malcolm had a similar awareness of his increase in his texting
with his prom date:
“Right now [one] girl I talk to, especially with prom coming up, I just gotta stay
in contact with her. I don't wanna get a suit, then she get to the place and she is
like ‘what is this?’ you know. I gotta keep in contact with that” (Malcolm, M, 17).
These may be slight changes to texting practices, but for the participants discussing them,
they were distinct from their previous ways of using the technology. Chamroeun
described how he and his girlfriend used a video game to connect and spend time
together:
“She would get mad at me sometimes… like, ‘why are you playing with your

phone,’ and I'm just like, ‘I'm playing this game’…Then that's when we started
talking and it was so fun. And so the thing was, she wanted to... find a basis with
me…so we used the game” (Chamroeun, M, 16).
Chamroeun and his girlfriend were able to use technology to spend time together and
ultimately strengthen their relationship, increasing their use of the gaming technology in
the process. Changing relationships are a normal part of teen life, and for these teens,
these shifts impacted how they interacted with technologies. Relationships could prompt

136
higher levels of interaction to support communication, as well as an increase in shared
technology use.
A few of the teens detailed how their technology use changes were connected
with negative experiences in social relationships. These shifts in technology use were
characterized by participants engaging in what they considered non-use of the
technologies associated with these negative experiences. Additionally, these changes
were coupled with the perception that the continuums of use of the specific technologies
would not change in the future. These cases stood out as particularly vivid, and were
triggered in cases of emotional upheaval or discomfort. These experiences included
online aggression and drama, as well as significant changes in important relationships
with others who were associated with particular technologies.
Darya observed drama at school and had her Facebook page hacked, both of
which deeply troubled her. She subsequently stopped using Facebook completely:
“I mean after my page got hacked, I was like ‘Okay, I'm not going to deal with it’
and…certain things was happening at school like drama. I don't like drama. I
can't stand it. So I just be like, ‘Let me take myself and remove myself from this
aura and just leave it alone’” (Darya, F, 18).
Because of her experiences with drama and online aggression, Darya deleted her account,
shifting her continuum of use for Facebook to the non-use level. Drama also prompted
Chamroeun to drastically decrease his use of Facebook:
“It just brought too much drama…then people will start fighting and then I'll be
brought into that…this one person threatened me even though I didn't even do
anything. So I was like, ‘You know what? Stop this all together.’ I just hated it”
(Chamroeun, M, 16).
While he “stopped Facebook once and all together,” he did not delete his account. He
periodically used it to access offers for a game he played, also giving his mother access to

137
“check on her friends.” This is an important point. Chamroeun perceived of this as a real
disengagement with Facebook – as non-use – and shared strong feelings about why and
how he stopped interacting with this technology. However, some research studies would
consider him to be a Facebook user, interpreting his active account as indicative of use of
the technology. This is one area where the concept of continuums of use is particularly
helpful, allowing for consideration of this participant’s perceptions and purposeful
disengagement as an indicator of extended non-use.
These kinds of deep shifts were not just related to social media. Britni had a
change in a personal relationship that prompted her shift to non-use of gaming
technology. She remembered: “I used to be a really heavy gamer, but I don't use them at
all now…actually, I have put them in a bag to give them away.” She further explained:
“I think my games and stuff, they have a lot of value. It's not sentimental value,
but like value that I just don't wanna have, or an attachment that I just don't
wanna have, because a person that I really don't care too much about got them
for me. So, I figured, I'm just gonna get everything that you got me and I'm gonna
push it away” (Britni, F, 17).
Britni connected her feelings about the individual for with the technology they used to
share. Determining that she didn’t want a reminder of this former relationship prompted
her stop interacting with the gaming technology. Britni’s story, as well as Darya’s and
Chamroeun’s, shed light on how negative experiences and relationships can lead teens to
decrease their interactions with certain technologies. While their levels of use may
change in the future, at the time of the study each of these participants described their
engagement as deeply and irrevocably changed.

138
5.5 Summary
The teens from an urban setting that participated in this study demonstrated
diverse continuums of use with various kinds of technologies. Smart phones were their
favored devices, in part for their ability to support communication, as well as their
portability. The literacy skills and experiences the participants discussed had strong
relationships with social connections, most evident in the ways that the perception of
audience informed decisions about what to share online, where, and when. In addition to
describing these use practices, this chapter identified four factors impacting teens’
technology continuums of use: local policy and access, affective factors, life stage and
future goals, and relationships. While teens in this study used technologies for a variety
of purposes, they also demonstrated a variety of technology limiting and non-use
practices that were influenced by these factors.

139
CHAPTER 6: DISCUSSION
6.1 Introduction
By combining a focus on everyday life contexts and continuums of use with an
information ecologies perspective for this research, I was able to develop a rich picture of
the variety of ways teens in this study interacted with technology, as well as how they
limited their interactions with technologies. In this chapter I make connections among
these concepts with other research, and conclude by focusing on the implications of these
findings for a variety of arenas and groups, including caregivers, libraries and educational
institutions, technology designers, and researchers.
6.2 Information Ecologies and Values
This work demonstrated that these teens place emphasis on a variety of values.
While the participants most often expressed Openness to Change and Self-Enhancement
values, more than half of the teens in the study discussed Conservation and SelfTranscendence values and their associated goals. Though there is little work examining
teens’ values in this way, one survey-based longitudinal study with Russian and Estonian
early adolescents (participants began the study in 7th grade) had similar findings. The
authors note that the values expressions from the youth in their study might be related to
cultural trends “prioritizing individualistic values” (Tulviste & Tamm, 2014, p. 528).
However, they also contend that the goals the teens in their study emphasized may be
related to the idea that “adolescence is marked as a time of self-discovery, and the need
for autonomy from authorities,” arguing that “such value hierarchy might be typical of
this special period of life” (Tulviste & Tamm, 2014, p. 528). This dissertation contributes
evidence that these values priorities are important for teens from urban areas in the

140
United States. Further analysis across geographical area, national cultures, and over
different life stages is an important area for future study discussed in more depth in
Chapter Seven.
6.3 Information Literacy Practices and Perceived Audiences
The teens in this study described diverse ways of using technology to engage in
information literacy practices. Finding and using information was a crucial and daily
activity for the teens in this study, and these teens displayed a wide variety of information
needs, matching Agosto and Hughes-Hassell’s work on urban teens’ everyday life
information needs (2006a, 2006b). A subset of the participants in this work was deeply
engaged in creating content and sharing it with others, using digital technology to support
their creative endeavors and to share their outputs with an online audience. These teens
leveraged technology to support their creation and sharing. Teens used specialized
software and devices like photo editing software and apps, music creation software, and
cameras to develop content. They also employed more widely-used technologies like
social media and blogging tools to share their creations. Similar to the ways teens’
hobbies and personal interests prompt engagement with digital media (Ito et al., 2010),
these deep interests prompt engagement with specific technologies as well as the
information literacy practices of creation and sharing.
For these teens, reaching an audience was an important factor in their decisions
related to sharing. The benefits they identified in these connections included personal
achievement and the potential for future work opportunities. One teen even described an
increase in her self-esteem related to sharing pictures of herself online, when positive
feedback helped see herself in a new light. This connects with what Katz and Crocker

141
(2015) term visual conversation, when sharing the sharing of images is a form of
communication. Teens also identified perceived audience as a factor in their decisions to
refrain from sharing any content they might create. Research has demonstrated that
writing for a perceived audience makes a difference in how teens engage in content
creation in academic settings (Forte & Bruckman, 2006). Other work has highlighted that
the perception of audience has shifted with the onset of social media and networked
communication (Litt, 2012). Literacy skills and practices are often discussed as occurring
between an individual and information itself. However, for several teens in this study, the
social elements of creating and sharing content curbed their engagement in these kinds of
literacy skills. We see again that not all teens wish to engage in technology in the ways
popular discourse might have us expect (broadly and publically). This social element is
an important factor for parents, educators, and librarians to consider when working to
support the development of information literacy. In a kind of middle ground, multiple
teens in this study shared content with close, trusted audiences, which helped develop
their confidence and sense of safety when sharing. Nurturing these kinds of semi-public,
supportive audiences to supplement literacy instruction will become more important as
networked content creation and sharing opportunities increase, and perspectives like
Connected Learning (Ito et al., 2013) become more prominent.
6.4 Smart Phones for Many Practices
For the teens in this study, smart phones were the center of a trend toward using
one device for many purposes. For example, consider Chelsea’s use of a smart phone to
support her personal quantified self data-tracking, complicated note-taking for school and
non-profit work, and managing her day-to-day business invoicing and bill collecting.

142
These diverse uses of a single device highlight that for teens, contexts of use are often
connected and overlapping. These teens’ preferences for mobile devices have
implications for their use of information. Optimizing apps and information provision
techniques to meet teens’ preferences for smart phone technology use is an important
way to address their needs. Teens related their smart phone preferences to their
perceptions of the portability, ease of use, and efficiency of interacting with these
devices. And more generally, teens place emphasis on the ease of use and efficiency of
technologies; it was a factor in their technology selection choices but also in their
technology limiting decisions. When considering technology use, the teens in this study
expressed preferences for information seeking and communication, but also expressed the
ability to control technological resources as an important part of what they’re looking for
in their technology use. This was most often manifested because inefficient and
ineffective technology use experiences resulted in the participants feeling like they did
not have control of their technical resources.
6.5 The Positives of Technology Non-use and Limiting
There were times that self-limiting the use of technology proved to be beneficial
for the teens in this study. Participants reported purposefully reducing their interaction
with technology on a regular basis. Stepping away from technology for a temporary
respite allowed them to manage their emotions and get a handle on how best to proceed
with the task at hand. Changing levels and frequency of technology use allowed them to
support their personal relationships and conform to norms and expectations about the
work of becoming an educated young adult.

143
Engaging in what they described as total non-use allowed teens to break away
from negative interactions with others, and while it potentially limited access to some of
the positives associated with social media (Ellison, Steinfeld, & Lampe, 2007) and
gaming (Gentile et al., 2009), for the teens in this study, it was worth it for the associated
peace of mind. Marwick and boyd (2014) have done work identifying drama as an “everpresent” part of teens lives (2011, p. 4) that “is often performed for, in, and magnified by
networked publics” (2011, p. 5, authors’ emphasis). For several teens in this study,
experiencing the negative effects of drama led them stop using social media and other
technologies in ways that they described as full non-use, with the intention that their level
of use would not change in the future. These were by far the strongest examples of
reduction in use teens described, and they add complexity to the picture of why, when,
and how teens choose not to use technologies. This has similarities in the world of
information use and access. At certain times, access to information can be overwhelming
and even detrimental (Bawden & Robinson, 2009; Goulding, 2001), and limiting of
information can be seen as a self-preservation strategy (Chatman, 1999).
6.6 Reframing the Ways We Think about Teens’ Technology Use
These examples of technology non-use and limiting highlight the opportunity for
reframing the ways we think about how teens use technology, deemphasizing increasing
technology use as our main priority. Selwyn (2003) points to this as a goal, and the
experiences of the teens in this study contribute weight to the idea that for teens, non-use
of technology can be a good choice, as it can be an effective way to manage emotional
state and reactions to changes in personal relationships. As a number of researchers have
previously highlighted (Baumer et al., 2013; Satchell & Dourish, 2009; Selwyn, 2003),

144
non-use is often purposeful, agentic, and considered practice. Non-use can be seen as an
action in and of itself (Fuchsberger et al., 2014), and the concept of continuums of use
recognizes these non-use practices as an important part of the larger picture of how teens
interact with technology. The teens in this study made choices to limit their interaction
with technology, choices that are deeply connected to the ways they engage in higher
levels of technology use and engagement with information. Promoting technology access
and use for its own sake works against the needs, priorities, and abilities of teens to
manage and control their own levels of technology use.
6.7 Teens’ Concerns for Technology Use
It is also important to recognize that the teens in this study discussed their
technology use and society’s technology use in ways that demonstrate their caution and
concern. Contrary to popular discourse of teens as addicted to technology (Brown, 2015),
the teens in this study described many reasons and ways for moderating and limiting their
technology use. They highlighted the importance of safety and the stability of society,
sharing the same concerns that many adults emphasize and that drive much of the
research on teens. For example, adults are often concerned about the academic
performance of teens. The perspectives shared by the teens in this study also show that
they deeply care about their own academic success, and further, they use technology use
as a way to support it. While this is likely related to their expressed goals of attending
college, the teens demonstrated multiple techniques for engaging in learning and
preparation for future educational experiences. These teens also envisioned ways to
continue their use of technology to support learning in college and for job and career
success. They are indeed using technology in what many adults would see, as Chelsea

145
puts it in Chapter Five, “correct” ways. Ultimately, these teens often demonstrate more
thoughtful, careful, creative, and effective technology use than they receive credit for.
Accordingly, I believe it is time to acknowledge that teens have many of the same values
as the adults who care for them the most, and to widen our focus from adult-normative
concerns to include the perspectives and priorities of teens.
However, while these teens were often capable technology users, there were also
moments of difficulty, discomfort, and concern. These strains surface opportunities to
leverage values and an information ecologies perspective to improve the ways teens are
able to use technology, including though educational interventions and technology
design. Recognizing that different teens have different patterns of values priorities and
expressions is one of the keys for this approach. It is reasonable to expect that a teen with
a strong orientation toward Conservation values like Tradition, Conformity, and Safety
might have more concerns about the risks technology use presents to him and to his
family, friends, and community. Similarly, it is fair to think that directly addressing ways
to mitigate those concerns with him might make her feel more inclined to participate in
technology use. It could also be beneficial to discuss and clarify the opportunities she
could connect to via technology. Conversely, a teen who has less of a focus Conservation
values and more emphasis on Openness to Change values like Self-Direction,
Stimulation, and curious exploration, would likely be comfortable trying new things
online. She could potentially benefit from a conversation discussing measures to protect
her online safety.
Having these conversations with youth is particularly important in light of the fact
that, as Livingstone and Helpser highlight, when teens are online, “increasing

146
opportunities increase the risk” (2010, p. 324). We need to work to ensure that teens
aren’t missing out on opportunities, but that they aren’t unaware of the risks they might
encounter when interacting with technology. In short, understanding teens’ values can
give teens, parents, educators, librarians, and others invested in their successful growth
and development a better understanding of their priorities and open up pathways for
conversation about technology use and the goals it can support. Taking an information
ecologies perspective and acknowledging the great variety of factors that influence teens’
technology use can help identify when things are working well, when they’re breaking
down, and how to best support teens in the technology use they want to pursue.
6.8 Considerations When Working With Teens
To move toward developing ways to support teens as described above, this
section of the chapter presents a variety of ideas to consider for work with teens, relevant
for practitioners, researchers, parents, and any person invested in the success of the young
people in their lives. Here I discuss some recommendations for adjustments and changes
to interventions intended to support teens’ technology continuums of use and information
ecologies. First, I touch on general suggestions, and in the sections below, go into detail
about how specific stakeholders might incorporate the findings of this study, including
libraries and educational institutions and computing designers and researchers.
6.8.1 Implications for individuals working with teens. Those interacting with
teens should recognize when they are engaging in thoughtful and effective technology
use, and consider ways to increase teens’ opportunities to do so. Linking teens to
technologies that support their interests, and connecting them to appreciative audiences
for the content they create can help increase their engagement with the full spectrum of

147
information literacy practices. It is also important to remember that there are instances
where teens should be able to step away from technology, and to temper assumptions
about the benefits of technology use. Not all teens will wish to interact with a given
technology, and the factors and reasons prompting technology use may change, leading
continuums of use to change in response. There is ample evidence in this study that teens
are not only capable of limiting their technology use, but that they do it purposefully.
Teens are also capable of making decisions about non-use to manage their
emotions and protect their sense of privacy and safety. One possible way to address these
teens’ diverse understandings and experiences is to support young people in increasing
their ability to make choices about their continuums of technology use. This means
giving teens more opportunities to exercise their preferences, such as by making school
policies about technology less rigid and strict. Additionally, it means supporting teens in
understanding the ways their technology choices can support their values and goals.
Teens’ continuums of technology use connect them to information in various ways.
Promoting teens’ self-management of their continuums of use in turn supports their
ability to manage their own information literacy practices.
While some of the teens in this study identified technology as a way to access
opportunities and support their everyday life interests, the participants also commonly
described technology as presenting potential risk. Many of the concerns they discussed
were future oriented and somewhat undefined, leaving resolution open-ended. For people
who have the opportunity to engage teens in discussions about risk associated with
technology use, it makes sense to incorporate concrete discussions of the everyday risks
they may face now, in addition to clarifying their concerns about how technologies may

148
impact their future lives. There is an opportunity here to help teens develop a realistic
understanding of the risks and threats they do face.
Local policies had direct impacts on the ways teens were able to interact with
technology, and while these policies may be developed in order to support an educational
mission, limiting technology access can in turn limit teens’ ability to access information.
In some cases, this is certainly a goal of these policies (e.g. preventing access to online
social networks to encourage teens to focus on schoolwork), but teens have demonstrated
that they use social interaction as a way to support their academic work – both in this
study and in other work examining teens’ social media use (Agosto, Magee, Dickard, &
Forte, 2015; Forte, Dickard, Magee, & Agosto, 2014). These policies may also have
unintentional consequences for teens’ ability to complete their work, as detailed in
Sammie’s story about needing to use YouTube for an assignment and not being able to
access it on school grounds. Reconsidering, and in some cases lessening, the restrictions
of policy may yield positive outcomes in terms of allowing teens more access to the
information they need, and giving them more opportunities to manage their own
continuums of use.
6.8.2 Implications for design. There are several important considerations to
come out of the work in this study that have implications for how technology is designed,
and how we go about researching the ways teens interact with computing technologies.
These implications center around the use practices identified in this work as well as the
values and information ecologies that informed teens’ technology use. While the
community of computing researchers examining values would likely encourage
understanding teens’ specific sets of values for design, and scholars are starting to

149
specifically engage with teens’ priorities using a values framework (Bowler, Knobel, &
Mattern, 2014), there is plenty of work to be done in this arena. Poole and Peyton’s work
argues “it is imperative that the field of interaction design begins to give the adolescent
population greater attention” (2013, p. 216). I submit that not only is it imperative that we
give teens this increased attention, but that we should acknowledge the values that inform
their goals and priorities, as well as the other ecological factors that contribute to their
continuums of use. As a corollary, computing researchers and designers should
understand that any new technology will be operating within information ecologies.
Teens will have existing technologies, continuums of use, and surrounding factors that
influence that use. The teens in this study discussed preferences for technologies that fit
in seamlessly with their existing information ecologies. They wanted technologies that
enabled easy contact with friends (in contrast to technologies that did not support
activities like group chat across brands), and they wanted technologies that they could
afford. These are each important considerations when developing new technologies.
6.8.3 Implications for research. Teens are at a time in their lives when they are
seeking a wide variety of relationships, including dating relationships (whether they are
romantic, exploratory, and/or sexual), as well as intense friendships and other
connections with peers (Erikson, 1968; Havighurst, 1972). For a number of the teens in
this study, relationships and relationships changes had an impact on levels of technology
use and the decision to limit use, with significant changes in technology use correlated
with negative social experiences. This highlights an important area of consideration for
understanding and supporting teen technology use. Relationships have bearing on

150
continuums of use, and for teens (and many adults as well), relationships change, grow,
and dissolve on a regular basis.
In general, ICTs and research on them is focused on how these technologies
support the positive elements of relationships and social interaction, but do less to address
the potential negative interactions that may color technology use choices and preferences.
With regards to the ways researchers learn and think about teens’ technology use, I
believe this indicates that we should be designing studies to engage with the idea that just
as computing is social, so is “not computing.” Just as social contexts have deep
implications for adoption and use of technologies, they also have implications for nonuse. Socio-technical systems research and scholarship will do well to think more about
how relationships and social interaction can prompt disconnection from technologies.
Additionally, many of the teens in this study had part-time work that influenced
their ability to access and use technology. There were also teens whose technology skills
informed how they approached their work. However, when research in Information
Science and computing examines teens’ technology use, it tends to focus on academic
and more recently, social contexts. Expanding our research perspectives to engage with
work as a part of teens’ lives will help make the connections between teens’ various
technology use contexts more clear.

151
CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION
7.1 Introduction
With this study, I sought to engage with teens’ perspectives and priorities to
deepen understanding of their everyday life experiences with technology, and ultimately
to learn more about how those experiences impacted their information practices. To do
so, I made connections between a number of perspectives to frame and scope this work. I
worked to link between Everyday Life Information Seeking (Savolainen, 1995) and the
concept of continuums of use in order to better understand the full spectrum of ways
teens interact with technology. This helped to shed light on the factors that influenced
teens’ decisions to limit technology use, and in some cases, cease use completely.
Additionally, I adopted an information ecologies perspective (Nardi & O’Day, 1999),
which spurred me to examine not just how teens used one kind of technology, but to
think about the contexts that surround their everyday life technology use, including the
people, practices, technologies, and values that come together in local environments.
Values proved to be a particularly fruitful lens for understanding these factors and
interactions, which I framed using Schwartz’s theory (2007). This chapter concludes this
dissertation by presenting a brief overview of the contributions of this work, discussing
the limitations of this work, and going into detail about what this research illuminates as
priorities and concerns for future research. The chapter concludes by touching on specific
research plans to be implemented after completion of my degree.
7.2 Overview of Contributions
This study identified and characterized teens’ values expressions in relation to
their technology use, finding that teens had diverse values but that they most often

152
emphasized Openness to Change and Self-Enhancement values. Participants interpreted
technology as connecting them to opportunities and presenting potential risks, and some
participants adjusted their levels of technology use accordingly. Understanding teens’
underlying values and their impacts on technology use can help stakeholders to tailor
their technology support, instruction, and guidance.
Phones were the most discussed device in this study, and the participants used
them to engage in a wide variety of practices, with communicating as their one of their
most preferred activities. They engaged in literacy skills across a range of technologies,
and the social nature of their information interactions impacted when, why, and how they
used information and created and shared content. Consequently, nurturing supportive
audiences for teen content creation and sharing should be an important part of
information literacy instruction and support.
These teens regularly changed their levels of technology use, often purposefully.
They moved up and down continuums of use with diverse technologies in response to
internal and external influences. The participants’ experiences revealed four factors that
influence teens’ decisions to limit their technology use:


Local policies and access: policies can reduce teens’ ability to interact with their
technologies, but when they are freely available, teens also demonstrated reduced
technology use for entertainment purposes.



Affective factors: technology can trigger frustration and emotional upset, which
most teens dealt with by taking a break, though using technology also served as
an outlet when other factors impacted a change in emotion.

153


Life stage and future goals: Some teens in this study prioritized their future
opportunities to the point that they limited their social media use to protect their
online presence; multiple participants also envisioned continued self-limiting of
their continuums of use while in college.



Relationships: changes in relationships were connected to changes in continuums
of use. Drama and deep breaks in relationships led to the most extensive shifts
toward non-use, with these changes described as permanent.

These factors combine to impact the ways teens are able to access information via
technology. In contradiction to much of the scholarly, educational, and popular
literatures, which tend to view technology use as a desirable end goal in itself, the
experiences of the teens in this study show that limiting use can be a positive way for
them to manage their emotions, present themselves in ways that align with their future
goals, such as getting into college, and protect themselves from drama associated with
difficult relationships and their correlated experiences. The experiences and perceptions
of these teens from an urban setting call for researchers and stakeholders invested in teens
to recognize their ability to manage their continuums of technology use and provide more
opportunities for them to do so.
7.3 Limitations (and Some Strengths)
These contributions have implications for parents, librarians and library staff,
educators, researchers, designers, and teens themselves, but there are several limitations
to consider when thinking about this work. Limitations include constraints related to the
participant population, the structure of data collection (including the fact that
participants’ perspectives were prioritized and the need for reflexivity in analysis), and

154
the generalizability of the findings. Below I go into more detail about these limitations,
and discuss the ways I worked to mitigate their influences.
Because of the in-depth nature of the data collection, the number of participants in
this study was limited. Those who did participate all demonstrated an intention to attend
college and were high achievers in this sense, which likely informed the way they
discussed their everyday lives, as well as the values expressions that they included in
those discussions. These teens had all participated in paid internship opportunities
through the MYC, a local organization working to support work-force development. The
organization estimated that approximately 80% of the youth that participated in the
program where this study was advertised qualified for federal family aid, indicating that it
is likely a number of these youth were from lower socio-economic status backgrounds.
Additionally, while the number of participants was relatively small, I was able to work
with a diverse population of teens from racial and ethnic backgrounds that have
traditionally been under-recruited in social science research studies (Knight, Roosa, &
Umaña-Taylor, 2009), as well as in the world of medicine (Alvarez, Basquez, Mayorga,
Feaster, & Mitrani, 2006; George, Duran, & Norris, 2014), which I see as a strength of
this study.
Though the population included participants who come from typically underrepresented backgrounds, most of the participants were required to coordinate with their
parents to meet ethics review board requirements for permissions in order to enroll in the
study (participants under the age of 18 had to meet this requirement). This means that the
majority of participants had good enough relationships with their parents to engage in this
coordination work, and conversely it means that teens who did not feel this level of

155
comfort with their family likely self-selected out of participating. I go into more detail
about my concerns about what these requirement limitations mean for research with
youth in the Considerations for Future Research discussion in Section 7.4.
In addition to the limit on population number that arose from the study design,
there were other considerations that I worked to carefully address, namely the
implications of prioritizing participant perspectives, and the need for my own reflective
perspective coupled with a rigorous approach to data collection process and analysis. I
worked to mitigate the limitations of elements of the study with the selection of a variety
of techniques in both the study design and the analysis choices. For example, I took a
perspective prioritizing teens’ perspectives and focused data collection on teens’
understandings of their feelings and experience via the creative activity and the semistructured interview. However, I also included a survey and daily diary recordings where
teens reported a list of all the technologies they had used that day, allowing for the
collection of “more objective” data to triangulate the open-ended data. Additionally,
though I used an open coding process for the thematic (Braun & Clarke, 2006) and visual
analysis (Banks, 2001) portions of this study, I also used directed qualitative content
analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005), employing Schwartz’s (2007) validated theory to
structure the second portion of the analysis, putting it in conversation with the structured
information ecologies framework (Nardi & O’Day, 1999).
In addition to these added structures, throughout the study, I worked carefully to
recognize my own perspectives and biases, and limit their impact on data collection and
analysis. This involved careful design of the study instruments and a pilot process
conducted with the first four participants in the study, as well as continued self-reflection

156
on my experiences as a teenager and my own personal values. While each of the
approaches I employed in this work has its own set of limitations, by combining
techniques I was able to help mute many of the possible effects and help ensure that this
study includes strong research design, data collection, and analysis.
In this study, I worked to have deep data collection and rich portrayals of the
participants’ lives, which qualitative research seeks to create. Study replication is not a
goal of the qualitative, naturalistic, ethnographic research perspective. Instead,
transferability (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) is a goal, and it is incumbent upon those
interested in applying this work to other contexts to determine which aspects are
applicable and which are not. To conduct this study, I was able to rely on 15 years of
experience working with youth and the institutions and systems that influence their
everyday lives in order to navigate recruiting and interacting with teens. I do feel that my
comfort with youth and extensive practice developing rapport was a factor in the success
of data collection for this study. This is strength of this work, and a potential
consideration for those interested in building on this study.
Finally, because of the size of the participant pool and their non-representative
demographics, the findings of this work are not generalizable. However, one the
motivations for this study was to develop deeper understandings of the priorities and
desires of teens, emphasizing their perspectives and making connections between teens’
views and Library and Information Science (LIS) and HCI/computing conversations.
This emphasis on teens’ views can be somewhat difficult to achieve with larger-scale
techniques, particularly in cases like this study where the work is somewhat exploratory.
Moreover, I do believe that some of the findings and major points to come out of this

157
work are transferable to a wider teen population, and help identify and clarify a variety of
future options for research with youth, which will be discussed in more depth in the
following section.
7.4 Considerations for Future Research Design
This research study has illuminated a large number of considerations that I will be
incorporating for my own future work, and that I think are relevant for future work with
teens and younger children in both the LIS and HCI/computing research communities.
Below I go into detail about teens’ priorities, issues of scalability, difficulties with
recruiting and diversifying research participation, and thoughts on broadening the
contextual foci of research with youth.
7.4.1 Scalability. Going forward, scalability is one of the biggest hurdles to
consider in work with youth. Taking a naturalistic perspective, as I did with this study,
requires in-depth data collection that takes a significant investment of time. However, the
concepts and ideas that come out of this deep work can inform how larger scale studies
are designed and carried out. One of the ways I plan to address the difficulty of
scalability is to increase the kinds of data collection I pursue. When appropriate, I plan to
build on naturalistic data collection with electronic data collection techniques. This will
allow me to triangulate trace data from social media and other relevant data types with
the qualitative work that serves as a foundation for my research.
7.4.2 Study design and recruiting. Even with the expectations of limited
participants (this study’s ethics review board approved protocol allowed no more than 35
participants), there were several young people who wanted to participate in this study but
were not able to do so. One person had estranged parents, and though this person had

158
lived with other adults for nine months, this teen did not have another legal guardian who
could provide permission for their participation. Another teen had parents who did not
read English, and so were unable to provide permission for participation. It was very
difficult for me to tell these individuals that I couldn’t enroll them as participants, and I
believe that this is an important part of study design that would benefit from increased
accommodations. Drexel University has already made some strides to increase the
availability of non-English consent/permission/assent documents in multiple languages,
but this still requires translators for study specific language and increases the time of
study preparation and approval. Going forward, I think it also makes sense to develop
more nuanced understandings of the diversity of guardianship relationships, and design
protocols in advance to accommodate for exceptions to traditional understandings of
parent-child relationships. In recruiting and running this study, I interacted with a several
teens with families that had different structures than the idea of the traditional nuclear
family. I did not anticipate that this would impact a study of this size with the extent that
it did, and I will work to make sure future studies do not prevent young people in these
situations from participating.
While this is certainly an issue on an individual study level, the cumulative impact
of failing to address these kinds of recruiting issues is that studies that include minors as
participants are biased towards young people who have good relationships with their
guardians, as well as young people who have parents without English language barriers.
The experiences of youth without these kinds of family backgrounds are important to
consider, and unfortunately, unless these family contexts are an explicit element of

159
recruiting approaches, many less privileged youth and minority youth are likely left out
of participation in most studies.
In addition, once participants are enrolled it takes considerable time to do this
kind of research with youth. Even with confirmed meetings with each individual, I had
many teens reschedule, forget our appointments, or have personal events and issues that
prevented their attendance. While I did not keep exact track of these kinds of issues
during the actual data collection, I estimate that I had to reschedule meetings
approximately 1/3 of the time, and had multiple meetings when teens did not arrive.
Because of this, I recommend that research with youth employ an extended timeline and
flexible protocols to allow for rescheduling. Perhaps more importantly, flexible
researchers are needed that understand that scheduling will be a consistent constraint, and
it is important to create methods and select study locations that accommodate youths’ –
as opposed to researchers’ – needs and preferences.
Finally, going to neighborhoods where teens were comfortable and
knowledgeable about the location was very important to me, and was a central part of the
study protocol. As Elwood and Martin (2000) discuss, “the ways that locations can
situate participants also [have] implications for the power relations of our interview
experiences” (2000, p. 655). I met teens in libraries close to their schools or homes,
which they selected independently when they knew of a close location. I supported teens
who did not know their options by researching locations near their everyday locations
and allowing them to select from several libraries. I purposefully took this approach to
work to mitigate any unequal power relationships, particularly in light of the fact that I

160
was an adult Caucasian researcher working with young participants, most who were from
non-dominant backgrounds.
While I feel that I had good rapport with these participants, with many saying
they appreciated my invested listening and attention, conducting this study raised a lot of
questions for me about the role of race and ethnicity in research interactions. I felt a bit
unprepared to fully address the ways race and ethnicity impacted the relationship between
myself and these participants. I want to take a moment to recognize that with the current
US climate of issues and tensions about the way young people of color are being treated
by institutions like schools and police, this is an increasingly complex issue. In addition
to the concerns I have for these young people pursuing independence and selfactualization, I fear that this has implications for the kinds of work scholars will be
willing to pursue, given the added constraints associated with doing research with youth.
To that end, my own future work will continue to seek out the perspectives of
marginalized and underrepresented youth, will increasingly recognize the
intersectionality that impacts young people’s lives, and will strive to critique social
systems (many that are socio-technical) that contribute to that marginalization.
7.4.3 Diversifying participation. In addition to the diversity of racial and ethnic
backgrounds that exist, as well as the socio-economic factors that impact teens’ lives,
there are many other factors that contribute to diverse life experiences. A number of these
factors bring up considerations for recruiting. For example, while this study worked with
teens from an urban area, there are many other types of places to live, and the everyday
lives of teens from other locations may have different social contexts, infrastructures,
expectations, and responsibilities that could impact their values and continuums of use.

161
I’m also interested in working with deaf and hearing impaired teens, as well as
teens with vision impairment, to learn more about their everyday life experiences with
technology, but I’d likely need to include an interpreter for the data collection process,
and/or specialized recruitment materials. A number of these types of diverse backgrounds
are typically studied from a medical, care-oriented perspective. For example, there are
numerous studies examining the medical and physical implications of teens’ lives with
diabetes (Davidson, Boland, & Grey, 1997; Bui, Perlman, & Daneman, 2005; Faulkner,
2003). However, there is less work that decentralizes the medical experience and changes
perspective to study everyday life more broadly construed, and very little that
acknowledges these teens’ health experiences while focusing on their experiences using
ICTs or engaging with information needs outside of health topics. Teens with these
diverse backgrounds have unique experiences that impact their everyday lives, including
their interactions with technology. Researchers have the opportunity to expand our
understandings of teens’ engagement with technology by working with young people
from a variety of backgrounds, and making connections between the perspectives of teens
with different life experiences.
7.4.4 Diversifying contexts of study, understanding overlapping contexts.
Teens in this study discussed a number of different contexts of technology use, but these
contexts tended to be described as non-exclusive, fluid, and dynamic. As discussed in
Chapter Five, smart phones were typically used to address all contexts of use. This
demonstrates that for these teens, devices and technologies bring contexts together, which
can contribute to a blurring of the lines between them. This can make research more
difficult, and for my part, it makes sense to continue to acknowledge this messiness in my

162
study designs by not necessarily limiting my focus to a specific type of technology or
context of use. For example, much of the work examining non-use focuses on specific
technologies like social media (Hargittai, 2008; Lampe et al., 2008; Junco, 2013; Neves
et al., 2015; Tufekci, 2007) and computers (Selwyn, 2006). In contrast, I plan to continue
to design studies that examine continuums of use across multiple technologies, including
platforms, software, and hardware, informed by the information ecologies emphasis on
examining multiple technologies in a local environment.
7.5 Future Research Plans
Conducting this study has further opened my eyes to the possibilities and joys of
research. I plan to extend and build on this initial work via a series of related studies. I
discuss three of the ways I plan to move forward below, including a focus on further
understanding teens’ values, delving more deeply into how teens make technology nonuse decisions, and options for study designs that engage teens in the full research process.
7.5.1 Using Schwartz’s values inventory. Directly building on this study, in
future work I am already conceptualizing, I will a version of Schwartz’s values index that
is a 21-item scale validated in the European Social Survey (Schwartz, 2003). The scale
will be useful for assessing teens’ full spectrum of values in relation to their technology
use, skills, and literacy practices (particularly content creation and sharing). In addition to
examining teens’ values at the time of the study, there could be some interesting work
examining values over multiple points in time, including before age 18 and then again
after being an adult for a while, similar to the longitudinal study design of Tulviste and
Tamm’s (2014) work with early adolescents. There is also an opportunity to delve more
deeply into cross-cultural analysis of youth values, building on the strong tradition of

163
multi-nation work carried out by Schwartz and other researchers building on his theory
(Tulviste & Tamm, 2014).
7.5.2 Learning more about non-use. This study demonstrated that teens engage
in non-use across hardware, software, and platforms, informed by multiple factors that
have different impacts at different times. I think this is an important contribution, and
there are many opportunities to expand on this in future work. Going forward, I plan to
focus some of my research on learning more about teens’ fluid relationships with
technology through longitudinal work examining use over multiple time points,
specifically probing changes in continuums of use. Additionally, I plan to conduct indepth qualitative work to learn more about how the four factors identified in this work
impact teens’ continuums of technology use.
7.5.3 Teens as co-researchers. Throughout my work on this study, I was inspired
by the work of several researchers who purposefully endeavored to include teens as more
than simply research subjects, but as co-developers of the research process. Though I was
not able to include teens in the design of this dissertation study, I came to this work with
the perspective that I too wanted to consider teens as co-researchers and authorities on
their own experience. I was really pleased to see the ways that the participants responded
to the study: many described how they had learned through participating and thought
about ideas that they hadn’t contemplated before.
Going forward, I’d like to extend on this by including teens in the research design
process, like the participatory research process described by Cahill (2007). This approach
will enable me to further engage with teens’ priorities and perspectives. In order to do
this, I envision developing a long-term method of engagement with youth, similar to a

164
number of initiatives out of the University of Maryland. In the Human-Computer
Interaction Lab, Allison Druin and colleagues have the Children as Design Partners
initiative (Human Computer Interaction Lab, 2010), active since 1998, where children
ages seven to eleven join the team to contribute to a multitude of design projects. Mega
Subramaniam’s work at the same institution with Hack Health (Subramaniam, 2015)
includes tweens in a 12-week health literacy curriculum where their learning and
engagement is part of the research focus. These approaches can serve as models for
involving teens and youth in longer term opportunities to not only participate in research,
but to contribute to the development of research questions and priorities, and learn and
gain new experiences themselves. I know that newer perspectives on research design will
always have an important impact on how I go forward with my work, and I am excited
about the opportunity to pursue this kind of work with youth.
7.6 Summary
Using a survey, audio and voicemail diary study, creative activity, and semistructured interview, this dissertation worked with 19 teens from large city in the MidAtlantic region to better understand the everyday life information ecologies and
continuums of technology use of teens from an urban setting. Employing a variety of
analysis techniques to engage with teen perspectives, this study contributed deeper
understandings of how teens express values and how those values inform their
technology use, particularly in response to their perceptions of the opportunities and risks
presented by technology. It identified a wide variety of teens’ smart phone use practices
and described teens’ varied information literacy practices, identifying audience as a key
element in content creation and sharing. This work also identified four factors that

165
influence teens’ continuums of use: local policy and access, affective factors, life stage
and goals, and relationships. This dissertation also presented implications of these
findings for those working with youth, designers, and researchers, highlighting the
validity and importance of technology non-use and limiting practices. This work calls for
a reconsideration of high levels of interaction with technology as an assumed goal, and
promotes supporting teens in managing their own continuums of technology use.
Going forward, it is clear that seeking and engaging with youth perspectives will
be the hallmark of my work. In that spirit, I’d like to conclude this dissertation by
returning to some of the thoughts shared by a participant of the study.
Emma described her creative activity output, which depicts a computer keys
spelling the word BUILD from above (reproduced in greyscale, original included black
keys and letters in rainbow colors). She detailed her perspective on what technology
offers:
“My kind of view is like technology is an extension of our brains, kind of, so we
can use it for whatever, like, our purposes are. And like for me, I use it mainly to
create things and build things…I see technology as kind of like, just like another
paintbrush” (Emma, F, 16).

Researcher: Rachel Magee
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study!
I am looking forward to learning more about your technology experiences. This study has 4 main
parts, and as thanks for participating, you’ll receive up to $30.00 at the end of the study,
depending on how many parts you finish. I will ask you to complete a survey, keep an audio
diary by phone and photo diary by email for one week, do a creative project, and complete an
interview with Rachel.

Here’s more detail:
1. Survey
To start off, I’d like to have you fill out a short survey. This will help me get an understanding of
your experiences and background, and will take about 15 – 20 minutes.
2. Diary
The next part of the study is the diary. Think of it as an old-fashioned diary that you make by
talking on the phone about your technology experiences and opinions each day during the
study. You can complete each daily diary entry near the end of the day each day by leaving a
voicemail at this phone number:
1-800-123-4567
Please answer the following questions when you call:
1. Think about your day and tell me about the technologies you used today. Walk me
through what you’ve used, starting from when you woke up.

184
2. Now I’d like you think about which of the technologies that you used today stand out
in your day. Please tell me which technologies come to mind, and tell me why they
stand out.
3. Thinking about those technologies that stand out, please tell me the more detailed
story of your experience with one of them today. What were you doing and why? How
did using that technology make you feel?
In addition to the voicemail messages, please also send me pictures of all the
technologies you use when you’re not at school and that you feel comfortable
photographing. You can take these pictures in any way that works for you, and send
them all at the same time, or over the course of the week you do your diary. If you don’t
have access to a camera, let me know and I’ll give you one to use for the study.
Email these pictures to me at:
teentech@drexel.edu
The researchers on the team are the only people who can listen to your diary entries or
see your pictures. If you would rather call multiple times during the day instead of
calling just once in the evening, that’s fine. You can also call as many times as you like,
but please do it at least once a day.

3. Creative Project

*Please complete this activity on your own before the interview
and bring what you make with you to the interview*
One of the things I’m interested in is your overall thoughts and feelings about
technology. I’d like you to create some art or other creative project to help explain your
feelings about your technology experiences, or your relationship to technology.
You can write a song or essay, make a drawing, record a video, or do any other type of
artistic expression you like. Pick a way to express yourself that appeals to you – this is
supposed to a fun and enjoyable way to think about technology. See the list below if you
need inspiration, and contact Rachel at 626-383-6576 or teentech@drexel.edu if you
have any questions.
We’ll talk about what you make during the interview, so please finish it and bring it to
the interview. At the interview, I’ll make a copy or document your project, but your
project will remain yours.
Prompt: Think about your experiences with technology. What do you like and dislike
about technology? If you could change technology in any way you wanted to, what
would you do?

185
Possible projects include:
song/musical
composition
series of poems,
slam poems
creative essay
short story
short film/video
music video

woodcarving
photography
series
drawing
painting
sculpture
collage

dance
performance
themed menu
fashion
show/series
quilt
game
video game

4. Interview
The interview will be the last part of the study. I’ll talk to you about the diary messages you’ve
shared with me, and I’ll ask you to explain what you’ve created during the creative project. We’ll
do the interview within a week after you finish the diary study, and it should take about an hour,
depending on what you want to share.

Remember, you can always contact Rachel at 626-383-6576 or
teentech@drexel.edu if you have any questions.
Thanks for your participation!

PI: Denise Agosto
Co-PI: Andrea Forte
Researcher: Rachel Magee
Thank you for coming today. During this interview, I’d like to talk to you about how you use
technology in your everyday life, and about the activities you’ve been doing for this study over
the past week. This interview will take 45 – 60 minutes. Note that I am recording the
conversation, and if you decide not to answer any of the questions, that’s just fine. Do you have
any questions before we begin?
How do you define technology?
What are three of your favorite things to do with technology?
What are three of your favorite things to do online?
(If not discussed, ask whether participant uses social media, and what they do use. Ask how they
make decisions between services, such as where they post pictures).
Can you tell me the story of the last time you looked for information about one of your interests
outside of school work? How did you decide what information to use?
How do you define creativity, or creating something?
Can you tell me the story of the last time you created something?
Can you tell me about a recent time you shared something you created?
Can you tell me the story of a time you were frustrated using a technology?
In your diaries, you described using ______ technology/technologies. Can you tell me more
about that?
Are these the technologies that are the most important to you? If not, what are they and why?
Are there any technologies you don’t like using? Can you tell me more about that?
Are there any technologies you’ve used and then stopped using? Can you tell me more about
that?

191
Based on your diaries, it sounds like you use _____ a fair amount. Are there technologies that
you use a bit less?
Can you tell me about any rules or guidelines you have about how you use technology?
Who sets the rules, and what do you think about them?
Are there any rules you have for yourself in terms of how you use technology? If so, why did
you create them?
Can you tell me about any people who inform or influence how you use technology? Have you
had any conversations with your family about technology? How about your friends? (Use diaries
to help inform discussion of people)
Can you tell me about the last time you had to make a decision about which technology to use?
Now I’d like to take a look at your artistic project. Can you tell me about what you’ve created?
What would you like other people to think about or learn from your project? Or, if you wouldn’t
like to share it with anyone, what does it mean to you?
Is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your thoughts about technology or your use of
technology?
