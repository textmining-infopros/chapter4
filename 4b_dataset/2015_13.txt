ABSTRACT
Digital games as tools for learning in K–12 have been a topic of intense discussion over
the last 15 years. One area of focus has been on the integration of commercial off-the-shelf
games in lesson plans. A predictive factor for the adoption and integration of digital games is the
attitudes or readiness of teachers. Yet, while many studies have examined this with teachers
themselves, teacher librarians (TLs) have largely been ignored, despite the key role they play in
education and technology adoption in schools. This study attempted to determine TLs’ beliefs
and practices about digital games as 21st century learning tools, to examine similarities and
differences with those of classroom teachers, and to see if and how TLs’ pedagogical beliefs
impacted their perceptions of barriers toward digital game adoption. The Teachers’ Attitudes
Toward Games (TATG) Survey measured TLs’ perceptions of barriers to using digital games.
Findings suggest that TLs tended to use digital games to address discrete library skills—a
behaviorist practice—despite the fact that they tended to hold constructivist pedagogical beliefs.
Though, evidence showed that some were using games to integrate 21st century skills into
classroom lessons. Similar to findings on classroom teachers, TLs perceived lack of time, lack of
infrastructure, and lack of support as barriers to using digital games. Furthermore, TLs with
behaviorist beliefs tended to perceive greater barriers to using digital games as compared to TLs
with constructivist beliefs.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Even prior to the new millennium, 21st century learning was already a topic of
conversation among scholars, educators and policymakers. The underlying premise being that in
order for students to be career and life-ready in the information age, new models for learning
needed to be adopted (Abbott, 1997; Longworth & Davies, 1996). One such model is the
Partnership for 21st Century Skills’ (P21) Framework for 21st Century Learning. The P21
Framework emphasizes critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity (4Cs) as
essential learning outcomes for the 21st century. Information, media and technology skills are
integral to the development of the 4Cs, giving teacher librarians (TLs) an important role in
supporting 21st century learning.
Both the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the International
Society for Technology in Education’s (ISTE) special interest group for media specialists
(SIGMS) advocate for TLs to support 21st century learning by: (a) teaching to a cross-section of
learning standards that reflect the P21 Framework, including the Common Core State Standards
(CCSS), and AASL and ISTE Standards; (b) evaluating existing and emerging technologies; (c)
teaching information literacy skills; (d) collaborating with classroom teachers; (e) serving in
leadership roles (e.g., technology planning committees); (f) and developing library collections
and administering library programs that promote 21st century learning (AASL, 2007; ISTESIGMS Executive Advocacy Committee, 2010). Furthermore, today’s school libraries function
1

as 21st century learning spaces where students can access technology and work together on
collaborative projects (ISTE-SIGMS Executive Advocacy Committee, 2010).
TLs are already embracing these roles and becoming technology leaders in the process. In
2013, School Library Journal conducted a technology survey of U. S. school libraries and found
that out of 761 TL respondents, 72% reported being viewed as technology leaders in their
schools, 56% reported introducing technology at the classroom level, 42% reported serving on
their schools’ tech teams, and 34% perceived themselves as having a school-wide impact on
technology adoption. These findings illustrate the significance of TLs’ potential roles as
advocates for the kinds of technologies that support 21st century learning—technologies such as
digital games (Greenfield, 2009; Hayes & Games, 2008; Shute, Rieber, & Van Eck, 2012).
Research has found digital games to be potentially beneficial learning environments for
supporting 21st century skills, including critical thinking and problem solving skills (Gee, 2007;
Hung & Van Eck, 2010; Van Eck, 2006), communication and collaboration (Kirriemuir &
McFarlane, 2004; Prensky, 2006; Squire, 2003), and self-regulation (Blumberg & Ismailer, 2009;
Rieber, 1996). Moreover, a growing body of evidence is creating the consensus that digital
game-based learning (DGBL) results in significantly greater learning outcomes when compared
to non-game conditions (Clark, Tanner-Smith, & Killingsworth, 2014; Sitzmann, 2011; Vogel et
al., 2006; Wouters, van Nimwegen, van Oostendorp, & van der Spek, 2013). One caveat to
DGBL is that digital games must be well-designed in order to improve learning outcomes. Welldesigned digital games share similar features with well-designed learning environments, namely
that they are active, goal oriented, contextualized, adaptive, and provide ongoing feedback
(Shute, Rieber, & Van Eck, 2012).
2

A connection between the literacy practices of digital gameplay and school-based literacy
practices has also been made by a number of scholars (Abrams, 2009; Apperley & Walsh, 2012;
Beavis & O’Mara, 2010; Gee, 2007; O’Brien & Scharber, 2008). Because of this, experts on
gaming and literacy have identified libraries and librarians as uniquely suited to promote and
support literacy and learning through digital games (Gee, 2012; Squire & Steinkuehler, 2005).
Squire and Steinkuehler (2005) drew a connection between digital gameplay and information
literacy in particular. Problem solving lies at the foundation of information literacy, and problem
solving is considered one of the learning benefits of digital games (Gee, 2007; Griffiths, 2002;
Van Eck, 2006). Digital games can also increase a student’s interest in a topic, which triggers
questions (Harris, 2010), leads to information seeking (Nicholson, 2010), and develops research
skills (Squire & Steinkuehler, 2005). Digital games themselves are environments where
information seeking and meaning making take place, and Adams (2009b) suggests that digital
gameplay in the library can improve information seeking skills. Furthermore, there is now an
emerging recognition that digital games play a role in serving the primary purposes of libraries:
social, democratizing and educational (Adams, 2009a; Buchanan & Elzen, 2012; Nicholson,
2010; Werner, 2013).
TLs can play a pivotal role in digital game adoption because they already support and
promote 21st century learning through the skills of inquiry-based research that form the bigger
picture of information literacy (AASL, 2007; Asselin, 2004). TLs interpret information literacy
within the context of 21st century literacies, which are characterized by an individual’s
proficiency in using technology tools (e.g., technology literacy, ICT literacy), in multimedia
navigation and creation (e.g., digital literacy, multimodal literacy), and in the ability to analyze
3

and synthesize multiple forms of information (e.g., media literacy, information literacy, visual
literacy; NCTE, 2008). The concept of 21st century literacies, rooted in sociocultural theory, has
changed the very definition of literacy from one of reading and writing print text to one of
literacy as a group of multiple social practices that can change in response to cultural, social, and
communicative influences (Barton, Hamilton, & Ivanic, 2000; New London Group, 1996). If
literacy is a social practice, then social practices such as digital gameplay are also a form of
literacy (Gee, 2007; Squire, 2008; Steinkuehler, 2010).
While enthusiasm for digital games as 21st century learning tools continues to grow, it is
tempered by barriers to digital game adoption in the classroom. Fullan and Stiegelbauer (1991)
first proposed the concept of barriers in their theory of first- and second-order educational
change. Brickner (1995) extended Fullan and Stiegelbauer’s work by describing first- and
second-order barriers to change in the computer usage of mathematics teachers. Ertmer (1999)
continued Brickner’s work by applying first-order and second-order barriers to the technology
integration practices of teachers. First-order barriers are the external factors (e.g., equipment,
support) that impact technology integration, and second-order barriers are the internal factors
(e.g., personal beliefs) that impact technology integration. Multiple studies have examined
barriers to technology integration, with findings citing lack of time (Beggs, 2000; Bunch &
Broughton, 2002), lack of support (Brown et al., 2002; Schoepp, 2005), and lack of awareness of
policy issues (Maddux & Johnson, 2010; Russell et al., 2007) as having a significant impact on
teachers’ technology practices. A recent study by Ertmer, et al. (2012) found that teachers’
pedagogical beliefs about the relevance of technology to student learning were highly correlated
with their technology practices in the classroom.
4

Similar results have been found in studies specifically examining barriers to digital game
adoption. Commonly cited barriers to digital game adoption include lack of time (Ertzberger,
2009; Gros, 2003; Ketelhut and Schifter, 2011; Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014), lack of infrastructure
(Ertzberger, 2009; Farmer & Murphy, 2010; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011; Rice, 2007) and lack of
support (Baek, 2008; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011; Ketelhut & Schifter, 2011; Takeuchi & Vaala,
2014). Beliefs about lack of curricular relevance are also common findings in studies on digital
game adoption (Bourgonjon et al., 2013; De Grove, Bourgonjon, & Van Looy, 2012; Gros, 2003;
Kenny & Gunter, 2001; Proctor & Marks, 2013). While plentiful studies have examined
classroom teachers’ beliefs about digital game adoption, TLs as a group are largely missing from
the scholarly discussion.
Statement of the Problem
No research to date has examined TLs’ beliefs and practices concerning digital games,
despite the pivotal role they play in education and technology adoption in schools. Because TLs
and classroom teachers share a number of similarities, TLs may face the same barriers to using
digital games as their classroom counterparts. Both are subject to the same experiences that
shape their pedagogical beliefs, including personal experience as a student, professional training
and teaching experience (Raths, 2001; Prestridge, 2012). TLs’ pedagogical beliefs may impact
their use of digital games because perceptions about the relevance of technology to student
learning are highly correlated with technology practices in the classroom (Ertmer, et al., 2012).
TLs face similar institutional constraints as their classroom counterparts. For example, Farmer
and Murphy (2010) found that lack of equipment, lack of funding, lack of physical access, lack
of time, and lack of support are all impediments to digital game adoption in libraries. These are
5

the same barriers that classroom teachers face in digital game adoption (Ertzberger, 2009; Kenny
& McDaniel, 2011; Ketelhut & Schifter, 2011; Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014).
Differences between TLs and teachers exist as well. One difference is that of teacher
identity. In particular, misperceptions about the library profession and negative stereotypes held
by faculty, administrators and students may impair recognition of TLs’ roles as teachers of
information literacy and as co-teachers of classroom-integrated literacy instruction (Hartzell,
2002; Polger & Okamoto, 2010; Walter, 2008). If TLs are not recognized for their teaching role,
they may be less likely to serve on decision making committees, act as technology supporters,
collaborate with teachers, and teach students information literacy skills; roles that create
opportunities for supporting and promoting digital games (Adams, 2009b; Van Eck, 2006).
Another difference between TLs and teachers lies in potentially conflicting perspectives
on collaboration. Today, the concept of teacher-librarian collaboration is a standard in the core
curriculum of school librarianship programs (ALA/AASL, 2010), and is based on collaboration
models of school librarianship (Loertscher, 1988; Montiel-Overall, 2005). On the other hand,
teachers often struggle to collaborate (Piercey 2010) despite decades of research on its benefits
(Friend & Cook, 1990; Marks & Printy, 2003; Goddard, Goddard & Tschannen-Moran, 2007).
Differing perspectives may make collaboration difficult for TLs and teachers, subsequently
hindering opportunities for TLs to support and promote digital games in schools.
A third difference between TLs and teachers is one of scheduling. Unlike teachers who
work within a fixed schedule, TLs often operate on a flexible scheduling basis for the purpose of
being able to collaborate with teachers at their students’ points of need (AASL, 2014; McGregor,
2006) Flexible scheduling may create opportunities for TLs to promote digital games if it
6

improves their abilities to collaborate with teachers. Considering the unique position of TLs to
support digital games through any number of the roles they play in supporting 21st century
learning, it is important to understand what perceived barriers exist that may prevent them from
promoting and supporting digital games in education.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to determine TLs’ beliefs and practices
about digital games as 21st century learning tools, to examine similarities and differences with
those of classroom teachers, and to see if and how TLs’ pedagogical beliefs impacted their
perceptions of barriers toward digital game adoption. The Teachers’ Attitudes Toward Games
(TATG) Survey (Van Eck, 2013) was used, which was based on previous research about firstand second-order barriers to educational change (Ertmer, 1999; Fullan & Stiegalbauer, 1991).
The following barriers were examined: a) infrastructure (e.g., accessibility; resource availability;
support); b) training (e.g., professional development); c) beliefs about using games in education
(e.g., complexity; quality; cost); d) personal beliefs about digital games; and e) beliefs about the
value of games for literacy and learning. Additionally, demographic data was gathered, including
gender, age, qualifications, type of library, and gaming experience. Open-ended questions were
included in the study to identify TLs’ experiences with, and reasons for using games. Those
experiences were compared to data derived from the TATG survey and the research on teachers’
beliefs and practices.
A convenience sampling of the TL population was used for the study, which was taken
from a pool of K—12 librarians that participate in the following American Library Associationsponsored e-mail discussion lists: the AASL Forum (aaslforum@lists.ala.org), the Information
7

Literacy Discussion List (infolit@lists.ala.org), and the Reference and User Services Association
list (rusa-l@lists.ala.org). Additional participants were recruited from the Library Media
Network LISTSERV (LM_NET@LISTSERV.SYR.EDU), an e-mail discussion list for media
specialists hosted by Syracuse University. TLs were recruited through the lists’ discussion
forums. The survey was distributed electronically via Qualtrics.
Significance of the Study
The evolving roles of TLs as supporters of 21st century learning make this study
particularly significant. Today, TLs serve any number of roles that put them into the position of
supporting and promoting digital games: they may serve on decision-making committees and
make suggestions about technology purchases, they may support and coordinate educational
technology within the school, they may collaborate with teachers to integrate 21st century
learning into lessons, they may teach information literacy skills to students, or they may develop
library collections and administer programs that support 21st century learning (AASL, 2007;
ISTE-SIGMS Executive Advocacy Committee, 2010). Any barriers due to external and/or
internal beliefs about digital games could prevent TLs from taking the opportunity to support or
promote digital games through these varied roles. This study will inform the research by
providing insight into the current state of TLs’ beliefs and practices regarding digital game
adoption. The results of this study will offer a blueprint for ways in which TLs’ roles in
supporting 21st century learning can be made more successful.
Definition of Terms
In this study, the following terms must be described for clarification: teacher librarians,
digital games, first- and second-order barriers, and pedagogical beliefs.
8

Teacher Librarians
Teacher librarians (TLs) refer to credentialed librarians who work in school and/or
academic libraries. Credentialed school librarians work in the K—12 school libraries, and hold
state certification as media specialists at the minimum. Credentialed academic librarians work in
college or university libraries, and hold an ALA-accredited master’s degree in library and
information science at the minimum. The term librarians refer to librarians in general (i.e.,
including public librarians).
Digital Games
Digital games refer to any type of game that can be played on an electronic device (e.g.,
console, PC, mobile device), and digital gaming refers to the practice of playing digital or video
games. These include, but are not limited to, popular games, serious games and/or games
specifically designed for the education market. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) refers to the
body of research on digital games as learning tools.
First- and Second-Order Barriers
Barriers refer to the critical barriers that impact technology practices in the classroom
(Ertmer, 1999). First-order barriers are the external factors that impact technology practice, such
as adequate equipment, adequate budget, and administrative and technical support. Second-order
barriers are the internal factors that impact technology practice, such as pedagogical beliefs,
classroom management style and the beliefs about the role of digital games in the classroom.
Pedagogical Beliefs
Pedagogical beliefs refer to the beliefs that teachers hold about teaching and learning, and
the resultant interactions between teachers and students. They are often categorized as
9

behaviorist (e.g., direct instruction) or constructivist (e.g., knowledge construction), though a
continuum exists between the two. Pedagogical beliefs may act as second-order barriers to digital
game adoption if they impact teachers’ perceptions about the value of games as learning tools.
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework informing this study is Fullan and Stiegelbauer’s (1991)
theory of first-order and second-order educational change, where first-order change is external
(e.g., systems, processes) and second-order change is internal (e.g., beliefs). This was further
described by Brickner (1995) as first- and second-order barriers to change. Brickner (1995)
described first-order barriers as the external factors (e.g., equipment, support) that impact
technology integration, and second-order barriers as the internal factors (e.g., personal beliefs)
that impact technology integration. Ertmer (1999) used this theory to create the Barriers Model,
which looks at first-order and second-order barriers to teachers’ technology integration practices.
The TATG survey used Ertmer’s (1999) Barriers Model as a foundation for its development.
Assumptions, Limitations, and Scope
This thesis examines TLs’ beliefs and attitudes about the value of digital games for 21st
century learning and literacies, and the barriers that prevent digital game adoption in classrooms
and libraries. The assumption was made that because TLs represent a similar population to
classroom teachers, the factors impacting TLs’ adoption and integration of technology will also
be similar. Research questions and hypotheses were based on this assumption, and the TATG
survey, which was developed for teachers, was applied to TLs in this study. There is a limitation
to that assumption, as additional, unexplored factors may also exist as barriers to TLs’
technology integration and adoption.
10

The scope of this study was wide-reaching, geographically. The nature of the e-mail
discussion lists used to recruit participants made it possible to reach a large number of TLs
across the United States and abroad. The subscribership size of the four discussion lists allowed
for recruitment of a potentially large pool of participants.
Research Questions
The research questions for this study were developed out of work on the barriers to
teachers’ technology practices in the classroom (Ertmer, Addison, Ross, & Woods, 1999).
Hypotheses were drawn from the research described in the literature review.
RQ1. How are TLs using digital games?
RQ2. What are TLs’ pedagogical beliefs?
RQ3. How do TLs’ uses of digital games reflect their pedagogical beliefs?
RQ4. What barriers do TLs perceive for using digital games?
RQ5. How do TLs’ pedagogical beliefs shape perceptions of barriers to using digital games?

12

CHAPTER II
LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter presents the rationale for studying the attitudes and beliefs of TLs about the
value of digital games for 21st century learning. Over the past several decades, researchers have
examined the factors that impact teachers’ technology integration practices in the classroom.
Ertmer’s (1999) Barriers Model has been one way to conceptualize this. Based on Fullan and
Steigelbauer’s (1991) theory of educational change, Ertmer (1999) identified first- and secondorder barriers that influence teachers’ technology practices. First-order barriers are the external
factors that impact technology practices and second-order barriers are the internal factors that
impact them (Brickner, 1995). Research using the Barriers Model has been extended to teachers’
practices concerning digital game adoption (e.g., Beggs, 2000; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011;
Maddux & Johnson, 2010; Teo, Chai, Hung, & Lee, 2008).
This study seeks to further extend the research on barriers toward digital game adoption
to the TL population by using the TATG survey to examine the factors that impact TLs’ uses of
digital games in education. TLs are in a unique position to advocate for and support digital game
adoption in schools because they already support 21st century learning through information and
related literacies (AASL, 2007). Digital games are a 21st century learning tool (Foreman, 2004;
Prensky, 2007, 2008; Van Eck, 2006), and a number of researchers have identified digital
gameplay as a literacy practice (Gee, 2007; Squire, 2008; Steinkuehler, 2010). Furthermore,
school libraries have been identified as ideal spaces for connecting the informal literacy practices
13

of digital gaming with formal school literacy practices (Adams, 2009b; Beavis & O’Mara, 2010;
Farmer & Murphy, 2010; McTavish, 2009; Squire & Steinkuehler, 2005). Therefore,
understanding the factors that impact TLs’ attitudes and beliefs about the value of digital games
for 21st century learning will inform the research on the barriers that may prevent TLs from
taking on such support roles in the adoption of digital games in education.
The following review of the literature represents the research relevant to this study,
specifically, a review of the literature on 21st century learning, the TL’s role in 21st century
learning, digital game-based learning, the connection between digital gameplay and literacy, the
role of digital games in libraries, and barriers to digital game adoption. Chapter II is organized
into seven sections: (a) 21st century learning, (b) the role of TLs in 21st century learning, (c)
digital games as 21st century learning tools, (d) digital games and literacy; (e) digital games in
libraries, (f) barriers to digital game adoption, and (g) TLs and digital game adoption.
21st Century Learning
Partnership for 21st Century Skills
In 2002, the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21) was founded by a coalition that
included the U.S. Department of Education, and business and education leaders as a response to
the recognition that the education system needed to better prepare students for the career and life
demands of the 21st century (Abbott, 1997; Longworth & Davies, 1996).The mission of P21 was
to develop a framework for 21st century learning. The coalition’s vision of 21st learning has
since evolved to focus on critical thinking and problem solving skills, communication and
collaboration, and technology-related skills. While the model of 21st century learning is a
response to the demands that technology has placed on work and life skills, much of it represents
14

familiar ideas in education research (Bloom, 1956; Dewey, 1910; Piaget, 1928; Vygotsky, 1978).
Figure 1 illustrates the P21 Framework.
At the core of the P21 Framework is an emphasis on teaching subjects such as language
arts, math, science, and history within the context of the following 21st century interdisciplinary
themes: global awareness; financial, economic, business, and entrepreneurial literacy; civic
literacy; health literacy; and environmental literacy. Professional education groups have
advocated for these themes to serve as relevant connections to career and life skills (Partnership
for 21st Century Skills, 2007), a concept for which John Dewey (2004) also advocated.

Figure 1 . Framework for 21st century learning. This framework illustrates the interrelationship between
the skills, core subjects and learning environments that make up 21st century learning (Partnership for
21st Century Skills, 2011).

The elements of the outer arch of the P21 Framework are intricately connected to each
other and inherently present within the teaching and learning process of the core subjects. P21
15

emphasizes depth, not breadth, promoting the 4C’s of critical thinking, communication,
collaboration, and creativity. Information, media and technology skills are integral to the
development of the 4C’s, and serve as anchors for the interdisciplinary themes of the framework
(Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2007). TLs are experts at teaching information, media and
technology skills and integrating them into curriculum, so they play a central role in supporting
the values of the P21 Framework. Life and career skills, such as initiative and self-direction (i.e.,
self-regulated learning) are further goals of P21’s vision for 21st century learning.
P21 defines learning environments as more than just a place (e.g., classroom, library,
online learning community), but “as the support systems that organize the condition in which
humans learn best–systems that accommodate the unique needs of every learner and support the
positive human relationships needed for effective learning” (Partnership for 21st Century Skills,
2009a, n.p.). P21 also emphasizes the use of technology in the development of strong education
support systems, from standards and assessments, to curriculum and instruction, to professional
development, to teaching and learning communities (Vockley, 2007).
Common Core State Standards
In 2009, a collaborative initiative led by governors and state education commissioners in
48 states was formed in an effort to create a single set of national college and career-readiness
standards informed by exemplary state standards that were already in place, along with input
from teachers, subject experts, states, organizational leaders, and the public. From that initiative,
the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) were born (Kendall, 2011).
CCSS emphasizes depth over breadth; critical thinking and problem solving;
communication and collaboration; and information, media, and technology driven literacies. In
16

these ways, CCSS supports the ideals of 21st century learning and is well-aligned to the P21
Framework (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2011).
In 2010, the AASL released a position statement on CCSS as follows: “As students strive
to meet the rigor of the standards, certified school librarians will play an essential part in
ensuring that 21st-century information literacy skills, dispositions, responsibilities and
assessments are integrated throughout all curriculum areas” (n.p.). This position statement
reinforces the recognition that the CCSS has created new opportunities for TLs and classroom
teachers to work together as partners in 21st century learning. The full statement can be viewed
in Appendix E.
ISTE Standards
Formerly known as the National Educational Technology Standards or NETS, ISTE
established a standard of excellence for best practices in teaching and learning with educational
technology. ISTE (2007, 2014) Standards for Students describe the skills needed for technology
literate students, emphasizing creativity and innovation; communication and collaboration;
research and information fluency; critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making;
digital citizenship; and technology operations and concepts.
In 2013, ISTE released a policy statement on CCSS, declaring that “the ISTE standards
help educators build a firm foundation for teaching with technology and further the development
of many of the same 21st century skills set forth by the Common Core State Standards (n.p.).”
The Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2009b) recommends that ISTE Standards be used as a
guide for integrating technology literacy and tools into state learning standards.

17

The ISTE Media Specialists special interest group (SIGMS) released a position statement
on the role of TLs in supporting and promoting ISTE Standards. SIGMS stated that TLs play an
important role in integrating educational technology into classrooms and curricula due to their
unique position within the school (ISTE-SIGMS Executive Advocacy Committee, 2010).
AASL’s Standards for the 21st Century Learner
AASL’s Standards for the 21st-Century Learner address information literacy in the
context of multiple literacies, including digital, media and technology literacies. The standards
also emphasize critical thinking and problem solving, communication and collaboration, and
technology skills -- the underlying skills of inquiry-based research that make up the broader
picture of information literacy (AASL, 2007).
AASL (2011) developed a crosswalk to align CCSS with its learning standards in an
effort to illustrate how AASL Standards share many of the same learning goals as CCSS. The
Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2009b) recommends both AASL’s Standards and CCSS for
states implementing standards that emphasize depth over breadth.
Aligning Digital Games to 21st Century Learning Standards
Swanson (2013) suggests that the adoption of CCSS has created a greater need to blend
literacy and mathematics together. Because digital gaming is considered a meaningful literacy
experience (Gee, 2007; Squire, 2008), digital games present a new tool for bridging the CCSS
for Mathematical Practice with the CCSS for English Language Arts, both of which share
common goals with the AASL and ISTE Standards. Digital gameplay is an activity that aligns
well with all four sets of standards, as shown in Table 1.

Underlying all four sets of standards is the concept of critical thinking and problem
solving through inquiry-based learning. The CCSS for Mathematical Practice are broadly enough
written as to be straightforwardly applied to the CCSS for English Language Arts. For example,
to “make sense of problems” in math and to comprehend “key ideas and details” in language arts
both require critical thinking skills. Research in language arts requires students to “use
appropriate tools strategically” just as they do in math. The “integration of knowledge and ideas”
in language arts requires students to “reason abstractly” and “construct viable arguments,” as
19

they do in math. Both the AASL and ISTE Standards further expand upon the inquiry-based
skills of critical thinking and problem solving through information and technology literacies,
aligning them well to CCSS. Because digital games have the potential to be used as inquirybased learning tools, they can be positioned into alignment with all four sets of standards. Table
1 illustrates how digital games in the classroom integrate the goals of all four sets of standards.
The Role of TLs in 21st Century Learning
TLs are in a unique position to support 21st century learning in schools. The emergence
of digital age literacies (e.g., information literacy, digital literacy, media literacy, visual literacy)
has thrust TLs into a new role that goes beyond promoting the traditional literacy of reading to
promoting and supporting the multiple literacies needed in today’s technology-rich world
(DiScala & Subramaniam, 2011; Dotson, Dotson-Blake & Anderson, 2012; Everhart & Dresang,
2007). In fact, TLs already serve in this role to some extent since many provide technology
support within their schools, and sometimes serve as their school’s technology coordinator when
a separate position does not exist. TLs also teach to a cross-section of learning standards,
including Common Core, AASL and ISTE Standards. Furthermore, the school library provides a
place where students can access technology and work together on collaborative projects (ISTESIGMS Executive Advocacy Committee, 2010). Because digital games are educational
technology tools, this position gives TLs an opportunity to take on the role of supporting and
promoting digital games in classrooms and curricula.
Evident in the ISTE-SIGMS position statement is the idea that educational technology
has caused an evolution in the role of TLs (see section on ISTE Standards). The AASL also
recommends new roles for TLs in response to 21st century learning. In 2009, the AASL crafted a
20

description of the roles and responsibilities it envisioned for 21st century TLs. Multiple roles in
the guise of leader, instructional partner, information specialist, teacher and program
administrator were described (Ballard, 2009), with the underlying goal of these roles as
supporting the development of critical thinking and problem solving, communication and
collaboration, and technology skills -- the foundational skills of inquiry-based research that make
up the broader picture of information literacy (AASL, 2007). Because digital games are tools for
these 21st century skills, each role envisioned by AASL serves as an opportunity for TLs to
promote digital game adoption.
As leaders, TLs might serve on decision making committees (Everhart, Mardis, &
Johnston, 2011), enabling them to offer advice and suggestions on specific digital games that
engage and enhance learning. As instructional partners, TLs might collaborate with teachers
(Cooper & Bray, 2011) to integrate digital games, such as Inanimate Alice, into lessons that
support multiple literacies (Fleming, 2013). As information specialists, TLs might develop
gaming collections that support the curriculum (Farmer & Murphy, 2010); collections that
include digital games such as Minecraft (Gauqier & Schneider, 2013). As teachers, TLs might
use digital games, such as Admongo, to teach media and information literacy skills (Ribble,
2012). As program administrators, TLs might design and develop library-based programs that
incorporate digital games, such as after-school gaming clubs or maker programs (Bland, Hughes,
Willis, & Elliott Burns, 2013).
A recent technology survey by School Library Journal (2013) suggests that TLs are
already serving in technology leadership roles. In the survey of 761 respondents, 72% of TLs
reported being viewed as technology leaders in their schools, 56% reported introducing
21

technology at the classroom level, 42% reported serving on their schools’ tech teams, and 34%
perceived themselves as having a school-wide impact on technology adoption. These findings
illustrate the significance of TLs’ potential roles as advocates for the kinds of technologies that
support 21st century learning—technologies such as digital games (Greenfield, 2009; Hayes &
Games, 2008; Shute, Rieber, & Van Eck, 2012).
Digital Games as 21st Century Learning Tools
According to the Entertainment Software Association (2013), 58% of Americans play
digital games and the average U.S. household owns at least one game console, PC or smart
phone. Digital gaming is now a ubiquitous part of society and a phenomenon that has led
researchers to explore the impact of digital games on learning. Digital games-based learning
(DGBL) research aims to connect the design of successful gaming environments with the design
of successful learning environments (Gee, 2007; Rieber, 1996; Shute, Rieber, and Van Eck,
2012; Van Eck, 2006).
The Learning Benefits of Digital Games
Shute, Rieber, and Van Eck (2012) contend that good digital games and good learning
environments share similar features, namely that they are active, goal oriented, contextualized,
adaptive, and provide ongoing feedback. Research has found digital games to be potentially
beneficial learning environments for supporting critical thinking and problem solving skills (Gee,
2007; Hung & Van Eck, 2010; Van Eck, 2006); communication and collaboration (Kirriemuir &
McFarlane, 2004; Prensky, 2006; Squire, 2003); and self-regulation (Blumberg & Ismailer,
2009; Rieber, 1996); findings that suggest that digital games make good tools for 21st century
learning.
22

Critical thinking and problem solving. Critical thinking and problem solving are
generally considered domain-specific, making transfer of skills notoriously difficult. One
strategy for enhancing transfer across domains is repeated practice (Halpern, 1998). Shute,
Rieber, and Van Eck (2012) believe that the engagement value of well-designed digital games
makes them prospective tools for providing learners with the kind of repeated practice needed for
the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills.
Digital games are characterized by different types of gameplay, which in turn require
different types of critical thinking and problem solving skills. Hung and Van Eck (2010)
developed a classification system to align problem solving to gameplay using Jonassen’s (2000)
typology of problems and Mark Wolf’s (2006) grids of interactivity. Jonassen’s typology
correlates 11 different problem types with a continuum of knowledge and cognitive processes.
Of the knowledge and cognitive processes associated with different problem types,
metacognitive thinking is a particularly important skill because it acts as an important path to
critical thinking and problem solving (Berardi-Coletta, Buyer, Dominowski, & Rellinger, 1995;
Magno, 2010). It is also a primary component of self-regulated learning.
Hung and Van Eck (2010) identified simulations, strategy games, and action, roleplaying
and adventure games for supporting problem types that require metacognitive thinking.
Metacognitive thinking is also an underlying skill for information and related literacies (Dewald,
Scholz-Crane, Booth, & Levine, 2000), making those types of digital games particularly relevant
to TLs in their roles in supporting 21st century learning. Table 2 provides examples of the
problem and game types that exercise metacognitive thinking skills.

Communication and collaboration. In well-designed constructivist learning
environments, communication and collaboration function as social negotiation tools to promote
the generation of new knowledge and to expose learners to a diversity of viewpoints (Driscoll,
2005). Research has found digital games to be potential arbiters for the development of
communication and collaborations skills, and relatedly, group decision making and negotiation
skills (Kirriemuir & McFarlane, 2004; Prensky, 2006; Squire, 2003).
Contrary to popular belief, digital gameplay is not a socially isolating activity. Greenfield
(2014) found that children who frequented video game arcades were just as likely to use the
arcade space for socialization as they were to actually play the games. Vered (1998) studied the
24

interactivity of a group of boys (Blue Group Boys) in an elementary school setting as they played
the digital game, Incredible Machine, during recess. She observed several levels of interactivity:
social interaction during group play, negotiation skills in giving and taking instruction, and
communication and collaboration as the boys analyzed and strategized the game. Gee (2007)
proposed that one of the learning principles of digital games is the Affinity Group Principle.
Affinity groups are similar to communities of practice in that they share a common goal, are
holistically organized, share knowledge through networks, and are facilitated by leaders who
help members turn tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge that can be shared outside the group.
Elements of Gee’s Affinity Group Principle were displayed in Vered’s (1998) observations of
the Blue Group Boys, suggesting that the affordances of digital games might be useful for
supporting collaborative learning in the classroom.
Self-regulated learning. Three primary characteristics are present in self-regulated
learners: (1) metacognitive awareness, (2) use of appropriate strategies, and (3) motivational
control (Zimmerman, 2002). Metacognitive awareness enables learners to self-reflect on their
own learning, set goals accordingly, and identify the best strategies to reach their goals.
Motivational control allows learner to maintain the effort needed to reach their goals. In short,
self-regulated learning is effective learning.
Rieber (1996) used Piagetian Learning Theory and Flow Theory as frameworks to
illustrate the conditions of self-regulated learning, situating it within the constructivist concept of
the microworld. Microworlds are small environments where learners build knowledge through
play (Hadzilacos & Koutlis, 1993). Digital games are examples of microworlds.

25

According to Piagetian Learning Theory (Piaget, 1997, 2000), learning occurs within a
state of conflict. Self-regulation is necessary to resolve the conflict. Because the goal of almost
any digital game is to resolve some sort of conflict, digital game environments are natural
contenders for supporting self-regulated learning (Blumberg & Ismailer, 2009). Through
gameplay, learners are able to experience conflict on a small scale and work towards an
understanding of it. The process of resolving conflict in digital games mimics the process of selfregulation.
Flow Theory (Csikszentmihalyi & Csikszentmihalyi, 1992) describes the state that people
enter into when they become so absorbed in an activity that time passes without notice and all
other distractions disappear. Flow, like self-regulation, requires a high level of motivational
control to maintain attention and concentration. Shernoff, Csikszentmihalyi, Schneider and
Shernoff (2003) studied student engagement in high school classrooms from the Flow Theory
perspective, and found that increased student engagement resulted when task challenge and
student skill were well-balanced, when instruction was relevant, and when students felt in control
of their learning environment. The concept of flow has been used to describe the experience of
playing digital games (Chen, 2007; Gee, 2007; Rieber, 1996), showing that digital games are
highly engaging tools. From that perspective, it can be argued that digital games have the
potential to provide the conditions necessary for increased student engagement and self-regulated
learning.
The Learning Effectiveness of Digital Games
Despite the wealth of research on DGBL, many educators still question the learning
effectiveness of digital games. Empirical evidence is mixed. While some studies clearly show
26

significant increases in learning outcomes as a direct result of DGBL (Anderson & Barnett,
2013; Hickey, Ingram-Goble, & Jameson, 2009; Spires, Rowe, Mott, & Lester, 2011), other
studies suggest that increased learning outcomes may be the result of the motivation and
engagement factors of digital gameplay (e.g., Annetta, Minogue, Holmes, & Cheng, 2009;
Huizenga, Admiraal, Akkerman, & Dam, 2009; Liu & Chu, 2010; Papastergiou, 2009; Yang,
2012). In research showing decreased learning outcomes, increased cognitive load caused by
game interactivity was cited as a possible cause (deHaan, Reed, & Kuwada, 2010).
Four recent meta-analyses of DGBL studies sought to clarify the impact of digital games
on learning outcomes by conducting media comparisons of game conditions to non-game
conditions (Clark, Tanner-Smith, & Killingsworth, 2014; Sitzmann, 2011; Vogel et al., 2006;
Wouters, van Nimwegen, van Oostendorp, & van der Spek, 2013). In addition to media
comparisons, Clark et al. (2014) also examined the effect of learning design in digital games,
with the hypothesis that digital games employing augmented learning designs would perform
better than standard versions of the games.
In terms of media comparisons, overall findings in all four meta-analyses showed greater
learning outcomes with digital games versus their non-game counterparts:


Vogel et al (2006) found significantly higher learning gains (z = 6.051, p < .0001) and
attitudes (z = 13.74, p < .0001) in digital game conditions as compared to traditional
teaching methods.



Sitzmann (2011) found significantly greater gains in self-efficacy (d = 0.52, p < .05),
declarative knowledge (d = 0.28, p < .05), procedural knowledge (d = 0.37, p < .05), and

27

retention (d = 0.22, p < .05) in digital game conditions as compared to various other
groups in non-game conditions.


Wouters et al. (2013) found significantly higher learning gains (d = 0.29, p < .01) and
retention (d = 0.36, p < .01) in digital game conditions, but did not find digital game
conditions more motivating (d = 0.26, p > .05) than non-game learning conditions.



Clark et al. (2014) found significantly greater cognitive, interpersonal and intrapersonal
learning outcomes (d = .33) in digital game conditions when compared to non-game
conditions.

Additionally, Clark et al. (2014) found that digital games with augmented learning designs were
associated with greater learning outcomes (d = .37) in relation to their standard counterparts, a
finding that emphasizes the important role of instructional design for effective learning. Though
limitations do exist with any study, the largely consistent findings across all four meta-analyses
add to the growing evidence that well-designed digital games are effective learning tools.
Designing Digital Games for Learning
In a review of studies on digital games, Tobias, Fletcher, Dai and Wind (2011) concluded
that while games appear to engage and improve cognitive processes in a number of ways, it is the
affordances of the game itself that determine what cognitive processes will be impacted. DGBL
research suggests that learning transfer is optimal when game and task share common cognitive
processes (Anderson & Bavelier, 2011; Greenfield, 1998; Subrahmanyam & Greenfield, 1994).
Consequently, Tobias et al. (2011) emphasized the need for analyses of game and task in order to
ensure they share common cognitive processes. Hung and Van Eck’s (2010) alignment of
problem types to digital game types serves as a good starting point for tackling such analyses.
28

However, there is a limitation in aligning digital game affordances to related cognitive
processes. Analysis of that nature requires subjective interpretation, so there is no guarantee that
good learning will result from digital game choice. A more sustained approach to effective
learning from digital games lies in instructional design. The findings from Clark et al. (2014) on
augmented learning design in digital games demonstrates the importance of instructional design
as a key factor in the development of good digital games for learning.
How does instructional design fit into the game design process? Van Eck recognizes
similarities between the game design process and the ADDIE process, beginning with the
establishment of an overall goal during the analysis phase, to mapping out the product during the
design phase, to the process of testing the product during the evaluation phase (Hirumi,
Appelman, Rieber & Van Eck, 2010a). Appelman believes that effective digital game design
requires a movement away from the traditional instructional design process toward a
constructivist model that focuses more on experiential learning processes. Rieber advocates for a
more creative, non-analytical approach to designing digital games for learning (Hirumi,
Appelman, Rieber & Van Eck, 2010b). All agree that the design and development of good digital
games for learning will require a collaborative process between instructional designers and game
designers (Hirumi, Appelman, Rieber & Van Eck, 2010c).
Reese (2010) developed an instructional game design and embedded assessment
approach called CyGaMEs. The CyGaMEs approach is based on the idea of native learning
technology and attempts to simulate the natural learning processes through inquiry and
analogical reasoning. CyGaMEs borrows from the instructional design process by focusing on
alignment, task analysis, and prior knowledge. Embedded assessments measure player progress
29

toward game goal, player interaction with the game world, and player’s level of flow. Selene was
the first CyGaMEs-designed learning product, developed with the goal of teaching lunar science
concepts. A quantitative analysis of the use of Selene as a learning intervention found its primary
effect for learning as statistically significant (F (1, 20) = 358.73, p < .001; Reese & Tabachnick,
2010).
Another example of a successfully designed game-based learning environment comes
from a living model of game-based learning -- Quest to Learn (Q2L). Q2L is an experimental
public school in New York City, which opened in 2009 for grades 6-12. A collaborative effort
between the Department of Education, New Visions for Public Schools, and the Institute of Play,
Q2L offers an immersive, participatory curriculum based on the principles of game design.
Students are given increasingly complex challenges (e.g., games, quests) in each learning
domain, which they attempt to resolve through the components of gameplay, such as roleplaying,
interactivity, knowledge sharing, reflection and feedback (Salen et al., 2011). Shute and Torres
(2012) took an evidence-centered design approach (ECD) to assess Q2L student performance on
three competencies: systems thinking, teamwork and time management. Preliminary results
showed significant gains among students in time management (t53 = 5.74; p < .01.) and systems
thinking (t59 = 3.31; p < .01). However, students showed no significant gains on teamwork
skills.
Digital Games and Literacy
The concept of literacy has changed from one of reading and writing print text to one of
literacy as a group of multiple social practices that can change in response to cultural, social, and
communicative influences (Barton & Hamilton, 2000; New London Group, 1996). Today,
30

fluency in 21st century literacies is characterized by an individual’s proficiency in using
technology tools (e.g., technology literacy, ICT literacy), in multimedia navigation and creation
(e.g., digital literacy, multimodal literacy), and in the ability to analyze and synthesize multiple
forms of information (e.g., media literacy, information literacy, visual literacy; NCTE, 2008).
If literacy is a social practice, then social practices such as digital gameplay are also a
form of literacy. Gee (2007) argues that when people are learning to play digital games, they are
essentially learning a new literacy. Steinkuehler (2010) sees games as a “digital literacy practice
through and through” (p. 61). She suggests that both reading and writing take place within a
digital game. Players must read a game’s meanings, and then respond by writing back into the
game. The literacy is multimodal in nature. Players read words, sounds, and images in order to
learn how to play the game, and those words, sounds and images are situated specifically within
the context of the game’s domain (Gee, 2007). Avid gamers belong to a community of practice,
and become experts in gaming through participation in the practices surrounding the gaming
culture. Game literacy is a literacy of expertise (Squire, 2008).
A connection between the literacy practices of gaming and the literacy practices that take
place in schools has been made by a number of scholars (Abrams, 2009; Apperley & Walsh,
2012; Beavis & O’Mara, 2010; Gee, 2007; O’Brien & Scharber, 2008). O’Brien and Scharber
(2008) advocate for bridging the digital literary practices outside school with those inside school
to better engage learners and close the gap that exists between advantaged and less-advantaged
children. DGBL is one avenue for this (Caperton, 2010; Gee, 2007, 2010; Holmes, 2011).
Recognition of the need to merge multimodal literacy practices into school-based literacy
practices has been established among groups in Australia, the UK and the US (Bearne &
31

Bazalgette, 2010; Beavis & O’Mara, 2010; NCTE, 2005; Walsh, 2009). Beavis (2012) believes
that digital games are a valuable avenue for bringing multimodal literacy practices into the
English curriculum. She argues that games provide students with a new way to tell stories. They
bring “literacy into action” (Apperley & Beavis, 2011, p. 130) by bridging text with game action
through paratexts (Apperley & Walsh, 2012), and can help to cultivate critical perspectives about
the elements that come together to make texts work (Beavis, 2012). Beavis, et al. (2009;
Apperley & Beavis, 2013) developed a model for critical games literacy that can be used for
integrating games into the English curriculum.
Apperley and Walsh (2012) argue that digital games and school-based literacy practices
have far more in common than current literature suggests. They have proposed a heuristic for
understanding gaming (HUG) that teachers can use to select games that support literacy and
learning in the curriculum. HUG is based on the premise that reading occurs in the process of
gameplay. The heuristic is built on four parameters of gameplay: actions, designs, systems and
situations. In gameplay, the actions of players impact the final narrative, and the final narrative
can be different each time, depending on the action of the gameplayer. Players, like readers,
participate in communities that share paratexts (e.g., fan fiction, walkthroughs, mods) they have
designed. However, digital games provide greater opportunities for players to design paratexts.
Like books, digital games are based on systems that must be understood for meaning making. In
digital games, meaning making is multimodal as the player must interpret multiple forms of
media. Finally, digital games are played within a specific, situated context, which is fundamental
for understanding the learning that takes place during gameplay (Apperley, 2010; Gee, 2007).

32

Apperley and Walsh (2012) believe that understanding the concept of situations is the key for
teachers to be able to connect students’ gaming literacies to school-based literacy practices
Case Studies in Digital Games and Literacy Practices
Working with digital games as texts. In a large Catholic Boys School, digital games
were used in a Year 9 English class of 15 year old boys with the intention to facilitate
development of close reading and critical literacy skills about the role that games played in the
students’ lives. Using The Simpsons Hit and Run and Grand Theft Auto IV, students were asked
to review the two games for playing styles, expectations and game structure. Students
successfully showed their understanding of the review genre both in print and multimodal
format. They exhibited an intense knowledge of specific gaming environments, and they
demonstrated an ability to predict the knowledge that would be needed by new players (Beavis &
O’Mara, 2010).
In-school and out-of-school literacy practices. The in-school and out-of-school
information literacy (IL) practices of eight-year old Rajan (pseudonym) were analyzed. Rajan
attended third-grade at a large urban public school in British Columbia, Canada. His in-school IL
practices were largely centered on non-fiction books. Computer access was minimal, as there
was only one computer in the classroom. Rajan’s out-of-school IL practices consisted largely of
computer use for homework related research, playing games, and for instant messaging with
friends. Rajan was a frequent player of digital games that required problem solving (e.g., street
car racing). It was observed that the digital games he played often factored into the content of his
school-based literacy practices. For example, he wrote a play about street car racing. Findings
showed a disconnection between in-school and out-of-school IL practices. The author concluded
33

Rajan effectively participated in the global information economy outside of school, but was
unable to do so in school due to a lack of multimodal sources (McTavish, 2009).
Digital literacies for the disengaged. Steinkuehler and King (2009) created an afterschool program for adolescent boys based on the digital game, World of Warcraft (WoW). The
purpose of the program was to leverage the game as a tool for connecting boys’ in-school and
out-of-school literacy practices. This was accomplished through (a) the utilization of WoW
forum discussions to foster collective problem solving through informal argumentation, (b) the
creation of a user-generated online network to develop research and synthesis skills of
multimodal resources, (c) the building of individual and guild web sites to promote design
thinking and digital production skills, and (d) the writing of multimodal fan fiction graphic
novels. All four activities were aligned to NCTE standards. Findings showed initial success,
most notably in using literacy practices to solve problems, research and put together multimodal
resources, and synthesize in-game and out-of-game materials.
Close examination of the previous three case studies reveals a common theme, namely
that the multimodal format of digital gaming environments serves as a tool for strengthening
multiple literacy practices. In all three cases, the products and practices that resulted from the
students’ interactions with digital games represented the kinds of skills reflected in the P21
Framework. The Catholic Boys School students (Beavis & O’Mara, 2010) successfully
demonstrated the development of close reading and critical literacy skills, very likely due to
motivation from intense interest in the digital games used in the lessons. Ironically, Rajan
(McTavish, 2009) more effectively participated in literacy practices outside of school due to
greater access to multimodal sources (e.g., digital games). Finally, by engaging in literacy
34

practices centered on WoW, the boys in the after school program were able to strengthen a
wealth of skills that are applicable in school (Steinkuehler & King, 2009). For TLs, implications
from these case studies exist both in the classroom and in the library. In the classroom, TLs can
collaborate with teachers to create digital game-based lessons that promote multiple literacies. In
the library, TLs can develop digital game collections that serve as multimodal sources for 21st
century learning.
Digital Games and Information Literacy
Problem solving lays at the foundation of information literacy, and information literacy
models such as Big6 are problem-solving approaches to using information for decision making.
Numerous scholars have pointed to problem solving as one of the learning benefits of digital
games (Gee, 2007; Griffiths, 2002; Hung & Van Eck, 2010). Gee (2007) states that digital games
“situate meaning in a multimodal space through embodied experiences to solve problems” (p.
40). Squire (2006) views games as places “where learners participate in open and closed problem
solving” (p. 22). Steinkuehler (2006) sees games as being made up of “overlapping well-defined
problems enveloped in ill-defined problems that render their solutions meaningful” (p. 98).
Adams (2009b) studied information seeking behavior and meaning making in the online
role-playing game, City of Heroes, using McKenzie’s (2003) model of information practices to
inform her analysis. McKenzie’s model consists of four everyday modes of information seeking
behaviors: 1) active seeking, the most direct approach; 2) active scanning, such as browsing; 3)
non-directed monitoring, such as accidental discovery; and 4) by proxy, such as gaining
information via an agent.

35

In City of Heroes, players took an active seeking approach when they consulted game
forums or manuals outside the game; or, in the game itself, when an avatar approached a trainer
(i.e., non-player character). Players took an active scanning approach when they looked for
information in a likely source, such as an unofficial web page; or, in the digital game itself, when
they scan the environment looking for cues or clues (e.g., pulsing sounds when an enemy is
near). Players took a non-directed monitoring approach when they accidentally discovered or
encountered something in the game, such as how to use the interface or how to target a villain.
Players took a by-proxy approach to information seeking when they received information from
the non-player characters that they did not recognize as important (e.g., backstories), or when
another player in the game offered advice without solicitation. Adams (2009b) concluded that
information seeking behaviors that occur in a gaming environment parallel everyday information
seeking behaviors, and she suggests that gaming in libraries may be an effective tool for
promoting and reinforcing information literacy skills (Adams, 2009b).
Digital Games in Libraries
Gaming is not a new concept in school libraries. The development of educational game
collections (e.g., board games) to support the research and curriculum needs of teachers dates as
far back as the 1920s (Nicholson, 2013). However, digital games are a more recent trend in
libraries, most prominently in public libraries. According to the 2009 Library Gaming Census
Report, 25% of libraries of all types circulate PC games, 19% circulate console games and 5%
circulate handheld games. Of libraries that have gaming programs, the most commonly cited
outcomes are improved reputation with library users, user connection to other library services,
and increased social connection among users (Nicholson, 2009). Growing interest in gaming in
36

libraries led to the first annual Gaming, Learning and Libraries Symposium being held in 2007.
Keynote speakers included James Paul Gee and Henry Jenkins, both gaming and literacy experts
(Peterman & Grieg, 2007). The Symposium inspired a growth in the library research literature
exploring the links between gaming, literacy and learning.
Digital Games as Social, Democratizing and Educational
In the library literature, there is an emerging recognition that digital games play an
important role in serving the three primary purposes of libraries: social, democratizing and
educational (Adams, 2009a; Buchanan & Elzen, 2012; Nicholson, 2010; Werner, 2013).
Digital games as social. Libraries have long served as social centers, both in the
community and the school (Davies, 1974; Perry, 1912). Today, gaming clubs and gaming events
in libraries are one way to bring like-minded students together for socialization. Squire and
Steinkuehler (2005) believe that libraries can better connect with the digital generation by
providing access to digital games in libraries, set up gaming stations, and host gaming events.
Neiburger (2007) and Czarnecki (2009) draw parallels between digital game events and library
story times as taking something that a patron would typically consume at home, and constructing
a social event around it. Public libraries have already begun to embrace digital games and
gaming events, as the ALA’s International Games Day has become an annual event.
Digital games as democratizing. Democratization means equity of access, and is a
traditional value of libraries. The ALA (2013) defines equity of access as the ability for all
people to “obtain information in a variety of formats” and to “exercise their right to know
without fear of censorship or reprisal” (n.p.). Gee (2012) sees libraries as equitable providers of
access in the digital age. Just as libraries have served that role for reading, Gee suggests they can
37

also serve as the social equalizers for literacy skills of the 21st century, and they can do that by
providing access to good digital games. Gee (2012) defines good digital games as “complex and
challenging problem-solving spaces” (p. 63).
Democratization is also associated with civic engagement. A Pew Internet and American
Life Project report titled Teens, Video Games and Civics found that civic gaming experiences
among teens correlated strongly with youth’s civic engagement in the community (Lenhart, et
al., 2008). Civic engagement in gameplay was defined as opportunities where players helped or
guided other players, participated in guilds, learned about social issues or struggled with ethical
issues. In two case studies involving public libraries that tracked the civic effects of gaming
events on teens, researchers learned that gaming was a particularly transformational experience
for underserved youth, and libraries can provide the social spaces and the support needed for
gaming to improve youths’ civic engagement in a way that has not been experienced before
(Levine, 2009). Civic engagement is linked to civic literacy, one of the 21st century
interdisciplinary themes running through the P21 Framework. This would imply that when
school libraries support civic gaming experiences, they are not only serving their primary
mission of democratization, they are also supporting 21st century learning.
Digital games as educational. The most basic purpose of libraries is educational.
Libraries provide access to books and other sources to promote reading and literacy. There is
now a growing recognition that digital games not only promote reading within the game itself,
but can also inspire students to check out library books with similar themes and genres similar to
the digital games they play (Adams, 2009a; Squire & Steinkuehler, 2005). Gerber (2009) sees
digital games as a ‘hook’ to help students recognize how young adult literature can be matched
38

with their gaming interests. For example, she suggests that players of Elder-Scrolls Oblivion
might be interested in reading Elf Realm by Daniel Kirk, and players of Baldar’s Gate might be
interested in reading The Lightening Thief by Rick Riordan. Johnson (2006) argues that digital
games are a new cultural system of reading. He asserts that reading books and playing digital
games share similar cognitive benefits, namely effort, concentration, attention, sense making,
following narrative and imagination.
Squire and Jenkins (2003) see digital games as initiators of curiosity. Games can increase
a student’s interest in a topic, which triggers questions (Harris, 2010), leads to information
seeking (Nicholson, 2010), and develops research skills (Squire & Steinkuehler, 2005). Digital
games themselves are environments where information seeking and meaning making are taking
place, and Adams (2009b) suggests that gaming in the library can improve those information
seeking skills.
Digital Gaming Collections in School Libraries
Gaming collections have long existed in school libraries. The development of educational
game collections to support the research and curriculum needs of teachers dates as far back as the
1920s (Nicholson, 2013). While these have traditionally been board games, TLs are beginning to
consider the role of digital games in libraries. Work by Gee (2012), Squire (2005), Steinkuehler
(2005) and Nicholson (2007), along with a new understanding of how digital games can support
information literacy has led to an increased interest among TLs to explore the possibilities of
bringing digital games into library collections. Gaming policies are being examined, gaming
events are being held, and must-have digital game collection lists are being compiled (Nicholson,
2007). One avenue for justifying digital game purchases is the library’s mission statement. When
39

school libraries adopt more inclusionary mission statements that are similar to the lifelong
learning and social-centered mission statements of public libraries, they broaden their ability to
justify gaming collections (Farmer & Murphy, 2010).
Elmborg (2011) describes libraries as a Third Space—a technology-enabled learning
space that also supports the social interactions of students. An example of this is the learning
commons, which is becoming increasingly visible on school campuses (Fisher, 2010; Loertscher
& Koechlin, 2014) and typically located centrally in the library. Elmborg (2011) suggests that
school libraries can act as Third Spaces to bridge students’ out-of-school literacy practices with
their in-school literacy practices. Gee (2007), Squire (2005), Steinkuehler (2007) and others have
made the same observation about digital games acting as bridges between in-school and out-ofschool literacy practices (Abrams, 2009; Apperley & Walsh, 2012; Beavis & O’Mara, 2010;
O’Brien & Scharber, 2008). In that respect, school libraries are uniquely suited for the role of
Third Space where students can bridge their informal and formal literacy practices through
gameplay. TLs can facilitate this by supporting gaming collections, gaming events, and gamebased learning.
Barriers to Digital Game Adoption
While interest in digital games in schools has grown steadily over the past decade, digital
game adoption has not grown quite as much (De Grove, Bourgonjon, & Van Looy, 2012).
Barriers exist that may prevent teachers from changing their classroom technology practices.
These same barriers may also prevent teachers from adopting digital games in their classrooms.
The underlying theory behind the barriers concept comes from Fullan and Stiegelbauer (1991),
who proposed the idea of first- and second-order educational change. Brickner (1995) further
40

extended Fullan and Stiegelbauer’s work by describing first- and second-order barriers to change
in the computer usage of mathematics teachers. Ertmer (1999) continued Brickner’s work by
applying first-order and second-order barriers to the technology integration practices of teachers.
First-order barriers are the external factors (e.g., equipment, support) that impact technology
integration, and second-order barriers are the internal factors (e.g., personal beliefs) that impact
technology integration.
Multiple studies have examined first-order barriers to technology integration, with
findings citing lack of time (Beggs, 2000; Bunch & Broughton, 2002), lack of support (Brown,
Davis, Onarheim & Quitadomo, 2002; Schoepp, 2005), and lack of awareness of policy issues
(Maddux & Johnson, 2010; Russell, O’Dwyer, Bebell, & Tao, 2007) as having a significant
impact on teachers’ technology practices. Ertmer (2005) argued that second-order barriers, such
as personal beliefs about the value of technology and beliefs about teaching and learning, also
play a significant role in teachers’ technology practices.
Past studies have found discrepancies between teachers’ beliefs and their technology
practices. Most notably, constructivist beliefs about teaching do not necessarily translate into
constructivist teaching practices with technology (Becker & Ravitz, 1999; Lim & Chai, 2008;
Liu, 2011; Ravitz, Becker, & Wong, 2000), resulting in classroom settings that remain traditional
rather than technology-integrated (Ertmer, Gopalakrishnan, & Ross, 2001). Ertmer et al. (2012)
described these discrepancies as barriers thresholds and speculated that they may be the result of
teachers’ other beliefs that weigh more strongly when making decisions about technology
practices in the classroom. Ertmer (1999) suggested that the “relative weight that teachers
assigned to first-order barriers” (p. 52) can critically impact the way they integrate technology
41

into the classroom. For example, teachers who perceive lack of infrastructure as a significant
problem may choose not to use technology in the classroom at all, despite their beliefs about its
learning value.
Research on first- and second-order barriers to technology integration has been further
extended to the DGBL literature, with findings that reflect those cited above. Discussion of those
findings follows.
First-order Barriers to Digital Game Adoption
Commonly cited first-order barriers to digital game adoption include lack of time, lack of
infrastructure and lack of support. Games must fit into the time constraints of lessons. This
presents a challenge for both teachers and librarians. Lack of time to become familiar with the
games, and to prepare lessons around them (Ertzberger, 2009; Gros, 2007; Ketelhut and Schifter,
2011; Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014) is a deterrent to digital game integration into the curriculum.
Adequate infrastructure, such as hardware, software, and Internet service are needed for game
access, whether in the classroom or library. Lack of infrastructure can prevent digital game
adoption (Ertzberger, 2009; Farmer & Murphy, 2010; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011; Rice, 2007) or
at the very least, limit game choice (Tüzün, 2007; Van Eck, 2006). Technical issues (Gros,
2003), along with a lack of technical support (Baek, 2008; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011; Ketelhut &
Schifter, 2011) deters digital game use because of the disruption it can cause to the teaching and
learning process. Lack of peer and administrative support (Ketelhut & Schifter, 2011) can make
it difficult for collaborative problem solving to take place when implementation problems arise.
Second-order Barriers to Digital Game Adoption

42

A belief that games lack curricular relevance (Bourgonjon et al., 2013; De Grove,
Bourgonjon, & Van Looy, 2012; Gros, 2007; Kenny & Gunter, 2011; Proctor & Marks, 2013) is
a widely cited second-order barrier to digital game adoption. Kenny and McDaniel (2011)
suggest inadequate teacher training underlies teachers’ abilities to the see the learning relevance
in games. Barbour, Evans, and Toker (2009) found this to be true for pre-service teachers, who
were able to see curricular connections to games, but had difficulty seeing how they could be
used for learning in the classroom. Takeuchi and Vaala (2014), Van Eck (2013, 2014) and
Bourgonjon et al. (2013) echo the need for teacher training, and believe that professional
development is a vital component toward greater use of digital games in education. Ertmer et al.
(2012) support these findings in their research, and recommend that professional development
should focus on approaches that can create changes in teachers’ beliefs about technology
practices in the classroom.
Barriers Thresholds to Digital Game Adoption
If barriers thresholds (Ertmer, 1999; Ertmer et al., 2012) explain the discrepancies
between student-centered beliefs and teacher-centered technology practices, then they may also
explain the slow movement toward digital game adoption in the classroom. Of all the commonly
cited barriers discussed above, lack of curricular evidence may represent one of the biggest
confounding factors in explaining discrepancies between teachers’ beliefs and digital game
practices. Perceptions about lack of curricular evidence can persist even in the absence of
external barriers and in the presence of constructivist pedagogical beliefs, which may result in
resistance to digital game adoption. As others have suggested, (e.g., Bourgonjon et al., 2013;

43

Ertmer, 2012; Van Eck, 2013, 2014) professional development may be the key to resolving such
discrepancies.
TLs and Digital Game Adoption
Overarching Hypothesis
TLs already support 21st century learning and literacies as integrators and teachers of the
underlying skills of inquiry-based research that make up the broader picture of information
literacy. They serve as technology supporters and coordinators in many schools. They are
information specialists who recommend and purchase materials that support the curriculum
(AASL, 2007; ISTE-SIGMS Executive Advocacy Committee, 2010). These are roles that open
up opportunities for TLs to support and promote digital games in schools. However, there is a
gap in the research on TLs’ attitudes and beliefs about the value of digital games in supporting
21st century learning and literacies. This study aims to close that gap.
The overarching hypothesis of this study is that TLs share similar attitudes and beliefs
about digital games as their classroom teacher colleagues, and those attitudes and beliefs present
first- and second-order barriers to digital game adoption. This hypothesis is based on the idea
that TLs represent a very similar population to classroom teachers because in many states, TLs
are licensed teachers with the same educational requirements as their classroom counterparts. In
addition to teacher certification, TLs are also licensed or endorsed as media specialists, and some
states require that they hold a master’s degree in library and information science as well
(Jesseman, Page, & Underwood, 2014).
TLs and Classroom Teachers: Similarities and Differences

44

Similarities. TLs and classroom teachers are subject to the same institutional constraints
and policies. Research has shown that this can present external barriers (e.g., lack of equipment,
lack of support, lack of time) to digital game adoption for classroom teachers (e.g., Baek, 2008;
Ertzberger, 2009; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011; Ketelhut & Schifter, 2011; Rice, 2007). TLs face
similar first-order barriers. Farmer and Murphy (2010) found that a number of issues act as
barriers to the development of gaming programs in school libraries, namely lack of adequate
gaming equipment, justification for purchasing said equipment, scheduling and library space
availability, and policies that prevent access (e.g., filters) to digital games.
Classroom teachers and TLs are also subject to many of the same experiences that shape
their pedagogical beliefs, including personal experience as a student, professional training and
teaching experience (Prestridge, 2012; Raths, 2001). In terms of how that impacts their use of
technology, some studies have found that teachers’ pedagogical beliefs are highly correlated with
student-centered technology integration practices in the classroom (Chen, 2008; Clark &
Peterson, 1986; Ertmer, et al., 2012). However, other studies have found that teachers’
technology practices may be influenced by institutional expectations as well (Dwyer, Ringstaff,
& Sandholtz, 1991; Yocam, 1996), leading to teacher-centered technology practices even when
teachers hold student-centered pedagogical beliefs. Niederhauser and Stoddart (2001) believe
that providing teachers access to technology alone is not an effective way to integrate it into
classrooms. They state that technology should “become a carefully integrated part of teacher
training and professional development (p.29).” Ertmer (1999, 2005) has drawn similar
conclusions.

45

Differences. One difference that has been observed between TLs and classroom teachers
is that of teacher identity. In particular, misperceptions about the library profession and negative
stereotypes held by faculty, administrators and students have impaired recognition of TLs’
instructional roles (Hartzell, 2002; Polger & Okamoto, 2010; Walter, 2008). Such
misperceptions may prevent TLs from serving on decision making committees, acting as
technology supporters, collaborating with teachers, and teaching 21st century skills, all roles that
create opportunities to support and promote digital games (Van Eck, 2006).
Another difference between TLs and classroom teachers lies in potentially conflicting
perspectives on collaboration. The field of school librarianship recognizes that limited resources
are a barrier to the increasing demands of 21st century learning. To solve that problem,
Loertscher (1988) and Montiel-Overall (2005) proposed models of collaboration between
teachers and TLs based on constructivist principles. Today, the concept of teacher-librarian
collaboration is a standard in the core curriculum of school librarianship programs (ALA/AASL,
2010).
In contrast to collaboration models of school librarianship, classroom teachers often
struggle to collaborate (Piercey 2010) despite decades of research on its benefits (Friend &
Cook, 1990; Marks & Printy, 2003; Goddard, Goddard & Tschannen-Moran, 2007), and findings
(Becker and Riel, 1999) that collaborative teachers demonstrate more constructivist teaching
practices than non-collaborative teachers. Piercey (2010) suggested that because teachers are
culturally and historically unaccustomed to collaboration, attempts by leaders to require it may
only result in resistance. To improve collaboration, he recommended a servant leadership
approach that focuses on relationships within the organizational structure. Disparity between the
46

two models of teaching may make collaboration difficult for TLs and classroom teachers,
consequently hampering opportunities for TLs to support and promote digital games in schools.
As Piercey (2010) implied, school leadership presents an additional confounding factor that may
prevent collaborative relationships between the two groups.
A third difference between TLs and classroom teachers is in scheduling. Most teachers
operate on a fixed schedule basis, with classes or subjects taught at the same time each day. On
the other hand, many school districts have implemented flexible scheduling for TLs which
reflects the philosophy of the collaboration model of school librarianship. The theory behind
flexible scheduling is that it increases TLs’ abilities to collaborate and plan with teachers for
classroom-integrated instruction of library skills (e.g., information literacy). However, successful
implementation is key, and administrative support is essential for success (McGregor, 2002,
2006). The AASL (2014) issued a position statement on flexible scheduling as the following
excerpt illustrates:
The integrated library program philosophy requires an open schedule that includes
flexible and equitable access to physical and virtual collections for staff and students.
Classes must be flexibly scheduled into the library on an as needed basis to facilitate justin-time research, training, and utilization of technology with the guidance of the teacher
who is the subject specialist, and the librarian who is the information process specialist.
Summary
The development of a new model of learning for the 21st century, such as the P21
framework, is a direct response to the recognition that our education system needs to better
prepare today’s students for the career and life demands of tomorrow (Abbott, 1997; Longworth
47

& Davies, 1996). Critical thinking and problem solving, communication and collaboration, and
technology-based skills are the hallmarks of 21st century learning (AASL, 2007; Council of
Chief State School Officers & National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, 2015;
ISTE, 2007; Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2007). TLs support 21st century learning by
integrating the underlying skills of inquiry-based research (e.g., critical thinking, problem
solving, and technology skills) into the curriculum (AASL, 2007, 2010), and teaching to a crosssection of learning standards, including Common Core, AASL and ISTE Standards. TLs are also
taking on technology leadership roles by introducing technology at the classroom level and
serving on their schools’ tech teams (School Library Journal Research. 2013). Furthermore, the
school library provides a place where students can access technology and work together on
collaborative projects (ISTE-SIGMS Executive Advocacy Committee, 2010).
Research has found digital games to be potentially beneficial tools for supporting 21st
century learning (Blumberg & Ismailer, 2009; Gee, 2007; Hung & Van Eck, 2010; Kirriemuir &
McFarlane, 2004; Prensky, 2006, 2007, 2008; Rieber, 1996; Squire, 2003 Van Eck, 2006), with a
growing body of evidence showing greater learning outcomes in DGBL when compared to nongame conditions (Clark, Tanner-Smith, & Killingsworth, 2014; Sitzmann, 2011; Vogel et al.,
2006; Wouters, van Nimwegen, van Oostendorp, & van der Spek, 2013). Integral to 21st century
learning is the concept of literacy as a social practice, prompting recognition of digital gameplay
as a literacy practice (Gee, 2007; Steinkuehler, 2010; Squire, 2008). Additionally, a connection
between the literacy practices of digital gaming and the literacy practices that take place in
schools has been made by a number of scholars (Abrams, 2009; Apperley & Walsh, 2012;
Beavis & O’Mara, 2010; Gee, 2007; O’Brien & Scharber, 2008). Adams (2009b) and Squire and
48

Steinkuehler (2005) have drawn a connection between digital gaming and information literacy in
particular, making TLs and school libraries uniquely well-suited to promote and support digital
games (Adams, 2009a; Buchanan & Elzen, 2012; Gee, 2012; Nicholson, 2010; Squire &
Steinkuehler, 2005; Werner, 2013).
While the benefits of digital games are increasingly acknowledged, barriers to digital
game adoption exist. Barriers that are commonly cited by classroom teachers include lack of
time (Ertzberger, 2009; Gros, 2003; Ketelhut and Schifter , 2011), lack of infrastructure
(Ertzberger, 2009; Farmer & Murphy, 2010; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011; Rice, 2007) and lack of
support (Baek, 2008; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011; Ketelhut & Schifter, 2011). Beliefs about lack
of curricular relevance are also common findings in studies on digital game adoption
(Bourgonjon et al., 2013; De Grove, Bourgonjon, & Van Looy, 2012; Gros, 2003; Kenny &
Gunter, 2001; Proctor & Marks, 2013). No studies have examined TLs’ beliefs about barriers to
digital game adoption, creating a gap in the research. This study aims to close that gap.
The overarching hypothesis of this study is that because TLs represent a population
similar to classroom teachers, they are also likely to share similar attitudes and beliefs about
digital games and face similar barriers to digital game adoption. Both TLs and classroom
teachers are subject to the same institutional constraints and policies, and thus experience similar
external barriers to digital game adoption (Baek, 2008; Ertzberger, 2009; Farmer & Murphy,
2010; Kenny & McDaniel, 2011). Classroom teachers and TLs are also subject to many of the
same experiences that shape their pedagogical beliefs (Raths, 2001; Prestridge, 2012), which
correlate highly with their technology practices in the classroom (Ertmer, et al., 2012).

49

One difference that may act as a barrier for TLs to support and promote digital games is
misperceptions about the library profession and negative stereotypes held by faculty,
administrators and students have impaired recognition of TLs’ instructional roles (Hartzell, 2002;
Polger & Okamoto, 2010; Walter, 2008). Classroom teachers and TLs may also differ in
perceptions about collaboration. Professional training of TLs is based on collaboration models of
school librarianship (Loertscher, 1988; Montiel-Overall, 2005) and flexible scheduling to support
collaboration (AASL, 2014), while classroom teachers often struggle to collaborate (Piercey
2010). These differences may make collaboration difficult for TLs and classroom teachers,
subsequently hindering opportunities for TLs to support and promote digital games in schools.

CHAPTER III
METHODOLOGY
A mixed methods approach was used to test the research questions for this study. Chapter
III describes the methodology used, and is organized into four sections: (a) selection of
participants, (b) instrumentation, (c) data collection, and (d) data analysis.
Selection of Participants
Target Population
The target population of this study consisted of a convenience sample of K—12 teacher
librarians (TLs) who actively participate in library-related professional e-mail discussion lists.
TLs were recruited through several discussion lists managed by the American Library
Association: the AASL forum (aaslforum@lists.ala.org), the Information Literacy Discussion
List (infolit@lists.ala.org), and the Reference and User Services Association List (rusal@lists.ala.org). Additional participants were recruited through the Library Media Network
LISTSERV (LM_NET@LISTSERV.SYR.EDU) sponsored by Syracuse University.
These discussion lists were selected because they focus on issues that TLs face (e.g.,
library instruction, teacher collaboration, technology), they include a high subscriber rate of
librarians, they have a high activity rate, and they presented an opportunity for wide geographical
distribution of the survey to the target population. Wide geographical distribution to a high
subscribership of TLs increased the opportunity to obtain a population sample representative of

51

the general TL demographic group. Table 3 provides a detailed description of the discussion
lists.

Population Demographics
Demographically, TLs are predominantly female (91.7%), and the largest percentage fall
into the 45-55 age range (56.7%) Table 4 displays the most recently available demographic data
on school librarians in the United States, representative of the target population for this study.
Data was taken from the latest update of the ALA’s Diversity Counts study (ALA, 2007) on
gender, race, age and disability among library professionals, which was based on an analysis of
52

available U.S. data derived from the Census and the American Community Survey. Table 4 only
includes national data for credentialed librarians, which is defined as the minimum of a stateapproved media specialist certification.

Instrumentation
The primary instrument that was used for this study was the Teachers’ Attitudes Toward
Games (TATG) Survey (Van Eck, 2013), a 5-point Likert-type scale that measures attitudes and
beliefs that may act as barriers for digital game adoption by teachers. This instrument was chosen
to test the overarching hypothesis that TLs and classroom teachers represent similar populations
in terms of their perceptions of barriers to using digital games.
Additionally, one section of the Teaching, Learning and Computing (TLC) Survey
(Becker & Anderson, 1998) was utilized to help identify TLs’ pedagogical beliefs. A
demographic survey was also used to gather data on age, gender, state or country, qualifications,
job duties, learning standards used, and gaming habits. Finally, a series of open-ended questions
were included in the instrument for the purpose of gathering qualitative information on how TLs
are using digital games in the classroom and library. See Appendices C, D, E, and F to view the
instruments.
TATG Survey
53

The TATG survey is based on Fullan and Stiegelbauer’s (1991) theory of first-order and
second-order educational change, where first-order change is external (e.g., systems, processes)
and second-order change is internal (e.g., beliefs). Ertmer (1999) extended this theory to firstand second-order barriers to teachers’ technology integration practices. The TATG survey used
Ertmer’s (1999) work as a foundation, and subscales and questions were derived from numerous
existing, validated instruments as shown in Table 5.

The instrument consists of 83 items, and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.
Questions in the survey were the result of outcomes in current research (e.g., Kennedy-Clark,
2011; Maddux & Johnson, 2010; O’Hanlon, 2009), and were divided into first-order and secondorder barriers to change. First-order barriers include perceptions about lack of infrastructure,
such as technology access, technology support, and budget; and perceptions about lack of time.
Second-order barriers include perceptions about teaching (e.g., philosophy), lack of confidence,
and perceptions about lack of curricular relevance.
Equal numbers of items per subscale were created, and items were expressed both
negatively and positively to ensure authentic responses and prevent skewing of the data. At this
time, preliminary testing with 90 students has taken place, with 58 of those students taking it in
pre-test/post-test form for a study relating to math games in education. Once sufficient data on
the instrument has been gathered, principal components analysis will be conducted (R. Van Eck,
personal communication, November 19, 2013). This study provides an opportunity to gather the
additional data needed for the principal components analysis.
Teaching, Learning and Computing (TLC) Survey
Item J3 of the TLC survey was used to identify TLs’ pedagogical beliefs, and consists of
five pairs of bipolar statements about teaching philosophies ranging from behaviorist to
constructivist. Given the statements and a continuum scale, TLs were asked to select the
statement that most closely aligned to their beliefs.
The TLC survey was a nationwide survey of over 4000 teachers in more than 1,100
schools conducted by the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations to
measure teachers’ pedagogical beliefs, their teaching practices, their uses of technology in
55

teaching, and their school environments. Statements about pedagogical beliefs were validated
through in-depth interviews with 72 teachers in 24 schools encompassing several geographical
areas of the United States. The items chosen for the TLC survey were those that the interviewers
felt most closely aligned with the teachers’ actual pedagogical beliefs (Becker, 2000).
Framework for Categories of Classroom Practices
Ertmer et al.’s framework for Categories of Classroom Practices, located in Appendix B,
is a set of criteria that outlines student-centeredness in both teaching and technology practices. It
was originally developed for a study examining how well the pedagogical beliefs of K—12
classroom teachers aligned with their award-winning technology practices; and was adapted
from prior research on the differences between behaviorist and constructivist classroom
environments (Ertmer, Gopalakrishnan, & Ross, 2001; Grabe & Grabe, 1996). For this study, it
was used to assess the alignment between TLs’ pedagogical beliefs and their digital game
practices.
Past studies have found misalignments between teachers’ beliefs and their technology
practices. (Becker & Ravitz, 1999; Lim & Chai, 2008; Liu, 2011; Ravitz, Becker, & Wong,
2000). Ertmer et al. (2012) described these as barriers thresholds and speculated that they may be
the result of teachers’ other beliefs (e.g., first-order barriers) that weigh more strongly when
making decisions about technology practices in the classroom.
Data Collection
The first step in data collection was to gain permissions from the University of North
Dakota’s Institutional Review Board. As the study involved the use of a survey, an exemption
certification form was completed and submitted as required. Additional permissions were needed
56

from the discussion list owners in order to gain agreement for recruiting study participants from
those lists. Permission was granted for the following discussion lists: AASL Forum, INFOLIT,
RUSA-L, and LM_NET. Letters of agreement were submitted to the Institutional Review Board.
To recruit TLs from the discussion lists, a letter of invitation was posted to the forums. It
explained the purpose and benefits of the study, the amount of time required to complete the
study, and the steps taken to ensure participant privacy. The survey was electronically
distributed, and data was collected using Qualtrics’ survey software. Recruitment of participants
took place over a three month time frame, with reminders posted to the forums at two week
intervals in order to improve participation rate. During that time period, 221 discussion forum
members took part in the survey. Upon completion of the study, a letter was posted to the forums
thanking participants for their time and contributions to the research, with assurance that results
would be shared at a later date.
Data Analysis
This study utilized both a qualitative and quantitative methodology for data analysis. The
two methodologies are described individually.
Qualitative Analysis
Question 1: How Are TLs Using Digital Games? The qualitative analysis for research
question one consisted of cross-tabulating the open-ended responses from the 7 questions related
to digital game-based lessons into a single, separate Excel sheet with column headings for each
open-ended question. Each set of TL responses was organized across rows, and each category of
responses was organized by column and under its designated heading. Reponses were analyzed
for keyword patterns and common themes, and then classified and color coded by categories that
57

reflected terminology found in the school librarianship and DGBL literature (e.g., library
instruction versus classroom-integrated instruction; TL as collaborator, facilitator, or designer of
lessons; engagement, interactivity, enjoyment in games). Research question one was exploratory,
though the results were also used in the analysis of research question three.
Question 2: What Are TLs’ Pedagogical Beliefs? Data for research question two was
gathered using question J3 from the TLC survey, located in Appendix A, which measures
teaching philosophy. Use of an excerpt from the TLC survey was chosen due to the survey’s
background and validity. Responses from the TLC survey were tabulated to reflect the degree of
TLs’ pedagogical beliefs from behaviorist to constructivist on 5 separate bipolar statements: (a)
explainer/facilitator, (b) content/”sense-making,” (c) breadth/depth, (d) content/interest, and (e)
whole class activity/multiple activities. Statements were reverse coded where necessary. Possible
total scores ranged from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating a more constructivist philosophy.
Results were compared to the TATG data to determine if TLs’ reported pedagogical beliefs were
reflective of their attitudes and beliefs about barriers to digital game adoption.
Question 3: How do TLs’ uses of digital games reflect their pedagogical beliefs?
Ertmer et al.’s (2012) Framework for Categories of Classroom Practices, located in
Appendix B, was used to analyze how well TLs’ reported uses of digital games identified in
research question one were aligned with their pedagogical beliefs identified in research question
two. Constructivist beliefs do not necessarily translate into constructivist teaching practices with
technology (Becker & Ravitz, 1999; Lim & Chai, 2008; Liu, 2011; Ravitz, Becker, & Wong,
2000). Ertmer et al. (2012) described these discrepancies as barriers thresholds and speculated

58

that they may be the result of teachers’ other beliefs that weigh more strongly when making
decisions about technology practices in the classroom.
According to Ertmer et al.’s Framework, constructivist classroom practices are those that
foster communication, collaboration, problem solving or higher-order thinking. Behaviorist
classroom practices are those that focus on isolated skills, standards or independent learning.
TLs’ digital lesson objectives and digital game choices were assessed using Ertmer et al.’s
Framework. Results were organized and tabulated by lesson objective, game title or description,
game role (e.g., direct instruction; knowledge construction), game content (e.g., skills taught in
isolation; emphasis on thinking skills), and type of practice (e.g., teacher-centered; studentcentered).
Quantitative Analysis
Question 4: What barriers do TLs perceive for using digital games? Quantitative
analysis of the data examined numerical scores obtained from the Likert scale items in the TATG
survey. Responses on each statement ranged from scores of 1 to 5, with lower scores indicating
more negative attitudes. Reverse coding of negatively worded items was done to ensure all
statements pointed in the same direction. Individual Likert statements for each barrier construct
were combined to create new variables. Frequencies, mean scores, and standard deviations for
each of the new variables were calculated using SPSS data analysis software.
Question 5: How do TLs’ pedagogical beliefs shape perceptions of barriers to using
digital games? Scores from the data analysis in research question two were divided into two
groups, creating a new variable. Total scores of 20 and higher were used to represent
constructivist TLs (n = 29). Total scores of 16 or lower were used to represent behaviorist TLs (n
59

= 26). The middle scores were eliminated. Using the variables from research questions two and
four, a Pearson’s product-moment correlation was calculated to determine if there was a
relationship between TLs’ pedagogical beliefs and their perceptions of barriers to using digital
games. To define and describe differences between the two groups, independent samples t-tests
were run against dependent variables consisting of overall attitude toward digital games, as well
as attitudes toward first- and second-order barriers as a whole. Independent samples t-tests were
also used to calculate differences in attitudes for each individual barrier subscale.
Summary
The target population of this study consisted of a convenience sample of TLs who were
subscribers to discussion lists managed by the ALA and/or a discussion list for media specialists
sponsored by Syracuse University. The nature of the discussion lists enabled wide geographical
distribution, which facilitated generalization of the study’s results to the general TL population
across the United States. The primary instrument used for this study was the TATG survey, a 5point Likert-type scale that measures perceptions of barriers to using digital game. Additionally,
item J3 of the TLC survey was used to identify TLs’ pedagogical beliefs. Also, a series of openended questions were asked in order to learn about TLs’ experiences with using digital games as
learning tools.
The survey was distributed through the discussion forums via the electronic survey
software, Qualtrics. A mixed-methods approach was used to analyze data both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Results of the data analysis will be presented in the next chapter.

CHAPTER IV
RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS
This study aimed to extend the research on perceptions of barriers to digital game
adoption to TLs. TLs were invited to participate in an online survey in order to examine their
beliefs and practices about using digital games in schools. A 60% retention rate was achieved,
with 133 out of 221 TLs completing the survey. Of those who completed the survey, 117, or 53%
of the total pool, were TLs who worked in school libraries. Data from that group was analyzed
for the study. This chapter presents the descriptive statistics first, followed by the results of the
data analysis. Data analysis findings are arranged by the five stated research questions.
Descriptive Statistics
Demographic Variables
Age and gender. Age and gender demographics were collected to determine the degree
by which the sample population represents the national TL population, and as a means to
compare subgroups within the sample. According to the most recently available statistical data
on K—12 media specialists, the ratio of female to male TLs is more than 10 to 1 and the majority
of TLs are 45 or older (ALA, 2007). The TL population for this study reflects a similar profile,
with females comprising 94.87% of the survey sample, males comprising 4.27% of the survey
sample, and the remaining percentage not indicated. Likewise, the greatest representation of TLs
in this study were in the age groups of 45 and older, though the age distribution across those
groups was more evenly spread than in the national data. Figure 2 shows a comparison between
61

the survey sample and the national TL population. Differences may be reflective of changes in
the national TL population (e.g., aging, retirement) since the Diversity Counts survey (ALA,
2007) was conducted. However, in both sets of data, evidence of an older TL population is clear.
This may be due in part to the tendency of the profession to attract mid-career changers, making
school librarianship—and librarianship in general—a second career for many of its professionals
(Jones, 2010).

TL population by state. Survey participants were also asked to identify their state or
country for the purpose of determining the geographic spread of the sample population.
Represented in the survey sample were 32 states and two countries—Australia (n =1) and
Canada (n = 2). Texas and New York had the highest representation, likely reflecting the large
populations of those states. Other states, such as Indiana and South Carolina also had higher than
62

average representation, which could simply be the result of TL groups in those states sharing the
survey within their networks. Figure 3 compares the populations by state.

Qualifications. To determine how well the survey sample represents the TL population,
participants were asked to identify their professional qualifications. While qualifications differ
from state to state, all 50 states require media specialist licensure in the form of either a media
specialist certification or endorsement. In 45 states, teacher licensure is a required prerequisite
for pursuing media specialist licensure. A master’s degree in library and information science is
only required in 16 states (Jesseman, Page, & Underwood, 2014). Detailed data on TL
qualification requirements for each state can be found in Appendix A1.
In the survey sample, 76.1% of the participants reported holding media specialist
licensure and 52.1% of the participants reported holding a master’s degree. As shown in Figure
4, these characteristics are in line with the national data on media specialists in public schools
(Bitterman, Gray, & Golding, 2013), indicating that the survey sample is representative of the
national TL population in terms of qualifications.

Job duties. To gain insight into how the current job practices of TLs might create new
opportunities for them to support and promote digital games, participants were asked to identify
their primary job duties. Job duties were derived from a sample job description based on the
AASL’s position statement on the role of TLs in supporting 21st century learning, which is
included in Appendix D. Table 6 shows the percentage of TLs who reported performing each job
duty.

Not surprisingly, the top two primary job duties performed by TLs are collection
development (99.15%) and reading promotion (97.44%), both being traditional responsibilities
for the profession. Teaching research skills (95.73%) was the third most reported job duty,
reflecting the importance of information literacy as an academic skill. Collaborating with
teachers was also a job duty reported by the majority of TLs (84.62%), and may be a good
indicator of the changing role of TLs in the educational landscape of 21st century learning.
65

In addition to identifying their primary job duties, participants were asked to indicate how
often they performed selected duties that are particularly relevant to 21st century learning (i.e.,
duties involving information and related literacies, as well as technologies), and consequently to
DGBL. Table 7 shows the results of the reported frequencies of job duties.

All 9 in this grouping reported rarely teaching research skills.

TLs reported teaching research skills “all the time” or “often” with the greatest frequency
(71.79%), which indicates that the TL’s role in information literacy instruction is wellestablished. Of the TLs who identified evaluating learning technologies as a primary job duty
(75.21%), more than half reported performing that duty “all the time” or “often” (60.68%). This
places TLs in a central position for evaluating and recommending digital games that will support
teaching and learning in the classroom. Collaborating with teachers and providing professional
development “all the time” or “often” were reported by less than half the TLs, suggesting that

66

fewer opportunities may presently exist for TLs in supporting and promoting digital games
through those avenues.
Learning standards. To provide a snapshot of the degree of 21st century learning
initiatives within the TLs’ school environments, participants were asked to identify the learning
standards that their school districts recognize. Table 8 shows the learning standards that were
identified by TLs in the survey.

Common Core was identified by 69 participants representing 29 states in the study.
3
ISTE Standards were identified by 34 participants representing 20 states in the study.
4
AASL Standards were identified by 60 participants representing 25 states in the study.

Five states and two countries represented in the study – Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana,
Virginia, Minnesota, Canada and Australia – have not adopted Common Core, though Minnesota
67

did adopt its ELA standards (Achieve, 2013). It appears that some of the TLs may not have been
aware of their state’s connection to Common Core, as they identified their standards by another
name (e.g., Kansas College and Career Readiness Standards, Georgia Performance Standards,
PDE SAS) rather than selecting the Common Core option. This may be due to the renaming of
Common Core standards in an attempt to distance the state from any politics surrounding
Common Core adoption. Those instances were not included in the table. All of the additional
learning standards cited in Table X, with the exception of the Diocese of Charleston standards,
promote or support 21st century learning. This determination was made by examining their
verbiage in regards to 21st century skills as defined by the P21 Framework (Partnership for 21st
Century Skills, 2007).
ISTE Standards have been adopted or adapted by 49 states, but were only identified by 34
TLs in the survey. This may be due to the fact that many states do not refer to their technology
standards as ISTE standards, leading to unfamiliarity with the ISTE acronym as the source of the
standards. Regarding AASL Standards, 60 TLs identified that their school districts recognized
the standards. Fewer states have required curriculum standards in place for libraries, so AASL
Standards are more frequently adopted at the local level (Council of State School Library
Consultants).
It should be noted that in states that do have required library curriculum standards, some
have combined their library and technology standards together in recognition of the common
goals that both share. At least four states represented in the survey have such standards: (1)
Connecticut’s Information and Technology Literacy Framework, (2) Kansas’ Model Curricular
Standards for Library Media and Technology, (3) North Carolina’s Information and Technology
68

Essential Standard, and (4) Wisconsin’s Model Academic Standards for Information and
Technology Literacy. Though the sample is small, both ISTE and AASL Standards were
recognized by TLs from those states, which may suggest that combined library and technology
standards place TLs in a better position to both recognize and address 21st century skills in
schools.
Type of library. To determine the distribution of the sample population, TLs were asked
to identify the type of library in which they worked. An even distribution of TLs across the K—
12 spectrum is likely to provide a more complete picture of how TLs think about and use digital
games at all levels of learning. Figure 5 illustrates the findings.

As Figure 5 shows, elementary and high school libraries were fairly equally represented
in the study. While it may seem like middle school libraries were underrepresented, TLs in
“other” libraries indicated primarily elementary/middle or middle/high school combinations,
69

meaning that the “other” category captured a lot of middle school libraries. When adding the
combined libraries with the middle school library category, the effect of an even distribution of
TLs across the K—12 spectrum results, suggesting that the sample population in this study
serves as a good representation of TLs at both the primary and secondary levels.
Gaming habits. To determine whether gaming experience is correlated with attitudes
about digital games as learning tools, participants were surveyed about their personal gaming
habits. They were asked to estimate the number of hours per week that they play different types
of digital games (e.g., sports, casual, action, role playing). Additionally, TLs were asked to
respond to the statement, “I would rather do other things than play videogames.” Results from
that statement show that most TLs would rather do other things than play digital games. Thus,
the prospect of devoting time to digital gameplay was viewed negatively (M = 2.15,
SD = 1.019). This supports the results of data on the TLs’ personal gaming habits, as shown in
Table 9.
With the exception of casual games, the majority of TLs reported less than one hour’s
worth of digital gameplay. These results reflect the research on gaming demographics.
According to the Casual Games Association (2013), the majority of casual gamers are females
over the age of 30, and most casual gameplay occurs in short increments of 5 to 20 minutes. The
description of casual gamers mirrors the demographics represented by the TLs in this study. That
is, a predominantly female (94.87%) population that is over 30 (> 97%), and who plays primarily
casual games. This may have implications for TLs’ beliefs about digital games, as well as the
choices of digital games that they choose for use in the library or classroom.

Although the majority of TLs in the study showed very little interest or experience with
playing digital games, 16 TLs did indicate playing strategy games for one or more hours a week.
In that category, one TL also indicated wanting to “play these types of games.” Strategy games
are particularly well-suited for promoting problem solving skills that require metacognitive
thinking (Hung & Van Eck, 2010). TLs with experience in playing strategy games may be more

71

likely to recognize their value as learning tools, making them more likely to recommend strategy
games over other types of games when collaborating with teachers.
Testing the Research Questions
Research Question One
Question 1: How Are TLs Using Digital Games?
One of the purposes of this study was to find out how TLs are using digital games. This is
important because TLs are uniquely positioned to support digital games as 21st century learning
tools in both the library and classroom. As the demographic data from the survey show, TLs’
primary job duties include evaluating existing and emerging learning technologies, teaching
information literacy skills, and collaborating with teachers to integrate multiple literacies into the
classroom. These are job duties which provide opportunities for both using digital games and
recommending digital games to teachers.
Gaming initiatives. Survey participants were first asked if they had offered any gaming
initiatives in their library. Almost 42% of the TLs, 49 out of 117, had offered some type of
gaming initiative. Table 10 displays a list of the initiatives that the TLs had offered in their
school libraries.
Gaming events and gaming clubs were the most frequently cited gaming initiatives. This
finding suggests that some school libraries are using digital games to serve a social function, in
the same way that popular fiction and board games have long been used. Gaming collections and
maker activities that featured game design were also cited more frequently than other gaming
initiatives, which may reflect the evolving state of the school library into a learning commons,
where participatory play and creativity are central values (Loertscher & Koechlin, 2014).

Game-based lessons. A total of 47 lessons were described by TLs in the survey. Data
analysis began with identification of keyword patterns to signify common themes that could be
used to categorize the results. Two clear themes emerged for the TLs’ roles in lesson design and
for the types of lessons being taught. For lesson design, the TLs either played the role of
designer, collaborator or facilitator in the lessons. These three categories were derived from
commonly used keywords and from interpretations of lesson descriptions. They align well with
the current job duties of TLs as teachers, collaborators and technology supporters. When TLs
were teaching the lessons, they generally described themselves as creating or designing the
lessons. When TLs were collaborators of lessons, they often described themselves in that role,
though in some instances they indicated designing the lessons. When TLs were facilitators (i.e.,
support), they cited such roles as trainer, game facilitator, or materials provider.
The second theme that emerged was a distinction between library instruction and
classroom-integrated instruction. In library instruction, lessons were always designed by, and
usually for the TL. In classroom-integrated instruction, TLs served most often as collaborators or
facilitators and lessons were designed for both the teacher and TL or the teacher alone. Tables 11

and 12 are divided by library instruction and classroom-integrated instruction, and provide a
summary of findings. Lessons that were not clearly digital game-based were excluded from the
findings.

Library instruction. TLs’ digital game choices for these lessons trended toward games
that served the function of enabling practice of those skills. For example, shelf order lessons used
digital games specifically designed for shelf order practice such as Order in the Library (S2S
Utopia, 2004), a digital game developed by engineering students at the University of Texas in
Austin between 2002 and 2004, and a similar game called Shelver (Mrs. Lodge’s Library, 2013).
Likewise, the keyboarding lesson used a digital game intended for that purpose, and the lesson
on search skills used a set of tutorials with games that are discretely divided by skill and concept.
On the other hand, the choice of Scratch was an interesting one for mouse skill practice because
it provides a contextual basis for practicing such skills. However, it is unclear if the students
76

were given a goal to create something during the lesson. Lesson length varied, though all fit
when the time frame of a single class period.
Classroom-integrated instruction. Lessons designed for classroom-integrated instruction
also included objectives that focused on skills practice (e.g., spelling, reading, math facts) and
used digital games such as Sumdog (sumdog.com) and Starfall (starfall.com) that were
developed for that purpose. However, there were a greater variety of lessons described in terms
suggestive of 21st century learning (e.g., collaborate, create, research). Two lessons stand out in
particular because both were designed by TLs. One TL designed a lesson that had students create
a product in Minecraft (Mojang, 2009) that represented their knowledge of a composer or
explorer they were researching. Another TL used a city-building game (not specified) to teach
students the process of identifying a goal and prioritizing resources to achieve it. Both lessons
took longer than a single class period (days or weeks). Both lessons also provide examples of the
role TLs play in integrating multiple literacies into classroom curricula.
There were notable differences between the types of lessons and digital games used in
library instruction and classroom-integrated instruction in this study, with a greater trend toward
isolated skills practice in library instruction lessons. Similar uses of digital games have been
found among classroom teachers, who tend to lean heavily on drill and practice (Becker, 1991;
Maddux, Johnson, & Willis, 1992; Niederhauser & Stoddart, 2001). Time may be one factor that
impacts TLs’ choices of digital games for library instruction. TLs’ typically operate on a flexible
scheduling basis to be available for students at their point of need (McGregor, 2002, 2006). This
may make library-specific lesson planning more challenging, possibly prompting TLs to focus
more heavily on simple digital games that promote practice of isolated skills in a short period of
77

time. On the other hand, a fixed schedule (e.g., once a week) may prompt TLs to choose digital
games supportive of isolated skills practice that can be taught in a single class period.
Another factor may be in the nature of library skills themselves. While using the school
library and its resources requires certain sets of skills, those skills are almost always applied in
the context of a classroom-related learning goal; hence, the focus on collaboration models of
school librarianship (Loertscher, 1988; Montiel-Overall, 2005). That concept is welldemonstrated in the two examples of TLs who used Minecraft (Mojang, 2009) and a citybuilding game to integrate multiple literacies into classroom instruction. Without collaborative
relationships with teachers though, TLs may perceive having little choice but to teach library
skills in isolation.
In that respect, choice of digital games becomes even more important for designing
digital game-based lessons for library skills. Specifically, the use of roleplaying or strategy
games would be particularly beneficial for addressing library skills outside of the classroom
because they situate learning within problem solving contexts. Gaming experience with more
complex digital games may be an important factor in proving their value to TLs for promoting
the metacognitive processes that information literacy requires. In fact, the TL who used the citybuilding game was one of the few survey participants who had indicated playing strategy games
frequently (> 5 hours per week).
Characteristics of successful lessons. All of the TLs who used digital games in lessons
agreed that the games had enhanced the learning process. Analysis of responses to what made the
lesson successful found mention of engagement, enjoyment, and interactivity most frequently,
and mention of learning least frequently. Those who did mention learning generally perceived
78

the digital games as effective learning tools, with the exception of one TL who “didn’t see much
evidence of learning” in using a game to teach students book shelf order. Table 13 displays TLs’
responses from the survey. Findings suggest that TLs may be more likely to perceive the value of
digital games as engaging and motivating to students, rather than recognizing the cognitive
learning benefits from gameplay itself. Additionally, TLs’ uses of digital games, especially in the
design role for library instruction, trended toward simple drill and practice games, which may
also impact their perceptions about the affordances of digital games as learning tools.

Changes to lessons. When asked what they would change about the lesson, many of the
TLs either left the answer space blank or indicated that they would make no changes at all,
implying that their lessons were successful. Of the 26 TLs who did mention changes, they
invariably described wanting more time for preparation, practice or gameplay; more challenge;
or more learning components added to the lesson. Critically reflecting on their lessons to identify
changes for improvement may be an indication of those TLs’ intentions to use digital games

79

more frequently and with greater deliberation. Table 14 displays representative responses from
TLs who would make changes to the lessons.

Wanting more time for preparation, practice and play suggests that TLs perceive the use
of digital games as valuable learning tools for their students. Wanting more challenge suggests
that TLs may recognize the need for more complexity in their digital game-based lessons, which
may lead them to seek out more complex games for future lessons. Wanting to add more
components to the lessons, such as turn-taking and application to real-life, suggests that TLs are
willing to experiment with digital game-based lessons to support 21st century learning.
Research Question Two
Question 2: What Are TLs’ Pedagogical Beliefs?
To test the overarching hypothesis that TLs represent a similar population to teachers,
TLs’ pedagogical beliefs were measured using item J3 of the TLC survey. It was important to
understand TLs’ pedagogical beliefs because they may act as a second-order barrier to digital
game adoption. Behaviorist beliefs are more likely to prevent TLs’ from adopting digital games,
since teachers’ perceptions about the relevance of technology to student learning are highly
80

correlated with their technology practices (Ertmer, et al., 2012). Likewise, constructivist beliefs
may increase the likelihood that TLs will adopt digital games.
In the survey, TLs were asked to respond to five different bipolar statements, located in
Appendix D, to measure their pedagogical beliefs using a continuum scale of 1 to 5 for each
statement. Statements were combined into a single scale measure, with a minimum total score of
10 and a maximum total score of 25. A higher score indicated more constructivist beliefs about
teaching. The mean score of the scale was 18.09 (SD = 2.97), indicating an overall constructivist
philosophy among the TL sample population. This reflects the findings on classroom teachers,
who also tend to also share constructivist philosophies of teaching (Ravitz, Becker & Wong,
2000), and confirms the overarching hypothesis.
Research Question Three
Question 3: How Do TLs’ Uses of Digital Games Reflect Their Pedagogical Beliefs?
Research has shown that teachers’ pedagogical beliefs and technology practices in the
classroom do not always align (Ravitz, Becker & Wong, 2000), which may also be true for TLs.
To test this research question, TLs’ lessons were evaluated using criteria from Ertmer et al.’s
(2012) Categories of Classroom Practice. Only TL-designed lessons were included to eliminate
the possibility of any influence by teachers on lesson design when TLs functioned as
collaborators or facilitators. Two non-digital game lessons were omitted, resulting in a total of 18
lessons for this analysis. The results were then compared to the mean score of the teaching
philosophy scale for the digital game subgroup, which was slightly higher than the mean score
for the overall group (M = 3.71, SD = .62). Table 15 displays the results of the evaluation of the
TL-designed lessons.

Based on criteria from Ertmer et al.’s (2012) framework, as shown in Appendix F, TLs’
game-based lessons were evaluated and categorized as student-centered (constructivist) or
teacher-centered (behaviorist). At first glance, it appears that the findings are fairly evenly split
between teacher-centered and student-centered digital game practices. However, with the Shelver
(Mrs. Lodge’s Library, 2013) game representing seven lessons described by TLs, the findings
indicate a two to one slant toward teacher-centered practices among TLs. There appears to be a
discrepancy between TLs’ pedagogical beliefs, which are constructivist, and TLs’ digital game
practices, which are behaviorist. This discrepancy also exists among classroom teachers
(Andrew, 2007; Palak & Walls, 2009; Ravitz, Becker & Wong, 2000) supporting the overarching
hypothesis of this study.
Interestingly, the TLs who designed library instruction were more teacher-centered than
those who designed classroom-integrated instruction. Becker and Riel (1999) made a similar
observation with teachers, of whom “own-classroom oriented teachers” showed more behaviorist
practices than “collaborative classroom teachers” did. It appears that this same phenomenon
holds true for TLs, further supporting the overarching hypothesis that TLs and classroom
teachers are similar populations. Based on this observation, the collaboration model of school
librarianship may be beneficial for both TLs and teachers by moving both groups away from
teacher-centered practices toward student-centered ones. In fact, the effects of the collaboration
model may have been illustrated in this study based on the observation that TLs designed less
than half the lessons reported, and the classroom-integrated instruction—where TLs worked with
teachers in some capacity—included a greater number of student-centered lesson examples.

83

It is possible that TLs’ lesson topics and digital game choices were prompted by the need
to implement library instruction within a fixed class period, suggesting that time was at least one
factor affecting TLs’ digital game practices. Considering that TLs work with many students
throughout the day, and often on a flexible scheduling basis, time may in fact be what Ertmer
(1999) described as a barriers threshold for TLs. Barriers thresholds provide a way to explain the
discrepancies between teachers’ beliefs and their classroom practices. In the case of TLs,
perceptions about lack of time for library instructional practices may present as too great a
barrier for even the most constructivist believing TL to overcome.
On the other hand, TLs’ perceptions about time as a barrier may differ when
collaborating with teachers in the classroom. In fact, the flexible scheduling of TLs was
developed to create more time for collaborative opportunities between TLs and teachers, though
logistics can make it difficult to implement (McGregor, 2002, 2006). The Minecraft (Mojang,
2009) and city-building game lessons are examples of such collaboration. This finding suggests
that TLs may have more time than classroom teachers for lesson planning in the context of a
flexible schedule, making the collaborative role of TLs all the more significant in terms of digital
game adoption.
Research Question Four
What Barriers Do TLs Perceive for Using Digital Games?
To determine if TLs share similar perceptions about barriers to digital game use as
teachers, the TATG survey was used to measure 11 attitude subscales representing first- and
second-order barriers to digital game use. Attitudes were measured on a Likert-type scale of 1 to
5, with mean scores closer to 1 representing negative attitudes and mean scores closer to 5
84

representing positive attitudes. Cronbach’s reliability analysis was run on the total scale, overall
first-order scale, overall second-order scale, and on each subscale. Reliability was found to be
acceptable, with the exception of four subscales: access (α = .64), policies (α = .63), reliability (α
= .63) and incentives (α = .37).
While the TLs did tend to perceive that digital games are beneficial learning tools, firstand second-order barriers were evident. TLs’ first-order barriers were lack of support, lack of
time, school policy and lack of budget (though they do not feel games are too expensive). TLs’
Second-order barriers were lack of incentives and the drawbacks of digital games. Table 16
displays the TATG survey results.

Findings on first-order barriers for TLs were similar to those for classroom teachers,
namely lack of time, lack of infrastructure and lack of support (Ertzberger, 2009; Gros, 2003;
Ketelhut and Schifter, 2011; Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014). There were also similarities between TLs
and classroom teachers regarding second-order barriers. While the TLs generally agreed with
85

statements about the benefits of digital games, findings showed that the TLs also perceived
drawbacks to using digital games, particularly that “games are not aligned with the testing used
in schools.” This suggests that TLs may see curricular connections to digital games, but are not
sure how to implement them successfully within the confines of curriculum standards. Barbour,
Evans, and Toker (2009) found the same to be true for pre-service teachers.
Access subscale. In the access subscale, TLs clearly agreed with one statement: “Schools
don’t have games for teacher librarians (TLs) to use” (M = 2.77). In the sample, 42.2% (n = 49)
agreed or strongly agreed with this statement, while 30.2% (n = 35) took a neutral position.
Those findings suggest that while TLs may not see access to technology within the school as a
barrier to digital game use, they may either be unsure, or do not believe that schools have an
adequate selection of digital games that can be currently used by TLs. Reliability of the access
subscale was not acceptable (α = .64), so the findings may not be an accurate reflection of TLs’
perceptions about access to digital games.
Policies subscale. In the policies subscale, the only statement that the TLs strongly
disagreed with was, “I don’t know what the school policy is on use of games” (M = 4.16). In the
sample, 81.2% of participants (n = 95) disagreed or strongly disagreed with that statement,
suggesting they were well-versed in school policies regarding game use. Negative perceptions
toward the other statements indicate TLs’ tendencies to perceive blocking controls (M = 2.72)
and safety policies (M = 2.48) as barriers to the use of games in schools. Reliability of the
policies subscale was not acceptable (α = .63). However, with removal of the statement “I don’t
know what the school policy is on use of games,” reliability increases (α = .72), confirming that
TLs tended to perceive school policies as a barrier to digital game use.
86

Budget subscale. In the budget subscale, responses were fairly spread out among the
statements, suggesting some disagreement and perhaps reflecting TLs’ own budgetary
experiences. The only statement within this subscale that most of the TLs strongly disagreed
with was the statement that “games are too expensive to use” (M = 3.63). In the sample, 64.1%
of participants (n = 75) disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement. Results suggest that
while school budget is possibly a barrier for purchasing digital games, TLs did not necessarily
view digital games themselves as being too expensive.
Support subscale. In the support subscale, lack of support from technology personnel (M
= 2.97) and lack of support from administrators (M = 2.95) were viewed as the greatest barriers.
Parental support (M = 3.12) of games was perceived as less of a barrier. The only statement in
the support subscale that did not present as a barrier by the majority was the statement, “if
technology broke down, I could not get help” (M = 3.58). In the sample, 63.3% (n = 74)
disagreed or strongly disagreed with that statement. Because many TLs act in the capacity of
technology coordinators at their schools, those results might be an indicator of TLs’ confidence
in their own troubleshooting skills.
Difficulty subscale. In the difficulty subscale, TLs tended not to perceive games as too
hard to play (M = 3.63), too complicated to use (M = 3.85), or too complex to learn (M = 3.69).
Those findings may be a reflection of TLs’ experience with technology as a part of their regular
job duties. For example, TLs work with library cataloging systems and databases on a daily
basis, so are accustomed to interacting with technology.
Time subscale. In the time subscale, lack of enough time to implement games (M = 2.84)
was seen as the greatest barrier by TLs. In the sample, 39.2% (n = 46) disagreed or strongly
87

disagreed with the statement, “there is enough time to implement games in a typical day.”
Another 32.5% (n = 38) took a neutral position on that statement, possibly reflecting an
uncertainty due to lack of experience with game implementation. The only statement in the time
subscale that TLs’ did not perceive as a barrier was the statement, “games take too long to learn”
(M = 3.73). In the sample, 66.6% (n = 78) disagreed or strongly disagreed with that statement,
possibly reflecting their level of comfort with using technology, a consistent finding within the
survey results.
Reliability subscale. In the reliability subscale, a large number of neutral responses on
the statements resulted in a skew toward the middle. However, when eliminating the neutral
responses altogether, the statements suggest that the TLs did not perceive reliability as a barrier
to using digital games. This may be a reflection of their level of comfort with using technology.
Reliability of the reliability subscale was not acceptable (α = .63), so the findings may not be an
accurate reflection of TLs’ perceptions about digital game reliability.
Incentives subscale. In the incentives subscale, while more than half the TLs (n = 67,
57.2%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement, “using games would not be worth it,”
they consistently agreed that there are no incentives or awards in place for using digital games in
schools. Interestingly, responses to the statement, “if my school rewarded the use of games, I
might consider it” were largely neutral (n = 56, 47.9%), suggesting that the use of rewards and
incentives to use digital games may not necessarily increase digital game use among TLs.
Reliability of the incentives subscale was not acceptable (α = .37), so the findings may not be an
accurate reflection of TLs’ perceptions about incentives to using digital games.

88

Confidence subscale. In the confidence subscale, TLs tended to agree with statements
relating to comfort level and confidence of using digital games in school. However, more than
half agreed or strongly agreed with the statements, “one reason TLs don’t use games is that they
are not trained for it in school” (n = 60, 51.3%) and “I think TLs should be taught about using
games in school” (n = 76, 60%). This suggests that while TLs are very confident in their
technical abilities to use digital games, they may be less confident about how to integrate digital
games into learning.
Benefits subscale. In the benefits subscale, out of 21 statements, only one statement
revealed a strong consensus of disagreement. Almost half of the TLs (n = 55, 47%) disagreed or
strongly disagreed with the statement, “when you play a game, you don’t have to worry about
failing” (M = 2.79). This may be due to the fact that most of the TLs in this study reported little
to no personal gaming experience, so the concept of continuous feedback for strategy
improvement may not have occurred to them.
Drawbacks subscale. In the drawbacks subscale, 80.4% of participants (n = 94) disagreed
or strongly disagreed with the statement, “there is no educational content in games” (M = 4.01).
However, results from other statements in the subscale suggest concerns about digital game use,
most notably in the areas of alignment to tests (M = 2.62), and inappropriate content in games
(M = 2.62). These results may reflect TLs’ perceptions about school policies (e.g., curriculum
policies, filtering policies) as a barrier to digital game use.
Research Question Five
Question 5. How do TLs’ pedagogical beliefs shape perceptions of barriers to using digital
games?
89

Since pedagogical beliefs can present as second-order barriers themselves, this study
sought to determine if TLs’ pedagogical beliefs were significantly related to their perceptions of
barriers to using digital games. To test this research question, a Pearson product-moment
correlation was first calculated to evaluate relationships between the variables.
As shown in Table 17, there was a significant positive correlation between TLs’
pedagogical beliefs and overall attitudes toward barriers to using digital games (r = .303).
Significant positive correlations at the p <. 01 level were also found between TLs’ pedagogical
beliefs and attitudes toward first and second-order barriers to using digital games.

Further analysis using independent-samples t-tests was conducted to identify any
statistically significant differences in perceptions of barriers to using digital games in TLs with
constructivist pedagogical beliefs versus TLs with behaviorist pedagogical beliefs. Total overall
barriers, first- and second-order barriers, and barriers’ subscales were tested against two groups
of TLs representing behaviorist beliefs and constructivist beliefs. Groups were determined by
categorizing teaching philosophy scores such that those with scores of 20 or greater were
considered constructivist (n = 29) and those with scores of 16 or less were considered behaviorist

90

(n = 26). Middle scores were not included in the analysis. Findings from the independent
samples t-tests were used to test the hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1: TLs with behaviorist beliefs are more likely to perceive the presence
of overall barriers than do TLs with constructivist beliefs.
As shown in Table 18, TLs’ perceptions of total overall barriers to using digital games
indicated a statistically significant difference for TLs with constructivist beliefs (M = 3.63, SD =
.36) and TLs with behaviorist beliefs (M = 3.36, SD = .39); t (53) = -2.66, p = .01. These results
showed that the TL group with constructivist beliefs tended to perceive fewer overall barriers to
using digital games than did the TL group with behaviorist beliefs. Findings support the
alternative hypothesis, and the null hypothesis was rejected.

Hypothesis 2: TLs with behaviorist beliefs are more likely to perceive the presence
of first-order barriers than do TLs with constructivist beliefs.
91

Comparison of TLs’ perceptions of overall first-order barriers showed a statistically
significant difference in the scores for TLs with constructivist beliefs (M = 3.71, SD = .52) and
TLs with behaviorist beliefs (M = 3.35, SD = .58); t (59) = -3.11, p = .003. At the p-value level,
differences between the two groups were bigger for first-order barriers as a whole than they were
for overall barriers. This suggests that the TL group with behaviorist beliefs tended to perceive
external barriers as considerably more difficult to overcome than did the TL group with
constructivist beliefs.
For subscale first-order barriers, significant differences in perceptions were found on all
first-order barriers, with the exception of school policies and budget, indicating that the
differences detected on the overall scale were not attributable to the undue influence of one or
two items. Both groups tended to perceive school policies and budget as barriers. Such shared
perceptions may indicate that TLs believe those barriers to be fixed or out of their control.
It should be noted that because a factor analysis has not yet been conducted on the TATG
survey, it is still undetermined whether all statement on the survey are valid, and to what extent
each item loads on each construct. Therefore, results at the subscale barrier level could be subject
to greater change with a modified survey. However, for overall first-order barriers, findings
support the alternative hypothesis, and the null hypothesis was rejected.
Hypothesis 3: TLs with behaviorist beliefs are more likely to perceive the presence
of second-order barriers than do TLs with constructivist beliefs.
Comparison of TLs’ perceptions of second-order barriers showed a statistically
significant difference in the scores for TLs with constructivist beliefs (M = 3.37, SD = .37) and
TLs with behaviorist beliefs (M = 3.15, SD = .49); t (58) = -2.00, p = .05. Though, at the p-value
92

level, differences between the groups were not as statistically significant as for first-order
barriers. While the TL group with behaviorist beliefs tended to perceive more second-order
barriers than the TL group with constructivist beliefs, both tended to perceive more overall
second-order barriers than first-order barriers.
For subscale second-order barriers, significant differences in perceptions between the two
groups were only found for drawbacks, suggesting that the differences detected for second-order
barriers were attributable to perceptions about drawbacks to using digital games. The behaviorist
group perceived more drawbacks to using digital games than did the constructivist group.
Interestingly, findings showed that both groups shared similar perceptions about the
positive benefits of digital games. This may be due to the largely constructivist beliefs of the
survey sample. The group categorized as behaviorist for the purpose of this analysis still may
have held some constructivist beliefs, considering that the cutoff score for that group was 16,
which at the high end falls in the middle of the teaching philosophy scale. The voluntary nature
of the study could also explain these results, as TLs were able to self-select their participation.
As a result, the survey may have primarily attracted TL participants with an interest in using
digital games.
As was noted with the results on first-order barriers, a factor analysis has not yet been
conducted on the TATG survey. Therefore, results at the subscale barrier level could be subject
to greater change with a modified survey. However, for overall second-order barriers, findings
support the alternative hypothesis, and the null hypothesis was rejected.

CHAPTER V
SUMMARY, DISCUSSION, AND CONCLUSIONS
Summary of the Study
The purpose of this mixed method study was to extend the research on barriers to
technology adoption (e.g., Ertmer, 1999) by classroom teachers to include digital game adoption
by TLs. Research on barriers to digital game adoption, or more broadly, technology adoption, is
based on the theory of educational change (Fullan & Stiegelbauer, 1991). This study attempted to
determine TLs’ beliefs and practices about digital games as 21st century learning tools, to
examine similarities and differences with those of classroom teachers, and to see if and how TLs’
pedagogical beliefs impacted their perceptions of barriers toward digital game adoption. The
overarching hypothesis of the study was that because TLs are a similar population to classroom
teachers, the study’s results should reflect the results of previous research on classroom teachers.
The TATG Survey (Van Eck, 2013) was used in this study to measure TLs’ perceptions
of barriers toward the adoption and integration of digital games in K—12 settings. The TATG
consists of 83 Likert-type scale statements comprising 11 barrier subscales about first- (i.e.,
external) and second- (i.e., internal) order barriers to using digital games for learning.
Additionally, TLs’ pedagogical beliefs were measured using a set of five bipolar statements from
section J3 of the Teaching, Learning and Computing National Survey (1998). TLs were also
asked a series of open-ended questions about their experiences with using digital games in a
lesson.
94

The study included 221 participants, with 117 participants fully completing the survey.
Participation was voluntary and participants were recruited through several professional library
e-mail discussion lists. Demographic data, including gender, age, and qualifications, showed that
the sample population was an adequate representation of the TL population as a whole. This
study sought to answer five research questions:
1.

How are TLs using digital games?

2.

What are TLs’ pedagogical beliefs?

3.

How do TLs’ uses of digital games reflect their pedagogical beliefs?

4.

What barriers do TLs perceive for using digital games?

5.

How do TLs’ pedagogical beliefs shape perceptions of barriers to using digital games?
Question one was answered qualitatively by cross-tabulating open-ended responses

around categorizing theme by common themes (e.g., type of lesson, role of TL) relating to TLs’
experiences with using digital games in a lesson. Question two was answered quantitatively by
identifying the summative score from the statements on TLs’ pedagogical beliefs. Question three
was answered qualitatively by using Ertmer et al.’s (2012) Categories of Classroom Practices
framework to assess if TLs’ digital game practices reflected their pedagogical beliefs..
Question four was answered quantitatively by examining the individual first- and secondorder barrier subscales, as well as the combined score from each of the subscales. Question five
was answered quantitatively by recoding the data from research question two into a new variable
consisting of two groups of pedagogical beliefs based on extreme scores: behaviorist (scores of
16 and below) and constructivist (scores of 20 and above). Middle scores were not included in

95

the analysis. A range of quantitative measures of central tendency and inferential statistics were
used to test the new variable against the data from research question four.
Discussion of the Findings
Research Question One: How TLs are Using Digital Games
Findings showed that approximately 40% of the TLs surveyed had offered library gaming
initiatives, such as gaming clubs, gaming events, or gaming collections. TLs largely indicated the
purpose of their gaming initiatives as recreational or award-based in nature. This may mean that
TLs recognize the popularity of digital games with students and are thus willing to provide
access to games in their libraries to support students’ leisurely interests. After all, one of the
purposes of the library is to support the social or recreational needs of patrons (Adams, 2009a;
Buchanan & Elzen, 2012; Nicholson, 2010; Werner, 2013). These findings support the argument
that the school library is an ideal place to promote recreational gaming as a literacy activity in
the same way that the library promotes recreational reading as a literacy activity. Gaming
initiatives also allow TLs to support the concept of the library as a Third Space (Elmborg, 2011)
by serving as a place to bridge students’ out-of-school literacy practices with their in-school
literacy practices through digital gameplay (Gee, 2007; Squire, 2005; Steinkuehler, 2007).
Approximately the same number of TLs who had offered gaming initiatives had used
digital games in a lesson to meet literacy or learning goals, suggesting that TLs’ uses of digital
games in library programs and services may transfer over to interest in using digital game-based
lessons. TLs used digital games for both library instruction and classroom-integrated instruction,
including math, language arts and social studies. In over half of the digital game lessons
described, TLs designed the lesson or collaborated with a teacher in planning and implementing
96

the lesson, suggesting that TLs are taking considerable initiative in using digital games as
learning tools. When TLs served in the capacity of facilitator (i.e., support), they cited such roles
as trainer, game facilitator, or materials provider. These findings reflect the primary job duties of
the TL participants in this study, namely teaching research skills, collaborating with teachers to
integrate multiple literacies into teaching and learning, providing professional development
opportunities, and evaluating existing and emerging technologies. Based on these results, it can
be argued that TLs are in a unique position to support and promote digital games on a schoolwide level as a function of their role in supporting 21st century learning (Ballard, 2009). This
sets TLs apart from their classroom colleagues.
There was a trend toward digital game uses that supported isolated skills practice in TLs’
library instruction lessons, and lack of time may be one reason for choosing those types of
games. In fact, when asked what they would change about the lesson, “more time” and “more
opportunity” for students to play were common answers. Classroom teachers also tend to lean
heavily on games that emphasize drill and practice, in no small part due to the fact that drill and
practice games take less time to play (Fishman, Riconscente, Snider, Tsai, & Plass, 2014;
Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014). The edutainment industry further supports the use of drill and practice
games by making them readily available and easy to implement within a limited timeframe.
TLs’ digital game uses may also be reflective of their scheduling. TLs typically operate
on a flexible scheduling basis to be available for students at their point of need (McGregor, 2002,
2006). This may make library-specific lesson planning more challenging, prompting TLs to
focus more heavily on simple digital games that promote practice of isolated skills in a short
period of time. A fixed schedule may have the same effect if TLs only see students on an
97

intermittent basis (e.g., once a week) and for a short period of time. Regardless, isolated library
skills are of little value to students if they are not practiced within the context of a classroomrelated learning goal.
On the other hand, flexible scheduling may increase the likelihood of teacher-librarian
collaboration that leads to classroom-integrated instruction, which is one reason why the AASL
(2014) advocates for it. This was well-demonstrated in the two examples of TLs who took on
roles as lesson designers to integrate Minecraft (Mojang, 2009) and a city-building game into
classroom instruction. In light of those examples, TLs’ flexible scheduling may be of particular
value to teachers in increasing the probability of using complex digital games in the classroom.
In other words, if TLs are available for collaboration with teachers on a flexible basis, they may
have more time for lesson planning that focuses on digital games that support complex 21st
century skills (e.g., multiple literacies, critical thinking, problem solving).
Finally, TLs’ responses to what made the lesson successful were of notable interest. In
particular, very few TLs mentioned anything at all about learning. Most of the TLs responded
with observations about the students’ experiences with the games instead—experiences such as
motivation and engagement. TLs largely felt that students had fun during the lessons and enjoyed
interacting with the games. One TL mentioned that her students enjoyed the shelf order game,
Shelver (Mrs. Lodge’s Library, 2013), though she found little evidence that learning took place.
These findings may mean that learning did not occur in many of the games and therefore was not
observed as a successful outcome. Conversely, TLs’ observations of students’ motivation and
engagement during gameplay may reflect their enthusiasm for using digital games. Research on
classroom teachers’ formative assessment practices with games found that teachers who checked
98

on students’ engagement and motivation during the assessment process were the most frequent
and enthusiastic users of digital games (Fishman, et al., 2014).
Research Question Two: TLs’ Pedagogical Beliefs
Overall, the TLs in this study tended to hold constructivist beliefs. This is not an
unexpected finding, as the library profession today is focused on supporting 21st century skills
such as digital and information literacy (AASL, 2007; ISTE-SIGMS Executive Advocacy
Committee, 2010), skills that require constructivist teaching practices such as guided inquiry
(Kulthau, 2010).
This finding also supports the overarching hypothesis that TLs and classroom teachers
are similar populations, since classroom teachers also tend to share constructivist philosophies of
teaching (Ravitz, Becker & Wong, 2000). It is likely that both groups form such pedagogical
beliefs through similar means, such as personal experience as a student, pre-service and
professional development training, and teaching experience (Raths, 2001; Prestridge, 2012).
Digital games are 21st century learning tools (Foreman, 2004; Gee, 2007; Prensky, 2007,
2008), and a constructivist philosophy is necessary for supporting and promoting them within the
teaching and learning process (Shute, Rieber, & Van Eck, 2012). Because the library profession
focuses heavily on 21st century learning, and because TLs and teachers tend to share
constructivist beliefs, TLs are well-suited for the task of supporting and promoting digital games
in schools in collaboration with teachers. Professional training that uses models of teacherlibrarian collaboration is a standard in the core curriculum of school librarianship programs
(ALA/AASL, 2010), so TLs are already prepared to take on roles as collaborators. In fact, the
potential benefits of teacher-librarian collaboration on digital game-based instruction was
99

revealed in this study’s findings on TLs’ digital game uses, where digital game choices and
lesson descriptions for classroom-integrated instruction were more frequently suggestive of 21st
century learning (e.g., collaboration, communication, research) than were descriptions of library
instruction.
Research Question Three: TLs’ Digital Game Practices and Pedagogical Beliefs
TLs’ digital game practices tended to be teacher-centered, reflecting the findings from
research question one about their digital game uses. For library instruction in particular, of which
the game-based lessons were entirely designed by TLs, isolated skills practice (e.g., shelf order,
keyboarding, search skills) was a predominant lesson type, resulting in choices of drill and
practice games (e.g., Order in the Library). Drill and practice games are designed on behaviorist
principles (Niederhauser & Stoddart, 2001; Shute, Rieber, & Van Eck, 2012) rather than
constructivist principles, so the findings suggest a discrepancy between TLs’ pedagogical beliefs,
which are largely constructivist or student-centered, and their digital game practices, which are
more behaviorist or teacher-centered.
This discrepancy also exists among classroom teachers (Andrew, 2007; Becker & Ravitz,
1999; Lim & Chai, 2008; Liu, 2011; Palak & Walls, 2009; Ravitz, Becker & Wong, 2000),
further supporting the overall hypothesis that TLs and classroom teachers are similar
populations. Ertmer et al. (2012) described discrepancies between teachers’ pedagogical beliefs
and their technology practices as barriers thresholds, and speculated that they may be the result
of teachers’ other beliefs (first- and second-order barriers) holding greater weight when making
decisions about technology practices in the classroom. Some TLs may perceive that certain

100

barriers such as lack of time, lack of support, or lack of infrastructure are too difficult to
overcome in order to use digital games.
On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the TL-designed lessons (n = 18) analyzed
for this research question made up less than half of the game-based lessons described in the
survey (n = 47). In the rest of the lessons—all of which fell into the category of classroomintegrated instruction—TLs worked with teachers in the capacity of collaborating on lesson
design or in facilitating the lesson described (i.e., providing technology support). A greater
number of student-centered lesson examples (i.e., suggestive of 21st century learning) were
found in that category. This may be an indicator of the benefits of the collaboration model of
school librarianship, though further research is needed to make such a determination.
A lack of training and awareness about the affordances of digital games might also
impact TLs’ technology practices. Research has found a lack of adequate professional
development to be the case for classroom teachers, many of whom are self-taught or who rely on
informal peer-to-peer methods to learn about digital games (Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014). Providing
TLs with adequate professional development opportunities or pre-service training in digital game
integration could be the key to expanding their use of digital games for student-centered
learning. Takeuchi and Vaala (2014) similarly concluded that classroom teachers would benefit
from pre-service training on digital game integration, as well as greater promotion of online
resources for digital game-based teaching. In light of TLs’ own job duties of providing
professional development opportunities, collaborating with teachers to support multiple
literacies, and evaluating existing and emerging technologies, adequate training of TLs in digital

101

game integration may serve as an additional catalyst for improving classroom teachers’ uses of
digital games.
Research Question Four: TLs Perceptions of Barriers to Using Digital Games
TLs tended to perceive lack of time, lack of support, lack of budget and school policies as
first-order barriers to digital game use. They tended to perceive the drawbacks of digital games
(e.g., not aligned to tests, do not teach textbook content) and incentives to using digital games as
second-order barriers. Classroom teachers perceive comparable first- and second-order barriers,
thus supporting the overall hypothesis that the two groups are similar populations.
Like the TLs in this study, research has found that lack of time, lack of infrastructure
(e.g., budget, policy) and lack of support are commonly perceived first-order barriers among
classroom teachers (Ertzberger, 2009; Gros, 2003; Ketelhut and Schifter, 2011; Takeuchi &
Vaala, 2014). It is not surprising that TLs perceive similar first-order barriers as their classroom
counterparts. Because both groups are subject to the same external institutional constraints, it is
likely that they are similarly affected by any resulting limitations, though there may be some
differences in the way TLs are affected by time due to differences in scheduling. While teachers’
schedules tend to be clearly structured within the confines of their classrooms, TLs’ schedules
tend to be flexible, requiring movement in and out of the library, between classrooms, and
sometimes between multiple campus libraries. This may mean that TLs perceive having even
less time than their classroom colleagues in preparing and implementing digital game-based
lessons for library instruction. On the other hand, the purpose of flexible scheduling (at least
theoretically) is to provide TLs with more time to plan and prepare for classroom-integrated

102

instruction, which may be of benefit to digital game-based lessons. Further research should
examine these differences.
There are also similarities between TLs and classroom teachers regarding second-order
barriers. Lack of curricular relevance is a widely cited second-order barrier for classroom
teachers (Bourgonjon et al., 2013; De Grove, Bourgonjon, & Van Looy, 2012; Gros, 2003;
Kenny & Gunter, 2001; Proctor & Marks, 2013). While TLs tended to agree that digital games
are beneficial learning tools, they also tended to perceive drawbacks to using digital games,
particularly that “games are not aligned with the testing used in schools.” This suggests that
while TLs may see the value of digital games as learning tools, they may be unsure about how to
implement them successfully within the confines of curriculum standards. Takeuchi and Vaala
(2014) recommend the establishment of “an industry-wide framework for describing and
evaluating educational games” (p. 6) for the purpose of facilitating classroom teachers’ abilities
to identify digital games that best align to learning standards, units and lesson plans. This type of
framework would also benefit TLs in their roles as teachers of research skills, teachercollaborators, and evaluators of existing and emerging technologies.
In this study, TLs also cited incentives as a barrier to digital game use. However, it is
unclear whether they perceived lack of incentives as a barrier to digital game use or the use of
incentives as a barrier to digital game use. When looking at the data for each individual
statement in the incentives construct, it appeared that TLs might view the idea of incentives as an
insult. This may simply mean that TLs are not motivated by rewards or incentives.
Research Question Five: TLs’ Pedagogical Beliefs and Barriers to Using Digital Games

103

There were significant differences in perceptions of barriers to using digital games
between the TL group with behaviorist beliefs and the TL group with constructivist beliefs.
Overall, TLs with behaviorist beliefs showed substantially more negative attitudes to digital
game use than TLs with constructivist beliefs, meaning that the behaviorist TLs perceived
greater barriers to using digital games. This also held true for perceptions about first-order and
second-order barriers separately. However, the findings on differences in degree of perception
between first- and second-order barriers were particularly interesting.
Behaviorist TLs tended to perceive greater first-order barriers to using digital games than
constructivist TLs. This suggests that constructivist TLs perceived first-order barriers as less
prevalent or more easily overcome than did behaviorist TLs. The extent of this observed
difference was unexpected because first-order barriers are external, with some existing on an
institutional level (e.g., budget, policy, technical support), and thus not under the direct control of
the individual. The findings suggest that, as a whole, constructivist TLs tended to perceive firstorder barriers as manageable hindrances in the use of digital games. This may mean that they
would be more willing to experiment with digital games as learning tools despite any external
barriers they might face. The same has been found true for constructivist classroom teachers,
who tend to perceive first-order barriers as smaller obstacles then behaviorist classroom teachers
(Ertmer et al., 2012).
As expected, behaviorist TLs tended to perceive more second-order barriers to using
digital games than constructivist TLs. However, both behaviorist and constructivist TLs tended
to perceive overall greater second-order barriers than they did first-order barriers as a whole.
This result was intriguing because second-order barriers are internal and may be overcome on an
104

individual level. Further examination of the second-order barriers revealed that both TL groups
perceived many of the same drawbacks to using digital games. Among the drawbacks, most TLs
tended to perceive that digital games are not “aligned with the testing used in schools” and do
not “teach any of the things in textbooks.” It is possible that the TLs’ responses to those
statements were a reflection of the influence of their institutions’ expectations on their
technology practices (Dwyer, et al., 1991; Yocam, 1996).
That is, with the growing focus by many school districts on standardized testing, TLs
may not feel they have much leeway in using digital games that do not clearly align to
curriculum standards. For example, digital games that are not produced specifically for education
may be overlooked by TLs if the school districts they work for expect all educational
technologies to adhere to curriculum standards—and perhaps be labeled as such. Similar findings
have been found among classroom teachers, who more frequently select digital games that are
labeled as educational rather than commercial, possibly because they are easier to align to
curriculum standards (Fishman, et al., 2014; Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014). These findings might also
be an indication of TLs’ general lack of experience with playing games, especially regarding
concerns about the “content of games” and that “games are too violent.” Research has found that
classroom teachers share similar concerns (Kirriemuir & McFarlane, 2004; Squire, 2003).
Interestingly, both the behaviorist and constructivist TLs perceived greater benefits of
using digital games. This might be the result of influence of recent media touting the learning
benefits of playing games like Minecraft (Barron, 2013; Ossola, 2015; Szafranski, 2014). It
might also be explained by the fact that the survey was self-selected and voluntary, thus

105

primarily attracting TLs who had some interest or knowledge about digital games as learning
tools—a limitation of this study’s design.
The findings for research question five imply that pedagogical beliefs themselves might
be a barrier to digital game use in TLs. Overall, the behaviorist TLs in this study perceived
significantly greater barriers to digital game use than did the constructivist TLs, suggesting that
behaviorist TLs would be less likely to use digital games as learning tools. Research on the
impact of classroom teachers’ pedagogical beliefs on perceptions about technology has drawn
similar conclusions (Ertmer, 2005), providing further evidence that TLs and classroom teachers
are indeed similar populations. Future research should identify the individual factors that impact
TLs’ pedagogical beliefs and to what extent those factors might impact their digital game
practices.
Implications for Practice
The findings from this study hold a number of implications for TLs as potential advocates
for digital games, and the implications are threefold. That is, implications exist on three levels:
the library level, the classroom level, and the school level. Implications for practice are also
dependent upon TLs having adequate training in digital game integration to improve their
abilities to recognize, recommend and implement digital games that support the higher-order
thinking skills that 21st century learning demands. Additional training might also help them
overcome some of the barriers they perceive to using digital games.
The Library Level
At the library level, TLs have the opportunity to build digital game collections, provide
technology for gameplay (e.g., game consoles), and offer gaming initiatives such as gaming
106

clubs or gaming events (e.g., International Games Day @ your library). Students benefit through
access to digital games that support 21st century literacy practices at an informal level. Digital
game access in the library creates a Third Space effect that enables TLs to connect students’
gaming practices with school-based literacy practices such as reading and information literacy
(Elmborg, 2011; Gee, 2007; Squire, 2005; Steinkuehler, 2007).
Like books, digital games are based on systems that must be understood for meaning
making (Apperley, 2010). TLs can use this connection to inspire students to check out library
books with themes and genres similar to the digital games they play (Adams, 2009a; Squire &
Steinkuehler, 2005). Connections between digital gameplay and information literacy practices
also exist. By providing students with access to digital games that support complex problem
solving skills (Hung and Van Eck, 2010), TLs are supporting the types of information seeking
behaviors and multimodal problem solving skills that are relevant to school-based research
practices (Adams 2009b).
The Classroom Level
One of the current roles of TLs is providing professional development to school
personnel. Research indicates a need for better training of classroom teachers on digital game
integration (Takeuchi & Vaala, 2014). TLs have the opportunity to fill this role by serving as the
trainers of teachers for digital game integration, thus benefitting digital game adoption in the
classroom. Additionally, as evaluators of emerging technologies, TLs would have the
opportunity to recommend the types of digital games that support 21st century learning. As
collaborators with teachers, TLs have the opportunity to support the kind of digital game
implementation in classrooms that promotes multiple literacies.
107

Teacher-librarian collaboration may be the key to digital game integration that supports
21st century learning at the classroom level. In this study, TLs’ uses of digital games in
classroom-integrated instruction were more reflective of 21st century learning when compared to
library instruction. This may be due to the affordances of flexible scheduling, or it may be the
result of collaboration itself, which tends to foster more constructivist teaching practices than
own-classroom orientation (Becker & Riel, 1999). Further research is needed to determine if
teacher-librarian collaboration increases the types of digital game uses that support 21st century
learning in the classroom.
The School Level
Some TLs serve on decision making committees that impact areas such as technology
planning and curriculum development, and there is evidence that some TLs perceive themselves
as having an impact on technology adoption at the school-wide level (School Library Journal
Research, 2013). This creates opportunities for TLs who are knowledgeable about the
affordances of digital games to advocate for and recommend digital games for integration into
the curriculum, which may result in greater administrative support of digital games at the schoolwide level.
While TLs’ multiple roles as teachers of research skills, teacher-collaborators, technology
evaluators, professional development trainers, and decision makers provides them with a
plethora of opportunities for supporting and promoting digital games, their perceptions of
barriers to using digital games may prevent them from doing so. The findings from this study
showed that TLs do recognize the benefit of using digital games, and are already taking a lead in
using them to support literacy and learning goals. However, findings also indicated specific
108

barriers that may prevent TLs from advocating for digital games. Lack of time, lack of support,
and lack of infrastructure were first-order barriers to using digital games. Lack of curricular
relevance was a second-order barrier; and behaviorist pedagogical beliefs may have also acted as
a second-order barrier for some TLs in the study. Overcoming these barriers is necessary in order
for TLs to promote and support digital game use in schools. The most effective solution for
overcoming first- and second-order barriers may be professional development for in-service TLs
and the addition of digital games integration courses for pre-service TLs. Researchers who study
classroom teachers’ digital game practices have made similar recommendations (Takeuchi &
Vaala, 2014; Van Eck, 2013, 2014).
Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research
The objective of this study was to investigate TLs’ attitudes about using digital games as
learning tools. Data analysis resulted in a number of significant findings. However, several
limitations exist for the study. A primary limitation of this study is that no prior research is
available on TLs’ attitudes about using digital games. This study was the first of its kind, with
the methodology based on research studies about classroom teachers’ attitudes toward digital
games. Hypotheses were grounded in the research on classroom teachers. While the results of
this study found that TLs do indeed share similar beliefs and attitudes about digital games as
their classroom counterparts, further research is warranted to build an evidence base specifically
on the TL population, as it is likely that they also differ in important ways.
One limitation of this study is that it used convenience sampling with voluntary
participation. While the demographic make-up of the study sample resulted in a good
representation of TLs as a group, the findings may not be representative of the general TL
109

population’s attitude about digital games. It is possible that the TLs who chose to participate in
the survey only represent a subgroup of TLs who have some knowledge, curiosity or interest
about digital games. It is also possible that the study did not capture a strong representation of
school districts across the country—questions about school district characteristics were not
included in the survey. Additional research using random sampling and is recommended to
determine the accuracy of this study’s findings.
Another limitation is that the survey did not include questions regarding TLs’ specific
technology roles within their schools as compared to other technology personnel, and how those
roles fit into the technology leadership picture within their schools and school districts. Future
research is needed to explore where TLs fit within the structure of technology leadership at both
the school and district level to identify how much impact TLs have on technology adoption at the
classroom and school-wide level.
A final limitation is that the construct validity of the TATG survey has not yet been
established, though it is in process. It is yet unknown whether a factor analysis will support the
subscales and constructs upon which the instrument is founded. The inclusion of items which are
found only weakly connected to the constructs could understate or overstate possible findings
about barriers. Data analysis will be rerun with the final, revised version of the scale in the near
future to establish if there are any differences in the findings.
Conclusions
This study extended the research on barriers to digital game adoption from classroom
teachers to TLs. Findings showed that TLs and classroom teachers share similar attitudes and
beliefs about using digital games as learning tools. In particular, both groups have identified lack
110

of time, lack of support and lack of infrastructure as external barriers to using digital games.
Both groups have identified lack of curricular relevance as an internal barrier to digital game
adoption. These findings support this study’s overarching hypothesis that TLs are similar to
classroom teachers in terms of attitudes and beliefs about using digital games.
Though perceptions of barriers to using digital games are similar for both populations,
reasons behind their perceptions may be different. In particular, TLs may diverge from
classroom teachers on reasons for perceiving lack of time as a barrier to using digital games due
to differences in scheduling (i.e., fixed versus flexible). Because of this, TLs may perceive lack
of time as a greater or lesser barrier depending on the type of instruction that students need—
library instruction or classroom-integrated instruction. Further research is warranted to delve into
how much weight TLs’ scheduling places on their perceptions about lack of time as a barrier to
using digital games. If future research does find a relationship between TLs’ scheduling and
perceptions about lack of time, implications may also apply to classroom teachers. For example,
if TLs on fixed schedules perceive greater barriers of time to using digital games than TLs on
flexible schedules, implications for classroom teachers on fixed schedules may also exist.
Both TLs and classroom teachers share similar constructivist pedagogical beliefs, and as
the research on classroom teachers has shown, their pedagogical beliefs do not always match
their technology practices. In this study, TLs tended to use digital games that supported isolated
skills practice for library instruction, which stood in stark contrast to the group’s largely held
constructivist beliefs about teaching. It is possible that these reflect institutional expectations. If
so, such institutional expectations may represent a different type of first-order barrier. Future
research, including possible inclusion of items about this on the TATG survey, should examine
111

this further. It is also possible that TLs diverge from classroom teachers in their reasons for using
teacher-centered digital game practices—reasons that may be reflective of their scheduling.
Further research is needed to determine such differences.
Because TLs and classroom teachers do share similar attitudes about using digital games,
TLs, like classroom teachers, may also benefit from training opportunities that teach them how to
implement digital games within a constructivist framework. Because TLs function in roles both
inside and outside the classroom, additional training will not only benefit TLs, but also the
classroom teachers with whom they collaborate and the administrators with whom they serve on
decision making committees. When TLs are knowledgeable about the affordances of digital
games, students will benefit in both the classroom and the library.

AASL’s Position Statement on CCSS
The American Association of School Librarians (AASL) acknowledges the National
Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center), the Council of Chief
State School Officers (CCSSO) and the state-led Common Core State Standards Initiative
in the development of the college- and career-readiness standards for English-language
arts and mathematics. We encourage our members to study these standards to determine
how school library programs support student success in meeting the Common Core State
Standards. AASL provided feedback on the grade level bands of the public draft K—12
standards, released on March 10, 2010.
As students strive to meet the rigor of the standards, certified school librarians will play
an essential part in ensuring that 21st-century information literacy skills, dispositions,
responsibilities and assessments are integrated throughout all curriculum areas. AASL
leads the way in addressing information literacy through the Standards for the 21stCentury Learner, and the Standards for the 21st-Century Learner in Action provide a
coherent framework of development from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. With the
integration of these standards to the Common Core State Standards, students have the
opportunity to be well-prepared as life-long learners facing the challenges of college and
careers.
The school library professional as leader, instructional partner, information specialist,
teacher, and program administrator is critical for teaching and learning in today’s schools.
The school librarian leads in building 21st-century skills by collaborating with classroom
114

teachers to design engaging learning tasks that integrate key critical thinking skills,
technology and information literacy skills with subject area content. In addition, the
school librarian provides a library program that contains multiple instructional avenues
and resources in various formats for the authentic application of information literacy
skills.
As these Common Core State Standards are implemented by the states, AASL stands
ready to participate in the process. A task force prepared a crosswalk from the AASL
Standards for the 21st-Century Learner to the Common Core State Standards. This
document guides our members as they collaborate with classroom teachers. We
encourage our members to examine the Common Core State Standards and be involved at
the state and local level in their implementation.

TLC Teacher’s Survey, Item J3 on Teaching Philosophy
Different teachers have described very different teaching philosophies to researchers. For each of
the following pairs of statements, check the box that best shows how closely your beliefs are to
each of the statements in a given pair. The closer your beliefs to a particular statement, the closer
the box you check.
"I mainly see my role as a facilitator. I try to
provide opportunities and resources for my
students to discover or construct concepts for
themselves."

"Students really won't learn the subject unless
you go over the material in a structured way.
It's my job to explain, to show the students
how to do the work, and to assign specific
projects."

"The most important part of instruction
is the content of the curriculum. That
content is the community’s judgment
about what children need to be able to
know and do."

"The most important part of instruction is
that it encourage ‘sense-making’ or
thinking among students. Content is
secondary."

"It is useful for students to become
familiar with many different ideas and
skills even if their understanding, for
now, is limited. Later, in college,
perhaps, they will learn these things in
more detail."

"It is better for students to master a few
complex ideas and skills well, and to
learn what deep understanding is all
about, even if the breadth of their
knowledge is limited until they are older."

"It is critical for students to become
interested in doing academic work,
interest and effort are more important
than the particular subject-matter they
are working on."

"While student motivation is certainly
useful, it should not drive what students
study. It is more important that students
learn the history, science, math and
language skills in their textbooks."

"It is a good idea to have all sorts of
activities going on in the classroom.
Some students might produce a scene
from a play they read. Others might
create a miniature version of the set. It’s
hard to get the logistics right, but the
successes are so much more important
than the failures."

"It’s more practical to give the whole class
the same assignment, one that has clear
directions, and one that can be done in
short intervals that match students’
attention spans and the daily class
schedule."

Appendix E
Open-Ended Questions on Using a Digital Game in a Lesson
For the following questions, think about your experience with using a digital game (e.g.,
videogame, PC game, console game, etc...) in a lesson to support literacy or learning.
1. Describe the digital game you used for the lesson.
2. Describe the lesson's topic or objective.
3. What role did you play in designing the lesson?
4. For whom was the lesson designed to be used? (Multiple choice: for the teacher, for the librarian,
both teacher and librarian)
5. How long did the lesson take?
6. What made the lesson successful?
7. What would you change about the lesson?

Research Questions and Methodology
Research Question
RQ1. How are TLs
using digital games?

Instrumentation
Open-ended
question
(Ertmer,
Gopalakrishnan, &
Ross, 2001)
TLC Teacher’s
Survey, J3

Methodology
Themes will be identified, coded and categorized.
Color coding will be used to represent different
themes.

RQ3. How do TLs’
uses of digital
games reflect their
pedagogical beliefs?

See RQ1 and RQ
2

Ertmer et al.’s (2012) Framework for Categories of
Classroom Practice will be used to determine how
well TLs’ reported uses of digital games are aligned
with their pedagogical beliefs.

RQ4. What barriers
do TLs perceive for
using digital games?

TATG Survey

RQ5. How do TLs’
pedagogical beliefs
shape perceptions of
barriers to using
digital games?

See RQ2 and RQ4

Numerical scores will be obtained from the Likert
scale items in the TATG Survey. Responses ranging
from 1 to 5 will be exported into Excel for each of
the participants, along with their demographic data.
Reverse coding of negatively worded items will be
done.
Data will be analyzed using Excel’s Analysis
Toolpak to run statistical tests. Composite scores
will be calculated for related Likert scale items, with
mean and standard deviations calculated for
variability.
Data from RQ2 will be converted to a 1 to 5
response score, with 1 indicating transmissionist and
5 indicating constructivist. An overall mean score
from all 5 categories will be obtained. Data from
RQ2 and RQ4 will then be analyzed using Pearson’s
r correlation. Linear regression will be performed to
compare groups.

RQ2. What are TLs’
pedagogical beliefs?

Responses will be tabulated in a range from
transmissionist to constructivist for 5 categories: (a)
explainer/facilitator, (b) content/”sense-making,” (c)
breadth/depth, (d) content/interest, and (e) whole
class activity/multiple activities.
