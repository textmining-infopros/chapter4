ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This inquiry into an event as an archive would not have been possible
without the creative labor and insights of artists, organizers, and makers of
cultural life in downtown Tucson, Arizona. As I move forward, I continue to find
inspiration in what this community has shared with me and how these individuals
enrich the place where I live, write, and learn from them still.
In the periods of intensive learning that have led to this research and its
dissemination, I have been fortunate to enjoy the financial support of University
of Arizona sponsors. I thank the School of Information, the Social and Behavioral
Sciences Research Institute, the Graduate and Professional Student Council,
Confluencenter, and internal and external wings of the Tinker Foundation. I am
also grateful to have discussed this work with scholars in performance studies and
the humanities, as a 2015 fellow in the Mellon School of Theater and
Performance Research at Harvard University, and as an invited lecturer as the
Ballard Museum with puppeteers including Dr. John Bell.
In creating this work I have been nourished as a scholar in an
exceptionally supportive network. For this gift I acknowledge many mentors,
helpers, students, and friends at the University of Arizona School of Information
particularly our Director, Dr. Bryan Heidorn, and archival scholar Dr. Jamie Lee.
I also acknowledge the UA Department of Communication, where my training in
qualitative inquiry has been a distinct pleasure under the tutelage of Dr. Margaret
Pitts and others. And I extend thanks for essential feedback at the final stages of
this dissertation from Dr. Barry Wellman.
Life does not stop for scholarship, no matter who or how many may
depend on you! I have traveled this journey holistically thanks to many helpers.
Among these, Gretchen Stahlman has helped me realize ideas by walking through
them with me on Tumamoc Hill; Jennifer Nichols has shown me how navigate the
transition from play to work and back again with grace; and I extend special
thanks to my sister Debra Daly and especially to my mother Edita Y. Tomory, for
keeping my household from lapsing into chaos as I wrote.
Finally, I express deep gratitude for the time, patience, and excellent
critical work of my dissertation committee: Dr. Kay Mathiesen, Dr. Vincent Del

ABSTRACT
Community expressions

specifically, annual events manifested by

groups other than official organizations can be sites for transmission of crucial
understandings of the past that have not achieved representation in formal
archives. In this dissertation, to locate the minor narratives of history I analyze a
community expression with my focus honed on the ephemeral matter used within
it, to imitate and question the reliance in archives on evidence, and explore
ephemera as important focus points for the transmission of collective memory.

Procession, a grassroots annual celebration and parade in honor of the dead in
Tucson, Arizona.
To convey and interpret perspectives from the community enacting and
participating in this event through engagement with ephemera, I have used three
questions as my guide: How are ephemera used in All Souls Procession events as
commemorative community expressions? How has the history of the All Souls
Procession been shaped around the commemorative use of ephemera in
relationship with recorded documents? And, What are the implications for
archives of this case of commemoration through ephemeral community
expression?
Through qualitative methods of data collection including participant
observation, document analysis, and unstructured interviews with thirteen current
and former All Souls Procession organizers, I have found two overarching themes
in the discourse around ephemeral commemoration in this event: processing the

Daly 11
past and softening community boundaries. I found that through these themes of
use, ephemera in the All Souls Procession anchor collective memory while
constituting community boundaries, meeting a growing need to define and

membership defined as volunteerism in ASP events, ephemera function as iconic
draws toward this event, attracting people to a unified theme and then engaging
them in constructing it anew, as its ephemeral building blocks must be regularly
recreated. Ephemera in this study were also found to help claim ownership and
authority for the All Souls community, through occupation of space and memory.
Concluding this work are three propositions: First, that in such community

arena, which is both ephemeral and enduring; Second, the use of ephemera as
commemorative matter may give a community leverage in controlling records
about the past, yet in increasingly transparent ways. Third, as they adapt to the
model of participatory archives seen increasingly in the digital archival landscape,
users can deploy strategies     

    

effacements and master narratives, the latter of which are then celebrated as
community histories through new cycles of ephemeral commemoration. I
ultimately retheorize the archive as collective action to construct, efface, and
build community around history, supporting the notion that the more collective, or
massive, or spectacular the telling of a story, the better it competes to become a
history.

CHAPTER 1:
INTRODUCTION

like communities be represented in archives? This dissertation work focuses on a
community event studied as an archive, and on ephemeral objects and
performances as its records. In this introductory chapter of the work, I first make
the case for opening archives to matter and histories other than those archives
traditionally include. I then introduce the role of ephemera as a popular fabric of
community existence and therefore a key phenomenon in nontraditional
archiving. Next I outline the case study research I have conducted that considers
an event as an archive. After introducing the research site of the All Souls
Procession in Tucson, Arizona in the United States, I provide an overview of my
research questions, participants, methodology, and data organization and analysis.
Following this overview, in the next chapters I focus on the framework of theory,
literature, and general understandings that support my inquiry, and then proceed
to detailed chapters on inquiry, analysis, and conclusions.
RATIONALE
There are important reasons it is worthwhile to focus on community
memory as it plays out in events in general and in event ephemera in such
expressions in particular. First, for some decades now it has been acknowledged
that the public and also archivists increasingly value stories other than the master

Daly 13
narratives long defined as archival material.1 As Bastian has argued in multiple
works including her exploration of carnival, cultural expressions
annual events

specifically,

can be sites for transmission of crucial understandings of the past

that have not achieved representation in formal archives.2 Second, an imperative
of archives is to represent all histories, yet many are left out on the grounds that
the records representing them do not have enduring value. The rationale for
examining cultural expressions as archives is that such events enact, transmit, and
store minor narratives  

  3 of the past that is archived history.

Within this rationale for locating minor narratives, I focus on ephemera
both to imitate and to question the reliance in archives on evidence. The term
ephemera   t mean only those definitions typically utilized in library
and information science or archival studies, those referencing paper-based
materials that are transient or difficult to classify. Instead, my use of the term
             are as well as the actions
they facilitate, encompassing the material and the immaterial so often used

together in community expressions. Ephemera thus include paper-based
ephemera, nonunique materials, materials not intended to last, and performances
involving ephemeral objects

all of these categories overlapping one another.

Whereas the master narrative is evident in documents and records typically
construed as important or having long-term value, minor narratives are evident in
matter commonly considered unimportant or transient ephemera, which are
collected, constructed, displayed, performed, and then destroyed or discarded in
the course of action.
I foreground ephemera here as important tools for the transmission of
collective memory. Since Maurice Halbwachs began writing on collective
memory in the 1950s, many branches of scholarship have acknowledged the
importance of specific sites of meaning, often things
and artifacts

monuments, documents,

as anchors through which individuals and groups come to

understand the past.4 Examining archival scholarship, Jacobsen, Hedstrom, and
Punzalan have identified multiple ways in which archival scholars seat collective
memory in archival documents and records. Themes they found range from the
positing archives as essential foundations of collective memory, to critical focus
on   limitations as surrogates for memory.5 I embarked on this work

and to convey and interpret perspectives from the

community enacting and participating in that event through engagement with
ephemera.
Overall, this work can be framed most simply as a contribution to archival
studies, yet the true nature of my inquiry is complex and interdisciplinary. I
approach this inquiry on the dynamic construction of community histories by
moving through areas of archival studies that overlap with humanism, and I
present what I find through the lens of my personal experience, subjectively
interpreted. Recognizing as a humanist the need to open the archives to include all

human histories, I have worked to learn how community events function as
archives to enrich archival science with new theory around what archives can be
and do. More personally, as a former organizer and participant of multiple
community events including the All Souls Procession, I have studied this event as
an archive to help me understand the construction, transmission, and erasure of
histories swirling around me. In short, my own reasons for pursuing this research
are humanistic, scientific, and personal.
THIS RESEARCH
The research site for this study of community event-as-archive is the All
Souls Procession (hereafter also referred to as the ASP), a grassroots celebration
established in November 1990, which now draws tens of thousands of participants
to parade through downtown Tucson each year in collective commemoration of
the past. Three questions have guided this study of the ASP as an archive:
RQ1: How are ephemera used in All Souls Procession events as
commemorative community expressions?
RQ2: How has the history of the All Souls Procession been shaped around
the commemorative use of ephemera in relationship with recorded
documents?
RQ3: What are the implications for archives of this case of
commemoration through ephemeral community expression?
Thus my inquiry has focused in how ephemera are used to commemorate in the
ASP, and how the history of this event been shaped by this use. Furthermore, I
have drawn implications for archives around this commemorative use of
ephemera that I discuss in the final chapters of this work.

Daly 17
I have focused my inquiry on current and former organizers and
participants of the ASP whom I have found to be rich sources of knowledge
concerning event meanings, objectives, and histories, even as the event has grown
and changed across time. In terms of organizational structure, the ASP has always
been loosely organized, with most participants given few explicit instructions
except to honor the dead and the past in whatever ways they choose. Since 2006
All Souls organizers have coalesced under the moniker Many Mouths One
Stomach, and while a handful of these individuals have official titles, many are
still untitled volunteers. In this work I have gathered  

    

perspectives with a focus on ephemera in collective commemorative practices.
This study is situated in the case of the ASP through the interpretive lens
of the research participants with whom I co-construct knowledge, and through my

I do not believe in the epistemology of the objective investigator, and in
this qualitative work I have not followed positivist research paradigms such as
validity and reliability because these are ill suited for naturalistic inquiry. Instead
I have worked reflexively, looking back upon my own position as an Anglo
woman of particular cultural perspectives and privileges, and as a member of an
academic culture. I have worked to bracket biases and assumptions I had built up
in these roles as I collected and prepared to analyze data. Still, I do not intend for
the resulting findings to be generalized beyond the natural environment in which
they were constructed. Instead I present my findings as the interpretations of a
situated and subjective researcher who has taken apart and reassembled
experiences credibly, dependably, transferably, and confirmably.8
Guided by the questions and methodological benchmarks outlined above, I
have deployed three qualitative methods of data collection and analysis:
participant observation, unstructured interviewing, and document analysis. More
specifically, between October 1st, 2013 and January 31st, 2016, I spent 20 hours as
a participant observer of All Souls workshops, parades and events, 13 hours in
unstructured interviews with participants, and an unquantified but substantial
number of hours analyzing paper and online documents including films, social
media posts, and grant proposals. Furthermore, beyond these quantities I have
thoroughly immersed myself in the emic, or insider, discourse around the
ephemera-centered memory practices in this event, and in some etic, or outsider,
critiques of this event as well.

Working with the corpus of data built using these methods and
methodology, I have conducted analysis in pursuit of themes drawn from and
theory grounded in the data. I have focused on the ASP as an archive through the
visual methodology of discourse analysis, by suspending preexisting categories,
and identifying worlds, inconsistencies, absent presences, and social contexts.9
From the discourse generated by this event studied as an archive, I have arrived at
conclusions presented in the final chapter that I hope will enrich theory around
not only what archives do, but around what archive are or at least, what they
can be, depending on whom you care to ask.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Substantial work already exists claiming archival gaps and absences and
the need to remedy these. Acknowledging that such gaps exist in formal archives
(and reviewing some of the literature on these gaps in the next chapter), I invite
the reader to consider the body of histories excluded from archives alongside
those included within them, by offering the conceptualization of negative
[archival] space.

As the first component of the conceptual framework for this study, I
conceptualize formal archives as occupying positive archival space and the many
excluded histories as existing in negative space. In the visual arts, negative space
is that which is not the subject of an artistic work but which defines the
boundaries of the subject. The use of the negative space metaphor thus allows the
reader to keep both the included and excluded in view as constituting constructed
history. Yet this conceptualization simultaneously keeps a focus on the distinct
privilege archives offer to the histories of static groups like institutions

those

with clear lists of who does what - while relegating dynamic groups such as
communities to negative space because they change too fast for the fixed record,
the stored artifact.   

their performances of the archive fill and interpret these three roles of thing and
place and practice, using ephemeral matter and imagination.
As a third part of the conceptual framework supporting this research, I
accept that

made of materials easily assembled and then destroyed in a large urn and other
ritual burnings that occur at the end of the Procession or afterward.
Finally, the fourth component of my conceptual framework for this
research is the notion that community events can and should be viewed as
archives performances of the archival scenario in negative archival space. My
understanding of such events as archives is influenced by the community archive
movement in Britain, and more specifically, by archival scholar Jeannette

The All

Souls Procession is a growing channel for a critical array of information about
Tucson and the US-Mexico borderlands based on the use of ephemera in
commemoration  and is therefore a compelling case to study for this work.
MOVING FORWARD: REMAINING SECTIONS AND CHAPTERS
In the next chapter of this work, Chapter 2, I track the theoretical
underpinnings and literature at the foundation of my inquiry and offer contextual
justification for my advancement of new understandings in archival scholarship 
of negative archival space and ephemera, respectively. In Chapter 3, I introduce
my focus on ephemera in community expressions as storage and transmission of
history, and I work to shed light on dynamic community play within negative
archival space. Chapter 4 offers an in-depth description of my interpretive casestudy methodology and the methods utilized in this study. In Chapter 5, I present
analytical findings around the commemorative use of ephemera in the All Souls
Procession as themes. In Chapter 6, I discuss found themes and analyses in the
context of current understandings of history construction, as well as direct archival
implications of these. In Chapter 7, I conclude by reviewing findings and broader
implications, acknowledging limitations, and offering directions for related future
work.

In studying ephemera in community commemoration, I am working with a

exclusion, to    

alongside archived history. I analyze formal archiving traditions as forces which
reinforce a corpus of history bounded by systematic exclusions and colonial
power dynamics. I then mark the domains of memory outside of the traditional
archival boundaries as negative archival space, while showing that negative space
is still active thanks to efforts in community archiving. I close this chapter with

In recent years there has been a great increase in informal local- and
interest-based archives internationally, also known as the community archive
movement. According to research by scholars studying this movement, one reason
communities construct and keep their own histories is to channel their collective
memory to sites other than the formal, traditional archives typically closed to their

material and immaterial locus of engagement at the center of communities'
dynamic commemorative practices.
Considering the crucial role played by history in the formation of both
individual and collective memory, my study of the commemorative use of
ephemera has important implications for history construction, for community
archivists and the professional institutions that would partner with them. I situate
my study in an annual community event in honor of the dead that is centered in
commemorative ephemera, which has transmitted local histories including those
that (re)define the event itself since 1990. Through this analysis, I map one area
of negative [archival] space by drawing an analytical guide to one community's
archival scenario play through ephemeral commemoration. Through this work, I
intend to illuminate a growing subcultural form of commemoration for archival
professionals to consider in the drive toward more inclusive histories.

signifies as a social grouping in which people organize themselves around shared
activities or goals but which is not a named organization. I acknowledge that
communities do sometimes coalesce as organizations while remaining dynamic
communities on some level; however, these coalescences are often compelled by
the inorganic need to produce records, bypassing more organic traces of action.
The approach I take to the concept of community in this work is pragmatically
normative # that is, prescriptive for archival practice # in arguing that because
communities exist, their histories must be analyzed toward inclusion and culture
change in formal archives.

imaginary than the latter. The public is simply not very familiar with the world of
archival practice and scholarship  perhaps, as I will argue in the next chapter,
because they so rarely see themselves reflected there.
Deploying this outsider perspective, then, and in view of the mutually
sustaining roles of place/thing/practice, I view archives through the scenariobased framework also theorized by Taylor:
Instead of privileging texts and narratives, we could also look to scenarios

In the game of charades I described earlier, the actor is performing the archival
scenario; in communities, organizers of community expressions and archives are
enacting that same performance: the archival scenario.

Another strength of the concept of scenario as a lens is in its presentation
of each role as playable by an actor who retains agency. While scenarios do fix
our perspectives on universal notions such as murder-in-war, they are also
frameworks enacted locally, offering opportunities for play within each
customizable role because each scenario performance is situated in a space. While
scholars deploy the terms narrative and text as similar frameworks, a distinct
feature of performance scholarship is agency in choosing how to view and play a
role agency first seen in work by Goffman as symbolic interactionism.50 Taylor

conceptualization of communities of records including dynamic expressions

she has found to be societally destructive in the absence of fixed records.53 This
humanistic concern is doubtless grounded in her years working as archivist in a
relatively undeveloped society, in which written recording practices were

Nonetheless, community expressions push against the archival ideal of
fixity with considerable tension. This tension is initially raised by the use of
ephemera as records and then elevated considerably with the spread of recordness
to performing bodies. Through performances, community expressions transfer
repertoires of knowledge from the bodies of performers to other sensing bodies
present.55 Therefore, following Bastian in consideration of these expressions
within communities of records calls for radical reconsideration of fixity in the
concept of what can be a record  

recordness in dynamic performance within a larger movement interrogating fixity
around dynamic information.56
The crucial tension around dynamic commemoration is evident in this
work in the transfer of recordness from fixed thing (object, document) to unfixed
thing (ephemeral object) to unfixed non-thing (ephemeral performance). The
methodological classification ephemera that results from these transfers is
inspired by scholars from the field of performance studies, particularly the late
queer theorist JosÃ© Esteban MuÃ±oz (1996) in his introduction to the book Queer
Acts   

modality of anti-rigor and anti-evidence that, far from filtering materiality
out of cultural studies, reformulates and expands our understandings of
materiality. Ephemera, as I am using it here, is linked to alternate modes
of textuality and narrativity like memory and performance: it is all of those
things that remain after a performance, a kind of evidence of what has
transpired but certainly not the thing itself.57
To reimagine the classification ephemera around crucial dynamic tension
is to study what RomÃ¡n and coauthors, also scholars of performance studies, have

to the methodology of this work, involving the strategic design of a method to
study ephemera defines as follows:
what is either deliberately or inadvertently left behind [which] then serves
as the proof or evidence of the lost or forgotten performance [but] is
neither interchangeable with the lost performance, nor can it fully replace
it. It is the traceable remains of what had once transpired.58
Ephemera in this study is a broad methodological category encompassing why
and how communities dynamically commemorate and how such commemoration
matters in relation to archival scenarios. Through this analysis I endeavor to find
ways for formal archives to acknowledge and include community performance in
archives, and I interrogate the classification ephemera as central to this endeavor.
Tension around fixity, ever-amplified in the digital archival landscape, is seen in
this work as a crucial criterion of recordkeeping for communities due to their
dynamic identities. With such tension as a criterion I reimagine the classification
ephemera as desirable for transmitting dynamic community histories, not in spite
of but due to    lack of fixity. Again, ephemera in this work, then,
encompasses the material and the immaterial, often used together in
commemorative acts.

The histories of the dominant recordkeeping and archival traditions are
populated with remarkable thinkers, scholars, and practitioners who have
dedicated their lives to preserving and exhibiting histories and to filling the gaps
between them. The ensuing critical discussion of some of their influences is thus
not intended to disparage seminal works in archival tradition, but rather, to
explore historic practice in order to gain perspective on some of the normative or
exclusionary assumptions that underpin contemporary archival work. Through
critical analysis of the foundations of modern archival practices, I hope to
understand the persistence of privileges and exclusions in which we as modern
archivists are also implicated. While not extensive, my own work as an archivist
has operated within these same paradigms I critically analyze here, and I
acknowledge my role, as Harris has footnoted in his own critical work quoted

social beings in relationships with others and with the archives themselves. So
closely are we involved in our relationships with history construction that our
relationship cycles may remain invisible to us unless we step reflectively out of
them. Therefore, in this section focused on archival tradition, my goal is to step
temporally and critically outside of archival thinking, to see the cycles in which
we work, and to understand more of where and how the archived corpus is (and is
disallowed from being) composed.

Harris, Caswell, and others who use visual and aural metaphors for
archives guide their readers to experience their writing with the urgency of the
sensing body. However, in my view neither visual nor aural metaphors capture
the use of space that is paramount in archival practice; it is only the third type of
sensory metaphor, involving touch, that begins to demonstrate the power over
space needed for traditional recordkeeping. Lee has written of the archival body,
at time in erotic terms.64 On the other hand, Lee does not discuss at length the

centrality of space in archives is the focus of my metaphor of negative archival
space.
In terms of Del Casino's definitions of space in social geography,66 the
view of space at the foundation of negative archival space is the humanistic view
that spaces are repositories of human meaning.67 I acknowledge the importance
of other views of space in social geography, including the radical view that space
is constructed through societal mediation and control, and the poststructuralist
view of space as constructed through language.68 However, I rely on ephemeral
objects and performances as well as narratives to temporally define and control
spaces in this work, and I find the humanistic view of space attributes agency and
meaning-making to its occupants in ways that accommodate these participantconstructed meanings. I conceptualize that which is excluded from archives as

understanding of space as rival property69 with the potential to be reenvisioned
and controlled through active occupation that may include performance. My
notion of negative archival space begins with the understanding of archives as a
socially constructed corpus or as a body of histories,70 and the negative space as
all the space around that body, populated by histories which do not or cannot
adhere. My intention is to conceptualize that which is excluded from archives as
unified by that exclusion into a dynamic shape, and to illuminate and map
commemorative activities in negative archival space.

which they operate  they play crucial roles in social memory and identity, and as

While modern archival

tradition is considered by leading scholars including Cook to be rooted in seminal
texts no more than 150 years old, 75 archives instruments of power can still
resemble those of the archons when viewed through a critical lens. Critical
scholars from numerous disciplines have written of the use of archives as
constructed by authoritative bodies to control and colonize populations. The

British archival tradition may be the most seminal of national archival

American, and Australian archival traditions as the dominant traditions guiding

systematically exclude the histories of many communities. This reading for
exclusions is prompted by their continuing to shape archival bodies and their
negative spaces, and by the work archivists committed to social justice have
performed and continue to perform. In particular I trace these exclusions

from archives the many forms of recording and transmission that are not
physically manifest, and it excludes communities who do not own space over
sufficient time for record storage or preservation  and who sometimes do not
own space over any length of time at all.91
Additionally, the exclusion of unfixed and unprinted matter and of nonadministrative records restrict the act of record-keeping to the literate and the
authorized, an exclusion discussed in the quote above by Gilliland et al in the

Early 20th century onward: Jenkinson and the guardianship of evidence
Within the considerably limited notion of the nature of a record discussed
above, a series of archival paradigms have shaped the dominant archival tradition:
through notions of record value, the professions those notions guide, the bodies of
histories they construct, and the negative spaces around the resulting bodies. The
first paradigm, juridical legacy, Cook notes was guided in the early to mid-20th

Jenkinson remains firmly in place in emphases in formal archival institutions: of
protection over access; and of isolated custody of archived collections over

Mid- to late-20th century onward: Schellenberg and the hierarchy of memory
The second paradigm of the dominant archival traditions, cultural
memory,105 took hold in the mid-20th century with the explosion of records around
two world wars among other pivotal flurries of documentation. Yet the triumph of
evidential record quantity over quality obscured a simultaneous emphasis in this

allowed the selective memory within the archives to be framed as cultural
memory - ostensibly representative of all culture(s) rather transparently rendered
through acknowledgement of selection decisions.
This misrepresentation of archives as universal thanks to large (but uneven
and gap-filled) collections has only been exacerbated with mass digitization
efforts.109 Regarding digital archival exhibits, Hedstrom noted as early as 2002
that curators  little effort to leave clues about the basis for their appraisal
decisions or the contexts in which they are made.110 The thoroughness of
metadata is another area in which selection decisions are enacted without being
made transparent; for example in 2009 survey of digital archival collection in
which the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) found that fewer than half of
digital collections were described sufficiently to be discoverable.111 Thus, through
the paradigm of cultural memory the corpus of records to be archived grew and

Late 20th century onward: Hans Booms, Helen Samuels, and the distant archivist
The dominant archival traditions focused archiving toward a new
paradigm near the end of the 20th century with a focus on social engagement; a
key concept was Identity for archivists and for the macro-level of society they
were increasingly concerned with representing.112 Prior to this era records had

The shift toward professionalizing archives as a society-level apparatus
led to a more explicit focus on broad representation, yet the accompanying shifts
in fundamental archival relationships undercut this goal. As archivists broadened
their focus to a macro-perspective on society their relationships with both what
their collections held and whom they served grew remote. Exacerbating this

Recently, as a representative of a small community archiving project, I
visited an institutional archive that included local matters tied to a particular
place. I met with two archivists there to propose a partnership with the community
archive project, which was based on a local event. The archivists listened to my
proposal and then the senior of the two responded by first pronouncing with
 This event    

not be able to partner with the community archive at that time, because such a

acknowledging a community 

fund, so they are often not allotted space.

although studies by leading archival theorists on community are helping the

notwithstanding that professional archivists are beginning to envision and
occasionally enact partnerships with communities, in my view community is not

at least not yet. The concept of community is not

communities are not in enough contact with formal archives to influence archival

CHAPTER 3: EPHEMERA IN COMMUNITIES
This chapter chooses a path toward better archiving for and with
communities. I worked to justify the need for this path in the previous chapter, by
tracing cyclical, patterned exclusions in archival practice, and locating the results
of these in negative space around the formalized collections in the archival body.
Even as archivists form new theories toward inclusion of new histories, to
legitimate their work archival professionals are compelled to model their
collections and practices on the hegemonic foundations of the past. As these
patterns have organized the corpus of archivable histories, they have also created
and shaped negative archival space.
In this chapter, by revisiting ephemera use in community expressions as
the storage and transmission of history, I work to shed light on negative archival
space and dynamic, empowering archival play within it. To this end I now turn
focus to a key player emerging from consideration of negative archival space:
ephemera. I explore the definitions and historic understandings of ephemera as a
classification, and ephemera play a key role in archiving the transactions of
ordinary people. At the end of the chapter I introduce the use of ephemera as a
reimagined concept through which to analyze a community expression, and I

Why should archivists study negative archival space?
There is value in examining histories excluded from professional archives
 or in postmodern terms, histories excluded from the possibility of being
constructed in legitimate archival space  for three reasons. The first fits squarely
within contemporary archival practice in its focus on gaps: Archivists should, and
do, attend to negative archival space to locate histories excluded from our

archives and work to include them; in other words, to fill historic gaps. As
discussed in the second chapter of this work, there are many sensory
conceptualizations of the bodies of history within and outside of archives. These
include the archival sliver versus what lay beyond that sliver,125 and the notion
of inclusion in the archive as being given a voice, versus exclusion as being
relegated to silence.126 These conceptualizations reflect the emphasis in the
archival profession of filling in gaps, since one must conceptualize the whole to
recognize its gaps. The study of oral history is founded on the premise that when
a history is vocalized and heard, a gap in the archive is addressed.127 A similar
foundation underlies the analysis of ephemeral commemoration here. Ephemeral
histories are likely to fill in gaps in archives.
A second impetus for attending to negative archival space in archivesfocused scholarship is to understand the processes that go into the nonprofessional
construction of histories  processes quite different from traditional archival

drafts of content, broken links, and information-turned misinformation are indeed
collections of evidence prompted by evolving technological abilities regardless of
human need or filter. By contrast, commemoration through live human
engagement disrupts the privileging of primary sources, locating value not in
permanence but in persistence.129 The inclusion of archives in the broad field of
information has led to intersecting lines of concern, over preservation in one
direction and metrics collection in another.130 Dynamic archives work in both of
these directions simultaneously.

Despite comprising that which is excluded from formal archives, negative
archival space is nonetheless activated space, in which histories are constructed
unencumbered by the formalities of traditional archives. Those whose histories
are left out of formal archives are likely aware of the archive as a general

history and anatomy of the Ephemeron, a fly that lives but five hours

the passage above from The Epic of Gilgamesh. The ephemeron in its fly form is a
living body that is almost simultaneously the passing of a body, its veinous wings
conjuring absence more than presence in their brittle transparency. Transmitted to

lodged within the human psyche not only because it never lives long, but because
it has lived so many short lives again and again attended by human reflection.
Flouting the archival demand for uniqueness, fixity, and organizability,
ephemera of a related sort continue to buzz disruptively across our archival
purview because they are uncanny so uncanny in fact that they are the basis of a
category. In contemporary information science and archives, ephemera has
become the classification under which collecting institutions group a paper-based
spectrum of items that do not fit well within their systems of preservative storage
and bibliographic control: bus tickets, wine labels, circulars advertising sales, and
commemorative balloons, to name but a few. The criteria by which matter can be

labeled ephemera is rather arbitrary; once they are labeled however, ephemera are
often segregated from other aspects of the collection and processed less
comprehensively than books and the other formats of materials around which
archival tradition has evolved. 132 Young laments that in information science and
archives ephemera are often only defined by example, and he locates this lack of
clear definition at the heart of the problem these fields have with handling
ephemeral materials.133 In lieu of a clear definition, ephemera has become

Questions prevail about whether ephemera are unfairly devalued by
collecting institutions, or whether their inherent qualities invite their distinct
treatment. Librarians and archivists who fret over handling ephemera may be
responding at least in part to the conditions of the ephemera that arrive in their
care. As noted by the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts,
Often, ephemera were produced using the cheapest papers and printing
processes available. Newspaper, cardstock, and coated papers are made of
short, weak, acidic wood-pulp fibers, which discolor and degrade with
time. Low-quality printing results in media that are friable, or easily lifted,
as they sit on the surface of the paper rather than within the paper fibers.
To make matters worse, ephemera have usually suffered heavy use, as
well as poor housing and storage, prior to their arrival in a collection. A

On the other hand, well-preserved ephemera can cause professional
consternation. A confounding of interpreted value, longevity, similarity to other
materials in a collection, and accessibility are embedded in the formation of
ephemera as a category. Illustrating this, Micah Hoggatt of Harvard University

ephemeral not in the sense that she ceases to exist, but in the sense that she has
ceased to be seen by the speaker, likely because her employers expected her to
work quickly and disappear. Like the use of the term here, the classification
ephemera enacts that which it names: When collecting institutions treat ephemera
poorly based on presumptions of temporality, ephemera become more likely to
disappear or disintegrate.

text hawking Easter eggs, alongside other imagery many archivists as well as art
critics might dismiss as eclectic, popular, or low art. If librarians and archivists
increasingly found these ill-fitting materials in their collections in the late 20th
century, they likely had the coddling approaches of Lewis, Rickards, and their
respective societies to hold responsible.
To summarize ephemera from a collection-focused perspective: Ephemera
in information science and archives is a classification for materials that may be
evanescent, referring both to those that land in negative archival space and those
that exist in formal archives. In these collecting institutions the labeling of
materials as ephemera may justify decisions not to fully process or welcome
them, though that same labeling may lead ephemera societies to treasure

COMMUNITY AND EPHEMERA
Dynamically ordinary people
In archival practice, much less attention is given to community records
than to the records of official organizations. Yet communities exist, engage in
transactions, and produce evidence of many kinds collective histories and shared
stories. As Thompson notes in his groundbreaking work on oral histories,
Until (the 20th century), the focus of history was essentially political: a
documentation of the struggle for power, in which the lives of ordinary
people, or the working of the economy or religion, were given little

of ordinary people have been seen as unimportant, an argument I also make in
chapter 2 of this work. Here I also advance another explanation: the exile of
ordinary people to negative archival space exists because humans tend to engage
important activities in dynamic groups, outside of established structures and
scripts. As I discuss further in the next section, ordinary people organize
themselves and engage in shared activity as part of and within dynamic
communities. Particularly in this era of what Rainie and Wellman call Networked
Individualism,147 day-to-day life and even more formalized shared events
increasingly happen outside of recordkeeping entities such as institutionalized
environments and static organizations, and even family structures, resulting in
community histories too dynamic for archives as traditionally understood.
To illustrate the difference between organizational and community
transactions underlying this work given the similarity across types of work or
engagement, I use meeting minutes as a microcosmic example of recorded
organizational work. In the case of a professional meeting, those present are
counted and named, rules of order are followed, and someone present is required
to write down what transpires. Each of these moments requires an inorganic
freezing or displacement of action (names and rules) and the intent to preserve (by
writing it down) in order to create a record. By contrast, community transactions
are more likely to leave ephemeral paper content as an organic byproduct of
action. In posters advertising events and in periodicals including newspapers and

147

magazines, for example, there is a clear temporal focus on the actions of their
creators and audiences, a prizing of the current moment. Active communities are
continuously constructed through participation in such current, prized moments.
Comprising the shared community, then, are notions of current happenings (e.g., a
parade, a block party) and behavior, rather than the recordability and records of
such activity.

philatelists, collectors of all kinds, and genealogists, and comments that

Daly 83

People whose perspectives and transactions are not typically recorded in
archives have special relationships with ephemera because ephemeral matter
constitute highly organic records, gleaned through the transactions that those who
occasion them elect (as in shopping receipts) rather than through what may be
atypical transactions compelled by governments (as in arrests.) Ephemera evoke
activities in which ordinary people choose to engage, in their everyday lives and
in the extraordinary moments they experience or, better, orchestrate. For many in
negative archival space playing in the archival scenario, ephemera play the role of
the thing. One of the most noteworthy examples of this archival scenario play is
in the American and European histories of scrapbooking.

Scrapbooks: Sharing ephemera in communities

Daly 85
Historically, scrapbooks have served those in negative archival space as a
system both for archiving ephemera and representing their personal histories
through it in social exhibition. Scrapbooks were particularly popular in late 19th
century America, where the industrialization of printing through steam power,
chromolithography, and embossing as well as rail transport151 led to an explosive
new tradition of ephemera, less textual than preceding print traditions and
considerably more colorful and graphical.152 For European immigrants
accustomed to collections as symbols of old world wealth, this influx of flashy
print materials enabled aristocratic roleplay through cheap collectibles: Tucker

All human archiving is selective. To consider community transactions in
archives, archives must realistically practice selectivity across the spectrum of
community transactions, from the ad hoc transactions at the less salient end of this
spectrum to community expressions at the more salient end. An ad hoc grouping
of passengers created in the context of a bus trip may have little in common
beyond matching itineraries and ephemeral bus tickets. In these ad hoc
transactions and their residual ephemera there may still be informative traces of
human experience, such as the choice of destination and bus line, which reflect

Stronger

that is, more cohesive

communities are more salient, and

community cohesion may be measured by repetition in  choices of
activities in common. As a community continues to engage in the same activities
together and to grow in levels of participation, its activities begin to constitute
community expressions, which in this work are organized by the most cohesive
communities at the stronger end of the spectrum. Community expressions include
large annual festivals, parades, and other highly attended repeating events
organized by people outside of dominant governmental organizations.
Community expressions is the term used to describe the phenomena that archivist
Bastian analyzes as performances of memory in her studies of festivals in the
Virgin Islands,157 inspiring the analysis of community expressions in this work.
This work rests on an assumption that when we analyze their functions in
negative archival space we find that ephemera often play the thing in the
community archival scenario, providing material centers for community
expressions. Ordinary people create ephemera to construct iterations of
community, and then save those ephemera to document that community context
within which they advertise, visit one another, pay for things, and engage in a host
of other day to day transactions. These transactions stand out as more ordinary

Despite their grounding in strong communities, community expressions are fluid;

at any given time. Instead, their ephemera are evidence of the activities through
which members engage and participate, because communities are entities of
action.
RECASTING EPHEMERA: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY OPPORTUNITY
Looking ahead in this work, ephemera will be used methodologically to
signify not only transient material but also transient activity centered around that
material. In particular, I make the case for my methodological use in this study of
the broadened definition of ephemera introduced in the theoretical framework in
this work to include material and immaterial ephemera.  

concept, as the consideration of a collection (community)

of activities preserved through both material and immaterial means (records). I
conclude this chapter by justifying this strategic recasting of ephemera as
interdisciplinary concept and terminology.
There are four reasons I have chosen to expand the concept ephemera
beyond the



 

 

 -based

classification. First, the material

understanding of ephemera is anachronistic. Collecting professions have long
problematized transitory matter, potentially abridging the community histories we
build with summary exclusions around impermanence, but also, relying on an
increasingly anachronistic understanding of information as physically palpable. In

Daly 89
the conclusion of her study of the classification ephemera, McDowell calls for its
reevaluation, noting that one reason ephemera

upon our screens with no hierarchical classifications, subject to post-print
considerations around what will preserve them or lose them to us.158 Ephemera
are classified in libraries and archives as temporal and are devalued in connection
with this temporality. Yet in the increasingly dynamic atmosphere of information
exemplified by anti-archival communication platforms like Snapchat, temporality
is a complex and at times highly-valued quality that extends from the material to
the immaterial, making the classification feel increasingly outdated and
meaningless.
The second reason I justify broadening the concept of ephemera beyond
its collection-focused classification is that meaning of ephemera as a
classification is increasingly unlike the use of the term in other fields.
Recognizing the value potential of all forms and formats of information as
archivable is imperative for archives in this era of interdisciplinary reorganization.
In a growing number of information science and archival studies departments,
professional training for the collecting fields is being absorbed within the more
dynamic field of Information.159 In thes    

recognizing innovative approaches to dynamic matter in all forms is essential.
The third reason I broaden the concept ephemera here to include the
immaterial is corroborative. Studying ephemera in the context of community
expressions in particular can shed light on negative archival space and the
dynamic archival play within it, but there are caveats to the use of ephemera in

a tendency that leads

Young to warn that
any historical research with ephemera must be counterbalanced with postevent documentation to answer new questions such as: Did the actors

Ephemera can be misleading; quality of experience should be preserved by other
means whenever possible. Corroboration is important to discern the differences
between an arbitrary and a planned transaction or between a relatively mindless
decision and a mindful one. Peeling labels from bottles absentmindedly during
wine-drinking signifies an experience distinct from the peeling of labels that
happens after wine-drinking, with the latter suggesting that it was a notable
experience overall. To understand the nature of that wine-drinking session, the
archivist may need to understand other aspects of it such as if, how, and why it
was planned, who attended and who did not attend, how that wine smelled, and
even how it tasted. The post-imbibing label peeling suggests there occurred
something salient

that it was peeled off to purchase again, or perhaps was an

experience remembered by a group of people. These shared moments are
recorded, remembered, catalogued, but not at the level of institutionalized
practice. Viewing that ephemeral wine label within a community of records could
decode this experience and that is why it is the focus of this project.
Finally, I expand the concept ephemera to include the immaterial here
because ephemera cannot be severed from the live and the performed, particularly
in commemorative community expressions. Although communities are more
personally involved than archivists in the histories they are constructing through
archival scenarios, in addition to paper-based ephemera communities play at
archiving with myriad forms of information and knowledge transfer including
ephemeral performances. Indeed, as I will show in the analysis of the All Souls

Daly 92
Procession, use of ephemera in performances forms the basis of

 

most crucial commemorative repertoires.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND MOVING FORWARD
On the basis of the four justifications above, from this point forward in
this work, I broaden the concept ephemera to include both transient material and
the transient immaterial. My intention is to recast the classification ephemera as a
methodological category for archival science that considers paper-based ephemera
and embodied performance together as community expression, and together these
play the place, thing, and practice in the archival scenario. This redeployment of
the classification breaks

  

yoke to print culture and follows instead the

role of the term as it is used in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Dutch ephemeron
study, evoking the mayfly which never lives long but which sufficiently haunts
our human senses that we draw, speak, write, or perform it again and again
ourselves.

intended for longterm preservation. Yet these material and immaterial ephemera
were central to the practices by which members of the ASP community to
commemorate and emotionally process the past. By using transient materials and
performances to construct a local past that informs community identity, ASP
participants play at and exist as part of the archival scenario, asserting community
histories while resisting the cycles that would lock those histories away from their
voices and control. Memories like Lup     Bracero father are shared locally
in free public space among a community of mourners, celebrants, and organizers.
In this work I study ephemeral commemoration in the ASP as a case of a
community expression. Considering the crucial role played by history in the
construction of both individual and community identities, I show that
communities reinforce their boundaries by transmitting histories through
ephemeral objects and ephemeral performance. For archives to work with and
include the histories of communities, these ephemeral commemoration practices
must be understood by archival professionals and theorists. To illustrate my
arguments, I frame the use of ephemera in the ASP as a particularly salient case of
commemorative expression. ASP performances and installations manifest the past
on many levels: historic, genealogical, geographical, visual, and artistic.
Poignantly, they manifest contested cultures of and within this community less

The stationing of the ASP as a representation of identity at the borderlands is a
common refrain among its supporters, and it raises the stakes around controversy
over the nature and origins of the ASP. There is dispute which I discuss in
Chapter 6 around the  relationship to the Chicano DÃ­a de los Muertos
holiday, and there are also issues of ownership, origination, and cultural
appropriation tied to the event. Though these disputes are not the sole focus of
this study, these identity-related issues relative to community memory and the
role of ephemeral commemoration in their development

Daly 100
Guiding my interrogation of the ASP as a case of community
commemoration are three research questions. First, my focus for this study is on
the nature of ephemera in a community setting, exploring the ASP as a case of
community commemoration in a particular place that exists near a large cultural
and geographic border. Given the fluidity and popular nature of ephemera, and in
light of scholarly and theoretical attention given to ephemera across disciplines
and studies as described previously, this study interrogates how ephemara
function by addressing the first research question:
RQ1: How are ephemera used in All Souls Procession events as
commemorative community expressions?
Second, given the historic and socially constructed nature shaping
commemorative experiences in both archives and in negative archival space, the
development of commemorative tradition has significant import for archives as
well as understandings of social behavior around information. I consider history
based on recorded documents around the ASP as a point of comparison for
ephemeral history construction of and within the event. Thus, the second research
question asks:
RQ2: How has the history of the All Souls Procession been shaped around
the commemorative use of ephemera in relationship with recorded
documents?
Third, this study is grounded in scholarly inquiry into community
expressions. This inquiry is ultimately meant to inform contemporary archival
practice by illuminating one commemorative community expression in negative
archival space, for the consideration of archivists, archival scholars, and interested

Daly 101
scholars of information on a more dispersed scale. Thus the third research
question asks:
RQ3: What are the implications for archives of this case of
commemoration through ephemeral community expression?
These questions have been addressed interpretively, centering on

part of working interpretively, I have taken a grounded theory approach. In the

this inquiry. Then, I describe the methods used for data collection and analysis.

and credibility as an interpretive scholar engaged in this research. Finally, I
endeavor to present a comprehensive, subjective context for this case.

story of the event begins in 1990 at CafÃ© OlÃ©169 in downtown Tucson, where
Lydia was organizing a ritual for the dead and for the living who mourned
them.170 Earlier that year she had lost her father, a veteran who had survived the
bombing of Pearl Harbor. Lydia remembered her father as a loving, gregarious
musician but also as a man who suppressed his emotions until they bubbled over
in rage. He had written his war experiences in a journal Lydia read after his death,
but he had never spoken of them. Lydia had studied art therapy in Chicago
following Jungian practices based on rituals as expressions of the unconscious. In
fashioning a ritual that involving friends and public spaces, Lydia hoped to honor
her father but also to express her conflicted memories of him.171

part of everyday life within that well-traveled, bohemian community, and ritual
celebrations and art forms were familiar sources of inspiration.172 The influence of
Mexican celebrations and the Chicano DÃ­a de los Muertos holiday was
particularly strong in Tucson, due to the flow of people and goods across the USMexico border.173 It was in this context that Lydia invited her friends to

accomplished what was intended led Lydia and her community to designate the
ritual an annual event, timed to coincide with DÃ­a de los Muertos on November

participants,179 converging from countless areas in and beyond the city. Still
nurtured in many doomed warehouse spaces but now also increasingly mobile and
networked, the ASP has continued to grow in both the numbers of participants
and the objects and subjects of commemoration.
This research focuses on the ASP as a case of commemoration because it
provides a particular window into archival scenario play and maintains a long
history within a community. Additionally, the ASP is offers a rich case for study
of commemoration because it imposes far fewer explicit restraints and demands
than more formal engines of commemoration such as monuments, memorial
services, or archives. Remarkably, participation in the ASP is mostly free, in both
senses of the term libre (without restriction) and gratis (meaning it does not
demand financial contributions from participants or spectactors). To keep it gratis
MMOS markets the event, plans the route, coordinates performances including
the finale, pays the considerable police presence mandated by the city, and hawks
donations from attendees so that attendance is not constrained by cost. To keep it
libre the network of ASP organizers professes to manage

not control or censor

the masses who participate as well as the multitude of objects and identities those
participants perform and display in their commemorations. Remaining free in
both of these manners is one way the ASP has been able to maintain its
community focus over time.

Research timeline and participants
I devoted two years and three months intensively to this study, from
October 2013 through January 2016. Twelve interviewees participated in
unstructured interviews, and many more participants attended events in which I
was a participant observer.180 I conducted much of my observation at artist-led
workshops. Sometimes these workshops hosted between five and fifteen people,
and other times there were just a few instructors working on projects while
waiting for community members to drift into the warehouses or studios housing
the workshops. Participants in other observed event activities including the large
parade are difficult to quantify because, as previously stated, it is estimated that
tens of thousands of people attended each of the main events. Although these
event attendees were not interviewed or solicited for this research, they were
participants in public events I observed as part of this project.
In addition to interactions through participant observation I have
conducted unstructured interviews with current and former ASP organizers and
participants. I focused on primarily on organizers after determining that they had
the most knowledge about commemorations across the history of the event. I also
interviewed participants who were not organizers when organizers referred me to
them and said that

In terms of gender, interview participants included seven female
interviewees and five male interviewees. Participants included four LatinoAmerican interviewees (two with Native American heritage), six Anglo-American
interviewees, one Asian-American Interviewee, and one interviewee who
preferred not to disclose her ethnicity. Interviewees included the ASP Founder
who is still a former organizer, a former ASP participant and organizer, three
former workshop instructors who were also organizers, the current organizer of
the main event, one workshop instructor who was a former organizer, and two
workshop participants. I conducted five of the interviews somewhat
spontaneously during participant observation at ASP-related events, and arranged
the remainder in advance in the location the interview participant preferred
provided it was in the downtown area so as to be easily accessible by all involved.

181

This research has been performed with approval of the University of
Arizona IRB. Multiple participants expressed a preference to be directly named
because from their perspective, revealing their identities can be, in certain circles,
a way for them to receive credit for their work. Furthermore, information from
many of the accounts discussed here is repeated on public websites. For this
reason websites and organization names related to this case have not been
obscured or pseudonymized. I have interpreted these decisions to be ethical within

In preliminary research for this study done with Dr. Catherine Brooks182
for a conference presentation, we drew from in-depth qualitative interviews with
artists

both expert and novice to examine the narratives of All Souls artists

and performers, asking how artists learn about, share information on, and make
meaning through a large-scale event and in their art. This project also involved
participant observation through workshop and event attendance, drawing on
observational notes taken at differing temporal points leading up to the event,
across two years of parades, preparation, and celebration. We focused in
particular on objects in the event as a center point in the meanings attached to as

me to gauge reactions to object performances distinct in imagery and tone. I found
that as a repertoire184 the ASP embodies local notions of death, festivity, and
identity at and along the US-Mexico border, and that parade-goers feel
particularly driven to interact with puppets painted as calaveras (skulls), but keep
their distance from those with more serious messages.

grounded theory, 189 an approach through which I construct new theories and

This study has thus been designed to be robust by drawing from multiple
methods, theories, and funds of knowledge  best understood as acknowledgment
of the rich, diverse competencies and knowledge people gain through their life
experiences.194 To triangulate methods, I have collected data via participant
observation, unstructured interviews, and discourse analysis of documents.
In this study I use grounded theory, approaching my data inductively.195 I
drew coding categories directly from the corpus of data, though looking for
ephemeral commemoration specifically. While original grounded theory assumes
objectivity, I assumed an acknowledged subjective, interpretive role in this
research.196 Furthermore, the grounded theory methodology provided tentative
theories to be tested as the research continued. Additionally, my engagement with
participant cultures has also been reflexive, defined not by a script but by

I have conducted 20

hours of focused participant observation for this research. During these participant
observations I have engaged in ASP-related activities

building and helping at

workshops, visiting installations, and walking with my daughter in the Procession
of Little Angels. To be a full participant in my observation I have also performed,
costumed, in the parade: inside a large puppet (2013), pushing a puppet-based
installation I designed on a cart (2014), and sharing homemade food in exchange
for memories (2015), comprising about one third of the total hours of participant
observation.
The decision to conduct participant observation including performance in
this research was both ontological and tactical: F    199 (2000)
circular ontology regarding qualitative inquiry, I have presumed no entitlement to
information from my sources and no opportunistic urgency. Instead, through
naturalistic involvement including the practice of performance as an arts-based
research method,200 I have embodied the ritual participation in this event in ways
that drew participants to want interact with me as a member of the culture. During
all participant observation activities I have taken time during or after observations
to record observations. In this manner I have written approximately seventy pages

including materials used to build objects and the objects that result, including
puppets, masks, altars, and costume pieces. At times this focus has also included
the spaces and places in which participants have performed ASP-related activities.

I conducted 768 minutes (12.8 hours) of unstructured interviews in total
with twelve interview participants as part of this research. I began each interview
not with a set script of questions but with an initial topic area in mind. I began the
interview introducing the topic conversationally or with an open-ended question

following up responses with either probing questions or open-ended questions in
different topic directions. I recorded all interviews and also took fieldnotes before,
after, and in some cases during the interviews.
In every interview, I used approaches designed to make the experience
beneficial for participants and to respect their agency. In guiding our
conversations I approached topic areas patiently, focused on shared trust and
rapport,207 and approached the sensitive or taboo with tact and care.208 In terms of
axiology, through naturalistic inquiry taking place where participants chose to

Because one participant was interested in

walking as we talked, we co-conducted a mobile interview, walking through
downtown Tucson to three locations that were sites our ASP-related memories,
and allowing movement through place and space to guide the interview. 211 It
should be noted however that interviews at workshops also seemed to relax
participants and give them an enhanced sense of agency, particularly when the
participant and I talked as we worked on an artistic project together such as the
application of papier mÃ¢chÃ© - a process requiring consistent hand movement but
only passive focus. I have organized all audio interviews and their complete
transcripts from this corpus in a digital directory, corresponding to a spreadsheet
in which I have recorded codes.

processions were salient for reasons that will be clear in their analysis.
I located the documents using four methods. One method was internet
research searching for pivotal documents related to aspects of ASP discourse that
emerged as salient during the course of my research. Another method was
auspicious discovery of documents in public shares of social media news that
appeared in my feed while using Facebook. A third method was through revisiting
a print-based archive of ASP-related documents. I had previously begun to build
the archive during the years when I was a core organizer of the event, from 2001
to 2004, and  

the building of

the archive and allowed me to access it. A fourth method was in asking for
documentation of items discussed during an interview. I have organized the
corpus of documents through digital representations with codes recorded in a
spreadsheet list, and stored these together in digital directories.
DATA ANALYSIS
Overview of data analysis
Similar to the data collection processes, my methods of data analysis have
been guided by the interpretive and reflexive methodology of this work. I have
taken for granted that analytical findings are contextual and situated. Baptiste has

However, this research proceeds from the approach to

naturalistic inquiry by Lincoln and Guba, which concludes that causality has little
utility in a world construed interpretively.213 Instead, the associations I have
drawn in this study include evoking, influencing, inspiring, responding to,
learning, teaching, building, celebrating, and transforming.
My analysis of all data in this research has been based on   

theory. As modeled by Dye, Schatz, and Rosenberg, this process can be viewed as
a kaleidoscope of diffusion and rearrangement of data bits.215 The method of
constant comparative coding involved, first, comparing as bits the incidents
applicable to each category; second, integrating categories and their properties to
regroup bits by theme formation; third, comparing themes and solidifying groups
of bits to delimit the theory; and fourth, writing the grounded theory around the
bits. This process is not exclusive of other types of analysis, however. It was also
instrumental in this work for me to combine data sets at the level of thematic

coding and then analyze across sets using discourse analysis as defined by Rose216
and adapted by Berg.217 This process is further explained in the section describing
the data set Documents.
Field notes
I have written and analyzed 87 pages of field notes for this research. As
Emerson has noted, the first step in moving from recording to analyzing field
notes is to read them.218 I read all of my field notes individually one time to begin
organizing them as one data set, and once they were organized I read them all
again as a data set, Field notes. When reading and re-reading all field notes
collected, I looked for insights and patterns around ephemera and commemoration
as programmed into the ASP, at the moment of observation and historically since
the inception of the event in 1990, in order to address my first two research
questions. I also reflexively analyzed moments in field notes that contained
salience for archival practice in order to address my third research question.
Interviews
I analyzed interviews on two levels, aural and textual. On the aural level, I
re-listened to all recorded interviews two times. Re-listening to interviews at the
aural level allowed me to hear intonations and other nuances and to remember

gestures and emotions that accompanied the words. Additionally, at the aural
level I was able to access our conversations while bypassing decisions made
during the transcription process, which are inevitably selective.219 On the textual
level, I transcribed all interviews and read each through one individually and then
read through all interviews again as a data set, called Interviews. As was the case
when analyzing my field notes, I examined the interviews with a particular eye on

Documents
Documents I have analyzed in this work include drawings, photographs,

particular, ephemera presenting advanced

knowledge of events should be corroborated with other sources.223 I have
therefore grounded my analysis of these documents in my immersion in the
discourse around the ASP from participant observation and interviews and from
years of membership in communities that participate in the event. I have followed
the methodology for discourse analysis including visual materials recommended
by Rose because this methodology does not require a break in analysis between
the textual and the visual.
Once I selected documents for analysis, I displayed these prominently on
the screen in my analysis workspace to facilitate immersive grounding in the data.
For analysis I then applied Rose's methodology as adapted by Berg 2009 (21820), analyzing this data set, Documents, according to these seven steps:
1. suspend preexisting categories
2. absorb oneself in the matter under study

4. identify what Stuart Hall has called "regimes of truth" or "worlds"224
5. identify inconsistencies
6. identify absent presences
7. identify social contexts (for example, audience, or performer.)
This process of analysis aligned well with the constant comparative process of
analysis in which I processed all data in the corpus, in that I was able to combine
data sets. That is, I combined the Documents data set with the and Fieldnotes and
Interviews data sets for the third step of the constant comparative and discoursefocused analytic process, bringing coded themes I could then analyze across all
data sets. Again, throughout this process my analytic focus was on ephemera use,
patterns in the practice of commemoration in a community expression, and
implications for archives, in order to address my research questions.
Coding of Data Sets
To code data for this study I first read thoroughly through each of my data
sets: Fieldnotes, Interviews, and Documents. I browsed them all together as a
corpus and recorded my impressions in preliminary analysis notes; then read them
again line by line or inch by inch. Then I began open coding225 or tagging with a

focus on ephemera use, the processes of commemoration as they developed over
time in the ASP, and implications for archives. Accordingly, open codes might be
specific people, family roles, places, attitudes, or colors. From this early
conceptual level I moved on to axial coding; as examples, these might include

I then decided which

were the most important of my codes and categorize by bringing multiple codes
together under a preexisting code or a new one; and discarding some of the initial
codes.
From the most important remaining codes, I then categorized and began to
theorize based on relationships. To assist in this process I asked questions, make
comparisons about their properties and dimensions, and sketched to visually
represent theoretical configurations.227 At the end of this process I recombined the
data into tentative relationship-based themes, some of which would lead to
theories, and I subjected these themes to discourse analysis to identify critical
assumptions, processes, relationships, absences, and presences. This entire
process was performed iteratively at multiple times during the study, with theories
built, checked, kept if tentatively supported, and checked for theoretical saturation
against future data.

Broadly conceived, my analytical process was steeped in theoretical
notions of the social construction of history with an eye toward the use of these
notions to build better theory. While analyzing my data, I looked for moments
that showed ephemera-based history construction processes at the individual,
community, and cultural levels. Grounded in the data themselves, I looked for
connections between ephemera use and cultural roles, rituals, patterns, and
processes. Once those analytic moments were achieved I considered implications
for archives as place/thing/practice in terms of the archival scenario.
TRUST AND CREDIBILITY
Criteria for naturalistic inquiry in this work
Criteria for naturalistic inquiry formulated by Lincoln & Guba228 have
informed the design of the study, continue to influence study-related decisions,
and will be presented in reports to correspond with commonly referenced
positivist benchmarks for trustworthiness. These criteria have been formed in
parallel with positivist benchmarks for scientific inquiry, in acknowledgment that
such benchmarks are necessary but not neutral, and that for qualitative work can
be assured through more suitable ideals. In keeping with these criteria
benchmarks

credibility, dependability, transferability, and confirmability229 -

the goal of this research will not be generalizability but instead meaningful data
and transferable findings that may apply across similar contexts.

In this study I have worked toward credibility (which parallels positivist
validity) using techniques recommended by Lincoln and Guba including
prolonged engagement, persistent observation, triangulation, peer debriefing, and
member checks.230 I have remained engaged with the culture under study and
continue to engage them as a community and discuss my findings with them as
informal member checks. To further enhance credibility I have had a peer

This research has involved intense interplay with the social world of the
participants in this research and in the ASP, through involvement in the field and
targeted interviews. The importance of rapport cannot be overstated. In this study
I have been privileged to gain access to tacit knowledge, implicit meanings, and
intimate memories

matter rarely revealed outside the context of a trusting

relationship. My relationships with research participants have evolved across what
Pitts and Miller-Day have written are positive turning points in the development
of rapport,234 each of these points deepening the insights and tacit understandings
to which I as human instrument of the research could access. I am grateful to the
participants in this research for rich moments of interpersonal connection, mutual
respect, sharing of humor and a sense of both inclusion and partnership.235 These,
as much as enrichment of scholarly discourse, are treasured rewards in qualitative
fieldwork.

My history with this event
Prior to and including this research period, I have participated in the ASP
for sixteen years as an artist, organizer, and giant puppet performer, and this
experience informs how I see, interpret, and reflexively analyze this event. When

district, just north of the Union Pacific tracks that screamed with a few cargo
trains every hour. In these warehouses, artists replaced dwindling use by industry
with wood- and metal-working shops, rehearsal spaces, and live-work studios.
The rooves of these studios leaked enough to fill buckets in the summer
monsoons, and in many places the w

sprout sharp rebar edges or live electrical wiring. Yet these spaces were cheap and
occasionally communal; one warehouse hallway had shared refrigerator where
anyone could select from cases of dumpster-dived fruits and even packaged foods.
The spaces and culture in and around downtown Tucson were crucial
ingredients in the creation and growth of the ASP, and their existence attests to
the perseverance and even thriving of cultural processes in disappearing space.

educational activities to increase the attendance and public presence of the ASP.
The warehouse district where most ASP activities then took place was located
along the tracks and northeast of the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, just

Daly 132
north of downtown Tucson and west of the 4th Avenue retail district.236 This set of
hulking building was originally designed for industrial use, then purchased by the
Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) in the 1970s and 1980s in order to
be destroyed, eventually, to level space for a planned highway. As plans for the
roadway inched through delay after delay in the 1980s and 1990s, artists began
moving into the warehouses, paying low rents to ADOT or squatting.
It was thanks to the infusion of new energy drawn in part from new artists
in the warehouses that by the mid-1990s, Lydia was able cede organizational
control of the annual procession to other artists residing in the warehouse spaces.
From 2002 to 2007, three collectives of artists

BICAS, Flam Chen, and Tucson

Puppet Works organized the event working out of two neighboring warehouses
that all shared one outdoor parking lot/workspace.
By 2001 I had moved among the artists in the warehouses, paying
$150/month to live in a 100-square-foot room shut in by an industrial refrigerator
door, as mosquitoes that buzzed in and out through a single unscreened window.
It was the only place in Tucson I wanted to live, because it felt like a place, given
meaning by the low income artists who filled its spaces. Furthermore I felt
welcomed there

worked in the warehouse district frequently used to refer to their network of

numbered a few thousand participants  very few of them spectators  in the year
2000.
I first participated in the ASP in 2000 and 2001 and I volunteered as an
administrator and grant-writer for the event for several years after. I have
participated in most of the ASP annual events since then, and so I have witnessed
parade growth to tens of thousands of attendees, and its finale transformation
from a circle of perhaps 20 giant puppets and fire spinners to a highly technical
performance  with amplified music pumping from speakers, video projections,
and a brightly illuminated stage beneath a crane-suspended urn. I have watched
the event change radically over the past sixteen years, and I have not always felt
comfortable with its changes. Yet in my view it has retained its core as a
community expression of commemoration.
While the ASP presents an intriguing case of ephemeral commemoration
for archivists, my decision to study this event for my dissertation also stems from
my desire to understand the role of the ASP in my community and in our
construction of the past. I was immensely proud of my artistic and organizing
roles in this event from the years 2000 through 2004, but that legacy has grown

The ASP has been run by individuals or groups that have self-organized in
three overlapping phases. While some values and concepts have been emphasized
across all these phases, each new group of organizers has imbued the event with
particular motifs including the types of ephemeral media used to commemorate
histories in the event and the nature of these commemorations.
In the first phase of ASP organization, from 1990 until the late 1990s,
Lydia was the primary event organizer. In my interviews and online, Lydia and
Cody give conflicting accounts of whose ideas inspired the creation of the event;
however, it is undisputed that Lydia planned and organized the first ASP in 1990.
Lydia says that she also made all of the masks, costumes, and musical instruments
used in the first ASP. It was a three-day celebration in which roughly 25 to 35

Harbor, along with other losses in their lives.
Beginning in 1991, numerous artists worked with Lydia in organizing the
parade, including creation of masks and artistic objects, holding workshops, and
organizing the parade and ancillary events. According to a grant proposal
authored event organizers in 1991, artists and workshop instructors involved in
the event would include Cody as a lantern workshop instructor along with
instructors of workshops in movement, costume and body painting, and the

  

The first historic phase of the ASP began giving way to the second phase
in the mid-1990s, when Lydia began to cede her central role in organizing the
ASP to a group of artists intent on expanding the event. This dispersal of
leadership initiated the second phase of ASP organization which began in the
mid- to late-1990s and lasted until the mid-2000s. Puppeteers led by Todd held
free workshops teaching attendees to make masks and puppets for the growing
procession, the bicycling collective BICAS welded floats using bicycle parts, and
fire performers led by Tiana taught a new generation of students performative
techniques to be featured in a fiery procession finale.10 While from the outset the
ASP had culminated in a circle of puppets and fire performers that had been
involved in the event, in this second phase Tiana and the fire performers also
began organizing and performing in a live finale spectacle. 11
The third phase of organization began in the early- to mid- 2000s and
continues to the present day. In this phase the approximate number of attendees
rose from 5,000 to tens of thousands and perhaps over 100,000.12 This phase
solidified when Tiana and her partner Rodd spearheaded the formation of the nonprofit organization Many Mouths One Stomach (MMOS), with input from two of
the puppeteers who had been organizing the parade and other artists and
organizers who had been involved in the past.13 Today Tiana and Rodd have

Daly 137
become the central figures organizing and representing the ASP. Cody has
returned as an organizer directing sculpture workshops in which the primary
material is cardboard.14

to performances catering to the many thousands of new attendees watching and
participating in the event. A DJ, a video projection team, and the Hungry Ghost
troupe in charge of busking for street donations serve as both entertainment and
fundraisers. MMOS has a highly active online presence, creating and curating
content related to the ASP. The finale performance is watched by tens of
thousands and is designed around the climactic moment when an iron-and-paper
urn, full of paper memorial slips filled out by participants, is raised into the air by
a crane and burned.
Ephemeral media ASP participants use to commemorate

Through ethnographic study of the commemorative practices in the ASP, I
have found the practices around ephemeral media coalesce in specific categories
or types of use. For the sake of brevity and saturation in analytical findings, in this
study I have focused on three of the categories of ephemera used. The first type of
ephemera use I describe is paper, which participants use to commemorate in the
forms of papier machÃ© sculptures, cardboard sculptures, signs, flyers, prayer
cards, and messages to be burned in the urn. The second type of use I describe
is performance, including live music, movement including dance and fire
performance, and puppetry. Finally, I will describe the use of live music as an
ephemeral medium in the ASP. While these three types do not include all forms

Daly 138
of ephemeral media used in this event, I believe they convey the extent to which
this event is reliant on dynamic action centered on objects not intended to last.
Paper
Paper is a core ingredient in most material objects used to commemorate
in the ASP, and its use as a basic ingredient in the ASP workshops has influenced
both workshops attendees and a general aesthetic around objects created for
procession activities. The paper used in the ASP is not acid-free and does not
afford lasting preservation or even short-term preservation in the event of rain;
indeed, one of its affordances cited by informants in this research is the quality of
some forms of paper to lose their structure rather than preserving it.
Throughout ASP history but particularly in its second era, instructors
taught students to create puppets and masks of papier machÃ©. To create one of the

with clay - or inflate a balloon for a quicker, head-shaped form - and then cover it
with a papier machÃ© made of newspaper shreds or toilet paper pulp mixed with
other ingredients such as glue, flour, and water. The ephemeral nature of paper is
crucial in papier machÃ©, as explained by Rhonda when she stated that she prefers
to create machÃ© 

completed papier machÃ© object is theoretically durable enough to last through
multiple years of the parade, but practical reasons exist to make durability
problematic, including the difficulty of securing space and the likelihood that the
machÃ© will be eaten by another group of Tucson warehouse-dwellers: mice. A
final affordance of papier machÃ© that should be noted, which I observed and
experienced during participant observation, is the meditative quality of the
repetitive motions required to apply machÃ© all over a large object, motions which

Figure 7: Cardboard at the 2014 ASP

Another paper-based material used frequently to commemorate in the ASP
is cardboard. In the workshops in the first and third eras of the ASP, instructors
taught most attendees to create objects from cardboard, sometimes affixed to

Daly 141
other paper-based components. Examples of these cardboard-based objects
include costume pieces (such as crowns), replicas of deceased subjects or deathrelated objects (including pointy-eared dogs and a giant motorcycle) and altars.
The most popular and iconic cardboard form seen in the procession is the
lantern, which affords light and therefore visibility to the act and subjects of
commemoration when an inexpensive plastic tealight is placed within. The 1991
ASP grant proposal listed lantern workshops taught by Cody among the activities
funding would support. One popular design of lantern today in the ASP today is
based on a 2009 design by artist Paul Bagley for a lantern he made of wood. Cody
adapted the design to feature a cardboard frames and windows made of tissue
paper or printed photographs and made it the basis of many workshops, not only
for ASP activities but for events held in other cities by a network of artists
connected to the ASP community, as will be revisited in the discussion of themes
below.

Some uses of paper in the ASP have not been taught in workshops but
have evolved based on the affordances of paper that are useful in the
commemorative process. For example, paper is an effective method of simple
broadcasting of the subject of    

, for a community of fellow

mourners and witnesses. To maximize local witnesses reached by their
commemorative acts, many participants carry or install homemade signs made of
poster paper, featuring printed photographs which they have blown up or
assembled as collages. For more intimate interactions with community,
participants hand out paper-based flyers or prayer cards informing the reader of
their commemorative purpose or memorializing the deceased.
Finally, beginning in the third phase of ASP history, an extremely popular
use of paper has been in writing messages of remembrance to burn in the urn, an
ornate, globular steel vase which at 8 feet in both width and breadth has been

Daly 143
designed to accept a practically infinite number of paper offerings. According to
the MMOS website:
The Urn is the large steel vessel that is pulled at the front of the
Procession. The Urn is a receptacle for our mementos, prayers, messages,
and remembrances of those we have loved and lost. Escorting the Urn, you
will see the Urn Attendants members of the Community Spirit Group.
They are there to silently receive your messages and remembrances and
place them in the Urn for you.
At the culmination of the Finale, the Urn is burned, and our collective
hopes, prayers, love, grief, memories, tributes, and remembrances are
consumed by the flames and dissolve into the ether.241

themes drawn across this work I have found that the use of paper to commemorate
in the ASP is transformative, changing material of little value into objects of
engagement with the past and into witnessed commemorative transmissions.

Performance
The nature of artistic performance in the ASP has included music, dance
and body movement, puppetry, theatrical performance including costume, and fire
performance. Performances have included acts across the spectrum of preparation

Daly 145
from spontaneous to rehearsed. Some of these performances have assumed a
serious or even religious tone while others have been more playful. Individual and
small group performances have always been involved in the ASP, and in recent
years large group such as school extracurricular organizations have also
participated.
Several key influences have shaped the use of music for ephemeral
commemoration in the ASP. Leadership phases, for one, have heavily influenced
the nature of performances in the event, whether or not those performances were
officially organized by any MMOS leaders or groups. Other strong influences
have been community structure including the number of attendees, and the
affordances of place and space. Review of ASP performances across historic
phases is useful in conveying what this event has looked and felt like.
In the first phase of the ASP, Lydia and those parading with her designed
most performances to be fully participatory, to train attendees in the event as a
participation-based ritual. Attendees of ASP events in its first phase learned
performance techniques and received workshop instruction in designing parade
objects and costumes. They then used what they learned to perform together as a

multiple, decentralized performances distributed along the event at various times.
In this phase, many performers used street theater to draw spectators in as

Daly 146
spontaneous participants, and performance groups set up along key points to
entertain the mass of the parade itself. For example, in the second phase countless
performers used the top of the Fourth Avenue underpass as a stage on which to be
seen by the parade passing through the underpass beneath, entertaining those in
the parade and compelling many spectators on the sidewalks to join in.
In the third phase of ASP history including the present, MMOS functions
centrally both to coordinate individual and group placement in the parade and to
organize movement-    

      

organizational strategy - countless individuals and small groups still show up
outside of MMOS coordination and there is no restriction of their performing in
the parade  but centralized coordination of performances functions to space apart
large groups with high visual or aural impact. Since the ASP reached a threshold
of popularity in the beginning of the third phase, it has drawn the participation of
large institution-based groups, such as high school mariachi ensembles and flanks
of folklorico dancers in swirling skirts.
In addition to outside performances the ASP features scores of MMOSorganized performances, which advance the MMOS mission in several highly
visible channels. One of these channels is the Hungry Ghost Busking Troupe,
tasked with collecting donations for MMOS and entertaining attendees with
performative acts including stiltwalking and street theater. A second highly
visible channel of performance for MMOS is the Urn Attendant Spirit Group, a
group in ornate, themed costumes who walk alongside the urn in the procession
and wordlessly collect papers to be burned in the urn. A third MMOS

Daly 147
performance channel which combines nearly all MMOS performers is the finale
performance, in which all MMOS-organized subgroups appear together on a stage
in a performance that culminates in the burning of the urn and its contents.
Live music
Music in the ASP is interpretively derived from the traditions of various
subcultures and cultures, including the developing culture of the ASP community
itself as the event has grown. That is, the many musical performances fall in line
with one of two signature sounds of the ASP: either amateur musicianship or
reverent world music. Amateur musicianship was a defining feature of the first
two phases of the ASP, when many of its musicians were either self-taught or
learned their craft in short workshops; for example, Thomas remembers that
Lydia recruited some participants in the early processions by simply handing
them instruments.243 Perhaps following this cue, by the first year I participated in
the ASP in 2000, the music of growing numbers of untrained musicians lent the
parade atmosphere a giddy offkey wobble, reminiscent of swirling around on a
musical carousel or playing a warped vinyl record.
However, this amateur musicianship grew less pronounced as the second
phase of the event morphed into the third and the event attracted more established
musical groups to participate, including the University of Arizona Marching Band
in 2011. Additionally, at least since 2015 the assembling of the parade has
become a street party with a well-known local Mexican-American DJ playing

cumbias and other Latin American styles including new artists from Mexico City
and speaking to the crowd in Spanish and English.
The reverent world music style has been favored by performers since at
least 1991, the second year of the ASP when the grant to Tucson Partnership was
submitted. In the proposal were details of a music workshop as follows:
The main musical instruments used for the procession and workshop will
be small transverse (side-blown) bamboo flutes and drums from many
cultures....The emphasis of the workshop will be creative individual
expression within a group setting, producing a global ensemble sound - a
blending of the contemporary American individual with the roots of many
world cultures.244

consistent across the phases of ASP history to the present day. Groups of
bagpipers have been part of the ASP since I witnessed their participation in the
second phase of the event, and possibly before. While not all the imported cultural
musical traditions are reverent or dramatic, by the mid-2000s the drama has been
consistently high at the finale, with heartstrings played in recent years by
renowned performers of didgeridoo, taiko drumming, and Tibetan throat singing.

and represented cultures. First, both the amateur and dramatic styles have favored
resounding percussion, with participants using drums, bells, and vocal rhythms
sung or shouted in unison. Second, the fluctuation of sound has played a crucial
role in the event for participants due to the architecture of an important
passageway in the parade: The underpass. Downtown Tucson has two tunnels that

pass under the Union Pacific railroad tracks, the Fourth Avenue underpass and the
Sixth Avenue underpass. Since at least the beginning of the second phase of the
ASP the parade has passed through one of these underpasses every year. In the
underpass the sound of the parade is amplified as it resounds against the cement
walls, and participants add to the cacophony by emitting thunderous noise
including shouts, screeches, whistles, and by furiously pummeling or honking
their instruments. Through these acts of soundmaking, participants and organizers
of the ASP have constructed immersive moments and sites in which to
commemorate.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND MOVING FORWARD
In this chapter, I have worked to provide a detailed overview of this study
as well as its personal and historic context, and to give a descriptive overview of
the use of ephemera in the ASP. In the next chapter, I share my findings. Focusing
on the nature and use of ephemera in this community setting, I explore what I
have observed and learned as a case of community commemoration imbued with
meanings related to its location as a large cultural and geographic border.
Additionally, I contextualize what I have observed and learned of the historic
development of the ASP in the use of ephemera as social history construction.

CHAPTER 5: FINDINGS
In this chapter, I present findings from my case study of the ASP as an
event in which community membership boundaries are fluidly drawn by
commemorative use of ephemeral objects and performance. I present analytical
findings around the commemorative use of ephemera as themes, situated in the
ASP as a case study that I have analyzed through immersion in the ASP
community, interviews with ASP organizers and participants, and discourse
analysis of documents. I focus my interpretive analysis of these themes on the
roles, rituals, and meanings that underlie commemorative uses of ephemera in the
ASP, and contextualize them within the three historic phases of the ASP
described earlier in this work. In the next chapter, Chapter 6, I discuss these
themes and analyses in the context of current understandings of history

THEMES IN THIS WORK
I have identified two overarching themes around ephemeral
commemoration evident in the fieldnotes, interviews, and documents I analyzed
for this dissertation. In the first of these themes ephemera are vehicles for a
commemorative technique that members of the ASP community call processing 
contextualized here as processing the past. I define processing the past as
interpreting and transmitting experiences of loss through bodily participation in
community rituals. The second theme hinges on the ways these rituals soften ASP
community boundaries, easing their crossing in terms of both inclusion and

Daly 151
rejection of members. For the remainder of this section I present these themes
processing the past and softening community boundaries and their subthemes
individually while also noting how they have built upon and connected to one

many ways ephemeral commemoration functions for the ASP community as a
means for challenging outside definitions of their event and for creating their own
historic records using objects, performance, and the claiming of cultural and
geographic territory.
COMMEMORATING JANUARY 8TH, 2011: AN ILLUSTRATED EPIGRAPH
I first began to understand why ephemeral commemoration was important
in the ephemera-based ASP when speaking with Rhonda245, a volunteer instructor
for ASP mask- and puppet-making workshops. She was talking about
commemoration around a local tragedy: Three years before my 2014 interview
with Rhonda, a shooter had stormed into a Tucson Safeway grocery store toting a
semi-automatic pistol, shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in the head and
killed six other people including a nine-year-old girl, Christina-Taylor Green.246
The shootings and the community response that followed were poignant
for the small city of Tucson, and was taken up in public political discourse for
years beyond that tragic afternoon. For months after the shooting, visitors left

on the lawn of the hospital where Giffords, Green, and other victims had

been rushed from the scene. Eventually a foundation that had been established to
build a more permanent memorial gathered the ephemera from that hospital lawn
and, acknowledging the importance of the ASP in commemoration of local
events, gave some of the ephemera to Rhonda and other ASP volunteers.
When I first individually interviewed Rhonda, she was building a float to
feature these ephemera. Rhonda is a former science teacher in her fifties with
short hair in graying waves, and as she spoke of the float she attended to the

wonder about that because I just keep thinking of that week the shooting
happened, and then I had to go to Phoenix for a week. It was the most
aggravating heart-wrenching thing I have ever been through, seriously,
being separated from my community. I never, ever felt part of a
community that I needed to be-I was horror stricken, and I needed to be
with my people. I needed to be with people who were processing the
same thing.

some of the ways that the commemorative use of ephemera ( whether material or
performed ( runs in a dynamic circuit with personal and cultural healing,
community boundaries, and living histories. By recognizing and expressing the
past through ephemera, the ASP community takes control over all aspects of this
dynamic healing circuit: constructing, acknowledging, and transmitting histories
participants commemorate.
PROCESSING THE PAST THROUGH EPHEMERAL COMMEMORATION
One salient theme in my study of ephemeral commemoration in the ASP is
that community members engage in and promote cathartic building processes, and
refer to these activities as processing the past. As a number of interviewees
suggested, to process signifies taking control of personal experiences of the past
through engagement of the body in ephemeral expressions, such as papier-mÃ¢chÃ©
assembly of a giant puppet or carrying a 25-lb puppet throughout the two-mile
Procession.249 In the next sections, I demonstrate that processing the past is a

the term "process" with a similar meaning was also used by two other

of the past, deepen their own involvement in the ASP, and acknowledge the

The ASP as personal and cultural processing of the past

creation of the ASP according to Lydia. A professional artist and student of

quick sentences punctuated with humor. An Anglo woman in her sixties, with
flowing grayish hair, large eyes, and a raspy voice, Lydia is someone I have
considered a distant friend since I moved to Tucson in 2000. During the interview
we occasionally helped one another remember the names of places and the precise
years of events, yet it was not until this interview that I learned how deeply
influenced Lydia had been by Carl Jung when she organized the first ASP in
1990, and how essential processing the past became in the event as a result.
Lydia had attended the School of the Art Institute in Chicago in the 1970s
and 1980s and had earned   

disseminated Jungian notions of art therapy through ritual to the early ASP

interviewees in Leslie Ann Epperson's documentary film about the ASP entitled
Many Bones, One Heart (SmallWheel Films, 2015).

The intentions toward both personal and cultural processing of the past
would remain central to the ASP as it turned into an annual event. Lydia
organized the ASP throughout its first historic phase, and focused on intimacy to
nurture personal processing, and education to enact cultural processing. Thomas,

deep voice and a slow, deliberate style of speaking, who with fellow members of
his puppetry collective taught many newcomers to the ASP community !
including myself in 2000 ! to create giant wearable papier mÃ¢chÃ© puppets. Over

connection with event rituals:
What drove me to start to hold workshops was an interest in adding some
structure to the All Souls parade. I quickly learned - we quickly learned that making something in honor of a loved one or even in the image of a
loved one was really helpful for people to process their grief.261
Participants learning in workshops from Todd and his co-instructors often chose
to model the puppets they built in the image of a lost family member, friend, or
pet, and they engaged in personal processing of these past losses as they did so.

participants to process personal histories and learn techniques to makes histories
social, to interact and integrate with the histories of other participants. Meanwhile,
organizers of the parade look beyond the personal; ASP organizers view the ASP
as an aesthetic cultural form, and its educational aspects as shaping the

ephemera, and as demonstrated in the next section, the cultural influence and
healing it enacts are important enough to organizers to function as capital.
Benefits of processing the past
1. Cultural currency as capital
Processing the past is also shaping of the present and future. The value of
shaping the culture that informs and contains the ASP community is salient
enough in the organizers perspectives I analyzed that it has become a form of
capital. In four interviews I analyzed (including the interview with Todd from the
Many Bones, One Heart discussed above), the value created by cultural
processing of the past is connected to the present and the future. The shaping of
culture is an impetus volunteer ASP organizers cite as the reason they do that
unpaid work.
One informant who connected the shaping of culture with capital was
Cody, an Anglo, curly-haired professional artist in his fifties. In a 2014 solo

discussed the volunteer nature of the ASP as a cultural anomaly:
It's not a profit-making venture. You're not going to make money out of it.
You may break even and that's as good as it's going to get. We get other
things back that to us are intangible. (musical interlude) For the majority
of people in this society, what is wealth is money, and they do not
calculate cultural currency. They don't calculate what they consider to be
precious or important in this culture in any other way but through money.
And this organization doesn't make a lot of money.265

2. The parade as rite of passage
Another benefit to processing the past through ephemera is the function of
processing activities as rites of passage for the ASP community. Through its
constitution in ephemeral materials and experiences, the parade itself is seen by
some of its organizers as a self-renewing cultural product that also functions as a
ritual validating community membership and drafting volunteer labor. For
example, in an interview with me in his studio in December 2015 Todd asked me
repeatedly during our interview to convey to Tiana and Rodd - the current ASP

potential illegitimacy to the weakening of the parade as a cultural product. Also in
his talk is a sense of importance tied to the legitimacy of the event, showing the

connected roles in cultural processing, and through these connected roles, the

Commemoration of the Braceros by a woman in the ASP in 2015 (as

The conscripting of Mexican men as US labor in the Bracero Program was also

The woman who remembered the impact of that grueling work

on her father centralized the physicality of the Bracero experience as she
described it on the ASP website:
My dad worked primarily in California picking cotton. That was hard
work because they had long bags that they carried across their chest and
dragged across the fields filling them up with cotton. They weighed so
much that it was very tiring. Another time he worked cutting ice. He was
taken to a frozen lake and workers had to cut large cubes of ice. My dad
always blamed that job for his problems with arthritis, because he said it
was so cold that he could feel the cold go through his work boots and
socks.

processing described in the previous section, and is forged through them. To

collective sense of community composition.272
In this section, I interrogate the sense of community in the ASP and its
relationship to ephemera used in the event. In particular, I analyze key meanings
of community conveyed by informants in this study, and demonstrate the reasons
fluid community boundaries are crucial in this event. Furthermore, I document the
ways in which engagement with ephemeral commemoration and parade work
pulls and pushes participants across ASP community boundaries.
Fluid, permeable community boundaries are important for the survival and
growth of the ASP. As the event has grown by thousands each year it has
demanded proportional growth in its collection of organizers and volunteers, and
these are drawn from the wider community of ASP attendees. The changing
demographics and cultural interests of Tucsonans have also demanded that the
ASP community grow in specific directions, to connect with demographic,
economic, ethnic, and cultural populations that may not have been involved in the

itself has many overlapping meanings

across the interviews and documents in ASP-related discourse, and analyzing all
of those meanings could be a dissertation on its own. However, in the data I have
analyzed in this study I have found two senses of community particularly salient
due to their distinct functions relating to ephemera and histories. One of these is
rejecting community, and the other is inviting community. Following these two
distinct senses and using ephemeral expressions as tools, ASP organizers and
participants promote beliefs and histories to support the assertion that the
community at the core of the ASP is not permanent; that it can and should change.
Rejecting community
Rejecting community is a subtheme I found in my study of ephemeral
commemoration in the ASP, reflecting a rejection of or by outsiders or inactive
members, while leading  

While rejection can be a cruel component of community life, without rejection
community membership is meaningless.273 One facet of rejecting community is
the adherence to one community in response to comparison with an outside group
or place. For Rhonda, processing the aftermath of the January 8th shooting while
traveling outside of Tucson led directly to her sense that Tucson had become her
home, and soon after to her decision to commit significant time to the ASP
community as a volunteer.

papier mÃ¢chÃ© puppets in ASP workshops each year. In the film, as she tells the
following to the filmmaker her voice grows thick with emotion:
This time of year, it's all I do. After work, when I wake up, weekends, I
live and breathe the All Souls Procession. My puppets are made for two
reasons. The ones are - the ones of the past. Then the [other] ones are
relationships with family. And they are still living, but I don't have the
relationships anymore. So in a sense those are also - dead relationships.
It's based on my sexual preference. They've chosen to push me aside. And
it just amazes me how I get more respect from complete strangers than my
family.
Marisol does not refer to herself as being part of any community, but she
nonetheless practices ASP rituals faithfully and devotes massive amounts of work
to them. I remember her from the mask- and puppet-making workshops in the
early 2000s learning puppet-building from Todd and Stephen, and have noted that

her partner in the film:

stand out as permeable by comparison.

A third facet of rejecting community is rejection via replacement of former
community members. While ASP organizers define the event as inclusive of all
who want to be involved, some replacement of former core organizers has been
necessary for the ASP community. One reason is that as time has passed, some
core organizers of the ASP have moved away, or passed away. Other former
ASP-community members have remained in Tucson but become occupied with
other activities like childrearing that leave them little time for ASP volunteering.
The capacity to easily replace former ASP organizers with newer members could

living histories to currently active organizers.
The replacement capacity of the ASP community was illuminated when I

focus was on the lives of the current organizers of the ASP, Tiana and Rodd. The
film devotes very little time to the first phase of ASP history; it devotes even less
time - just a minute or two - to the decade-long second phase of ASP history when
Todd was its Artistic Director and a crucial organizer, from the mid-1990s to
around 2005.
As a researcher of ASP history, I knew that a lack of records from that
time period may have led to the scarce representation of the second phase of ASP
history in the film; yet as a former ASP community member who has treasured
memories of the that era, I was reflexive in my experience of this film and noted
my own reaction to the near deletion of a large time period in the story. I was
also keenly aware of Todd watching the film next to me, imagining it might feel
worse to him

but for much of his brief time on the screen he is dourly explaining why he chose
to lessen his involvement in the event:
When I stepped down, it was really like, This feels too big for me, and it
feels like we're spending out of our means. I don't want half the year trying
to pay for one thing that happened in the fall.279

suited for ASP community membership. Yet however unkind such exclusion
might feel, the survival of the ASP in its current form has depended upon the fluid
boundaries of its community and the dynamic representation of its history. These
have been negotiated in part through the rejection of some former understandings

The inviting community
I found another sense of community in my study of ephemeral
commemoration in the ASP. This sense, which facilitates permeable community
boundaries and the growth of ASP, is the inviting community, extended by ASP
organizers and insiders toward those who are outsiders but invited to be involved.

While Lydia had included students and fellow artists in the first phase of ASP
history, which by numerous accounts had around thirty people,283 this effort at
expansion seems to have been designed to include those who were not artists.
This series of meetings lowered the bar for participation and softened ASP
community boundaries.
There is still an explicitly welcoming, come-as-you-are quality to ASP
workshops that in my observations has drawn many members of society excluded
from traditional structures to get involved. ASP events tend to draw participants
who are poor or mentally ill, perhaps because these events have always been free
and located near areas where the impoverished congregate, such as downtown

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND MOVING FORWARD
In this analysis of one case of community expression, I have analyzed the
roles of ephemera as vehicles for a commemorative technique that members of the
ASP community call processing the past

 interpreting and transmitting

experiences of loss through bodily participation in community rituals. I have
demonstrated that these rituals soften ASP community boundaries, easing their
crossing in terms of both rejection and inclusion. Overall, I have found that the
ASP is an event in which community members keep membership boundaries fluid
and dependent on engagement through commemorative use of ephemeral objects
and performance. In this work I have uncovered the processing and boundary
blurring that happens for a population in the Southwest U. S. I have argued that
this case of a community expression exemplifies how communities exist in
negative archival space, and how in spite of their existence in that particular
space, they perform archival scenarios that transmit their histories.

ephemera-based processes, this community creates their own historic records as
an archival scenario with ephemeral objects and performances, persistently
claiming agency over community identity and culture as they do so.
In the next chapter, too, I reconsider existing theory around archives and
community given the findings presented in this chapter. Archival theorists are
working against the history of exclusion in archives by envisioning community as
a new archival paradigm290 and acknowledging community expressions as records
of the past. 291 However, effective archival work with communities that would
advance communities inclusion in and relationships with archives must proceed
from a foundation of understanding of community memory practices, particularly
for populations historically left out of archives.

THE ARCHIVE AS PLACE, THING, AND PRACTICE

Daly 187
From my study of the ASP I have learned that the community expression
in negative archival space functions as an archive in several important respects.
As presented in the previous chapter, the ASP community is formed through
rituals of processing the past and fluid negotiations of community membership
around the ASP event. Overall, these rituals enable persistently engaged
community members to frame the past in ways that fit within current community
objectives.
On a more granular level, the ASP event itself represents holistic archival
scenario play, or performance of the archive as place/thing/practice. 292 The ASP
community ephemerally projects the archival place across local spaces as an
annually renewed store of community memory. With place established, the
community then locates memory in the remembered ephemeral thing as it
occupies that place. Finally, core members of the ASP community play at archival
practice, selecting and creating records to transmit their desired histories within
the temporal spaces they persistently define. In this section, I demonstrate all of
these types of scenario play, and argue that through them the ASP community
retains dynamic agency over its own identity and history, through explicit

I rely on ephemeral objects and performances as well as narratives

to temporally define and control spaces as places in this work. The humanistic
view of space attributes agency and meaning-making to its occupants in ways that
accommodate these participant-constructed meanings. I interpret the humanistic
definition of space to grant that spaces are often defined by the empowered and
authorized though I also acknowledge the potential for spaces to be reimagined
and reconstructed by collective action and memory.
For community expressions like the ASP, collective memory is anchored
in the occupation of public space. Schwartz has argued that collective memory

move you through the rest of the year and move you through your culture
in a different way. You know, just knowing that your relationship to all
these people in this weird little city was that one night.295
Tiana credits the making of ephemeral things and performances in the renewal of
relationships within and to the city. From her account we can interpret the
archival place as a figurative reservoir of memory projected onto public space.
This is construction of the archival place.
Todd also speaks of renewal when recounting his early involvement in the
ASP, describing its writing of history on public spaces as transformative of the
spaces themselves:

lives, throughout the rest of the year, we feel different about moving,
living in those working in those spaces.296
In these accounts ephemeral commemorative rituals are perceived as projections
with lasting images for those who use the spaces afterward. These projections
become a form of urban renewal in the eye of the occupant when structural urban
renewal changes are slow in coming. In the downtown Tucson area there are
many alleys, lots, and abandoned loading docks sprouting unruly grass and rebar.
It is across these broken landscapes that participants construct and project

transpired in a set of edifices known as the warehouse district, located along the

memorable activities have been destroyed.
I remember many of structures that hosted ASP activities. I remember that
the parade gathered at the headquarters of a local nonprofit called Muse in 2000
and 2001, and ended at the Mat Bevel Institute during those years; both of those
buildings have now been leveled, one eventually replaced with student housing
and the other with nothing but flattened earth. I also remember that, beginning in
2002 or 2003, raucous art workshops took place in the north building of the Sixth
Street Studios; that site is now also leveled. For me, some of these structural
disappearances were jarring: Muse, where I embarked on the procession for the
first time 2000, was not only leveled within several years  it was obliterated into
a giant, canyonlike hole in the ground that induced vertigo in me each time I
passed. These physically shifting landscapes were enacted by the empowered who
owned them and endured by the powerless who used them.

clearer at a key moment when the parade outgrew the sidewalk.
Tiana: I think once you've stepped out of your house onto the sidewalk it's
political and it's social because you're not in your own little bubble
anymore. You've taken it out and that was always, the mission was that it
doesn't exist in a private sphere. Not interested in that. It's not inside a
gallery where you pay the ticket. It's not a gated event. It's not any of those
things. It's really important that it's out in the public sphere. And so it
absolutely is political because that space doesn't belong to us. You know,

I mean the cops hated it. There was a lot of people and there was a lot of
floats and the floats were really big. I think Todd and Gregory had built a
skull so it didn't fit on the sidewalk. And because it was so big and
everybody was assembling, I remember on Fourth Avenue in particular
everybody just started spilling out onto the streets because it was so big.
But I didn't have a permit for us to use the streets so the cops came in and
started to actually hit, started hitting Todd's bike with the cruiser, with the

space occupancy of all of the ephemeral components of the parade did turn the
tables in a sense on the local authorities: Beginning the following year, organizers
were able to sufficiently capitalize on the growing popularity of the parade to help
them pay the local police to patrol (or rather, not interfere with) the ASP on the

their performances have deeper cultural resonance when they enact them in public

will better perform as records that transmit histories if in doing so they meet the
resistance of authorities.307 Through writing countercultural histories onto

Playing at archival practice
Through projecting the archival place across public spaces and locating
memory in the archival thing, the ASP community plays at archival practice: By
selecting and creating records, the ASP community retains dynamic agency over
its identity and history. This is most clear in their resistance of outside attempts at
defining the event's history, in favor of dynamic definitions from within. When
ASP participants play the role of archivists, there is little focus on society at large;
instead, their community plays the role of the society they serve. Viewed as a case
of a community expression, this retention of dynamic authorship over accounts of
the past can empower communities to construct prized histories, but it can also
distort the past, by erasing histories that do not suit current community objectives.
Place-based commemoration represents a contest of the desires to
remember and to forget. Archival theorist Kenneth Foote has written of these
negotiations as they pl                

The value of turning to episodes of violence and tragedy lies in the fact
that the memory of such events is so prone to be held in tension. A
society's need to remember is balanced against its desire to forget, to leave
the memory behind and put the event out of mind.
In archival practice the tension between remembering and forgetting plays out as
many decisions regarding which aspects of an event to commemorate and which
to leave out. In constructing histories of events through rituals of processing, ASP
participants replay the past like an internal reels of film, and wield selective
agency over which scenes to replay. In my 2014 interview with Rhonda, she
acknowledged such agency as she described the evolution of her ephemeral
sculpture commemorating the January 8th shootings.
At first, it was going to be kind of like a graceful, sinewy puppet that had
some whirling movement to it when you're walking down the street.

practices that scholars of history and archives have discussed as trends in modern
commemoration. Some of this scholarship, discussed at length in the second
chapter of this work, focuses community archives and expressions, lauding them
for empowering previously disenfranchised communities.312 Other scholarship is
more critical of community- and user-centered collections - particularly of the
expectation embedded within them that current perceptions should be folded
around evidence of the past. In this study I have found that both the supportive
and critical views of community archives and expressions are important to keep in
mind if archival scholars are to work effectively with community archives in coconstructing community histories. Using this complex approach, in the next
section I review critical scholarship around modern populist archiving, apply it to

only related to these populist online archives; in recent years, as images and

Online and offline, archivists who would work with communities in coconstructing their histories may need to negotiate the ephemeral community
archive as both a reservoir of memory and a place of personal processing.
Scholars of archives as well as historians have questioned whether populist trends
in institutional archives suit the society-level mission of memory institutions. The
rapid development of informational and social media technologies has helped

stories, casting each personincluding exhibit visitorsas a witness to
the attacks and immediate aftermath. In focusing on what each person
witnessed in a discrete period of time, exhibit designers eschewed
historical and geopolitical contexts.320
These trends can be seen as evidence that the archival paradigm Cook identified
as cultural memory remains a dominant force in archives.321 As seen in the second
chapter of this work that under the paradigm of cultural memory, the inclusion of
large quantities of evidence allows archives to present their collections as
universal and elide transparency in selection decisions. Just as Tiana noted above
that performing on the street is always political, so have scholars shown that
public online spaces are always political; 322 yet by enabling user-uploaded
content, curators who manage these populist archival spaces can present faÃ§ades
of neutrality.

The All Souls Procession is a participatory archive, similar in their usercentered design to American digital archives collecting witness narratives around
September 11th terrorist attacks and around Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.323
Recuber has noted that such participatory archives follow the database model,
inviting any member of the public to be involved in the commemoration of an
historic moment.324 Both these digital archives and the All Souls Procession
present invitations to the public to contribute their memories and to be seen doing

enabling formal archives to appear to represent all histories around an event

about selection are thus deferred and obscured in the participatory archive model,
leading to a digital wash of individual memories that few ever see.

accounts can become part of the archive  albeit without being described,
subjected to any serious historic contextualization, or even necessarily seen by a
professional curator. There is a feeling of empowerment as spectators become
participants  a transformation at the root of the ASP mission327  whether what
they join is a parade, a museum exhibit, or an archive. Furthermore, acting as a
community using ephemera to engage collective memory plays out in the All
Souls Procession as a strategy by which individuals achieve more power in
defining the past. Archivists endeavoring to work with communities will have to
negotiate these expectations of both individual and community-level
empowerment with their mission to preserve histories  for in the populist model
of archives, some histories are still forgotten.

which the cultural framework that supporting the understanding of events is

which some histories constructed and transmitted in it focus on the development
of the event itself. Because this history is recent  beginning in 1990 its  the

eras reveals competing and

disappearing histories that archivists must navigate carefully when working with
communities. In the next section, I highlight two of these and their implications
for archives.
The disappearing second phase of ASP history
Based on my study of the ASP I surmise that the second phase of its
history is disappearing from collective memory. In addition some of the data
presented in previous chapters, many accounts of the ASP that I have seen for the
last several years show this jump over the second phase of its history, describing
the beginnings of the event and then focusing on more current descriptions. One
of these is the film Many Bones, One Heart, and this discussion elaborates on

          the historic account on the current ASP website.331
One explanation for the disappearance of the second phase of ASP history before
the first phase is that origins hold more importance in cultural and sociopolitical
identity than does historic development.332
A second explanation I offer for the forgetting of the second phase of ASP
history is that the reliance on ephemera to transmit histories predicts ephemeral
disappearances of those histories  both because ephemera may not last long and
because those who commemorate with ephemera tend to do so in the spirit of
immediacy. The mask- and puppet-making workshops were the center of the
event in the second phase of the ASP, run by organizers in their twenties in leaky
warehouses that discouraged preservation of any sort. These years are the phase

raucous creativity I also remember well from this period was inseparable from a
subcultural taste for cleansing and renewal by core ASP organizers at the time.334
Stephen reminded me that much of the evidence of that period perished not
because of its inherent composition but because the workshop organizers
periodically burned their creations. I asked:
DD:

Why did you burn puppets?

Stephen:

it based on a shared philosophic text. Stephen and Todd  both core organizers in

history (from its beginnings in 1990 through approximately 1995), I have seen a

these reflect the cultural attitude in those years that photographs were prized

that the event was named the All Souls Procession rather than a Day of the Dead
event because it was intended to be multicultural, engaging the local art
community in distinct ways, and drawing on a variety of traditions. Yet DÃ­a de los
Muertos remained a popular framework for understanding the event; I remember
that the ASP was sometimes referred to as a Day of the Dead parade by
organizers and participants when I first participated in 2000, and documentation
of this naming history includes advertisement in 1999 as both Day of the Dead
and DÃ­a de los Muertos, found in a notebook of old ASP flyers and media (Figure
15) currently in the custody of Tiana. Whether or not the roots of this public
understanding and naming history are with Cody, they are deeply embedded in
this parade.349 Again, what can be seen here is a particular casting of the nature of
the ASP, one linked with DÃ­a de los Muertos

and one that would be disavowed

in ASP-related literature by organizers, for numerous and complex reasons.

almost as old as the ASP itself. The origins of the ASP as organized primarily by
Anglos, juxtaposed with the sea of calaveras and other Mexican-inspired iconic
images parade goers have increasingly chosen to wear and carry, have challenged
public support of the event. Maya, a Latina musician and activist, spoke in a 2015
interview with me of a series of organizational outreach meetings she attended
around 1995, that were dedicated to growing the event and deciding what it
should be called.

The thing that I remember the most about [that series of meetings]
the question of what to call it. And how to really present it as an eclectic
sort of celebration in the community, that really was inviting people from
all ways of thinking and believing and cultures and cities and even
religions to participate in. The debate that I still hear going on was
happening then and it was interesting. And that was the debate over

and asked whether it was cultural appropriation, to which an ASP organizer
replied as follows:
Our proximity to MX--creates a natural fusion of cultures--for sure--but I
can say that we get no City Support--         

Some more quick beta: We do not hold the event on Nov 1 or 2---to avoid
any pitfalls with our Latino friends--this point; however, does make our
biggest critics--anglo folks--very upset.
Many other cultures celebrate and honor their dead at this juncture of the
year as well.
Any outlet to remember our ancestors is good--esp for westerners who
lack that ability and/or outlet for that expression. thanks for the
conversation!356
This type of organizational response shows that organizers are aware of critical
discourse around the event, and work to manage criticism of the ASP online. ASP
attendees and organizers take advantage of the populist nature of the online
archive, to ensure records of the ASP reflect the perspective of current community
leaders.

The challenge forgotten histories present for archivists
Overall, the controversy around ethnicity and the ASP reveal that
communities present distinct challenges for archivists and scholars due to their
fluid structures. Addressing the effacement of association with DÃ­a de los Muertos
in the ASP would require tentative work by archivists engaging with the ASP
community. First, the archivist might acknowledge that organizers have been
working to diversify the body of ASP participants and organizers, through
permeable community boundaries and inviting community found in my recent
study of the ASP as analyzed in the previous chapter. The archivist might then
measure in earnest whether the work of those organizers has been successful,
keeping in mind that there has not yet been any serious demographic survey of
ASP     . 

 

      

participants today, it is difficult to judge who is participating.
I conclude by offering an anecdotal perspective on what I perceive as
notable changes in demographics of the ASP community, and a perspective on
how archivists can learn from this case of a dynamic, ephemera-centered event. I
offer this perspective in order that readers can consider these findings in relation
to other forgotten histories. In the 2013 ASP, I took on and modeled DÃ­a de los
Muertos iconography when I wore a giant calavera (skull) puppet constructed by
Todd. I had worn large puppets in the ASP before, but never until I performed the
calavera had I been stopped by so many parade goers to pose with them in
photographs  and never had such a large portion of those I interacted with at the
ASP been Mexican-American families. As these groups of parade goers posed

Daly 219
beside me, they did not seem concerned that an Anglo woman was performing the
puppet; they were much more interested in the role I was playing and how that
came through in the photograph. While I recognize the critiques tied to issues of
cultural appropriation and see the merit of those concerns, my own performance
in this instance illuminated the personal meetings and potential importance of the
mask, the ritual, and the display for parade goers.
The ASP grows by thousands of participants each year, transmitting
countless histories through ephemeral commemoration. In this complex scenario,
community proclamations of inclusivity characterize the path organizers have
chosen toward making this event more inclusive. Archivists who would work with
communities will likely witness many tensions around culture that are similar to
those already in play between organizers, academics, performers, and community
members. In any case, accounting for the past is an essential step toward
community empowerment. Overall, the mission of archivists working with

and that they retain societal context, all the while allowing that community to
define its own culture and to change that definition.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND MOVING FORWARD
In this chapter I have discussed the direct historic implications of this case
community-based ephemeral commemoration considered as an archive. As
discussed in preceding chapters of this work, archival theorists are working
against the history of exclusion in archives by envisioning community as a new

Daly 220
archival paradigm357 and acknowledging community expressions as records of the
past. 358 However, the effective archival work with communities that would
advance this paradigm must proceed from a foundation of understanding of
community memory practices, particularly for populations historically left out of
archives and therefore relegated to negative archival space. This work has been
based on my assertion that communities whose histories are excluded from formal
archives

communities in negative archival space like the ASP community of

organizers and participants

still perform archival scenarios that transmit their

histories. Through analysis of these histories and communities, I have worked to
advance community as a new archival paradigm and to anchor communities of
records as veritable archives. In the next and final chapter I raise areas of inquiry
for the future, and I also point to ways to build on this early scholarship and move
it forward.

In this work I have analyzed an annual community event, the All Souls
Procession, as ephemeral history construction, or an ephemeral archive. Using
scenario as a theoretical lens and archives as a backdrop, I have found two
overarching themes in the discourse around ephemeral commemoration in this
event: processing the past and softening community boundaries. Through these
techniques around ephemeral commemoration, the ASP community builds
dynamic membership, resists authority, and constructs new histories through
ephemera and their resulting occupation of space. Thus a community can enact
their own archival scenario with ephemeral objects and performances, and
persistently claim agency over community identity and culture as they do so.
ANSWERING QUESTIONS RAISED BY THIS WORK
In this section, based on the research I have conducted and presented here,
are tentative answers to the three research questions guiding this study. My first
question raised previously focused on how ephemera are used in ASP events as
commemorative community expressions, and this work finds that they are used to
anchor collective memory while constituting community boundaries. Those who
slips

hold, construct, and perform ephemeral objects and documents in the event
of paper, puppets, photographs printed at home, to name a few

signify their

intention to participate in the transmission of collective memory through this

continuously being destroyed and rebuilt to involve newer community members
in the anchoring of collective memory. With community membership defined as
volunteerism in ASP events, it is essential that the anchor for community be
iconic of this event yet persistently updated to reflect those who work and
contribute at the moment. Iconic ephemera thus anchor the community, attracting
newcomers to a unified theme and then engaging them in constructing it, as its
ephemeral building blocks must be regularly recreated.
The All Souls community has also used ephemera to occupy property and
authority. Abandoned warehouses and public streets and alleys have offered
ostensible space for the ASP community to gather and build, but these spaces (or

large ephemeral objects and memorable performances has allowed the ASP
community to claim territory across space (through object mass) across time

The second research question posed for this project focused on how the
history of the ASP has been shaped around the commemorative use of ephemera
in relationship with recorded documents. This study finds that this ASP history is
most frequently presented in media and in organizational literature in a single
master narrative centered around highly visible and memorable ephemera-based
artistic traditions. That narrative begins

with ephemera-based objects and costumes. The narrative ends with the event as a
freeform culmination of diverse new mourning traditions, with tens of thousands
of eventgoers honoring the past in whatever ways they choose and then parading,
united by small pieces of inscribed paper, together toward a finale spectacle and
ritual burning of ephemera organized by a small number of magnetic performers.
Yet there is evidence of past events relating to the ASP that reveal a far
more complex story of cultural flows, including Jungian mining of indigenous
rituals to heal modern European culture, and scenarios involving the 

  

of the Chicano DÃ­a de los Muertos holiday. In terms of existing records about
ASP history, these minor narratives are largely absent from ASP in textual media

Around the tradition of DÃ­a de los Muertos in particular, in visual iconography the
influence of the Chicano tradition is pronounced.

another most transparently is in the online arena, which is both ephemeral and

Daly 224
enduring. There, when writers of online content draw overt connections between
DÃ­a de los Muertos and the ASP, ASP organizers refute or downplay the influence
of the Chicano tradition on the ASP, suggesting intentions toward effacement,
which would facilitated by the disappearance of ephemeral evidence connecting
the two traditions. Thus the use of ephemera as commemorative matter in this
event gives current organizers an upper hand in controlling records about the past,
yet in increasingly transparent ways as these struggles sometimes play out in
public sites that ASP organizers do not control.
Finally, the third research question raised early in this work considers the
implications of this case of commemoration through ephemeral community
expression. In its freeform, inclusive nature, the ASP operates similarly to a
participatory archive

that is, in the manner of database-focused digital archives

such as those commemorating user experiences around 9/11 and Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita. When an unlimited number of users can upload experiences
around the past, the digital wash of memories that results offers them the
  

them little real agency in defining the history of the past event for the culture as a
whole. However, in this study I found organizers had grander aspirations, desiring
to shape memory on a cultural level, and that they pursued these goals through the
use of ephemera to create and recreate histories that performed for wider
audiences. These findings revealed that as they adapt to the model of the
participatory archive, users can deploy strategies

commemoration.
A NEW THEORY OF ARCHIVES
To complete the circle of grounded theory and retheorize the archive as it
emerges from this work, I must first trace what the archive could have been. In

endeavored to afford interpretive agency to my research participants I was

I recognized their understanding       better correspond with

place, thing, and practice

their archive emerges as both an annual iteration of

community membership and a claim over the space required for community
proximity. The archive that emerges from this study is collective action to
construct, efface, and build community around history.
This study accordingly calls into question the interplay between
individualism and collective action in digital participatory archiving trends
criticized for being fragmentary.362 From findings in the current study, we can
surmise that in at least some cases of participatory archiving, individuals jockey
for position to define, efface, and create the past by acting collectively as
communities. I found forming and performing within a community to be a crucial
component of a strategy, to create remembered records of the past and give them
more weight. The spectacle, the crowds, and annual repetition of a community
event emerged as crucial components of this strategy, suggesting that ephemeral
memories need to perform and engage again and again if they are going to define
the past at a cultural level. In the digital participatory archive, much attention has
been paid to the preservation standards designed to keep each artifact, but little to
the social and communal activities taking place ephemerally around these
histories. This study has suggested that the more collective or massive or
spectacular the telling of a story, the better it competes to become a history.
The re-theorized definition of the archive as constituted in collective
action also calls for reconsideration of ideals around the archival thing,

hand, the archive is always being constituted, and in postmodern models such as
the records continuum, this constituting process continues even as users interact
with the record.364 In this work ephemeral matter have been found at the center of
negotiations among competing views of history, and while these negotiations may
have led to effacement and master narratives, the same can be said of the
traditional processes leading to professional archives.365 The crucial difference is
that in ephemeral archives, negotiations between competing views of the past
were transparent  as when an ASP organizer argued to downplay DÃ­a de los
Muertos influence in the ASP in a public blogging forum. As the archival
profession builds digitally-based or -enhanced archives for the future, it is worth
probing further how fixed objects might better afford obscuring of such memory
negotiations, whether ephemeral matter offers increased capacity for
transparency, and what the ideal level of fixity is after all.

There are multiple avenues for future research, and certainly there are a
number of limitations relative to this project. First, though I was continually

immersed myself in a much larger world of documentation.366 I also chose to
interview current and former organizers of the ASP as my primary participants in
this study; as a result, the purposeful sample likely does not reflect the racial
diversity of the research site as a whole, and certainly does not reflect the
perspectives of all ASP participants who commemorate histories year after year
through this event. These are some of the limitations I will consider as I continue
to analyze this case and other similar cases around ephemeral content.
While I believe my personal connection to this work has enhanced my
understandings of the culture around this case, my work should be viewed
alongside other studies of this or similar events from a variety of perspectives to

In terms of community archives, and community expressions, I hope to see many
future studies that engage both supportively and critically with communities that
commemorate so that we might reach a point involving multiple cases and many
studies that align with this one.

The field of critical cartography offers an additional route for parallel

Finally, future work on ephemera in archives is needed, particularly as
material ephemeral overlaps with digital information. This is certainly not the
only study on ephemera in the field, but given recent shifts toward increasingly
critical scholarship in archives, future attention to ephemeral communication, and
the impact of the database as a model of public engagement are needed. Finally,
an additional arm of research might consider digital community archives, and I
acknowledge that this study of the case of the ASP could be broadened
considerably through research focused on online interactions around the ASP.
Certainly additional studies in these areas would contribute to ongoing
conversations around communities, ephemera, histories, memory, and notions of
culture and place relative to archival scholarship and work.
