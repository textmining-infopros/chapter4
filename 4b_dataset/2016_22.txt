ABSTRACT
Twenty-four joint use school/public libraries serve K-12 students and public communities
in Texas. However, there are no specific library standards to provide guidelines for this
type of combined library. In the current study, the researcher utilized a Delphi study to
develop library standards for shared school/public libraries in Texas. Texas Public
Library Standards (Texas Library Association, 2014), School Library Programs:
Standards and Guidelines for Texas (Texas State Library and Archives Commission,
2005), and the Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the Texas State Library
System (Texas Administrative Code, 2015) were correlated to create proposed joint use
library standards. A Delphi panel of 29 library experts participated in the current study.
The library expert panel included national and international library leaders and authors
from school, academic, public, and joint use libraries. University researchers, including
several Texas State Library librarians and Texas Library Association librarians, also
served on the Delphi panel. During three rounds of surveys the library experts identified
categories and components for developing effective Joint Use Library Standards. At the
conclusion of the study, consensus was achieved for 42 library standards. The Delphi
method identified objectives, goals, and principles that the library experts agreed should
be included in Texas Joint Use Library Standards. From the 42 joint use library standards,
a checklist was developed for school/public libraries to assess effective library service.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
Introduction to the Problem
In 2015, the Texas Library Association converged on the state capitol during the
84th Legislative Session to voice its support for the state’s libraries. The advocacy plan
of the professional association of school, college, and public librarians focused on the
motto, “Libraries are Public Education” (Texas Library Association, 2014). A public
library offers wide-ranging resources that help teach, enrich, and entertain. Gunnels,	  
Green,	  and	  Butler	  (2012) wrote, “public libraries were created to allow educational
resources to flow to a community” (p.25). A school library contributes to student
achievement. Research indicates that schools with good library resources and strong
instructional programs reflect higher scores on statewide tests (Lankford, 2006). Texas
libraries currently serve 24 million Texans in 880 public libraries. School libraries
support six million Texas students and teachers. University libraries help 1.4 million
college students and faculties on higher education campuses (Texas Library Association,
2014).
Professional opinions from scholarly articles and books alternately support and
criticize different elements of joint use school/public libraries (Gunnels et al, 2012;
McNicol, 2008; Moorman, 2002a). However, because combined libraries serve more than
one population, they may be better suited to our society now than during any previous
1

time. Shared libraries encourage collaboration, can be a more financially efficient means
of providing service, and serve as a forum to promote lifelong learning (Lankford, 2006).
In addition, a joint use library with effective practices could help reduce social exclusion,
promote community cohesion, and create a more equitable society (McNicol, 2008). At
the second international conference on joint use libraries in 2011, shared facilities were
promoted as valued community resources (Bergoc, 2012).
Joint use libraries have existed in the United States and internationally for more
than a century. However, Texas joint use school/public libraries do not have, but need to
develop, a specific set of library standards by which to measure quality service. Library
standards create structure to maintain effective service through times of change.
Mary Lankford, in her 2006 report for the Texas State Library and Archives
Commission on Joint Use School/Public Libraries in Texas, recommended the
development of joint use library standards. Using the state resources of Texas Public
Library Standards (Texas Library Association, 2014), School Library Programs:
Standards and Guidelines for Texas (Texas State Library and Archives Commission,
2005), and the Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the Texas State Library
System (Texas Administrative Code, 2015), the current study developed joint use library
standards for combined school/public libraries in Texas. Empirical data exists in the
literature confirming critical success factors for combined facilities. However, no
research has been published combining public and school library standards to create
Texas joint use library standards. Combining these standards is key to understanding how
2

joint use library standards can impact quality service in a dual use library. For this Delphi
study, a panel of experts from the library profession was asked to evaluate a proposed set
of joint use library standards that were developed from categories identified by the
Delphi library expert panel using current Texas library standards. The areas of Texas
Public Library Standards and Texas School Library Standards addressed in the current
study include:
•

Administration and Leadership Standards

•

Collection Standards

•

Library Environment Standards

•

Facility Standards

•

Finance Standards

•

Public Relations, Marketing, and Advocacy Standards

•

Technology Standards

•

Library Service Standards

•

Personnel Standards

•

State Accreditation Requirements

•

Teaching and Learning Standards

•

Information Science and Librarianship Standards
A successful library is a facility that seeks to serve all. Libraries provide, at no cost,

technology, print, and electronic resources, as well as professional reference service to
anyone seeking information (Texas Library Association, 2014). Although computer use is
3

widespread in our society, “there are still more than 100 million people, one-third of the
United States population, who are not digitally literate” (Hildreth, 2012, p.45). The
results of the Delphi technique in the current study will allow other joint use libraries to
apply specific standards to maintain quality library services in the rapidly changing world
of digital and print information (Gunnels & Green, 2012). The purpose of the new joint
use library standards is to promote quality library service to all, raise the expectations of
library clientele, and provide an authoritative document by which combined libraries may
measure effective practices (Texas Library Association, 2014).
Background of the Study
A significant body of research addresses national and international joint use
libraries but does not include the creation of a formal set of standards for dual use
school/public libraries. This lack of standards impacts the ability of libraries to provide
adequate service in existing combined facilities. Full integration of school/public library
services requires that student, faculty, and public library patrons share operating hours,
technology, and all resources in the library at all times (McNicol, 2006). Formalization of
joint use standards will provide a basis for transfer of knowledge to existing and future
shared libraries. As shown in Table 1, there are 24 joint use school/public libraries of
various sizes providing K-12 school and community library service in Texas. These joint
use libraries are located in counties across the state to provide library programming to
more than 180,000 Texas residents. The smallest combined libraries serve less than 500
patrons, but the average community population size is 7,500. The largest joint use
4

libraries serve more than 33,000 people. In Lankford’s (2005) report for the Texas State
Library and Archives Commission, almost half of the joint use libraries were located
within a school, while the others were stand-alone facilities. However, the stand-alone
libraries still served both a school and community population. The physical size of the
libraries varied from 1,200 to 16,500 square feet.

Before the current Delphi study began, the researcher sent out A Checklist for
Joint Use Library Implementations to the 24 Texas school/public libraries to gather
background information for the current study. This checklist was modified from
Lankford’s (2006) checklist for joint use libraries that is posted on the Texas State
Library Archives and Commission website. The checklist is displayed in Appendix A.
The information below was the result of this informal survey of the currently operating
joint use school/public libraries in Texas. This survey did not involve the library expert
panel of the current research. The survey and checklist served as background information
for the researcher.
● Sixty-six percent of the library directors hold a masters degree in library science.
● The library director acts as manager of the public library and is employed by the
school district to serve as school library media specialist.
● The school district may pay the salaries of all the library employees.
● The city or county contributes annually to the library budget.
● The libraries range in size from serving a population of 276 to 43,201.
● Most of the libraries are situated on a school campus with collections ranging
from 8,800 to 45,000 items.
● Annual circulation rates vary widely, relevant to the size of the community and
school population. There are 2,000-90,000 items checked out each year by
school/public patrons.
● These joint use libraries serve as the community’s only public library.
6

● The libraries are open from 20-62 hours each week.
● Fifty percent of the facilities offer day, evening, and weekend hours.
Seventy-five percent of the Texas combined libraries have library boards that
meet regularly and all of those who responded to the survey have written mission
statements, long-range development plans, and procedure manuals for library services.
Ninety-two percent submit an annual report to the state library or a funding agency. More
than 90% include electronic resources in their collection and 75% of the libraries
participate in the TexShare interlibrary loan service. All of the libraries offer facility
amenities such as exterior lighting and signage. Between 80-90% indicated they have
adequate parking, an after-hours return box, and sufficient interior meeting space and
shelving. Ninety-two percent receive continual funding from a public entity that is a
school district, city, county, or a combination of city and school funding. In addition to a
professional librarian, all of the facilities employ up to 4 people who serve in a
paraprofessional library position. All of the libraries offer at least two public computer
terminals and one half of the libraries host computer skills classes. Seventy-five percent
of the libraries in the survey offer summer reading programs when the school district is
closed and market library services with branded materials throughout the year to school
and community members. The physical size of the library collection varies greatly among
the joint use school/public libraries in Texas. The smaller libraries offer as little as two
items per student, while the larger libraries hold up to 81 items per student. Figure 1
details the library services of the Texas joint use school/public libraries.
7

The purpose of gathering information about the currently operating joint use
libraries in Texas allowed the researcher to focus on broad topics identified as
“components associated with success of joint use school/public libraries” (Lankford,
2006, p. 5). Lankford, in her report on joint use libraries for the Texas State Library and
Archives Commission, noted each of the following categories related to a goal of
successful service. The hours of operation determine whether service is adequate for
school and public library users. Staffing should be adequate for service to both school
and library visitors. The library collection and programming focuses on school and public
information needs. Figure 1 illustrates the details of library services as organized from a
checklist the researcher sent to Texas joint use school/public libraries. The checklist was
a modified version of the checklist used by Lankford (2005) in her report to the Texas
State Library and Archives Commission.
Texas Public Library Standards recognize two levels of service: enhanced and
exemplary. The enhanced levels of service build upon basic standards that are required
for accreditation and participation in the Texas State Library programs (Texas Library
Association, 2014). Texas Public Library Standards require Material Expenditure per
capita of $3.13 to meet the Texas public basic standard for accreditation. The overall
Operating Expenditure per capita for the same population size must be $15.33 for the
Enhanced standard. The 2014 Maintenance of Expenditures for a joint use library can be
anywhere within in this range, falling short of the highest public library standard, but

8

meeting the requirement for state accreditation by the Texas State Library and Archives
Commission (TSLAC)(Texas Library Association, 2014).

Figure 1. Library Services of 2015-2016 Texas Joint Use School/Public Libraries
Casstevens, S. (2015) [Joint use school/public Texas libraries policies and service
Unpublished raw data.]
(Lankford, 2005).
During all operating hours, a fully integrated combined library is accessible to
both the public and the school. Full integration of services would require that all library
materials, computer access, and staff assistance be shared by school and public library
users. This service challenge to combined libraries indicates a need to identify and
formally establish Texas joint use library standards. A proposed set of joint use library
standards will provide a basis for librarian leaders to ensure that dual use libraries remain
relevant to present and future library users (Gunnels et al., 2012).
Statement of the Problem
Texas joint use school/public libraries do not have a specific set of Texas Library
Standards by which to measure quality service. Combined use libraries continue to
increase and there is a need to develop authoritative Texas joint use library standards that
apply directly to dual use library services (Gunnels et al., 2012). All libraries continually
redefine their services to accommodate the changing information needs for those they
serve. Library standards create structure for libraries to maintain adaptable and relevant
service through times of change. Without standards, it is impossible for a joint use library
to validate whether the information needs of students, teachers, and public library patrons
are adequately served (Bergoc, 2012). To date no Texas joint use library standards exist
for combined library services.

10

Standards do exist for separate public, school, and academic libraries in Texas.
However, the challenges for joint use libraries are unique, creating a need for research to
determine if a collaboration of standards from the existing Texas Public Library
Standards, the Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the State Library, and Texas
School Program Guidelines and Standards can serve to develop library standards for
Texas joint use school/public libraries.
Without concrete standards for joint use libraries, like those that exist for single
sector facilities, it is difficult to measure what areas of service contribute directly to user
satisfaction and effective library services (Auld, 2002a). McNicol (2008) emphasized that
joint use libraries need to be accepted as a credible form of library service in their own
right and joint use librarians need to be recognized and rewarded as highly skilled
professionals.
Purpose of the Study
The current study had two purposes. First, using a Delphi method research design,
a library expert panel identified which components and categories in existing Texas
library standards could be used to develop proposed joint use library standards. Second,
from the list of proposed joint use library standards that achieved consensus during the
current Delphi study, a checklist was created to help joint use libraries assess effective
library services.
The current study identified and correlated current Texas Public and School
Library Standards to create joint use standards. There is existing research that focused on
11

critical factors of success in national and international joint use libraries (Bundy, 2003).
However, there is little research on Texas joint use school/public library standards. A
report by Lankford (2006) recommended developing joint use library standards. The
analysis of the data provided insight into how existing Texas Library Standards can be
modified to meet the needs of joint use libraries.
The Delphi technique of data collection has been applied successfully to a wide
range of studies. Developed by the RAND Corporation in the 1950s, the Delphi
technique is a tool used to make effective use of informed opinions in long-range
forecasting (Helmer-Hirschberg, 1967). The current study applied the Delphi method to
collect the opinions of library experts through a series of carefully designed
questionnaires and controlled feedback to establish a consensus of opinion about joint use
library standards. Research indicates a convergence toward consensus in the majority of
cases where the Delphi method has been used (Helmer-Hirschberg, 1967).
The primary purpose of gathering data from library experts was to obtain the most
reliable consensus from a group of knowledgeable professionals through a series of webbased surveys (Caroll, 2007). The survey rounds were a systematic method for
developing an informed opinion and were interspersed with researcher feedback. The
Delphi method is an iterative process to gather and distill the anonymous judgments of
experts using a series of data collection and analysis techniques (De Villiers, De Villiers,
and Kent (2005). The Delphi method is well suited as a research instrument when there is
incomplete knowledge about a problem. Delphi studies are useful for determining the
12

criteria of framework for a formalized set of standards (Skulmoski, Hartman, and Krahn,
2007).
The current study was exploratory in nature and focused on what the library
experts believed would function well as joint use library standards. The panel of library
experts completed three questionnaire rounds that included an initial set of profile
questions and three sets of structured, scaled questionnaire items assessing the
importance of standards derived from combining Texas Public Library Standards, Texas
School Program Guidelines and Standards, and the Texas Minimum Requirements for
Accreditation in the State Library System.
Rationale
McNicol (2008) pointed out that a joint use library, more than any other type of
library, must be aware of the unique needs of the community it serves. A shared library is
one of the “few places where young and old, schoolchildren, college students, and adult
visitors can all participate in learning” (McNicol, 2008, p. 140). The current study
contributed to the knowledge of correlating current Texas Library standards to joint use
library standards. The researcher questioned previously held conclusions that separate
school and public library facilities are more efficient in all but the smallest communities
(Moorman, 2002). Partnership is at the heart of any joint use library program, but a range
of measures are needed to determine detailed indicators of success for joint use libraries.
The researcher connected Texas Library Standards to each survey question. The areas of
current Texas library standards that were addressed in the Delphi surveys included:
13

●

Administration

●

Collections

●

Leadership

●

Technology

●

Facilities

●

Personnel

●

Library services

●

Finance

●

Public Relations

●

Library Environment

When done well, the combined library facility can preserve the values of librarianship,
create a sense of cooperation in a community, and become an impetus for lifelong
learning and information literacy (Henderson, 2007).
Research Questions
Using the Delphi technique, the current study focused on the existing Texas
Library Standards. Using these standards, the library expert panel reached a consensus
regarding joint use standards for Texas school/public shared libraries. From this
information, the treatise provided valuable data that was used to propose new Texas Joint
Use Library Standards.
Research Question 1 (RQ1) Can the current Texas Public Library Standards (Texas
Library Association, 2014) and the School Library Programs: Standards and
14

Guidelines for Texas (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005) be
adapted to create joint use library standards for Texas school/public libraries?
Sub-Question A (SQA)
How will the categories listed in the current Texas Public Library Standards
be adapted to Joint Use library standards?
Sub-Question B (SQB)
How will the current categories in the School Library Programs:
Standards and Guidelines for Texas be adapted to create Joint Use Library
Standards?
Research Question 2 (RQ2) What are the categories of Joint Use Library Standards
recommended by the Delphi expert panel?
Research Question 3 (RQ3) Can the categories of Joint Use Library Standards
recommended by the Delphi panel result in a checklist that will help Texas joint
use school/public libraries assess whether their library services are effective?
Significance of the Study
The impact of the current study could affect other Texas joint use libraries.
Combined library programs could benefit from the current research by using the checklist
of joint use Texas library standards to assess what is proficient and effective local library
service. This Delphi study was important to joint use libraries because standards provide
an authoritative document by which libraries may measure their quality of service (Texas
Library Association, 2014). Both public and school library standards are fundamental to
15

adequately develop joint use library standards (McNicol, 2008). The 21st century library
requires evolving skills from the librarian to meet emerging information needs. The
findings of this treatise will add to the body of librarianship because the new joint use
standards are relevant to the exponentially expanding world of information science and
technology (Gunnels et al., 2012). Joint use library standards add to the professionalism
of library directors who serve blended libraries (Lankford, 2006). The Delphi technique
allowed the joint use standards to be developed from an iterative consensual approach to
achieve a level of agreement from a panel of library experts (Carroll, 2007).
Definition of Terms
For the purpose of clarity in the narrative, the following terms apply to the study
of librarianship, information science, and the development of joint use library standards.
A joint use library is a strategic alliance between two or more stakeholders. There are
different models of shared libraries, as well as different levels of integration of services in
each joint use library. The terms below help describe the variety of joint use libraries
researched in this study.
College Library
A library that is attached to a higher education institution which serves two
complementary purposes: to support the school's curriculum, and to support the research
of the university faculty and students.
College/public library

16

“An interlibrary partnership that is a collaboration between a public library and a
college, university, or community college” (Gunnels et al, 2012).
Combined use Library, Dual use Library, Joint use Library, Shared Library
“A library in which two or more distinct library services providers, usually a
school/public library, serve their client groups in the same building, based on an
agreement that specifies the relationship between the providers” (Bundy, 2003, p. 129).
Delphi Research Methodology
A research method where experts in a specific field provide information during
repeated rounds. This process does not bring the participants together physically, thus
eliminating peer pressure and allowing open discussion without interpersonal interaction
(Neuman, 1995).
Full Service Integration
“ Complete collaborative use of buildings, co-location of services and a merged
school/public library service” (McNicol, 2008, p. 5).
Panel
The panel in a Delphi study consists of experts who practice or have practiced in
the field of the research topic.
Public Library
A public library is a library that is accessible by the general public and is
generally funded from public sources, such as taxes. It is operated by librarians
and library para-professionals who are also civil servants.
17

School Library
A school library is a library within a school where students, staff, and often,
parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources.
School/public library
“Located on school premises, sometimes within the school itself, this library
provides school and community library service” (McNicol, 2008, p. 9).
Single sector libraries
Libraries restricted to serving one user group identified as students enrolled in a
school or a public population group in a community.
Assumptions and Limitations
Assumptions are elements in a study that will be accepted without verifying
evidence. For the current study, the following assumptions included:
● The library experts understood the scope of the study and the terminology utilized
to gather information.
● The library experts were proficient, objective, and honest when responding to
surveys.
● The interpretation and analysis of the data reflected with fidelity the intent of the
experts.
● All respondents answered all survey questions honestly and to the best of their
abilities.

18

● To preserve anonymity and confidentiality in the survey, respondents did not
identify themselves to each other and sent their answers electronically only to the
researcher. The participation of the library expert panel was proactive because the
library experts did not react to the ideas of others.
● The anonymity and isolation of the library expert panelists provided for a certain
degree of independence and freedom from having to conform to the opinions of
others.
● Participants in the current study were volunteers who could withdraw from the
research at any time with no ramifications.
● The recruitment and selection procedures for the library expert panel were
sufficient to identify individuals with valid expert knowledge regarding Texas
Library Standards and joint use library services.
● The Delphi process was effective for gathering the knowledgeable opinions from
library expert participants (Burgin, 2012).
The panel participants represented a sample population of library experts. This
treatise was not intended to be a comprehensive representation of all joint use libraries.
The current study was designed to be a developmental process in the establishment of
joint use library standards for shared school/public libraries in Texas. In addition, the
subjective nature of the Delphi process created the possibility of “poor execution in the
performance” in the study (Vernon, 2009, p. 74).

19

The Delphi Method requires time, motivated participants, and an effective means
of communication (Hsu & Sandford, 2007). Research studies utilizing the Delphi
technique identify the following limitations for the methodology:
● The self-reporting nature of the survey was a limitation of this study. The
response rate from the surveys might have been lower than expected.
●

The library experts who agreed to participate may not have reflected the beliefs
and opinions of all librarians who qualified to participate.

● The proposed joint use library standards only apply to combined school/public
libraries. Joint use libraries can include shared college/public libraries.
● The Delphi methodology is time-consuming (Hsu & Sandford, 2007).
● Attrition may result from “round-fatigue and a loss of motivation” (Vernon, 2009,
p. 75). This low response rate from the participants on the expert panel might lead
to a potential decrease in the quality of information obtained (Hsu & Sandford,
2007).
● The anonymous nature of the library expert panel responses can be a limitation if
anonymity creates a lack of accountability and allows the panel to consider the
questions in the Delphi surveys less seriously (Vernon, 2009).
● The validity and reliability of the Delphi process can be compromised through the
potential of the researcher influencing opinion (Hsu & Sandford, 2007).
To avoid a lack of rigor, it was important for the researcher to identify an optimal
panel size, consensus levels, and appropriate number of iterative rounds. Library expert
20

panelists who were aware of their importance to the study and had a professional interest
in the research responded well to a researcher who employs a consistent and thorough
approach to the Delphi technique (Hasson, Keeney, and McKenna, 2000).
Nature of the Study
The current study utilized a Delphi research technique that explored library
experts’ opinions of proposed joint use library standards. A Delphi study is used to reach
a consensus from a group of experts on a particular topic by focusing responses to
questions in a limited set of rounds. The Delphi method is a structured qualitative and
quantitative process to collect knowledge and opinion from an identified panel of experts
(Cresswell, 2015). Researcher feedback to participants was systematically controlled. The
participants knew the summary of the panel’s responses anonymously at progressive
stages of the study (Skulmoski et.al, 2007). The Delphi method in this treatise included
certain quantitative data. The responses were scaled and rank-ordered, subject to further
iterative consideration by the library experts.
Invitation emails were sent to 62 library experts who qualified to participate in the
current Delphi study. Qualifying panel participants each had experience working as a
professional librarian in a school, public, college, or joint use library. Over the course of
three rounds, the expert librarians provided varying levels of agreement toward proposed
joint use library standards.
Organization of the Remainder of the Study
The current Delphi study is organized into five chapters including references,
21

appendices, and lists of tables and figures. Chapter One introduced the purpose of the
study, the problem statement, the significance of the study, the research questions, and
library terms with definitions. Chapter Two presented a literature review documenting
national and international research on joint use libraries. Literature on current Texas
library standards was also explored in detail to clarify the framework for developing joint
use library standards. In addition, Chapter Two explored future trends for libraries to
increase understanding of current and predicted issues for combined facilities. Critical
success factors and joint use library agreements for joint use libraries are also detailed to
further demonstrate the needs for specific joint use library standards.
Chapter Three described the Delphi research design and methodology, the
instrumentation, and the procedures for collecting and analyzing the data. Chapter Four
presented the actual collection and analysis of the data from three iterative survey
questionnaires. Chapter Four included documentation of the results of the three Delphi
rounds and the results of each research question. Chapter Five provided a discussion of
the findings, the implications of the current study, the recommendations for future
research, and the conclusion.

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction
Over the past decade, libraries have undergone tremendous changes. Information
availability has grown exponentially through digital and electronic resources. However,
current standards for libraries may not meet the rapidly changing information needs of
students, teachers, and public library patrons. Standards are necessary to ensure effective
service in every type of library environment (Bundy and Amey, 2006; Breivik, Budd, &
Woods, 2005). Texas has 24 libraries that are identified as combined school/public
facilities. They do not have library standards that apply to their unique type of institution
(Lankford, 2006). Conversely, there do exist library standards for Texas Public libraries
and Texas school libraries, but there is not an official list of standards that applies to
combined school/public libraries in Texas. State, national, and international research on
joint use libraries has been explored in this literature review to identify the components of
effective library service in a dual use school/public library. The literature reveals research
regarding:
•

Texas Public Library Standards.

•

Texas School Library Program Guidelines and Standards.

•

Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the State Library System.
23

The researcher studied the above topics as guidelines for developing joint use
library standards. Although the mission of a public library and a school library may be
different, a successful combination of services from a single facility can be achieved
(Lankdford, 2005). By joining together, combined libraries improve services in a way
that would be difficult in single sector libraries within separate public or school facilities
(McNicol, 2008). Literature addressing the Texas Public Library Standards and the Texas
School Library Program Standards is reviewed in detail to provide a framework for
proposed joint use library standards. This review also addressed the minimum
requirements for membership in the Texas State Library System.
Public libraries provide educational resources to a community(Texas Library
Association, 2014). School libraries enhance curriculum and improve student
achievement in a K-12 setting (Texas State Library Archives and Commission, 2005).
National research about joint use libraries showed that joint use facilities strive to support
the country’s democratic society by increasing access for all to a range of information,
decreasing social exclusion, and contributing to a more equitable society (McNicol,
2008). Allen Bundy (2003), a prolific international researcher on joint use libraries
worldwide, suggested that interest in the shared library concept continues to increase
globally, although the library profession does not always advocate this form of
cooperation. In the last 50 years, many combined libraries have failed (Calvert, 2010).
International research of joint use libraries details the disadvantages of joint use library

24

service, and identifies critical success factors that remedy the current deficits in joint use
library service (Bergoc, 2012).
There are several types of joint use libraries. The demands on a combined facility
depend upon the population it serves; if the joint use library is a college/public facility,
the information needs of the library patrons are different from the services that are needed
in a school/public library that serves a K-12 school population and a public community.
The literature addressed each of these kinds of joint use libraries and the particular
challenges faced by each to provide good library service. Resource management is a
major concern for any publicly funded institution, and the literature examined how joint
use library service can increase the effectiveness and lessen the strain from limited library
budgets (Moorman, 2002-a).
Throughout the research on joint use libraries, the need for a binding joint use
agreement between the city and school involved in a combined library is emphasized as
necessary and paramount to the success of a shared facility (McNicol, 2008). The
literature addressed the details of successful joint use agreements from several libraries.
The emerging information needs of students and public library patrons are reviewed in
Chapter Two in literature focused on the future trends of joint use libraries. Sarah
McNicol, a university researcher and organizer of the first international conference on
joint use libraries in 2007, wrote that joint use libraries, more than any other type of
library, are “ideally suited to the current political climate”(McNicol, 2008, p. 1). Shared
libraries encourage collaboration between partners. Though considered the “Cinderella”
25

of library communities, joint use facilities were presented in McNicol’s (2008) work as a
way to provide more efficient library service, if certain standards are maintained (p.1).
Finally, Chapter Two compiles the research about current library standards and current
joint use library services to create a narrative framework for proposed joint use library
standards
Library Standards
In K-12 education, standards have been part of our nation’s history since the 19th
century. At that time, the connection between education standards and the school library
had not been researched (White, 1963). By 1990, the role of the library professional was
established and credited with contributing to the achievement of students with strong
school library programs (Auld, 2002b). Education standards and school library standards
have become an important element of pedagogy to meet the information needs of K-12
students (Marcoux, 1999). Standards represent competency, and help to enhance the
professional development of library service and librarianship in school libraries and in
public libraries. The goal of a library standard, similar to a competency, is to combine
knowledge and skill into the advancement of services that facilitate learning and
information literacy (Luo, 2012).
Texas Public Library Standards are separate from Texas School Library Program
Guidelines and Standards, yet each document shares common goals and objectives
toward effective library service. A school library supports curriculum. A public library
provides information and recreational resources to its users. Joint use school/public
26

libraries are challenged to provide curriculum support and recreational information to
students, faculty, and public community populations (McNicol, 2008). Joint use libraries
must insist that the needs of all library users be met. However, no specific Texas joint use
library standards currently exist. The diversity of joint use libraries in Texas make the
possibility of creating a strict set of rules that every facility, regardless of size or budget,
must adhere to, unrealistic (McNicol, 2008). However, because the users of a joint use
library will demand a broader range of purpose than they would from a separate school or
public library, literature focused on current public and school library standards
provided a framework for joint use library standards.
Texas Public Library Standards
The Texas Library Association Committee on Public Library Standards created
qualitative and quantitative standards for public library service in Texas. The standards
were approved by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission (TSLAC) in May,
2004. In 2013, TSLAC, led by Texas state librarian Mark Smith, established a task force
with the Texas Library Association to evaluate the 2005 standards for timeliness and to
recommend needed changes. The Texas Library Association (2014) address the Texas
public library standards in the areas of administration, library collections, facility,
finance, public relations, personnel, services, and technology. Figure 2 displays the Texas
Public Library Standards. The purpose of the Texas Public Library Standards is to
promote quality library service to all, to raise the expectations of library clientele, and to
provide an authoritative document by which libraries may measure quality. Official
27

standards provide evidence of true need that librarians can use for funding requests.
These standards determine timely, comprehensive, and appropriate measures for public
library accreditation. Though some standards can be uniformly applied to all public
libraries, the specifics of most public library standards are geared toward certain
population sizes in order to make the standards relevant and meaningful to individual
libraries (Texas Library Association, 2014).
The philosophy that supports public library standards is based on the value of a
public library to its community (Texas Library Association, 2014). The 2014 revision of
the standards included the following imperatives for all public libraries to promote within
their own facility:
•

Value a public library as a community resource and of cultural heritage.

•

Value the diversity and uniqueness of each public library.

•

Value the particular needs of each community.

•

Value intellectual freedom and access to information.

•

Value the skills and contributions of library staff (Texas Library Association,
2014).

The categories of Texas Public Library Standards are illustrated in Figure 2. Texas public
library standards recognize two levels of service. The enhanced level of service builds on
basic services. Basic services are required for accreditation in the Texas State Library
System. The exemplary level of service builds on enhanced services. Libraries that
achieve enhanced or exemplary standards are those where improvement is continuously
28

progressive, rather than a reactive process to random events. To determine a public
library’s status in relation to the public library standards, TSLAC created a checklist for
libraries across Texas to present to library boards, funding agencies, and city councils.
The Texas Public Library Standards have been revised twice since their original
approval in 2004. The Texas Library Association re-evaluates sections of the standards
each year for appropriateness and comprehensiveness. If a total revision is deemed
necessary, a Joint Task Force of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission will
be appointed to recommend changes to the State Library and the Texas Library
Association (Texas Library Association, 2014).
Administration standards determine if a library meets the definition of a public
library as stated in the Texas Library Systems Act. Administration of a pubic library must
involve a governing or advisory board that meets regularly and has written bylaws that
control the relationship of the board to the library and the library staff. Also under
administrative standards are the directives to periodically review library policies and
procedures that cover specific areas of library operations as follows:
•

ADA compliance.

•

Copyright compliance.

•

Emergencies and safety.

•

Human resources.

•

Public service hours.

•

Programming.
29

•

Rules of Conduct for patrons and staff.

•

Patron surveys and community analyses

•

Figure 2. Texas Public Library Standards
(Texas Library Association, 2014).
The purpose of Library Collection Standards is to guarantee that public libraries
provide the resources that meet community needs (Texas Library Association, 2014,
p. 6). The size of a library collection is important only in relation to its use by the
population it serves. Usage is reflected in circulation per capita and the collection
turnover rate. The collection turnover rate is how many items are checked out by the
community and how many items are lost from the collection each year. For example,
in a public library that serves 5,000–24,999 people, a circulation per capita rate of
3.12 indicates an Enhanced (within the 50th percentile) library rating, while a
circulation per capita rate of 5.25 (75th percentile) places the library in the Exemplary
rating (Texas Library Association, 2014).
It is also important to monitor the age of library materials, particularly what
percentage is less than five years old, and to determine what items should be kept,
replaced, or discarded. Recently, the value of digitizing local history items has risen in
importance to for libraries to preserve unique and irreplaceable memorabilia. Through
digitization of print items and the growing use of electronic resources, library collections
are expanded beyond the physical walls of the library (Texas Library Association, 2014).
The collection of items to help with basic reading skills and English as a second language
is important in Texas public libraries to meet the literacy needs of the population, and that
requirement is included in collection standards (Texas Library Association, 2014).
31

Facility standards for public libraries encompass several components, depending
on the size of the collection, adult and children’s programming, meeting space needs, and
facility size and design. Each public library is unique and serves a distinct community,
but there are still common imperatives each public library must consider:
•

Compliance with building codes and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

•

Emergency manual and disaster plan.

•

Safe and secure environment, with regular reviews toward replacement of
buildings or content (Texas Library Association, 2014, p. 9).
Finance standards include quantitative and non-quantitative elements. Non-

quantitative standards include the assurance of ongoing funding structure for the library.
The money may be from any public entity or a 501(c)(3) corporation. An annual budget
should reflect the current information needs of the community. All fiscal and financial
management procedures should be consistent with local government practices and Texas
state law. For example, a public library that serves a population of 5,000–24,999 would
earn an Enhanced rating if the materials expenditures per capita are $1.72. An Exemplary
rating would require the library to reach a material expenditure per capita of $2.65. The
financial standards also would include certain operating expenditures per capita to
correlate with the materials expenditures. These financial requirements increase or
decrease with the size of the population each public library serves (Texas Library
Association, 2014).

32

Marketing standards promote library value to the community and require an
active public relations plan implemented by the library staff. Advocacy standards for the
public library focuses on gathering the support of “elected officials, governmental
entities, and community stakeholders” to positively impact the growth of library
programs and resources (Texas Library Association, 2014, p. 13).
Personnel standards are important to library service, ensuring the library staff
remains knowledgeable and committed to good library service. Standards determine staff
level by population served with total service hours. This formula results in the number of
full-time equivalent (FTE) staff. Personnel standards assert that library staff be courteous,
promote intellectual freedom, and remain well trained through continuous education
courses. Texas library personnel standards are organized to detail education requirements
for the library director and training requirements for all library staff. For example, if a
public library serves a population of more than 24,999, the director must have a master’s
degree in library science, earn 20 hours of continuing education annually, and employ
one FTE per 4,100 population (Texas Library Association, 2014).
Library service standards address accessibility, information services, and
programming. Accessibility is determined by how many hours a public library is open,
according to the population of the community. A library that serves between 5,000 –
24,999 people is required to be open at least 45 hours per week, host a website, and
maintain a social media presence. Information services include reference and
instructional services. Library programming is nested in the service standards to include:
33

•

Reference services; online and in-person.

•

Educational and recreational reading programs for all ages.

•

Outreach services to the underserved (Texas Library Association, 2014).

Technology standards are important in a public library, because the world of digital
information is only available to those who have the devices to access it. Public libraries
provide these devices at no cost to all who need them. Conversely, those library visitors
with technology devices at home also should be able to access the library remotely.
Technology standards require that libraries provide access to online databases, electronic
books, and technology equipment for checkout to patrons.
Texas School Library Programs: Guidelines and Standards
The Texas School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas (Texas
State Library and Archives Commission, 2005) align expectations of the Texas Education
Code to provide a tool for evaluating and improving school library programs. Figure 3
displays these standards. School library standards address six learner-centered categories
that address teaching, management, technology, library environment, community
connections, and librarianship. Library standards are a way to measure and increase
effective library services. The Texas State Library and Archives Commission (2005)
demonstrated that the standards are based on research that shows a correlation between
school library resources and greater student achievement.
These standards provide a guide for the school library to contribute to student
academic success. A goal is identified for each of these standards, creating a framework
34

for self-assessment and strategic planning for school librarians. Each goal is followed by
principles that integrate definite expectations of the State Board of Educator Certification
(SBEC) Guidelines for certification of School Librarians. For example, in Leadership and
Management category, one goal addresses adequate funding for any Texas school library
based on campus enrollment, to provide at least one book per student. The principle that
supports this standard and its goal is the role of the librarian to advocate for funding to
build the library’s program (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005). The
average age of the overall collection should be less than 11 years, emphasizing the need
for a library budget that can replace outdated library items. Figure 3 details the Texas
School Library Program Guidelines and Standards.

Figure 3. Texas School Library Programs Guidelines and Standards
Texas School Library Program Standards (Texas State Library and Archives
Commission, 2005) provide support from the campus library for student achievement.
36

The standards identify four levels of compliance that include Exemplary, Recognized,
Acceptable, and Below Standard (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005).
The top three ratings meet standard expectations, but the lowest rating does not. Through
self-assessment, school libraries determine where their library rates in the four standard
rankings (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005). These guidelines are a
professional tool of objective assessment based on recognized measures of performance.
The standards originally became effective in 1997, and were revised in 2005 to further
align the expectations with the following documents:
•

State Board for Educator Certification Guidelines for School Librarians

•

Texas Long Range Plan for Technology 2006-2020

•

Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills

•

Empowering Learners American Association of School Librarians

•

Library Media Standards for Teachers of Students Ages 3-18 (Texas State Library
and Archives Commission, 2005).

A committee of 80 library and school professionals worked on the revision of the
original 1996 Texas school library standards in an effort to support effective schools,
results-oriented education, and accountability (Texas State Library and Archives
Commission, 2005).
Supplemental resources are linked to the School Library Program Guidelines and
Standards to help librarians assess the current level of resources and service in the
school library. These resources include strategies for librarians to attain output measures
37

of service in quantitative and qualitative formats. There are also evidence-based
measures that will illuminate whether a school library program supports state mandated
curriculum and aids mastery of that curriculum for state testing (Texas State Library and
Archives Commission, 2005). For each of the six school library standards, the Strategies
for Librarians include elements that describe Exemplary, Recognized, Acceptable, and
Below Standard library programs to help identify and improve the current status of any
school library (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005). Output measures
record library program productivity with quantitative measures that are included in the
supplemental resources of the School Library Program Standards and Guidelines. There
are seven output measures for data collection and associated worksheets in the following
areas:
•

Percentage of planning and teaching requests filled or modified by school
librarian.

•

Percentage of curriculum requests addressed with print, Internet, and database
resources.

•

Average number of print, Internet, and database resources utilized per students
per week. (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005).

Evidence-based measures for school library programs are used to determine the influence
of the library program on a student population achievement. Using school library
standards, three evidence-based measures evaluate whether the student success has been
impacted by library instruction:
38

•

Students have quality access during and beyond the school day to resources that
support mastery of state-mandated curriculum.

•

Students gain increased knowledge of state-mandated expectations through library
instruction.

•

Students demonstrate achievement as related to state-mandated tests from skills
taught individually or collaboratively by the librarian (Texas State Library and
Archives Commission, 2005).

Summary of the School Library Program Standards
The goal of Standard I Learner-Centered Teaching and Learning promotes the
integration of curriculum, library resources, and library instruction to support the success
of all students. The principles for this goal include collaboration between librarians and
teachers, ongoing staff instruction, and reading initiatives. Standard II focuses on
Leadership and Management with the primary goal the demonstration of effective
librarian leadership. The principles for this second standard require the librarian to
advocate for the school library vision, mission, sound policies, and quality staff
management. In addition, the librarian advocates for funding and responsibly manages
and reports on the library budget. These principles assure that library administration
demonstrates the value of the school library program through data collection and the
distribution of information about library services to the school administration (Texas
State Library and Archives Commission, 2005).

39

The goal of School Library Standard III Technology and Information Access is to
facilitate the use of technology for students and teachers. The library should provide a
balanced collection of electronic resources and the librarian should teach sound research
skills and model ethical use of the Internet and online resources. The Learner-Centered
Library Environment is the fourth standard and encompasses all aspects of library space
and purposes to allow for production and communication by all members of a school’s
learning community. Flexible access and use of space, as well as storage and shelving
needs, are the principles that promote maximum use of the school library (Texas State
Library and Archives Commission, 2005).
Standard V Learner-Centered Connections to Community involves connecting
faculty, staff, and students to community resources as needed. In addition, the connection
to the community is reciprocal; the library views the community members as learning and
instructional partners. Thus, the librarian provides opportunities to use the library to the
school and neighborhood community population. Aware of the diversity of a school’s
student enrollment, the librarian also builds programs and library collections that meet
the unique needs of the community. Finally, Standard VI addresses the library profession
by setting a goal for school librarians to promote the success of all students by protecting
intellectual freedom, collaborating with other librarians in professional associations, and
engaging in self-evaluation and self-directed learning to benefit the school library
development and collection (Texas State Library and Archives Commission,, 2005).

40

Minimum Standards for Accreditation
In 2013, the Texas Library Association and the Texas State Library and Archives
Commission task force reviewed the Minimum Standards for Accreditation of Libraries
in the State Library System (Texas Administrative Code, 2015). These accreditation rules
are not included in the Texas Public Library Standards. These requirements only apply to
public libraries. Figure 4 illustrates a summary of the 12 requirements that a public
library must meet to be accredited in the Texas State Library System. Libraries that are
accredited are eligible for certain state services, such as the TexShare databases, and the
TexShare reciprocal borrowing and interlibrary loan program. In addition, state
accredited libraries are offered grant opportunities, training, and educational programs
unavailable to those outside the state library system (Texas Administration Code, 2015).
Figure 4 identifies the 12 areas of the Texas Administrative Code that apply to
public library accreditation in the Texas State Library System. The calculation of the
population that a public library serves is based on county and school district details. For
example, an established public library must not charge for general library services to any
person residing in the local political subdivisions that provide monetary support to the
library. If a library is unable to maintain or increase local operating expenditures each
year, this accreditation requirement may be amended to local operating expenditures
based on per capita numbers. The nondiscriminatory statement from each public library
must be on file at the state library in Austin. “A public library that does not meet one of
the requirements of accreditation cited in 1.81 of this title may be provisionally
41

accredited for 3 years, but then must fully meet all requirements in effect at that time.”
(Texas Administrative Code, 2015, p. 5).
The other requirements for accreditation that include communication tools for
library staff and patrons, designates Internet access on at least one publicly accessible
computer, a website, an online catalog of resources, and continuing education
requirements for the library director. The library director must be a professional librarian,
if not with a master’s degree, then by certification with a Special County Librarians
Certificate if the population served is less than 17,000.

Correlating the Standards
Correlating the standards from the Texas Public Library Standards, the School
Library Program Guidelines and Standards for Texas, and the Minimum Standards for
Accreditation in the State Library System allowed the researcher to see a framework for
joint use library standards. Figure 5 illustrates the correlation of current Texas Library
Standards.

Figure 5. Correlation of Current Texas Library Standards
43

Although the standards and requirements are not identical in Texas for public,
school, and accreditation categories, they do correlate to one another. As illustrated in
Figure 5, Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 1.71, population served in a public library is
directly related to the per capita requirements in the Texas public library standards for
Services and Collection, as well as the Texas school library standard Connections to
Community. The public library standards for Facilities relates to the school library
standard of Library Environment, as well as the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 1.73
Legal Establishment. The school library standard of Librarianship parallels the public
library standard of promoting intellectual freedom and TAC Code 1.75 of
Nondiscrimination. The public library standards in Finance show a relationship to the
school standards of Leadership and Management, as well as the quantitative accreditation
requirements in TAC Code1.74 and 1.81, that detail local operating expenditure
expectations for public libraries. The accreditation requirements in TAC Code 1.81 relate
to school library standards in Collections, Connections to Community, Library
Environment, and Leadership. Accreditation requirements link to public library standards
in Library Services, Collections, and Facilities. Associating each area of standards for
Texas school libraries and Texas public libraries creates a framework for library
standards that would apply to joint use school/public libraries.
National Research on Joint Use Libraries
Joint use libraries continue to grow nationally in an effort to provide better library
services to more people at a lower cost (Fitzgibbons, 2000). There are currently no
44

official standards for joint use school/public libraries in Texas. However, there are
several advantages and disadvantages of combined library service detailed in national
research on joint use libraries.
Advantages of Joint Use Libraries
Fitzgibbons (2000) explored a range of successful ventures between public and
school libraries. According to Fitzgibbons (2000), the essential ingredient to a successful
joint use library is cooperation between the city and school governing agencies. This
relationship must include a shared vision, common goals for the library, and the
establishment of joint policies and procedures. Fitzgibbons (2000) approached joint use
library service as a positive endeavor based on the following two assumptions:
Cooperative relationships improve library services, providing better information access to
students and public library users; a cooperative, not competitive, relationship between the
city and the school must exist for the improved library service in a combined library to
develop.
Though joint use libraries face complex challenges, they continue to increase in
number in the United States One reason is the current drive for economy (Gunnels and
Green, 2012). McNicol (2008) described financial benefits from one library providing
service to more than one population. “Greater efficiency in a shared building results in
reduced overhead costs related to utilities, maintenance, and landscaping” (McNicol,
2008, p. 23). A joint use library faces many resource management issues. In a
school/public library, the city may pay for staffing to serve public library patrons outside
45

the hours of the school day. Or, the financial support of human resources may be shared
between the city and school district. Inherently, a joint use library will benefit from more
than one funding entity, given that money from the city and school will be in the library
budget. McNicol (2008) pointed out that partnership in library services may save money,
but there is the additional cost of time commitment and consistent communication efforts
to make the partnership between a city library and a school library work well. The longterm financial future of a joint use library is secured through a legally binding joint use
agreement between the city and the school (McNicol, 2008).
Casey (2012) explored several issues on behalf of a school superintendent in
Illinois who was approached by the local public library about the possibility of placing a
branch of the public library in a new middle school. Casey (2012) compiled a list of
questions addressing location, expenditures, service issues, and staff and administrative
concerns. The following questions from Casey’s research apply to all school/public joint
use libraries, illustrating the complexity of the joint use library challenge:
•

Who would pay for staffing, processing and maintenance of library materials?

•

Would school and public library collections be merged or kept separate?

•

Would the school keep students from reading materials deemed inappropriate?

•

What kind of access would the public have to the library during school hours?

•

Is collaboration in a joint use library key to the efficient use of budget money?

46

Casey (2012) did not offer solutions to these questions posed about joint use library
service, but successful tactics for combined library service was identified in other
literature.
Joint use library services can complement each other. Gunnels and Green (2012)
noted “government entities throughout Texas are trying to stretch scarce budget dollars as
far as they will go, and one promising way to do so is to collaborate in providing key
functions” (p. 1). The school/public library will have “material for all ages and reading
abilities” (Gunnels & Green, 2012, p. 1). A single sector school or public library would
not have such a wide variety of material available. In addition, combined libraries offer
more hours of operation than a separate school or public library. Gunnels and Green
(2012) identified other positive aspects of joint use libraries:
•

Joint use libraries are part of the future as a way to save construction and
collection costs.

•

Effective leadership in joint use libraries requires transformational thinking.

•

California and Florida are states where joint use libraries are successful and
revitalized.

•

Joint use libraries are more likely to remain funded during budget cuts because
they have more community involvement than separate school or public libraries.
Bauer (1995) wrote a dissertation in 1995 after conducting a field study of a joint

use public/school library in Florida to identify factors which affect the quality of library
service. Bauer’s (2006) research was a follow-up of her doctoral work. Bauer focused on
47

personnel issues that arose in 1995 when the joint use library was initiated between the
city and a middle school, and then again when the same library transitioned into a joint
use college/city library. Bauer (2006) concluded that work roles for library staff,
management practices for library directors, and training models can be implemented
successfully with a detailed joint use agreement. The joint use agreement for the
combined facility needs to be a detailed guide for daily operation, with “some room for
interpretation by the library director charged with the implementation of the procedures
the agreement set forth” (Bauer, 2006, p. 593). Overall, Bauer emphasized (1995, 2006)
that a joint use library certainly benefits small communities lacking a sufficient tax base
to support an independent public library.
Mary Lankford was commissioned by the Texas State Library and Archives
Commission in 2006 to prepare a study of joint use school/public libraries in Texas. The
goals of the study were to record how current joint use school/public libraries were
serving school and public populations at the same time, and to identify the success factors
for joint use library service. Lankford gathered data from a 100-question survey of 24
Texas joint use school/public libraries that addressed 10 areas of joint use library service.
Lankford’s study also led to a Handbook for Planning Joint Use School/Public Libraries
that is available through the Texas State Library. Lankford found that economic factors
were not the most important measure of success for joint libraries. Quality of life
improved for people who used a joint use library (Lankford, 2006). Lankford agreed that
the missions of school/public libraries are different, but with stakeholder commitment to
48

the idea of a shared library, materials and technology can be provided for the educational
needs of students and community members, as well as a center for lifelong learning for
community members of all ages (Lankford, 2006).
Disadvantages of Joint Use Libraries
Moorman (2002b) compared the topic of joint use libraries to the political agenda
that has the face value of saving taxpayers’ money, but in reality is an empty promise.
“Don’t Do It!” is Moorman’s academic advice if a joint use library’s main purpose in a
community is just economic (Moorman, 2002b, p. 314). The main disadvantage of joint
use library service is identified as a decrease in the quality of service when one library
tries to meet the needs of students and a community from one facility. Moorman (2002a)
also wrote a case study dissertation comparing user survey and financial data from
statistically matched separate and joint use school/public libraries. Overall, Moorman
(2002a) discovered difficulties occurred when joint libraries attempted to meet the
information needs of both students and community members. Moorman recognized that
school and public libraries have different missions, and considered the effort to combine
such different visions a tremendous hurdle to overcome. In addition, Moorman wrote that
adults are reluctant to visit a school campus for their personal library use. In light of past
and current violent school events, security is a paramount concern in joint use
school/public libraries.
Moorman (2002b) does concede that a joint use school/public library can provide
excellent library service if a “unique set of factors are in place and effective combined
49

libraries are the exception, rather than the rule” (p. 315). However, if the following
conditions detailed by Moorman (2002b) can be met, financial savings and quality
service may be provided from a joint use school/public library:
•

Community understanding and support of joint use library concept.

•

Legally binding contract between public library and the school district.

•

The joint use library is accessible to the public from outside the school building,
with separate but convenient parking.

Moorman (2002b) found that the above conditions so rarely existed in any one
community, that unless there are fewer than 3,000 residents and the joint use library is the
only viable option for library service, then students and community members are better
served with separate libraries, rather than a combined library.
Libraries as Community Anchors
The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency that
funds museums and libraries, provided a national perspective of libraries by describing
libraries as “community anchors” (Hildreth, 2012, p. 44). Beyond the amount of dollars
designated for libraries, there is a philosophy from IMLS that libraries should be places
where lifelong learning is cultivated, and cultural and civic engagement is encouraged.
The IMLS plan, “Creating a Nation of Learners,” is the guide for areas of support the
IMLS will fund to make libraries “safe places for community gathering and venues for
cultural expression and lifelong learning” (Hildreth, 2012, p. 44). “Community anchor” is
a specific role a library can fulfill by providing access to public computers and high
50

speed Internet for all library patrons. This type of library service allows library users to
find meaningful information about job possibilities, health knowledge, financial literacy,
and communicate online with others. These are critically important services, especially in
the rural and low-income areas many libraries serve (Hildreth, 2012). Joint use libraries
have a unique ability to strengthen community life by responding to school and
community needs from one location. Sustaining joint use library service ensures that
students and public patrons who do not have access to personal technology can use the
library to develop and use the latest technology skills. According to Hildreth (2012),
“investment in library services is an investment in the community” (p. 44).
International Research on Joint Use Libraries
Joint use libraries similar to those in the United States have existed in many
countries for more than a century. Often, international joint use libraries were established
to provide public library services in rural areas where a lack of funding made separate
public facilities impossible (Matthews and Calvert, 2007). The exact number of
combined use libraries around the world is unknown. Fitzgibbons (2000) reported there
are at least 67 joint use libraries in 17 states in the United States. Bundy and Amey
(2006) described 200 joint use libraries in Canada and 120 in Australia. The United
Kingdom listed 60 shared libraries in 2005 (Bundy and Amey, 2005), but this number
might be an underestimate of libraries with joint use components.
Matthews and Calvert (2007) established Critical Success Factors for joint school
and community libraries in New Zealand. A comparison of these factors with others
51

found in international literature on shared libraries yielded guidelines for combined
libraries to be successful. These guidelines include “goodwill, communication,
flexibility, and tolerance” between partners as basic “synergy” elements that contribute
positively to joint use library success (p. 16).
The following critical success factors were compiled by Matthews and Calvert
(2007) to identify concrete elements that improved combined library services in New
Zealand:
● A formal management agreement.
● One library manager with overall responsibility.
● Community support.
● Adequate size with room for expansion.
● Convenient location for all.
● Adequate staffing and operating hours.
●

Membership in a larger library network.

● No restriction on collection for user group.
Although the research on joint use libraries in developing countries is more
limited, Liu (2008) illustrated how school-housed public libraries were a good solution
for sparsely populated rural areas in the northwestern region of China. These libraries
focused on reaching out to villagers who would not usually receive library service.
However, Liu (2008) pointed out that combined libraries do not necessarily serve an
equal function to both the school and the public community. China faces the same
52

security challenges as America when public patrons enter a school facility. Liu (2008)
concluded that the primary service of a school library is to serve the school. Attempting
to provide adequate community library service simultaneously might spread the school
resources too thin. It is important to note that the joint use libraries Liu researched in
China were primarily school libraries inside a teaching building, with no public library
staff or funding support from the government’s public library system (Liu, 2008).
The Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) is committed to
excellent joint use library service. The ALIA issued a formal statement declaring that
joint use libraries should be “established in communities if they equal or better the level
of service which would be given in separate facilities”(Australian Library and
Information Association, 2015, p.1). Similar to Moorman’s insistence that certain
conditions must be present for a joint use library to succeed, the ALIA cites many of the
same conditions as Moorman, but in a more positive light. Australia acknowledges that
joint use libraries are complex facilities that are challenging to manage, and sometimes
vulnerable to failure. Conversely, ALIA specifies these details to promote success:
•

Unequivocal commitment of all interested parties.

•

Full consultation involving all parties prior to decision about library.

•

Position of the library for convenient access.

•

Signing of formal agreement considering development, funding, and maintenance
of the library.

•

Single library manager with regular evaluation of library services.
53

Bergoc (2012) traced South Australia joint use library ventures back to 1977, and
stated that while now there are more than 50 joint use libraries in South Australia, no two
facilities are exactly the same. As a joint use library manager with 14 years of experience,
Bergoc has worked in Onkaparinga, which hosts three joint use libraries in one
metropolitan area. Each of these libraries has unique partnership characteristics that have
contributed to their successes and challenges. Generally, Bergoc wrote about the need for
library staff in a joint use facility to develop additional reference and research skills to
meet the higher expectations of a combined library user group. Often, library staffs are
trained in only one area of library expertise, as a public or school library employee. A
joint use library staff must be “cross-trained” to meet the needs of students, preschool
children, adults, and senior citizens (Bergoc, 2012, p. 118). Additionally, Bergoc (2012)
identified “resiliency and flexibility,” as important library staff skills, because in the
world of joint use libraries, as in all of society, “change is the only constant” (p. 117).
Ison (2012) presented research from a 12-year study of a large, three-way joint
use library in South Australia, the Berri Library and Information Center. This facility was
considered unusual when it was established in 1999, because it would serve a high
school, a technical college, and the local community. Measuring the effectiveness of this
library has been a priority and numerous user satisfaction surveys revealed user
satisfaction with library staff and the joint use library facilities. However, Ison (2012)
discovered that the same challenges occur in other combined libraries. Noise from
students disrupted public visitors. Difficulties sometime occurred with increased demand
54

for Internet access computer terminals. However, Ison (2012) concluded that overall
unrestricted shared space and access to the collection for both public and school library
visitors created a positive climate of joint library use in South Australia.
Ison’s (2012) study was long-term, encompassing numerous changes that
occurred in the joint use library during the years of research. Originally, the joint use
agreement was a 15-year contract, at which time the partners were required to renegotiate
utility costs, budget designations, and renovations of highly used areas. The children’s
area was expanded and a designated young adult area was constructed. At the conclusion
of the study, Ison (2012) felt sole employment created staff cohesiveness, and in turn,
better library service for users (p. 132.). Most important, Ison (2012) pointed out that
three separate libraries never could have delivered the level of curriculum support to
students that the combined facility in Berri offers to two schools and the community.
Types of Joint Use Libraries
Joint use libraries can represent a variety of partnerships. Most often, a shared
library is either a combination of a school and public library, or a public and college
library. School/public joint use libraries are usually situated in small rural areas, although
they are present in bigger communities. Other types of joint use libraries include higher
education facilities, such as technical schools, community colleges, or universities that
partner with a community to form a joint use college/public library (American Library
Association, 2002). A few of these libraries, like the San Jose Public Library in

55

California and the Alvin Sherman Library in Florida, are large multi-faceted institutions
that serve thousands of patrons (Gunnels et al., 2012).
Joint Use College/Public Libraries
In El Paso, Texas, community college students share library space with teen
moms attending story time with their toddlers in the Laura Bush Community Library.
Joint use college/public libraries offer spaces where teens, babies, and grandparents share
a social environment that fosters learning and personal growth (Jackson and Bell, 2008).
A member of the American Library Association founded the El Paso Joint Use
Partnership panel. The goal of the library is to serve the underserved in the northwest
section of the city, the area where Laura Bush’s mother grew up. For four years, this
library has served both college students and a lower economic community. It offers 546
programs with 17,289 attendees learning creative and practical writing, sign language,
anime, guitar basics, belly dancing, martial arts, ESL, and English reading skills. Many
college students bring their families to the library while they do their academic
assignments (Jackson and Bell, 2008). This is a joint use college/public library where all
age levels find a social environment in which to learn side by side.
Gunnels et al., (2012) researched joint use college/public libraries and published
a book that details the history, design, legal considerations, and effective management of
shared college/public libraries. All three researchers work in a joint use Texas
college/public library setting. Gunnels concludes that college/public libraries are a better
combination than joint use school/public libraries because higher education students find
56

the public library’s collection often meets their college academic needs (Gunnels et al.,
2012). Gunnels et al. (2012) determined school/public library combinations experience
more challenges to good service than the academic and public combination of library
service (Gunnels & Green, 2012).
Gunnels et al. (2012) concede that, in the past, college and public libraries had
different services and operating methods. The mission of an college library was to serve
faculty and students, as well as enable research. Public libraries provided educational
resources for a community. These stereotypes, like many other aspects of the library
world, have changed. The two cultures, academic and public, still must merge. However,
Gunnels et al. (2012) proposed that the collections and programming for both population
groups can survive and thrive. Gunnels et al. (2012) acknowledge that staff conflict, due
to previously regimented roles as either public or college librarians, may occur in new
joint use libraries. North Lake College, in Irving, Texas, is an example of a well-funded
newly constructed joint use college/public library that failed after a few years and closed.
Gunnels et al. (2012) attributes this “divorce” of library services to the
miscommunication of goals and the loss of commitment to success when the original
planners of the joint library moved on to other library positions (p. 28).
Gunnels et al. (2012) wrote about the opening of the 78,500 square foot Lone Star
College System Library, which also serves the Tomball community population. When
this facility first opened, there were two library directors and separate staff for college
and public library users. This dual employer situation created two distinct cultures that
57

were unable to cooperate as partners. Over time, three simple solutions remedied the
division between college and public library staff. First, the desk from which the college
librarians worked was placed toward the front of the library where they began to have
daily interaction with public library visitors. Second, the public library staff enjoyed the
same job perks as college employees for discount tickets to college performances and
free access to the wellness center. Finally, the element of unified quality customer service
solidified the staff. Gunnels et al. (2012) challenged other joint use libraries to embrace
the different cultures multiple library user groups bring to a shared facility.
Joint Use School/Public Libraries
As early as 1897, historical records indicate that public libraries in the United
States responded to the educational needs of students, because school libraries were rare
at that time (Liu, 2008). Before public libraries were developed in rural areas, schools
would often make their resources available to local communities. Public libraries situated
in schools began to appear in the 1930s. White (1963) published the earliest research on
joint school/public libraries, noting the inconvenience for public patrons from the noise
of the school, but also conceding that the appearance of local residents inside a school
can be seen as disruptive by teachers and school administrators. In the early 1960s, the
American Library Association published a study of joint use school/public libraries in
more than 70 library systems that place a public library in a school and 84 joint use
libraries in communities of more than 2,500 in which the main public library was situated
in a school. School/public combined libraries were the most common partnership of joint
58

use libraries, but recently more joint use college/public libraries have opened (Brievik et
al., 2005).
Challenges for school/public libraries. Published research about shared libraries
most often addresses school and community libraries that are on school campuses,
sometimes within the school itself. Many issues emerge from this arrangement, including
security and the reluctance of public library visitors to enter a school. Moorman (2002a)
detailed the common reluctance of adults to enter a library located inside a school
building, as well as the reluctance of students from other schools to use a public library
located at an individual school campus. In a combined school/public library, adult
materials might not be considered appropriate for a school collection. Moorman’s
(2002a) doctoral study led him to conclude that joint use libraries are effective and
successful only when a certain set of circumstances are present. These included:
● Solid community understanding and support.
● A legally binding contract between the city and school district.
● A library entrance outside the school building for public visitors including
separate parking.
Moorman felt these circumstances rarely existed together at any one time. Overall,
Moorman (2002b) concluded joint school/public libraries were successful only in
communities of less than 3,000 residents (p. 315).
Successes of school/public libraries. There are successful strategies for library
procedures that make combined school/public libraries successful, especially in rural
59

areas (McNicol, 2008). The addition of a certified school librarian to public library
staffing improves professional library service. Joint use libraries provide an increase in
the availability of electronic resources and a larger collection of physical items (Jackson
and Bell, 2008).
Auld (2002a) wrote of two successful school/public library combinations in Riverside
County, California. The key to a successful school/public joint use library is the same as
for any partnership, mutual benefit combined with a sense of shared purpose (Auld,
2002a). Many studies from the last 20 years present a negative view of the success of
school/public libraries. Powers (2007) studied combined libraries in Arizona and
described essential characteristics of success for these facilities. Key ingredients for
success include:
●

Keep the library separate from the rest of the school.

●

Provide separate entrances for public and school library visitors.

●

Make the library visible from the street with a designated parking lot.

All joint libraries have a common goal, to serve all members of a community. “With
passion, perseverance, and trust, joint-partnership can be a resounding success” (Jackson
and Bell, 2008, p. 2).
Lankford: Joint Use Library Report and Handbook
Mary Lankford, working in 2006 as a consultant for the Texas State Library and
Archives Commission, created a report about the joint use school/public libraries in
Texas and a handbook for communities that wanted to open a joint use school/public
60

library. Twenty-four currently operating joint use libraries were identified by the Texas
State Library’s Director of Library Development for Lankford to survey. Lankford’s
work led to an extensive report that addressed how joint use libraries could meet the
goals determined by the state of Texas to effectively serve both school and public
populations. Lankford acknowledged the need for joint use library standards, suggesting
that the specific goal for those standards would be to determine if a joint use library
mission is accomplished. As stated previously, Lankford visited 10 of the 24 joint use
libraries in Texas at the time of her survey and contacted all the libraries through
telephone interviews. Lankford used the 2004 Texas Public Library Statistics, but noted
in her work that joint use libraries did not report statistics separately for public and school
library communities. The Texas Administrative Code Rules for Administering the Library
Systems Act Rule 1.81 Minimum Standards for Accreditation of Libraries in The State
Library System is mandatory for joint use school/public libraries that are members of the
Texas Public Library System. These rules address the following areas:
•

Local Expenditures per Capita.

•

Library Materials per Capita.

•

Weekly Service Hours.

•

Weekly Hours of Head Librarian.

Although the above requirements are not considered standards for joint use libraries, the
Texas Library Association web site states “In addition to developing and evaluating their

61

own client based goals, joint use libraries are obliged to implement other standards as
will best benefit their community” (Lankford, 2005, p. 28).
The library plays an important role in providing educational opportunities for
people in all walks of life. Lankford (2006) cited research that established schools with
good library services and librarians who collaborate with teachers reflect higher student
achievement scores. Lankford wrote that joint use libraries “stretch tax dollars, without
duplicating services,” and found that to be “an idea that maximizes resources and
expands use of current facilities” (p. 14). Lankford was specific in the report to highlight
the unique challenges of combined school/public libraries. For instance, at the Acceptable
level of Standard III, Principal 1 of the Texas School Library Standards states that a
school library should provide a balanced and current collection of at least 9,000 items, or
at least six items per student at the elementary level, 14 items per student at the middle
school level, and at least 12 items per student at the high school level (Texas State
Library Archives and Commission, 2005, p. 16). However, it would be difficult to
evaluate the level of success of the joint use library in achieving this recommended
collection size, because a collection is used by all ages. To try and specify the percentage
of the combined library’s collection for adults would also be difficult, because adult
materials are used by adults and young people. Likewise, it is equally challenging to
determine if a public/school library contains a collection that adequately supports the
school curriculum (Lankford, 2006).

62

Lankford (2005) suggested a joint use school/public library would be most useful
in underserved communities. These would be areas that do not have a public library, or
do not have campus libraries within each school. Lankford was careful to note that joint
use libraries are more than a shared building. Stakeholders with an interest in a joint use
library include all people in a community who can contribute to the facility. This would
include community members, school officials, interested citizens, librarians, city
administrators, teachers, and parents. Again, Texas Public Library Standards state that the
minimum standards for the local expenditure efforts of a public library are determined by
the size of the local population served. A library serving a population between 10,000 and
25,000 should spend at least $1.50 per capita annually. If a library serves a smaller
population, between 5,000 and 10,000 people, then local expenditures should reach $1.20
per capita, or $5,000, whichever is greater. These requirements would apply to joint use
libraries, even in the smallest communities, where funding is more of a challenge (Texas
Library Association, 2014, p. 11).
Lankford’s (2006) advice for success in a joint use library venture included that
the shared library serves both missions of meeting school and community information
needs. The library should embrace both missions with one statement and a contract or
memorandum of understanding. This document would be a joint use agreement that
reflects the demographics and interests of the community, as well as supporting the
school campus curriculum. Of the 24 shared libraries surveyed by Lankford, 70%
reported an adequate governance document that was on file with the Texas State Library.
63

These documents included a Board of Directors Resolution, Certificate of Resolution,
Certificate of Incorporation, City Council Resolution Ordinance, and several varieties of
contracts between cities and school boards. A variety of documents may be used to
establish joint use libraries in Texas (Lankford, 2006, p. 7).
Lankford (2006) agreed that the mission of school/public libraries are different,
but can merge successfully with stakeholder buy-in to the idea of a shared building. In a
community-supported joint use library, materials and technology can be provided for
educational needs, creating a center for lifelong learning for community members of all
ages. McNicol (2008) agreed the majority of school/public libraries provide adequate
service for their school, but questioned the level of service joint use libraries offer their
communities. Only when specific services are present in a shared library can that facility
adequately meet the needs of a community and school. These services should include
convenient location of the library, lifelong learning opportunities, and intergenerational
interaction.
Resource Management for Joint Use Libraries
Budget dollars for libraries are scarce and stretched to meet as many needs as
possible. Todaro (2009) gathered data from a sample of 1,200 people during telephone
surveys to “gauge the perception of libraries” among Texas voters (p. 80). This research
was contracted with a professional survey firm and titled The Texas Voter/Public Opinion
Survey. The data was gathered from a random digit dial of adults 18 and older who were
registered to vote. This research showed merit in its sample size, which included 800
64

voters, an acceptable poll size according to national measurements. The data gathered
from the telephone survey emphasized a positive voter perception of Texas libraries and
support for further funding of school libraries. Respondents considered libraries to be
“vital to a student’s education” (Todaro, 2009, p. 82). The results of the survey indicated
80% or greater agreement in all areas of questioning, and across political party affiliation,
that voters support legislation to provide all students with a school library that meets
statewide standards (Todaro, 2009).
Politicians, administrators, and school board members are aware of many issues
during the funding process for school libraries. For example, research has shown that
“students are more engaged and more successful when the library is student and teachercentered, contains a robust collection, and employs a certified school librarian” (Todaro,
2009, p. 80). Hildreth (2012) summarized why financial support of libraries is important.
“A variety of investments [in libraries] will help reveal what works, identifying
challenges and information gaps, to determine and communicate best practices” (p.45).
According to Todaro (2013) scarce public funds can be garnered for libraries if librarians
do not use the “fund us because we are noble” rationale (p. 1). Instead, Todaro (2013)
suggests that librarians openly address the tight fiscal environment and justify every
expenditure a library makes. Revealing the cost-benefit and return on investment details
of a library shows how valuable libraries are as a “universal classroom” to society (p. 2).
The Texas Library Association (2014) in the Pocket Guide to 21st Century
Libraries detailed financial data from the circulation of books in Texas public and college
65

libraries for a single year. When that number was multiplied by an average book price of
$20, the cumulative merchandise value of libraries was more than two billion dollars for
12 calendar months. The return on investment in a library is almost too large to measure
because it includes:
•

Statewide interlibrary loans.

•

Thousands of attendees for free library programs.

•

Library support of student achievement and higher education.

•

Circulation of materials.

•

The provision of electronic resources worth millions of dollars to library users at
no cost (Todaro, 2013).

Gunnels et al. (2012) suggested that it takes a “rare combination of qualities to create
and make work” a joint use library (p. 152). This is largely due to budget cuts that affect
the partnership of shared libraries, making one or more partners unable to meet the
financial responsibilities required by the shared facility. From a different perspective,
libraries that are unwilling to partner with other libraries certainly risk remaining
significant in their communities. Due to widespread budget cuts, libraries unwilling to
change and adapt to sharing services may threaten their own survival (Gunnels et al.,
2012).
Joint Use Library Agreements
The joint use agreement is a primary factor in determining the success of a
combined library, “complemented by the adeptness with which a library manager uses it”
66

(Bergoc, 2012, p. 116). The joint use agreement details and embraces a shared vision
between the partners in the facility. For a joint use library to succeed, decision makers
must identify needs and develop plans to meet those needs. It is essential that the city and
school district define their roles and inform their respective communities of similarities
and differences in philosophy and service (Henderson, 2007). A successful joint use
agreement between a city and school district for a shared library facility will include:
● Common visions and goals.
● Commitment and active communication from school and city administrators.
● Adequate funding and staffing. (Fitzgibbons, 2000).
A strong joint use agreement should spell out policies for each phase of library
operation, as well as the responsibilities of the school and city agencies (Moorman,
2002). As long as a joint library does not benefit either the school or public library user
population disproportionately, the arrangement can work well, as evidenced in the
Riverside County libraries highlighted in Smith’s (2002) research. Bergoc (2012)
identified the joint use agreement as the document that “underpins service delivery and
facility management” (p.116).
McNicol (2008) advocated a formal agreement endorsed by all cooperating
authorities that would include these essential items:
● Adequate space
● Professional development for staff
● Technology
67

● Library service assessment and evaluation tools
● Policies for dissolution, should the joint use library fail to provide adequate
service to all user groups.
Combined school/public libraries tend to be smaller than combined college/public
libraries. When a library serves a smaller population, the organization of the joint use
agreement may be more casual than formal. Despite the size of a library, if there is not a
legally binding document to detail the partnership between city and school, the success of
the joint use library may be compromised. Without a document, the partnership may be
built solely on the strength of personal trust among the stakeholders. Acceptance of a
written joint use agreement is necessary to the success of the joint use library (Dalton,
Elkin, & Hanaford, 2006).
Joint use agreements should address required staffing skills, customer
expectations, and flexibility to change. Because a library is a “living classroom,” change
is a constant in library service (Bergoc, 2012, p. 118). The joint use agreement must
address collaboration, cooperation, and communication by defining service level
agreements and how those are measured and reported in a joint use library. Just like the
library building, a joint use agreement will age and change (Bergoc, 2012). A
comprehensive agreement would provide guidelines for the replacement of library items,
library furniture and the replacement of the joint use agreement itself (Bergoc, 2012).
Bundy (2003) observed that the core value of shared libraries is cooperation. It is a

68

successful manifestation of cooperation between partners that lessen “susceptibility to
failure or dysfunction” (p. 129).
In Texas, the Texas State Library and Archives Commission sets requirements for
the establishment of a joint use school/public library. These requirements may change
and each community has its own set of circumstances. The statute is Vernon’s Civil
Statutes. Library Laws of Texas authorizes a contract between a school district and a city
or county. In Texas Statutes Section 33.022 (Texas Administrative Code, 2915), “A
school district may enter into contracts with a county or municipality in which the district
is located to provide joint library facilities.” This law requires a public hearing before the
joint use library is established, as well as the following requirements:
A public library shall be established by charter, resolution, ordinance, or
by contract as provided in the Government Code with the purpose of
providing free library services. Joint use libraries must file the following
documents with the Texas State Library: Assurance of Nondiscrimination;
Interlocal agreement; Assurance of Compliance with Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act; and Articles of Incorporation (Texas Statutes, 33.022).
The joint use agreement is necessary for legal establishment of the combined
library, as well as successful implementation of joint use library services (Texas
Administrative Code, 2015).
Future Trends of Joint Use Libraries

69

Lankford (2006) suggested that Texas, because of its size and large rural areas, is
an ideal location for future joint use libraries. The majority of the combined libraries
Lankford researched in Texas were providing full service to their school/public
communities (Lankford, 2005). The development of more dual use libraries, according to
Lankford, should be a part of future planning for library service in Texas. The library has
evolved from a place to store books and read, to a place for reading, learning, and using
technology. The exponentially changing digital world constantly challenges libraries and
professional library staffs to the challenge of utilizing continually new information
sources (McNicol, 2008).
Google publicly recognized librarians as partners in the information world
(Gunnels et al., 2012). Google Books is an example of this partnership and highlights the
value of collaboration as exemplified by the contract Google established with libraries of
all types to scan their collections, making those items available to the world through
Google Books (Gunnels & Green, 2012). Joint use libraries reflect the same cooperation
and efficient use of resources in a practical sense of combining resources to make them
available to more than one group of library patrons. That type of library service is
relevant now and will be increasingly valuable in the future (McNicol, 2008).
Research cannot precisely predict what future libraries will look like. Kurzweil
(2005) describes the current technology landscape as changing so rapidly that even five
years from the present remains an exciting mystery. However, change itself is certain.
Libraries must respond positively and realize that a stand-alone, self-reliant library
70

facility is not practical, efficient, or effective. Libraries must change because the
environment and community continue to change. This change will require that libraries
work with other service providers to marshal all available information resources for
schools and communities (Gunnels et al., 2012; Texas Library Association, 2014).
Systematic and objective evaluation of current joint use library services
should be implemented with joint use library standards to assess how combined
facilities improve library service to communities (Fitzgibbons, 2000). Though
this section focuses on the future, Haycock (1990) stated,
Good management practice means constant evaluation on a formal
and informal basis and from both perspectives [in a joint use
library]. Too frequently, one partner, usually the school, where
there has been a strong program, gains in service but public library
service suffers because it is evaluated, not on the basis of what
should be, but on the basis of ‘something is better than nothing.’
Joint projects should be mutually beneficial and subject to contract
revision and renewal on a regular basis (p.33).
Overall, Lankford (2006) insisted that joint use library projects should be
mutually beneficial and have enormous potential for future library service where
“sufficient planning with some expertise has preceded library decision-making”
(p. 40). Texas, because of its size and underserved populations for library

71

services in large rural and isolated areas, is an ideal location for developing joint
use libraries as libraries of the future (Lankford, 2006).
Critical Success Factors for Joint Use Libraries
Lankford, (2006), McNicol, (2008), and Gunnels et al. (2012), addressed factors
that determine whether a joint use library functions as a successful or marginal facility.
These elements are based on researcher observations, responses to interview questions,
and librarian experiences in joint use library programs.
Lankford identified characteristics of service in joint use libraries that serve as
excellent models for combined libraries. It is important to utilize each part of a library,
create planning that involves community and school groups, and guarantee service even
when school is not in session (Lankford, 2006). Specific behaviors of the library director
support successful joint use library service:
•

The librarian must be enthusiastic about the positive potential effect of a joint use
library on the community. Lankford felt enthusiasm was “impossible to quantify,
but was an observable behavior to the library visitor” (p. 33).

•

The librarian must serve as a change agent to engage all possible segments of the
public and school community to offer improved library service in a joint use
facility.

•

The library director should utilize the professional development programs for the
library staff that are offered through the Texas state library and regional Texas
Education Service Centers.
72

•

The library director and staff are actively involved in community activities to
promote the library as a welcoming place to school and public visitors.

•

Information science and librarianship are service-oriented professions. Library
service includes an ever-evolving understanding of the community and school.
The library must remain flexible to change as the information needs of library
patrons change.

•

The most important part of library service is not the items available for checkout,
but the quality of the customer service. Education trends and emerging technology
create the needs for an ever-expanding array of library services.

•

The library director must secure funding for technology, learning to use and
instruct others in new technology skills for library services to remain relevant in
the 21st century (Lankford, 2006).

McNicol (2008) detailed several requirements joint use libraries should require to ensure
successful, long-term services:
•

Full commitment from school district and city stakeholders, evidenced by the
signing of a formal joint use agreement.

•

Consultation of school and city governing boards prior to library decisions
involving change, development, maintenance, and funding of the library.

•

Access to all users during library operating hours, with the addition of hours
outside the school day, as well as during weekends and school holidays (McNicol,
2008).
73

In direct opposition to critical success factors, the literature also contained
research that questioned the credibility of joint use libraries (Moorman (2002a), Gunnels
& Green (2012), and Lankford (2006). Seminal research on joint use libraries related
mostly to school community libraries. White (1963) added to the negative literature about
shared libraries with responses recorded from librarians who were very critical of schoolhoused libraries because schools are usually distant from business and shopping areas
where pubic libraries are most conveniently located. White (1963) also noted that small
communities may be unable to afford to hire and sufficiently train one librarian to meet
both public and school library user needs. Moorman (2002a) reiterated White’s concerns
and emphasized that not all joint use libraries truly show a real financial savings from
combined library services. Gunnels and Green (2012) and Lankford (2005)
acknowledged the reluctance of the public to use a library located in a school, particularly
during school hours. These concerns illuminate the need for accepted and official joint
use library standards for school/public libraries in Texas (Lankford, 2006).
McNicol (2008) wrote that professional attitudes in the library profession have
become accepting of joint use libraries, but shared facilities are still not “embraced
throughout the profession as positive developments” (p.39). Appropriate assessment
tools, such as library standards for joint use libraries, would increase confidence from the
library profession about combined libraries. These services and resources were detailed
by McNicol (2008), who agreed that the location and of joint use libraries should meet
specific expectations and be more diverse than for a single-sector library. A school/public
74

library should be located where it can serve multiple user groups, easily visible and
convenient to the entire community. The design of the facility must allow all visitors to
feel they have equal access to the library materials. The physical layout of a joint use
library must accommodate a wider variety of activities than just a school or public
facility. The use of physical space is enhanced by designating certain areas for quiet
study and others areas as noise tolerant spaces (McNicol, 2008).
Dalton et al., (2006) integrated successful business practices from the corporate
world to encourage joint use libraries to assimilate similar features to improve the
robustness of library services. These imperatives included a positive attitude between the
partners and stakeholders of the library. Partners would include city officials, county
representatives, schoolteachers and administrators, and community members. In addition,
the existence of organization arrangements for the library should be clearly detailed in a
legally binding joint use agreement.
● A shared philosophy of learning between the stakeholders that encompasses the
needs of everyone served by the facility. These groups would include
preschoolers, students, young adults, senior adults, and faculty of the school
campus.
● Harmonious long-term goals detailed in a plan that all partners agree to support,
including plans for dissolution of the joint use library, if services fail to meet
expectations.

75

Todaro (2013) insisted that data will reveal the true value of libraries and is a
critical success factor for school and public facilities. Data creates a culture of
measurement for the library that will evaluate the services of the organization (Todaro,
2013). Consistent data supports and inspires administrative decisions. If objective data is
the foundation for programs and services in the library, an accurate picture emerges of
the return on the investment in library funding. The value of library services increases in
the eyes of decision makers and library users. Todaro (2013) clearly demonstrated the
value of statistical analysis of data from measurements of library usage. Todaro (2009)
also detailed the results of telephone surveys to illuminate the perception of the value of
libraries from registered voters. Todaro (2009) concluded from the survey data that Texas
voters feel libraries are “vital to education” (p.80).
Ison (2012) summarized critical success factors for joint use libraries from a
learning outcome perspective. Patrons were successful locating the information they
needed in a joint use library when the collection was integrated and available to public
and school library visitors. Patrons also felt better served when the library staff served
public and students patrons simultaneously, creating a team-minded and united
appearance to both public and school visitors. The continual support of a joint use library
by the governing agencies in a school district and a community may not be visible to
every day library visitors, but that support in funding and long range planning for
programming is essential to a successful joint use library (Ison, 2012). Brievik et al.,
(2005) reiterated the following details that contribute to the success of joint use facilities:
76

● A sole employment model creates a team-minded and united staff.
● Strong and continual commitment from all library stakeholders serving as partners
in the joint use agreement strengthens the possibility of long-term successful
library service.
The worst possible consequences for a joint use library would be that patrons
would cease to visit, the library staff is continually stressed, and decision-makers do not
share a common vision for the library (Bundy, 2003). In contrast, several successful joint
use libraries resulted from a positive shared program with school and community
commitment. Bundy (2003) detailed several factors attributed to the success of joint use
libraries:
● A fair division of operating costs for the governing entities.
● Leadership and clear role expectations of the governing library board.
● Consideration of future collection and space needs.
Bundy (2003) felt all of these critical success factors could be addressed in a joint use
agreement and measured in library assessment surveys and interviews.
Proposed Joint Use Library Standards for Texas
The Texas State Library and Archives Commission (TSLAC) Task Force on
Public Library Standards and Accreditation has the following imperatives:
● Value all public libraries.
● Value the importance of libraries as community resources.

77

● Value uniqueness and diversity of our communities and their information needs
(Texas Library Association, 2014, p. 1).
Within a joint use agreement, there should be itemized requirements that are factors for
long-range success of the library. Continued communication between the city,
community, school officials and library staff within regularly scheduled meetings is
imperative for the planning, interaction and evaluation of library services. Haycock
(2006) emphasized that a “highly motivated professional librarian should be in charge
and report to a single governance board ” (p.492). In agreement with this
recommendation, Lankford (2006) encouraged the unique role of a joint use librarian
within the community.
Joint use library standards for school/public libraries in Texas would provide the
necessary ingredients for a successful shared venture. The entire spring 2006 issue of
Library Trends featured the theme, “Dual-Use Libraries.” Sarah McNicol (2006, 2008)
served as the issue editor. Several articles are referenced in the current literature review.
Haycock (2006) concisely summarized the results of 30 years of research on combined
school/public libraries. Acknowledging common advantages and disadvantages to joint
use libraries that have been repeatedly identified in the current study, Haycock compiled
the work of researchers from three different countries to articulate a list of predictors for
success in joint use library service.
First, Haycock (2006) determined that a joint use library is most effective serving the
population that is less than 10,000. The library must have a written legal agreement for
78

governance, finances, and administration of daily operations. A decision-making board or
committee develops policies for the library and evaluates the library director. The library
facility adheres to common suggestion from several researchers, that it is conveniently
located and visible to the public. Even though a joint use library is an integrated
institution serving students and the public, there should be designated areas within the
building that accommodate different groups. There should be a separate area for adults
and designated parking that is unavailable to students. The library should be connected to
a larger network of other school libraries and other public libraries, allowing the staff to
learn and communicate with professionals in each area of library service. Finally, an
integral key to success is a “highly motivated professional librarian in charge of the joint
use facility” (p. 488). The library director must assure regular communication and
planned cooperation between public and school library patrons and staff. Only written
joint use library standards could offer any warranty of the above expectations.
Summary
From Gunnels and Green’s (2012) perspective, joint use libraries will become
more common in the 21st century and can be a practical form of library service, because
a shared facility offers more resources than an individual library can provide. In addition,
this literature review identified how research on Texas Public and School Library
Standards suggests the need for joint use library standards. Further, research about joint
use agreements details certain elements essential for a successful dual use library
program. The national and international research on combined libraries literature created
79

a picture of the challenges joint use libraries encounter, and how services might improve
through joint use library standards. “Just as the library media center should be at the heart
of a school, the public library should be at the focal point of the community” (Haycock,
1990, p. 34).
McNicol (2006) emphasized that the guiding principle of a joint use library
provides a better standard of service than would otherwise be possible for users of a
separate school or public library. Successful joint use school and libraries could be “the
most vibrant and community-oriented libraries” (Fitzgibbons, 2000, p. 2).
In the following chapters, the current study utilized a Delphi methodology to
gather the opinions of library experts to address the lack of joint use library standards.
Subsequently, the proposed joint use library standards were used to create a checklist for
Texas school/public libraries to use to assess effective library services.

80

CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY
Introduction
The importance of library standards by which to measure effective serve is well
documented (Lankford, 2006). However, in contrast to Texas library standards for standalone public, school, and college libraries, there are no Texas joint use library standards.
In addition, there is no evidence of an evaluative tool to assist joint use school/public
libraries to measure effective service. This chapter examined the research that illustrated
the need for library standards in school/public libraries and addressed the lack of
adaptation of current public and school library standards to apply to joint use
school/public libraries. The purpose of the current study was two-fold. First, utilizing a
Delphi method research design, library experts identified categories and components to
recommend for the development of joint use school/public library standards. Second,
utilizing the joint use library standards recommended from the Delphi panel, the current
study generated a evaluative checklist for combined school/public libraries to assess
effective library service.
The Delphi research methodology was used in the current study to reach a
consensus from library experts. The Delphi study was appropriate for this research
because it allowed the review of proposed joint use standards from experts with similar
81

professional perspectives (Mertens, 2005). This research was exploratory in nature and
focused on what the library experts believed would function well as joint use library
standards. The panel of library experts completed three survey rounds that included:
1. An initial set of seven profile questions to gather demographic information about
the panel members and 13 open-ended questions to identify categories and
components to develop joint use library standards.
2. Two surveys of structured, Likert-type scaled questions assessing what standards
should be included in the proposed joint use library standards.
Chapter Three documents the purpose of the study, the research questions, the
research design and methodology, the instrumentation, the procedures for collecting data,
and the procedures for analyzing the research data, and ethical considerations.
Research Questions
In an attempt to achieve the purposes of the current study, the following questions
guided the research:
Research Question 1 (RQ1) Can current Texas library standards be adapted to create
joint use library standards?
Sub-Question A (SQA)
How will the categories in current Texas Public Library Standardsbe adapted to
joint use library standards?
Sub-Question B (SQB)
How will the current categories in the Texas School Program Library Standards
82

be adapted to create joint use library standards?

Research Question 2 (RQ2) What are the categories of proposed joint use library
standards recommended by the Delphi expert panel?
Research Question 3 (RQ3) Can the categories of proposed joint use library standards
recommended by the Delphi panel result in a checklist that will help Texas joint
use school/public libraries assess effective library services?
Research Design
The design of the current study utilized the Delphi method to identify categories
of joint use library standards for Texas school/public libraries. After the consensus of
opinion was reached from a panel of library experts, the resulting proposed joint use
library standards were used to create a checklist for shared school/public libraries in
Texas to assess their level of effective policies and library service. The researcher
maintained the anonymity of all panel members, thus reducing any inhibition that might
have arisen from personal interaction between the participants (Marcoux, 1999). Based
on the principle that “pooled intelligence enhances individual judgments and captures the
collective opinion of a group of experts without being physically assembled,” the Delphi
methodology allowed a group of individuals to work as a whole (De Villiers et al. 2005,
p. 639).
Description of the Delphi Method

83

The Delphi method is named for the oracle of Delphi, who was able to foresee the
future, and is used most often for research in the fields of management, medicine, and
education. Delphi is an accepted method of gathering consensus on a topic from experts
who have no direct interaction with each other (Marcoux, 1999). The Experts refine their
opinion on the topic of research based on researcher-controlled feedback gathered from
the other expert opinions. Linstone & Turoff (1975) and Helmer-Hirschberg (1967) cite
examples of Delphi research in educational planning at the national, state, and local
school levels. The Delphi method relies heavily on agreement from an expert panel as the
major component for producing priorities and complex thinking on a topic. The
successful result of the Delphi method is a strong consensual position on a structured
problem (Linstone and Turoff, 1975). Delphi studies are considered most appropriate for
studying topics or problems that can benefit from subjective input from a group of highly
qualified experts, such as the professional librarians in the current study (Rabina, 2013).
The Delphi technique was originally used in the 1950s by Norman Dalkey and
Olaf Helmer to elicit expert opinions about a possible U.S. bomb target after World War
II. The Delphi technique is considered a combination of qualitative and quantitative
research designs. The current study employed the Delphi techniques of anonymous
response to iterative rounds of questionnaires. In addition, controlled feedback from the
researcher served as an attempt to achieve reliable consensus of opinion from the library
expert panel (Hsu and Sandford, 2007; Vernon, 2009). Delphi studies have been widely
used as a decision-making tool in the research community (Marcoux, 1999). Rasp (1974)
84

claimed the Delphi technique has much greater potential than just predicting. It is now an
accepted method of research in the fields of library science and education.
In the current study, the Delphi group communication technique achieved a
convergence of opinion about a real world issue, namely the creation of joint use library
standards. The consensus of opinion about joint use library standards was gathered from
repeated surveys to derive consensus from a panel of library experts (Hsu and Sanford,
2007). Many Delphi studies have been completed in three rounds. It is the repeated
process of the structured questionnaires that allow consensus to build between various
opinions. The iterative structure provides multiple opportunities for participants to rethink their opinions and beliefs about the research topic. As the opinions of the panel
distill toward consensus, the accuracy of the research results increase (Hsu and Sandford,
2007).
The data and statistics gathered during the Delphi method are used to make
decisions (Linstone and Turoff, 1975). Structured communication during the rounds of a
Delphi study utilized individual contributions of expert knowledge and opinions. This
technique has been validated by the Rand Corporation (Helmer-Hirschberg, 1967).
However, the Delphi technique is not solely focused on the panel experts making a
decision. A successful Delphi study will have a group of experts look at options and
evidence for consideration toward organizing priority decisions (Linstone and Turoff,
1975). “Delphi is fundamentally the art of designing communication structures for human
groups involved in attaining some objective” (Linstone & Turoff, 1975, p.489). The
85

stability of the Delphi technique results when a statistical consensus is achieved from the
expert panel. The results from the rounds of surveys are shared with each participant
anonymously, allowing the panel members time to alter their opinions before the next
round of questions. In a successful Delphi study, this self-correcting process results in
group consensus about the research topic (Marcoux,
1999).

Characteristics of the Delphi Method
In a traditional Delphi study, several essential components are needed to reach a
reliable and valid consensus. The current study employed the same characteristics
required in a traditional study:
● Anonymity offered panel members the freedom to express honest opinions and
reduced the influence dominant people might have had in a face-to-face group
setting.
● Iteration of surveys allowed panel members the opportunity to revise their
opinions.
● Controlled feedback from the researcher allowed panelists to be aware of the
responses from the other participants.
● The organized statistical summaries of each iterative round provided information
for additional insight to participants.

86

● Statistical data in the Delphi technique created objective data to illustrate the
consensus or divergence of expert opinions (Skulmoski et al., 2007; Hsu &
Sandford, 2007).
The current study focused on developing joint use library standards in combined
school/public libraries in Texas. The Delphi method facilitated communication and
consensus between library experts who participated in the current study. There was no
interaction between the participants as the expert panel was anonymous to everyone but
the researcher. The Delphi process may be repetitive in that different rounds ask the same
questions. However, each succeeding round allowed the participants to know the group
consensus and maintain the ability to alter their own opinions without disclosing their
identity (Burgin, 2012).
For the current study, specific steps suggested by Mertens (2005), were
implemented with the library expert panel:
•

Participant experience was diverse yet knowledgeable about library standards.

•

An initial open-ended questionnaire asked the panel members to identify
important categories and components that apply to the research topic.

•

The researcher condensed the responses from the open-ended questions into clear
areas of information.

•

The researcher formatted the categories into an understandable survey form
(Powell, 2003).

87

Changes in the ratings of library experts were evaluated after each round using
different measures. To progress toward group consensus, the mean, median, mode,
standard deviation, and interquartile ranges were computed for each item generated from
the expert panel. The information from Rounds Two and Three were analyzed by
computing these measurements for each item. The items that receive unanimous
agreement from the library experts were identified as consensus on proposed joint use
library standards. Rasp (1974) identified three features of the Delphi research method,
and each is included in the current study:
•

Each panel expert knew his or her own response and the cumulative mean for the
entire group.

•

The individual responses of every other participant were kept anonymous.

•

Group input from a round of questioning was shared with the library experts as
part of the next round of questioning.
For the current study, the researcher nominated librarian professionals. Invitation

letters were sent to 62 library experts who qualified to participate in the current Delphi
study. Hsu and Sandford (2007) emphasized the importance of the selection of experts for
a Delphi study to ensure credible and reliable results. The list of participants was kept
anonymous through the entire study. The professional roles of the library expert panel
included the following:
•

School librarians.

•

Public librarians.
88

•

Authors of scholarly library articles and books.

•

University librarians.

•

University researchers.

•

Library consultants.

•

Librarians from the Texas State Library.

•

Library school instructors.

•

Joint use librarians.

•

International librarians.

Samples
There was one exact criterion used when selecting Delphi participants for the
current study. Individuals were considered eligible for invitation if they had related
backgrounds and professional experience regarding the research topic. In the current
study, library experts were library professionals with extensive education and experience
in the field. Delphi experts should be trained and competent within the specific area of
expertise related to the research topic (Hsu and Sanford, 2007). School, public, and joint
use librarians, library school educators, authors of literature about Texas libraries, library
consultants, and university researchers provided a wide range of professional knowledge
and experience for the current study.
Criteria for the Library Expert Panel
The literature shows that various expert panels have included a broad range from
as few as four participants to as many as 771 panel members (Skulmoski et al., 2007).
89

Ludwig (1997) documented that the majority of Delphi studies used between 14 and 20
participants from the same discipline, which would represent a homogeneous population.
De Villiers et al. (2005) suggested five to 10 participants in each category if the experts
are from different professional areas, which would represent a heterogeneous population.
However, the size of the sample in a Delphi study can vary, although less than 50 panel
members are suggested. If the sample size is too large, there is a potential of low response
rates from the rounds of questionnaires (Powell, 2003).
Vernon (2009) encouraged researchers to determine the criteria for panel
members based on the requirements of the study. The criteria should be clearly defined to
decrease researcher bias. The criteria of library expert participants for the current study
includes the following requirements for a library professional:
•

Anyone who was currently or had been employed as a professional librarian at the
time of the study. Nominees included school, public, college, and joint use
librarians.

•

Anyone who was employed by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission
in a professional librarian role.

•

Librarians who were active in publishing academic articles in peer-reviewed

Six of the library expert panel members authored scholarly articles and books about
librarianship.
Number of Rounds
No exact number of rounds is required for a Delphi study. The goal of the
methodology is to reach consensus regarding the topic. The literature generally indicated
that three or four rounds are necessary to complete a Delphi Study (Hsu and Sandford,
2007; Skulmoski et al., 2007). However, Hsu and Sandford (2007) do specify guidelines
if more than four rounds are needed in a Delphi study to achieve consensus. The current
study was completed in three rounds.
Consensus

91

De Villiers et al. (2005) insisted that achieving consensus serves “as the essence of
the Delphi technique” (p. 640). The efficient organization of anonymous group
communication is essential in a Delphi study. The challenge to measure consensus with
accurate data analysis and interpretation of qualitative responses allows the researcher to
employ a mixed method of research (Shelton, 2010). Not only does a Delphi study rely
on group consensus, but group stability is also an important element in the research
method. Group stability is defined by Von der Gracht (2012) as “the consistency of
responses between successive rounds of a study” (p. 1527). A 15% or less change in any
two Delphi rounds is considered a stable group response. Von der Gracht (2012) stressed
that consensus is a “contentious” part of the Delphi process (p. 1528). There is no
absolute definition or measurement for the term. Consensus can mean group opinion,
general agreement, or group solidarity in belief. However, the criteria for consensus are
established by the researcher and must be rigorously monitored (Von der Gracht, 2012).
The criteria to reach consensus in the current study included
•

70% or greater panel agreement.

•

4.0 or greater mean score.

•

4.0 or greater median and mode score.

•

1.0 or less standard deviation score.

•

1.0 or less interquartile range measurement.

92

Setting
One of the most effective advantages of the Delphi Technique is participant
anonymity, which reduces the effect of dominant individuals in a group-based process.
The setting for the current study was affected by the geographical disbursement of the
participants who participated by electronic communication (Hsu and Sanford, 2007).
Controlled feedback and the absence of manipulation in the physical group dynamic
allows the setting for a Delphi study to be unaffected by the physical drawbacks of other
settings. Even the noise level that occurs in most group interactions is eliminated in a
Delphi study. As a result, the information generated from a Delphi technique consists of
well-organized data from previous iteration, permitting the participants to alter their
original opinion or generate new insight to clarify their responses during each round of
questioning (Hsu and Sanford, 2007). The setting for the current study is geographical
disbursement of the panel members and participant anonymity. All communication was
accomplished electronically through Google forms that allowed the researcher to provide
controlled feedback to the panel without the dynamics of a physical group setting. The
physical locations of the library expert panel members included Texas, New Hampshire,
the United Kingdom, and Australia.

Instrumentation and Measures
The Texas Public Library Standards, the Texas School Programs: Guidelines and
Standards, and the Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the Texas State Library
93

were correlated to create the questions for the survey rounds in the current Delphi method
study. The researcher followed guidelines from “Survey Designs,” in Educational
Research: Planning, Conducting, and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research
(Cresswell, 2015). Rounds One, Two, and Three are included in the Appendices. The
survey instrument reduced measurement error with clear, unambiguous questions and
response options (Burgin, 2012).
The eight areas of Texas Public Library Standards vary by population sizes to
make the standards relevant and meaningful to individual libraries. These standards
address administration, collections, leadership, facility, finance, services, technology, and
personnel components of library service. The Texas School Library Programs: Standards
and Guidelines for Texas (2005) is a tool for evaluating and improving school library
programs. Student achievement is the objective of school libraries and standards allow
for objective assessment of school library programs based on official areas of
performance. All six of the school library standards are learner-centered, and each
standard focuses on one learner-centered category. Each standard contains a goal for
school library service and supporting principles that detail specific requirements of the
standard. The six areas of school standards include teaching and learning, leadership and
management, technology, library environment, community connections, and information
science. Each of these areas were addressed in the survey questions.
The Delphi process for the current study was divided into three iterations. Round
One began with demographic questions and open-ended questions for panel members to
94

identify categories they felt should be included in the proposed joint use library
standards. The demographic questions focused on participants’ age, gender, employment
status, level of education, and professional librarianship roles.
Likert-type scale questions during Rounds Two and Three allowed the library
expert panel to indicate their opinions about each of the proposed joint use standards by
selecting the corresponding response:
1= Should not be included in joint use library standards.
2 = Unimportant for joint use library standards.
3 = Depends on circumstances if this item should be included in joint use library
standards.
4 = Important to include in joint use library standards.
5 = Essential to include in joint use library standards.
The library survey consisted of proposed joint use library standards the researcher
created from correlating the following current Texas library standards addressing these
categories: collections, teaching and learning, leadership and management, technology,
library environment, and services. Panelists were asked to rate items to establish
preliminary priorities among proposed joint use library standards. As a result of Round
Two, areas of consensus and divergence of opinion among experts concerning joint use
library standards were identified (Hsu & Sanford, 2007).
In Round Three, the expert panel received a questionnaire to review the items
summarized by the investigator based on the data provided in Round Two.
95

The Round Three survey informed the panelists of the ratings summarized by the
researcher from the Round Two survey questions. Round Two and Three offered the
library experts an opportunity to clarify or alter their opinion of the proposed joint use
library standards. After Round Three, the panelists’ comments and items achieving group
consensus were distributed to the library experts.
Data Collection
The library expert panel members completed three rounds of surveys via Google
forms to reach consensus. The participants were assured their feedback would remain
confidential and the reporting of research results would protect their anonymity.
Choosing the appropriate number of participants to gather expert opinions over a specific
time period is a vitally important step in a Delphi method, because the right participants
directly relate to the quality of the results generated by the research (Hsu & Sanford,
2007).
The structure for the survey instrument in the current study was an Internet
Google form. To achieve consensus, the panel was asked to rate each of the categories
determined for the proposed joint use library standards. The panel used a five-point
Likert-type scale to assess these rankings. Using a Likert-type scale to rate or rank
elements in a Delphi study is appropriate (Vernon, 2009). Using descriptive statistics,
each of the items on the surveys was analyzed to establish the appropriate level of
consensus (McMillan, 2004). Consensus was achieved when a minimum of 70% of the

96

panel a mean, median, or mode of 4.0 or greater, a standard deviation and interquartile
range measurement of 1.0 or less resulted from the descriptive statistical analysis.
Validity and Reliability
Anonymous responses and controlled feedback help gather reliable data from an
expert panel (Hsu and Sandford, 2007). Consensus illustrates the agreement between
knowledgeable experts who are qualified to express their opinion in a given discipline
(Cresswell, 2015). The validity of the current study will be increased when joint use
school/public libraries are able to use the evaluative checklist generated from the current
study to assess effective library services. In a Delphi study, reliability is expressed
through preciseness of observation and accuracy of quantitative data (McMillan, 2004).
Selecting qualified experts to be participants, as well as clear instructions for completing
the questionnaires, are important to the reliability of the Delphi technique (McMillan,
2004). In the current study, the anonymous responses and controlled feedback from the
researcher increased the reliability of the data. The joint use library checklist increased
the validity of the data, supporting the Delphi methodology of research that panel
members can agree on topics related to their field of expertise to solve a problem. The
accuracy of the quantitative statistics from the surveys increased the reliability and
validity of the data from the current study (Hsu and Sandford, 2007).
Procedures for Data Collection
Step 1: The researcher identified a nominee list of expert panel members who are
library professionals. The criteria for the panel were detailed in the current study. This
97

information was kept in confidence to maintain anonymity, allowing the experts freedom
to express their true opinions (Skulmoski et al., 2007).
Step 2: Sixty-two library experts were invited to participate in the current study.
This number of possible panel members allowed for an expected attrition rate of 24%, if
between 15 and 30 panel members completed the three rounds of questionnaires.
Step 3: Each item on the questionnaire achieved consensus when a minimum of
70% of the library expert panel members indicated agreement and reached a mean,
median, or mode score of 4.0 or above on the Likert-type scale. In addition, consensus
was reached when 100 percent of the panelists indicated agreement on a questionnaire
item (Shelton, 2010).
Step 4: The current study used a five-point Likert-type scale with the range: 1 =
should not be included in joint use library standards; 2 = unimportant for joint use library
standards; 3 = depends on the circumstances if this item should be included in joint use
library standards; 4 = important to include in joint use library standards; and 5 = essential
to include in joint use library standards (Kingston, Jorm, and Kitchener, 2009).
Step 5: An Internet-based Google form (Kelly et al., 2010) was used for the three
survey rounds. The first round included demographic and open-ended questions to
identify categories and components recommended by the panel for the proposed joint use
library standards. The library expert panel was invited to include additional feedback it
felt was relevant about the categories of joint use library standards. The Round One
survey instrument included a combination of open-ended and closed questions to identify
98

components of proposed joint use library standards. Round One included several survey
comment boxes, to allow the opportunity for panelists to add qualitative comments to
strengthen the Delphi Study (Kingston et al., 2009).
Step 6: Texas Public Library Standards, Texas School Programs: Guidelines and
Standards, and the Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the Texas State Library
were designated as the source for the categories and components of the proposed joint use
library standards.
Step 7: Sixty-two potential panelists were invited to participate in the promised
study in an email that detailed the specifics of the research including the purpose,
anonymity, time required, and the honorarium each panelist would receive. The email
contained an informed consent statement each participant was asked to return to the
researcher to indicate voluntary agreement to participate in the current study. Thirty
potential library expert panelists returned the informed consent form.
Round One
Step 8: Round one was initiated with an email to each panelist that included
instructions for answering questions, guidelines for achieving consensus, and a reminder
that the purpose of the study was to develop a checklist of joint use library standards. The
email contained a link to a Google form, allowing the panelists to submit their answers
online. Responses were required for all questions in order for the form to be submitted
and returned electronically to the researcher.

99

Step 9: As each panelist submitted the Round One survey instrument, their
responses were electronically recorded through Google forms.
Step 10: Three days before Round One was to conclude, a reminder email was
sent to the panel members who had not completed the questions of Round One.
Step 11: Round One was completed with the collection of 29 responses through
Google forms.
Step 12: The responses from Round One were analyzed to prepare the Likert-type
scale questions for the survey instrument in Round Two (Burgin, 2012).
a. The library expert panel made comments about the categories and components of
the proposed joint use library standards. Each comment listed in the Round One
survey was itemized in Appendix D.
b. Descriptive statistics were utilized to identify the components of proposed joint
use library standards and to create a demographic profile of the panel members.
Round Two
Step 13: Round Two was initiated by sending an email to each of the 29
respondents who completed Round One. The email contained a Google form link to the
Round Two survey instrument that is illustrated in Appendix F. The email contained
instructions for the Likert-type scale questions, assured anonymity of the responses, and
contained the contact information of the researcher. A brief explanation informed the
panelists that their responses from Round One determined the questions for Round Two.

100

Step 14: Three days prior to the closing of Round Two, a reminder email was sent
to the panelists who had not submitted a response.
Step 15: The collection of 28 responses to Round Two was completed through
Google forms.
Step 16: The quantitative responses from Round Two were analyzed to prepare
the survey questions for Round Three. The descriptive statistics of mean, median, mode
standard deviation, interquartile range, and percentage of agreement were calculated on
each item of the Round Two survey instrument.
Step 17: According to the criteria established in the current study, if consensus
was achieved on any item in the study, those proposed joint use library standards were
accepted. The items that did not reach consensus were added to the survey instrument for
Round Three. If any items achieved “unanimous rejection” (Vernon, 2009, p. 72) they
were deleted from the survey.
Step 18: Based on the analysis of the data collected in Round Two, the survey
instrument questions for Round Three were finalized.
Round Three
Step 19: Round Three was initiated by sending an email to each of the 28
respondents who completed Round Two. The email contained a Google form link to the
Round Three survey instrument that is detailed in Appendix I. The email contained
instructions for the Likert-type scale questions, assured anonymity of the responses, and

101

contained the contact information of the researcher. A brief explanation informed the
panelists that their responses on Round Two determined the questions for Round Three.
Step 20: Three days prior to the closing of Round Three, a reminder email was
sent to the panelists who had not submitted a response.
Step 21: The collection of 27 responses to the Round Three survey was completed
through Google forms.
Step 22: The quantitative responses from Round Three were analyzed using the
descriptive statistics of agreement percentage, mean, median, mode, standard deviation,
and interquartile range on each item of the Round Three survey instrument.
Step 23: The data collection process for the Delphi panel concluded. A thank you
letter was sent to each participant, including a gift card of appreciation for his or her
efforts.
Step 24: The library expert panelists’ responses from the three Delphi rounds
were utilized to create an evaluative checklist of joint use library standards for Texas
school/public libraries to assess effective library services.
Procedures and Data Analysis
Data was collected to determine consensus among library experts on items
identified as proposed joint use library standards. The collected data was evaluated
throughout the research process to determine consensus and the changes in consensus
from the library experts during three survey rounds. This information was utilized to
report movement toward consensus, as well as to identify a stopping point in the Delphi
102

technique. A response rate of 70 % or greater, a 4.0 or greater mean, median, or mode, a
1.0 or smaller standard deviation score and interquartile range measurement on any item
indicated consensus from the library expert panel (Hsu & Sandford, 2007).
In Round One, the library expert panel identified components for joint use library
standards from current categories of Texas Public Library Standards, School Library
Program Guidelines and Standards for Texas, and Minimum Requirements for
Accreditation in the Texas State Library System. The categories and components
identified were then used as survey questions in the two remaining rounds of the Delphi
study. A five-point Likert-type scale was offered in Rounds Two and Three of the current
study, including the following scale: (1) should not be included in joint use library
standards, (2) unimportant for joint use library standards, (3) depends on circumstances if
this item should be included in joint use library standards, (4) important to include in
joint use library standards, and (5) essential to include in joint use library standards. The
descriptive statistics of central tendency and levels of dispersion were used to analyze the
responses from Rounds Two and Three. Statistical analysis of mean, median, mode,
standard deviation, and inter-quartile range for each item on the questionnaire, indicated
the convergence or absence of consensus in the current study (Hsu & Sandford, 2007).
In addition to the descriptive statistical analysis, all revisions suggested by the
library expert panel throughout the Delphi process were analyzed after each iterative
round. If an item achieved consensus, it was accepted as a proposed joint use library

103

standard. An item did not achieve consensus if it received less than 70 % agreement or
less than a 4.0 mean score.
After the completion of three rounds, data from final consensus was used to create
a checklist of joint use standards for school/public libraries to use as an assessment of
effective library services. Research suggests a minimum of 45 days be scheduled for a
Delphi study, allowing two weeks for library experts to respond to each round of
questions (Hsu and Sanford, 2007). The current study was completed in 42 days.
The quantitative data analysis for the current study focused on reaching an
agreement level. A certain percentage of respondents fell within a prescribed range in the
current study on each questionnaire item to indicate consensus for proposed joint use
library standards. Hsu and Sanford (2007) recommended consensus is reached if 70% of
participants’ fall within two categories on a five-point Likert-type scale. Statistics of
central tendency and levels of dispersion were measured for each item on Round Two
and Three of the Delphi study. This included determining the mean, median, mode for
central tendency and the interquartile range for levels of dispersion on each survey item:
Ethical Considerations
Ethical survey research requires good practices. In the current study, the
confidentiality of the responses was protected. The Delphi study technique continues to
be a valid data collection methodology to gather information from experts who are
experienced in the topic of interest and can provide practical, professional knowledge in
prioritizing items such as proposed standards for joint use libraries. The Delphi technique
104

can be time-consuming, allowing participants an adequate schedule to respond to the
different rounds of questioning. There is a potential for low response rates in a Delphi
study due to asking participants to respond to several iterative rounds within a requested
allotment of time (Hsu and Sanford, 2007). The current study received permission from
the Dallas Baptist University Committee for the Protection of Human Participants. The
researcher provided adequate safeguards for the rights and welfare of the participants in
this study. The research plans for the current study were in compliance with the research
policies of Dallas Baptist University and the DHHS Regulations for the Protection of
Human Subjects.
Summary
Chapter Three described the purpose, the research questions, the research design,
and the methodology for the current study. A detailed explanation of the Delphi
methodology, its characteristics, and how it is an appropriate design for the current
research is also included in this chapter. Chapter Three listed the steps utilized in
collecting the data and the procedures for analyzing the results. In Chapters Four and
Five, the findings from the Delphi study are analyzed and discussed.

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS
Introduction
The purpose of the current Delphi study was to identify recommended
components for proposed joint use library standards for school/public libraries in Texas.
In addition, the data was used to develop an evaluative checklist for joint use libraries to
assess effective library service. Chapter Four presents the results of three rounds of
survey questions and the analysis of the gathered data. The following research questions
provided structure for the current study.
Research Questions
Research Question 1 (RQ1) Can the current Texas Public Library Standards (Texas
Library Association, 2014) and the School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines
for Texas (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005) be adapted to create
joint use library standards for Texas school/public libraries?
Sub-Question A: How will the categories listed in the Texas Public Library
Standards be adapted to create joint use library standards?
Sub-Question B: How will the categories in the School Library Programs:
Standards and Guidelines for Texas be adapted to create joint use library
standards?

106

Research Question 2 (RQ2) What are the proposed joint use library standards
recommended by the Delphi expert panel?
Research Question 3 (RQ3) Can the joint use library standards recommended by the
Delphi panel result in a checklist that Texas school/public joint use libraries can use to
assess effective library services?
Delphi Methodology
The Delphi method utilized in the current study required a panel of library experts
approximately six weeks to complete three iterative rounds of questionnaires. Openended questions and survey instruments were distributed by email through Google forms.
Controlled feedback from the researcher allowed library experts to revise their opinions
about proposed joint use library standards (Skulmoski et al., 2007). There is no required
number of rounds to complete a Delphi study, but the literature indicated many Delphi
studies achieved consensus in three or four rounds (Hasson et al., 2000). The current
Delphi study was completed in three rounds. Instrument reliability for the surveys was
established with set protocol for item content, panelist selection, data collection, and
analysis. Researcher bias was minimal due to quantitative analysis for the results of each
survey question.
The repetitive nature of the Delphi method increased the validity of the research.
In the current study, emergent themes provided meaningful qualitative content. Validity
refers to whether the inferences that emerge from the data are useful, appropriate to the
topic, meaningful, and correct (Cresswell, 2015).
107

Selection of the Expert Panel
The researcher set the criteria to identify appropriate candidates for a Delphi
Study panel (Vernon, 2009). The individual profiles of the library expert panel members
provided important information for understanding the findings of the current research.
The criteria to participate as a library expert required professional librarian experience in
a school, college, public, or joint use library. Table 2 indicates all 29 library experts
currently serve or have served as a library professional.

Table 2 shows that 66.6% of panel members have professional experience in a school or
joint use school/public library. Joint use librarians have a specialized knowledge of
school and public library standards. Seventeen percent of the library experts currently
work or serve as library specialists in a university research setting. Two panel members
are employed by the Texas State Library. Two panelists work for the Texas Library
Association. One panel member is a Texas Regional Library Coordinator.
Every participant met the criterion of professional library experience. Table 3
shows 64% of the library experts hold a master’s degree, the required level of education
108

to serve a library population of 25,000 or greater. Twenty percent of the library experts
hold doctorate degrees and 10% have earned multiple graduate degrees. The total level of
post-baccalaureate education on the library expert panel is 93.3%.

Often, professional librarians work in only one type of library during their career.
Professional library roles tend to be specialized according to the type of library that
employs the librarian. Eighteen panel members, or 60% of the library expert group,
included librarians who have worked in more than one type of library. The panelists
described professional library careers that combined K-12 public school library work
with university research, academic library directorship, state government library planning
and administration, and extensive joint use library work. Five panelists have published
peer-reviewed articles or scholarly books about joint use libraries in the United States,
Australia, and the United Kingdom.
Library Expert Panel Size

110

The best or optimal number of panel members was not specifically identified in
the literature. If the background of the Delphi study group is similar, then 10 to 15
participants are considered an adequate number of responses (Hsu & Sandford, 2007).
However, if the range of experience differs widely among the panel members, a greater
number of participants are more effective. In the current study, panel size and selection
supported content validity by gathering a library expert panel of more than 10 members
(Linstone and Turoff, 1975). Generally, the research suggested less than 50 panel
members would still provide a representative collection of opinions. If the participant
pool is too large, the Delphi technique is at risk due to low response rates and a large
amount of time required for data from the questionnaires to be returned (Hsu & Sandford,
2007; Von der Gracht, 2012). Table 6 details the percentage of library expert panel
participation for each round in the current study.

Consensus
For the current study, consensus was determined by a minimum of 70% library
expert panel agreement, a mean score of 4.0 or greater, a mode or median score of 4.0 or
greater, a standard deviation score of 1.0 or less, and an interquartile range of 1.0 or less
111

on each survey question concerning proposed joint use library standards. An interquartile
range of 1.0 or less is an indicator of a high level of consensus. The descriptive statistics
were calculated on a 5-point Likert-type scale with the following range:
1 = Should not be included in joint use library standards.
2 = Unimportant for joint use library standards.
3 = Depends on circumstances if this item should be included in library standards.
4 = Important to include in joint use library standards.
5 = Essential to include in joint use library standards.
The 70% agreement level encompasses both the important or essential to include in joint
use library standards selection choices on the Delphi survey questions.
Description and Results of the Three Delphi Rounds
An invitation to participate in the current Delphi study was sent by email to 62
library experts. The panel members qualified as library experts because of work
experience as a professional librarian in a school, public, college, or joint use library. The
years of experience, level of education and variety of professional library
accomplishments was detailed in Chapter Three, illustrating the library expertise of the
panel members. Thirty library professionals agreed to participate in the study and 29 of
30 library expert panelists completed the Round One questionnaire. The proposed joint
use library standards only apply to combined school and public libraries. This is
important to note because there are other types of joint use libraries, such as

112

public/college libraries (Gunnels et al., 2012). Table 7 indicates the timeline for the entire
Delphi study.

Delphi Round One
Every member of the library expert panel received a link to the Round One survey
instrument after giving informed consent. The 29 library experts who completed the
open-ended and demographic questions of Round One voluntarily provided their
opinions.
Timeline for Round One
On September 17, 2015, thirty library expert panel members received an email
with a link to a Google form containing seven demographic questions and 13 checklist
questions for the panel members to identify components they felt should be included in
the proposed joint use library standards. Twenty-nine library experts completed and
returned the survey by the closing date of October 5, 2015.

113

Round One Analysis and Results
The questions in Round One addressed the components and categories of current
public and school library standards. In addition, the questions asked the library expert
panel members to identify essential components for joint use library standards in the
areas of:
•

Leadership and Administration.

•

Library Collections.

•

Library Environment.

•

Finance.

•

Public Relations.

•

Technology.

•

Library Services.

•

Personnel.

•

State Accreditation as a Texas Public Library.

•

Information Science and Librarianship.

Seventy percent or more of the library expert panel agreed on the 10 components
depicted in Table 8 to include in the proposed joint use standards.

These 10 categories were later correlated into a combination of public, school, and
accreditation standards to create joint use library standards. The categories of current
Texas public and school library standards were identified in Questions 10-20 during the
Round One survey. Each question asked the library expert panel members what
categories to select as essential to the development of joint use library standards in these
areas: leadership, collections, library facilities and environment, finance, public relations,
technology, service, personnel, state accreditation, teaching and learning, and information
science and professional librarianship.

The library expert panel identified the above components as elements to include
in proposed joint use standards. There were six additional components from current
Texas Library Standards that less than 70% of the library expert panelists agreed should
118

be incorporated into the joint use library standards. The components in Table 9 were
presented in Round Two as proposed joint use library standards, so the library experts
could view them as new joint use library standards, separate from current school or
public library standards.
Round One Comments from the Library Expert Panel
After ranking the components to be included in the joint use library standards,
library expert panel members made suggestions for additional components to be included
in the development of the proposed standards. These comments are listed in Appendix D.
A range of suggestions widened the scope of content for what considerations to include in
the new joint use library standards. One panel member emphasized the access to library
materials for all patrons needs to comply within local, state, and federal laws concerning
the protection of children. These laws are referenced on the American Library
Association’s website. Five comments emphasized the need to provide “true” public
library service in a school-housed facility, including programs, signage, and a long-range
plan that benefits both the school population and the community. Two panel members
expressed concern that small communities are often the type of areas that have joint use
libraries. These small libraries usually cannot afford a certified master’s degreed
librarian, or be able to meet all the requirements for state accreditation status. These panel
members asserted that accommodations should be in place for smaller joint use libraries
because of their limited ability to meet standards due to reduced resources. A suggestion
from one panel member detailed that whoever serves as the library director in a joint use
119

facility should have a “strongly defined authority to supervise, hire, and terminate library
staff according to both the school system and public library policy.”
Despite the numerous suggestions supporting the components presented in Round
One, one panelist insisted that several of the items should not even be included as joint
use library standards. This panel member felt that if a library follows the expected
standards of “regular libraries,” then it is redundant to create separate joint use library
standards. Comments from two library experts expressed concern that Internet filtering
should be used “only as required by law,” and that technology devices should be
available for checkout by public and school library users.
There were six specific suggestions from the library expert panel that the joint use
library standards be carefully worded to include public and school groups for meeting
space, signage, access to the library collection, and long-range plans for library
programming. The inclusion of public and school library patrons was the main emphasis
from the open-ended responses of Round One. One panel member succinctly summarized
the general appeal for effective joint use library service:
No joint use library will succeed if the thinking of the administration
separates school from public issues. Staff, hours, funds, all must be united.
What goes for one goes for all. We have just marked our 27-year anniversary
as a joint use library and that has been our philosophy from the beginning.
There needs to be a binding contract or agreement.
Round One Summary
120

Twenty-nine of the 30 library experts who agreed to participate completed the
Round One survey. In addition to the identified categories and components that reached a
consensus percentage of greater than 70%, there were suggestions from the panel to
incorporate into the proposed standards. These results were analyzed, revised, and
redistributed to the expert panel for Likert-type scale ranking in Round Two. Qualitative
interpretation of the comments from Round One allowed the researcher to edit
components for the Delphi Study based on the panel members’ acceptance and adaptation
of current Texas Library Standards. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were
integrated in the current study to develop the survey items for Rounds Two and Three,
the list of joint use library standards, and the checklist for libraries to use to assess
effective library service. This mixed methodology was well suited to the current study
due to the lack of joint use library standards for combined school/public libraries in
Texas.
Finally, the mixed methods design of collecting qualitative and quantitative data
allowed participants to create anonymous narrative responses in the comment boxes after
the survey questions. During Round One, some components of joint use standards were
met with clear agreement, while other categories showed a lack of consensus.
Delphi Round Two
Timeline of Round Two
The Google form link to the Round Two survey was emailed to the 29-member
library expert panel on September 21, 2015. The Round Two survey is shown in
121

Appendix F. The email asked panel members to rate the components library experts
identified in Round One. Round Two contained 45 questions, divided into the 10
categories of joint use standards identified by the panel in Round One. Based on feedback
from Round One, the format of Round Two allowed panelists to rate each item on a 5point Likert-type scale. On October 16, 2015, 28 panel members had completed Round
Two, representing a 96% completion rate.
Round Two Analysis and Results
The Round Two survey instrument contained 45 questions that addressed the
components of proposed joint use library standards identified by the panel during Round
One. The results of Round Two are exhibited in Appendix G. The survey link was sent to
the 29 panel members who completed Round One. In addition to the 45 questions, the
panel was asked to add any additional comments or revise the proposed standards
through optional comment boxes. After Round Two, participants' responses were entered
into an Excel spreadsheet. Descriptive statistics were used to establish the statistical
mean, mode, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range for the expert panel’s
level of consensus for each item (Skulmoski et al., 2007). Interquartile ranges were
calculated as measures of dispersion and the mean scores illustrated measures of central
tendency. The combination of this statistical information helped determine the level of
consensus for each survey item. During Round Two, a minimum of 70% agreement, a
mean score of 4.0 or greater, a mode or median of 4.0 or greater, a standard deviation
score of 1.0 or less, and an Interquartile range of 1.0 or smaller signified panel consensus.
122

An interquartile range of one or smaller is an indicator of a high level of consensus for
that item. Figure 7 identifies the Summary of Round Two.

development for staff

In the category of Leadership, the assurance of administration that the joint use
library would meet all quantitative requirements for accreditation received more that 80%
agreement, but panel members suggested revision in the wording of the standard.
Therefore, this item was revised and continued to the Round Three survey. The 18 items
that did not reach a level of consensus during Round Two are displayed in Table 12.
These items were sent to the library expert panel for the Round Three survey. The
statistical results from Round Two were included in the Round Three survey to inform
the library expert panel the level of consensus from Round Two. This information is the
controlled feedback the researcher can provide to Delphi panel members, while
maintaining anonymity of individual responses.
The proposed standards that did not reach consensus during Round Two included
items from all categories of joint use standards. The largest area of disagreement focused
on the Library Environment category, where four proposed joint use standards did not
reach the required level of agreement. The lowest percentage of agreement measured at
46%, was in the Personnel category for the standard that would require the librarian of a
joint use library to be a school certified librarian and hold a master’s degree. The ability
of small joint use libraries to afford a librarian with these qualifications concerned the
panel members who did not want a small joint use library to be penalized due to limited
financial resources. The library expert panel member comments from Round Two are
listed in Appendix H.

Round Two Comments from the Library Expert Panel
The library expert panel had the option to offer suggestions and revisions for the
45 items in the Round Two survey questionnaire. These comments are listed in Appendix
H. The Round Two survey was organized into 10 categories that represented each area of
proposed joint use standards. The comments from the panel members were grouped by
category. In the Leadership area, one panelist reiterated concern that all the Texas
accreditation requirements be included for joint use libraries, not just the ones expressly
listed in the survey. In the Library Collections category, two panel members suggested
again that the expectation for small joint use libraries to include expensive electronic
book platforms and an interlibrary loan service puts those libraries at a disadvantage.
They suggested that the standards be modified to accommodate resource availability for
smaller facilities without penalizing the library. Three panel members suggested revising
the wording in Collection standards to specify that joint use libraries must identify and
meet a community’s “unique characteristics and needs.”
In the Library Environment group of questions, item No. 15 asked, “How
important is an after-hours return box, meeting space for community groups, and
adequate storage and shelving?” Panel members suggested this question be broken apart.
Specifically, the comments emphasized that meeting space is essential in a standards
document, but an after-hours return box, storage, and shelving are amenities that improve
library services. Meeting spaces are imperative to provide area for classroom lessons.
One panel member suggested that instructional space for students should remain free
127

from interruption by public patrons. However, that requirement would not be in the true
spirit of a joint use facility. At the other extreme, one library expert commented, “joint
use libraries should not be housed in existing school buildings, but should be in separate
library facilities to provide better access (to public patrons) than schools do.”
Four comments focused on financial and budget issues for joint use libraries.
There was a warning to create standards that would avoid primarily “seeing the joint use
library as a way to save money without budget consideration of how both school and
public needs will be met.” Question No. 19 asked “how important are funds allocated by
percentage to budget programs and resources for school and public library users?” Four
panel members took exception to a budget based on percentages between the public and
library funding. They suggested using “raw numbers” that reflect “current programming
and needs” for “improved accuracy and simplicity” in annual budget planning. The main
emphasis to these suggestions was to create a finance standard that allowed for “flexible
funding based on current needs of both school and public” library programs.
Contrary to most other comments, one library expert reiterated during Round
Two, “if there are standards for regular libraries, then it is not necessary to include joint
use library standards as it is implied in all libraries as standard.” Because joint use
libraries are so diverse in size and services, a few participants warned the researcher to
make the standards “broad” enough to embrace the fact that what is “good for one
community library isn’t necessarily good for all community libraries.”

128

Question No. 24 elicited comments from the panel members. In the category of
Technology, one panel member asked, “How can we specify a balance when technology
needs change so rapidly?” Panelists voiced a variety of opinions about Internet filtering.
Question No. 25 asked, “How important is maintaining unfiltered access on public
computers, as well as promoting the ethical use of the Internet for students?” Two
panelists pointed out that public libraries must filter to qualify for Texas Erate funding,
which allows them to maintain Internet access at a reduced cost. Another expert said that
in a joint use library “adult patrons should not be limited in their information access by
filters designed for students, nor should they be required to seek permission to have
certain websites unblocked. That is an invasion of privacy.”
Round Two Summary
The library expert panel reached consensus for 27 of the 45 survey questions.
These items are organized within 10 library standard categories and were added to the list
of accepted joint use library standards. Eighteen items on the Round Two survey did not
reach consensus. These items received less than 70% panel agreement, less than a 4.0
mean, median, or mode score, greater than a 1.0 interquartile range, or greater than 1.0
standard deviation score. These 18 items were returned to the panel during Round Three.
Personnel standards for a joint use library elicited responses from the panel such
as “if there is one professional librarian in a joint use library, then it should be a certified
school librarian. A public librarian may not have the teaching skills of a school librarian.”
Question No. 38 addressed the issue of simultaneous access to instructional library
129

services at all times for student and public library patrons. One panel member
commented, “I am not sure what this questions means. Are instructional services for the
public, or is every librarian a trained instructor?” Many of the comments from Round
Two validated the focus of the proposed joint use library standards, evidenced by the fact
that 27 of the 45 questions achieved consensus during Round Two. However, 18 of the
questions continued to Round Three and included slight rewording to address the
concerns voiced in the comments from Round Two.
Delphi Round Three
Timeline of Round Three
Round Three began on October 19, 2015, when the 28 panel members who
completed Round Two received emails with a link to the Round Three survey instrument.
The Round Three survey instrument is depicted in Appendix I. Round Three closed on
October 26, 2015, after 27 panel members submitted the 18-question survey, representing
a response rate of 96%.
Round Three Analysis and Results
The Round Three questionnaire allowed the library expert panelists to rate 18
items that did not achieve consensus during Round Two. These 18 questions included at
least one proposed joint use library standard from each of the ten library standard
categories, with the exception of the State Accreditation questions, all of which achieved
full consensus during Round Two. The statistical results from Round Two were included
in each question of Round Three. These results informed the panel members what the
130

question had scored in percentage of panel agreement, the mean, standard deviation, and
interquartile range determined from Round Two library expert panel responses. In
addition, each Round Three survey question was followed by an optional comment box,
which allowed the panelists to make suggestions or comments regarding each question on
the survey. Figure 8 reveals the summary of the results from Round Three.

Items that achieved consensus in Round Three
In Round Three, 15 items in nine library standard categories achieved consensus
with a panel agreement of 77.7%-96.3% and mean scores ranging from 4.15-4.78. The
descriptive statistical results of Round Three are listed in Appendix J. Table 13 briefly
indicates the proposed joint use library standards that reached at least 70% panel
agreement, 4.0 or greater mean, mode and median score, a 1.0 or less interquartile range
131

measurement, or a standard deviation score of less than 1.0. The joint use library
standards that reached consensus in Round Three are more detailed in Appendix J. Each
of the items that reached consensus were accepted as joint use library standards and
included in the joint use library checklist.

Three items did not reach consensus during Round Three. These items are briefly
detailed in Table 14. Each of these items did not reach a panel agreement percentage of
greater than 70%, a mean, median, or mode score of 4.0 or greater, an interquartile
measurement of 1.0 or less, or a standard deviation score of 1.0 or less. The three items
that did not achieve consensus were from the standard categories of Library
Environment, Library Services, and Teaching and Learning. These items were dismissed

Round Three Comments from the Library Expert Panel
The expert panel had the option to offer suggestions and revisions for each of the
18 items in the Round Three survey questionnaire. The Round Three comments are listed
in Appendix K. There were comments for every single question in Round Three,
including the 15 items that achieved consensus and the three items that did not reach

consensus. In the Leadership category, one library expert reminded the researcher
“accreditation is essential to maintain in order to serve public and school library patrons.
Without this assurance any joint library project is doomed to failure, whether now or in
the near future.” However, another library expert pointed out that “If a joint use library
has adequate funding other than school district money, then that library can meet standard
expectations and maintain accreditation. I hate to see a library lose accreditation. This is
an example of why a separate set of standards would certainly benefit Texas joint use
libraries.”
To illustrate the benefits of state accreditation, another panel member pointed out
“interlibrary loan and (access to) the Texshare databases are examples of the importance
of accreditation. Interlibrary loan allows both public and school patrons the ability to
access materials beyond the local collection.” Another question in Library Collections
that received several comments addressed complete accessibility to all library materials
by all patrons. One panelist remarked, “If collections are not accessible to all users then
you do not have a joint library. I have seen too many examples of ‘joint libraries’ where
collection access was limited to certain times of the day or certain age groups. This is
totally against the spirit of a true joint library.”
Comments that related to the Library Environment standards addressed how space
requirements should be detailed for a joint use facility. One library expert cautioned,
“You can’t force a school to comply with somebody else’s standards. In most cases (in a
joint use library) the school owns the building.” Another panelist advised, “Space
134

requirements are not necessarily accurate. There should be enough space to meet the
needs of the joint library reflecting the niche it serves in the community.” One panelist
admonished, “School facility requirements carry the weight of law.” Yet, another library
expert said, “Since it is a joint use library, it is essential that Texas Public Library
Standards be followed (for space requirements).” Overall, space requirements try to set a
standard for what good library service should look like, providing a valid reason for the
need to set joint use library standards that address those needs in a shared facility.
The comments that addressed the area of Finance standards centered on “the
crucial specific designation of (monetary) authority and responsibility.” Another library
expert agreed, “Getting agreement on funding and responsibilities of both parties is
crucial and needs to be updated frequently.” In addition, because of the rapidly changing
world of libraries and information, several panelists advised “flexible” funding
allocations in the standards. A “flexibility paragraph” was suggested for the standards list
to prepare budgets to meet information needs as technology continues to evolve in library
service. Public Relations are an important aspect of any library and one panelist
commented, “libraries need to let their communities know what they are doing, spelled
out with specifics. Libraries live and perish on the altar of public opinion.”
The issue of Internet filtering again was a topic of comment in Round Three. “It is
important that school districts do not prevent public library patrons from accessing
information that might not be appropriate for students, but is perfectly acceptable for
adult patrons,” one expert wrote. The most thoughtful response stated, “Such a standard
135

needs to reflect the difference in need between the two communities. Schools filter,
public libraries don’t always filter, and adults should have the right to have the filters
turned off. A joint use library should recognize and support the needs of both
communities in accessing Internet resources.”
The three questions that did not reach consensus during Round Three addressed
three different standard categories. In Library Environment, question No. 8 asked about
the importance of signage that welcomes public and student patrons, and informs all
library visitors of services that are available. This item did not achieve consensus. One
panel member commented that this item is an important practice, but is not necessary as a
standard. Another library expert wrote, “I hope (signage) would be part of a contract as a
joint library is established. But, too many standards tend to stifle creativity and limit
options for quality joint library service.”
The second question that did not reach consensus was from the Library Services
standard category. The library experts had several comments about this question, which
asked how important is allowing the use of library space by community groups during
school hours? One panelist remarked, “If you don’t allow this, you do not truly have a
joint library facility.” Conversely, another panelist said, “This is a standard some libraries
would not be able to comply with. Some schools have libraries that only allow public
access at times other than school hours.”
The third question that did not reach consensus was from the Teaching and
Learning standard category. This question asked how important are community computer
136

and library resource classes? The comments concerning this question can be summarized
by this response from a library expert, “Educating the public should be addressed in the
mission/vision area. It is good practice to offer classes, but it is not a one size fits all in
the area of standards. Depends on the needs of the community.”
Another area of comment from Round Three concerned outcome-based
evaluation for joint use libraries in the standard category of Information Science and
Librarianship. “Outcome-based evaluation should be done with caution. It should include
detailed instructions for library staff on how data may be gathered and reported. This type
of evaluation is a tool for assessment, an example of best practice, but should not be
mandated in standards.”
Results by Research Question
The data collected for the current study was analyzed according to the following
three research questions.
Research Question One
Can the current Texas Public Library Standards (Texas Library Association,
2014) and the School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas (Texas
State Library and Archives Commission, 2005) be adapted to create joint use library
standards for Texas school/public libraries? Research Question One was answered by the
Delphi expert panel with the data illustrated in Appendices L and M. The panel reached
consensus on 42 of the 45 components of proposed joint use library standards that were
developed from current Texas Library Standards.
137

Sub-question A. How will the categories listed in the Texas Public Library
Standards, 2014 be adapted to create proposed joint use library standards? In Round One
of the current study, the panel of library experts was asked to identify components and
categories of current Texas Public Library Standards and indicate those it felt should be
included in joint use library standards. The panel was given the opportunity to suggest
revisions for any of these components and categories. There are 11 categories of Texas
Public Library Standards:
•

Administration Standards.

•

Collections Standards.

•

Facility Standards.

•

Finance Standards.

•

Public Relations and Advocacy.

•

Marketing Standards.

•

Personnel Standards.

•

Services Standards.

•

Technology Standards.

•

Information Science.

•

State Accreditation Requirements.

The majority of the panel agreed to include components from all 11 of the public library
standard categories in the proposed joint use standards, with a range of consensus
agreement from 96-73%. These results are displayed in Table 9 and Table 10. However,
138

six revisions were suggested from panel comments during Round One. These suggestions
are detailed in Appendix D. The suggestions were incorporated into the survey questions
for Round Two.
Sub-question B. How will the categories listed in the School Library Programs:
Standards and Guidelines for Texas, 2005 be adapted to create proposed joint use library
standards? In Round One of the current study, the panel of experts was asked to identify
components and categories of Texas school library standards and indicate those it felt
should be included in joint use library standards. The panel was given the opportunity to
suggest revisions for any of these components and categories. There are six learnercentered categories in current Texas school library standards:
•

Teaching and Learning Standards.

•

Leadership and Management Standards.

•

Technology Standards.

•

Library Environment Standards.

•

Connections to the Community Standards.

•

Information Science and Librarianship Standards.

Each of these school library standards has correlating goals and principles. The majority
of the expert panel agreed to include components from each of the six categories with a
96-73% range of consensus, with the exception of the self-directed learning of patrons
principle, which received only a 41% consensus agreement. Again, the panel made
several suggestions for adapting school library standards into joint use library standards.
139

These suggestions are detailed in Appendix D. At the end of Round One, there were 29
components from current Texas library standards that panelists agreed should be included
in proposed joint use standards. By the conclusion of Round Three, the expert panel
determined that 42 of the original proposed joint use library standards should be included
in a joint use library standard checklist. Three of the 45 proposed joint use library
standards did not reach consensus during Round Two or Round Three. The results of this
process are documented in Appendices L and M.
Research Question Two
What are the proposed joint use library standards recommended by the Delphi
expert panel? During each round of the Delphi study, panel members were asked to add
comments or suggestions for any category or component of the proposed joint use library
standards. These comments and suggestions are detailed in Appendices D, H, and K.
Research Question Three
Can the components of proposed joint use library standards recommended by the
Delphi panel result in a checklist that will help Texas combined school/public libraries
assess effective library service? The Joint Use Library Standard Checklist is presented in
Appendix O.
Summary
Chapter Four presented analysis of the data from Delphi Rounds One, Two, and
Three. The data was collected from a panel of library experts over a six-week period.
Each panel member is a professional librarian. Eighty-seven percent of the panel had
140

more than 10 years of experience as a librarian in a school, academic, public, or joint use
library. Several of the library expert panelists serve as university researchers, Texas
Library Association employees, Texas State Library employees, or published authors in
Information Science. In Round One, the panel members were asked to identify
components and categories they felt should be included in proposed joint use library
standards. The words and phrases for these open-ended questions were taken from Texas
Library Public Standards (2014) and Texas School Library Programs: Guidelines and
Standards (2005). In addition, these questions invited the panelists to identify other
words, phrases, or categories they felt should also be included in joint use library
standards.
The library expert panel members identified 16 components for joint use library
standards. Eighty to ninety percent of the library experts agreed that 12 of the
components should be included in the new standards, while 70%-80% agreed that 14 of
the components were essential to joint use standards. Only two of the components,
unlimited access to all materials and self-directed learning of patrons, achieved less that
a 50% agreement level from the library expert panel. These two components were revised
in Round Two and Three of the current study.
The panel members also were asked to decide if 12 specific categories of Texas
Library Standards should be included in the proposed joint use library standards. All 12
categories of current Texas library standards reached a majority agreement, 55%-96% of
the panel, for inclusion in categories of joint use standards. The attrition rate between
141

Round One and Round Three was 7%, with 27 or the original 29 panelists completing all
three survey rounds.
During the current Delphi study, the expert panel accepted 93% (42 out of 45) of
the items with and without revisions into the proposed joint use library standards. The
panel withdrew 6% (3 out of 45) items out of the proposed joint use library standards as
detailed in Appendix M. The slight rewording of several joint use standards in Round
Two and Three was the result of the suggestions and comments from the panel members.
Library expert panel member comments are listed in Appendices D, H, and K. Twelve
categories and 42 components comprise the proposed Joint Use Library standards for
Texas School/Public Libraries as seen in Appendix M. These standards establish the
guidelines for a library standards checklist created to help joint use school/public libraries
assess effective library service. The checklist is displayed in Appendix N.

CHAPTER 5. DISCUSSION, IMPLICATIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS
Introduction
In Texas, library standards exist for school, public, and college libraries.
However, there are no standards for joint use school/public libraries in Texas. Research
literature addresses the need for effective library service in joint use libraries. A range of
professional opinions from scholarly articles and books alternately support and criticize
different elements of dual use school/public libraries. However, all the literature suggests
critical success factors that would improve joint use library service. These critical success
factors could be expressed through joint use library standards. Twenty-four joint use
school/public libraries are currently open in the state of Texas. Future trends for 21st
century library service include the possibility of more shared libraries that serve multiple
population groups from a single facility.
Summary of Study
Consequently, there is a two-fold purpose for the current Delphi study. First,
using a Delphi method of iterative surveys, categories and components were identified by
library experts from current Texas library standards and utilized to develop joint use
library standards. Forty-two of the 45 proposed joint use library standards achieved
consensus from the panel of library experts. These new joint use standards were compiled
to create a checklist that combined school/public libraries can use to assess effective
143

library service. Chapter Five presents a discussion of the findings of the current study, its
implications, and recommendations for further research.
Summary of Findings and Interpretation of Results
Sixty-two professional librarians were invited to join the Delphi panel and 30
completed the informed consent form. From these 30 professional librarians, 29
completed the first Delphi round, resulting in a 96% response rate, 28 librarians
completed the second Delphi round, resulting in a 96.5% response rates, and 27 library
experts completed the third Delphi round, resulting in s 96% response rate for the final
round of the study. The 27 panelists who completed the entire Delphi study represent a
variety of librarianship roles. Eighty percent of the library expert panel holds master’s
degrees in information science. The high response rate between the 30 members of the
panel and the 27 who completed all three rounds of surveys indicate the strong interest of
the panel in the topic of joint use library standards.
The responses of the Delphi panel resulted in 42 proposed joint use library
standards in 10 different library standard categories. The joint use library standards are
shown in Appendix M. The 42 new standards were developed from components
identified by the expert Delphi panel from Texas Public Library Standards,(2014), Texas
School Programs: Guidelines and Standards for Texas, (2005), and the Minimum
Requirements for Accreditation in the State Library System (2015). The proposed library
standards were utilized to create an checklist for joint use libraries to use as an evaluative

144

tool to assess effective library service. The joint use library standards checklist is
presented in Appendix N.

Discussion of the Findings by Research Question
Research Question One
Can the current Texas Public Library Standards (Texas Library Association,
2014) and the School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas (Texas
State Library and Archives Commission, 2005) be adapted to create joint use library
standards for Texas school/public libraries?
Sub-question A (SQA): How will the categories listed in the Texas Public
Library Standards be adapted to create Joint Use library standards?
Sub-question B (SQB): How will the categories in the School Library Programs:
Standards and Guidelines for Texas be adapted to create joint use library standards?
Results for research question one
Current Texas library standards were adapted to develop joint use library
standards. The library expert panel identified components and categories from current
library standards and requirements for accreditation in the Texas State Library System
during Round One that resulted in 45 proposed joint use standards in 10 different
categories from correlated current standards. Forty-two of the items achieved consensus
and were accepted as proposed joint use library standards. The strong positive response
from the library expert panel and the large percentage of consensus for the proposed joint
145

use standards reinforced the appropriateness of using current Texas library standards to
create new joint use library standards. The panel answered sub-question A by
recommending 10 categories from current Texas Pubic Library Standards to be included
in joint use standards. Table 15 indicates these categories.

In Sub-question B, library experts identified five categories of current Texas School
Library Standards to include in the joint use library standards. The Texas school library
guidelines and standards are learner-centered. According to the library expert panel, most
of the current school library standards are applicable as joint use library standards. Table
16 indicates the panel accepted 60% of the school standard categories into the new joint
use standards.

The strong positive response of the Delphi panel to include most of the current Texas
public and school library standards in the proposed joint use library standards indicated
an affirmative response to the first research question.
According to the library expert panel, most of the joint use standards were
applicable to Texas school/public libraries. The expert panel accepted 93% of the
proposed standards. Specifically, from the 42 standards that achieved consensus, the
Delphi panel agreed to keep 28, or 66% in the original question format. The panel
suggested revisions for 14% of the original standard questions. The Delphi panel added
terminology, suggested simplification and re-wording some of the questions making the
standards more applicable to shared school/public libraries. The 42 original and revised
joint use components are displayed in Appendix M.
Research Question Two
What are the proposed Joint Use Library Standards recommended by the Delphi
expert panel? The panel determined in three Delphi rounds that 42 proposed joint use
library standards achieved consensus. Figure 9 illustrates the compilation of the joint use
library standards. The standards are further detailed in Appendix M. Each of the standard
categories represents an area to which current libraries are accountable to expectations
that indicate quality library service. There are 10 categories of standards and one category
of requirements for accreditation in the Texas State Library System. Membership in the
147

state library system provides several benefits for public libraries in Texas, such as the
Navigator Interlibrary Loan program, access to TexShare Databases, and a statewide
grant program. Joint use libraries would benefit two-fold with membership in the state
library system, because they could offer the privileges to public and school library
patrons. Each standard category contains from two to six principles that apply to that
standard.
Research Question Three
Can the Joint Use Library Standards recommended by the Delphi panel result in a
checklist that Texas joint use school/public libraries can use to assess effective library
services? The library checklist in Appendix N was developed from the 10 categories and
42 items of proposed joint use library standards. The standards were compiled from the
consensus of the library expert panel during the current Delphi study. Currently, there is
only one documented tool from the Texas State Library to help joint school/public
libraries in Texas determine successful library services. Mary Lankford developed a joint
use library checklist in 2006. Working as a consultant for the Texas State Library and
Archives Commission, Lankford conducted telephone surveys and site visits of the 24
joint use school/public libraries in Texas that serve K-12 students and the public.
Lankford created the checklist based on the information she gathered, but suggested the
need for specific joint use library standards. Although the topic of Lankford’s survey and
report are similar to the current study, the research methodology (Delphi) and the
outcome of the current research (proposed joint use library standards) are dissimilar from
148

Lankford’s work. Lankford’s report provided a foundation of information for the current
Delphi study (Lankford, 2006).

The joint use library standard checklist developed in this research is an evaluative
tool for joint use librarians to assess effective library services. The checklist list is
comprised of 42 suggested joint use library standards in 11 different categories of library
service. The panel members expressed opinions about what current Texas library
standards could be adapted into joint use library standards, based on their own
professional experiences as librarians from various types of libraries.
The library director of a combined school/public library could utilize the joint use
library standards checklist to numerically evaluate current library services in the facility.
In addition to the librarian, stakeholders representing the public population and
stakeholders representing the school population should also complete the checklist.
Because the checklist is a self-reporting assessment tool, the addition of various
perspectives increases the objectivity of the evaluation (Burgin, 2012). The assessor
would assign each of the 42 standards a point value between 0 and 3. The point values
represent the following observations:
0 points = There is no observation that this joint use library standard has been
completed.
1 point = Insufficient. There is very little indication that this joint use library
standard has been completed. Much improvement is needed.
2 points = Moderately observed. There is moderate indication that this joint use
library standard has been completed. Some improvement is needed.

151

3 points = Complete. This library standard is routinely observed. No improvement
is needed.
At the end of the checklist, the point values are totaled. A perfect score of 126 points
would indicate the highest level of joint use library standards routinely observed in the
library services of the school/public facility. The following standard indicators for the
checklist could represent the levels of library service:
•

Exemplary = 113-126 points (90-99%).

•

Acceptable = 101-112 points (80-89%).

•

Marginal = 90-100 points (70-79%).

•

Below Standard = 75-89 points (60-69%).

If a joint use library scored a combined total of between 113-126 points (90-99%) on the
42 standards, that library would receive a rating of Exemplary. This rating illustrates that
the joint use library needs very little improvement in its library services. However, if a
combined facility only achieves between 75-89 points (60-69%), it would receive a rating
of Below Standard. This rating would indicate that the joint use library has many areas of
library service that need improvement. Table 17 documents the categories and point
value measurements for the joint use library standards checklist.

Implications
The current Delphi study focused on developing joint use library standards for
Texas school/public libraries. Three survey rounds resulted in 42 proposed joint use
library standards and a joint use library checklist for facilities to assess effective library
services.
There are no current library standards for joint use libraries in Texas that serve
school and public populations from one combined facility. Conversely, there are official
Texas Library Standards for school libraries, academic libraries, public libraries, and joint
use college/public libraries. The gap that exists in library standards for joint use
school/public facilities also reveals a lack of evaluative tools to assess library services
from combined facilities. Such an assessment tool is nonexistent (Lankford, 2006).
Several authors have stated the need for clear indicators of success for joint use libraries
(Gunnels et al., 2012; Lankford, 2006; and Moorman, 2002). The current societal
emphasis on collaboration between services that provide educational resources has
caused renewed interest in joint use libraries.
Limitations
In a discussion of the limitations for the current study, there are areas of possible
concern. The experts were individually invited to participate by the researcher, creating
153

the limitation of potential bias from the panel. In the Delphi process, the selection criteria
for the expert panel are determined by the researcher. The members of the panel are
purposefully selected. This is unavoidable, because the expertise of the participants is
what makes each member uniquely qualified to serve on the panel (Vernon, 2009;
Cresswell, 2015). Members of a Delphi panel are invited to participate due to their expert
knowledge on a topic or problem to be researched (Skulmoski et al., 2007). The
researcher determined the criterion of professional librarian. Perhaps that requirement
should have been more stringent with a required level of education or years of
professional experience. These details may have created a panel with more specific
opinions towards creating joint use library standards. While defined and controlled by the
researcher, the purposeful selection of the Delphi panel remains non-random in nature
and not representative of the general population. The selection of the panel is subjective
in nature (Skulmoski et al., 2007). Therefore, the 27 panel members who completed the
three rounds of the current Delphi study may not have been representative of all the
professional librarians affected by joint use library standards.
The reliability of the Delphi process is a potential limitation of the current study.
Hasson et al. (2000) indicated there is no reliability for a Delphi study, because the
individual library expert panel members may interpret the same information differently.
Clear instruction and well-written survey questions increase the reliability of expert
responses during the iterative rounds. The questions to a Delphi panel should be
unambiguous and easily read. Additional research to further develop joint use library
154

standards for school/public libraries in Texas needs to occur to increase the reliability of
the current study.
The self-reporting nature of the joint use library standards checklist is another
potential limitation of the current research. It is a subjective process when a library
utilizes the joint use library standards checklist to evaluate effective library services. The
point value and subsequent rating from the checklist may determine how a library is
perceived with regard to library service to both school and public library patrons. If the
librarian reporting the results lacked the ability to objectively rate the institution, the
checklist results would not be accurate. Therefore, multiple stakeholders with an interest
in the joint use library should complete the checklist to increase the reliability and
credibility of the assessment tool. These stakeholders should represent the public, student,
and faculty population that the combined library serves during its daily operations of
service.
Recommendations
The current Delphi study resulted in 42 suggested joint use library standards and a
checklist for school/public libraries in Texas to use as an assessment tool to measure
effective library service. Due to renewed interest in the collaboration of public and school
educational resources, more research is needed in the area of how library standards create
quality and improved library service in shared library facilities. The following topics are
recommendations for additional research in this area.
Additional Research for Joint Use Libraries
155

The current study asked experts to correlate current Texas school and public
library standards to develop the joint use library standards. Additional research could
include studies that would allow library experts to evaluate and revise the 42 joint library
standards created in this study. Qualitative studies using interviews of patrons and library
staff at joint use school/public libraries in Texas would provide additional data to
improve joint use library standards. This type of research would contribute to the
practical application of joint use library standards in actual library settings. The checklist
that was generated from the current study could be used to facilitate the collection of data
from joint use libraries in Texas.
The daily operations of any library can provide ample quantitative data from
calculating the number of patron visits, circulation statistics, and patron interactions with
library staff. This type of data could provide information for studies using the joint use
library standards checklist to compare how the measurements of library service change
when the joint use standards are utilized in the shared library. An increase in library
usage and user satisfaction could contribute objective evidence to promote the acceptance
of joint use library standards as an effective way to improve library service and validate
combined library facilities.
A pilot test of the joint use library standards checklist would contribute to the
research on the current topic. The 42 joint use library standards on the checklist could be
presented to the 24 currently operating joint use school/public libraries in Texas. The
checklist would allow the library directors, library staffs, and public/school library
156

patrons to assess the library service of their local facility. In addition, participants at
multiple library locations could complete the joint use library standards checklist and
answer the following questions:
•

Was this joint use standards checklist helpful as your library evaluated its library
services?

•

If it was helpful, how was it helpful?

•

If it was not helpful, how was it not helpful?

•

What would make the joint use library standards more effective?

This additional research would increase the reliability and validity of the proposed joint
use library standards and provide an opportunity for stakeholders in multiple joint use
libraries to make the standards applicable to their individual libraries (Burgin, 2012).
Further research on joint use library standards could cluster each standard by the
size of the population that the individual library serves. Several members of the panel
expressed concern that the majority of joint use libraries serve communities too small to
meet some of the current Texas library standards. The size of the community needs to be
consistently considered when developing new joint use library standards. If any of the
proposed joint use standards are dismissed from the checklist by individual libraries,
perhaps those standards could become components in the joint use agreement a library
establishes between a school district and city or county governing agency.

Conclusions
Gunnels and Green (2012) predicted joint use libraries will become more
common in the 21st century, because a shared facility offers more resources than an
individual library can provide. The current researcher conducted a Delphi method study
design and identified the recommended categories and components for joint use library
standards in Texas combined school/public libraries. The joint use library standards
recommended by the Delphi panel were organized into a standards checklist designed to
help joint use school/public libraries assess effective library service. The 42 proposed
joint use library standards were developed from correlating the Texas Public Library
Standards (2014), Texas School Library Programs: Guidelines and Standards for Texas
(2005), and the Minimum Requirements for Accreditation in the State Library System
(2014). The library professionals who participated in the current study provided their
personal opinions and feedback to the researcher over a six-week time frame that
included three rounds of surveys. The joint use library standards checklist was developed
directly from the 42 joint use library standards that achieved consensus during the Delphi
study. The checklist will allow Texas school/public libraries to implement a scoring and
rating system to measure quality library service.
A joint use school/public library is like a living room in a multi-generational
family. It brings together all ages, from toddlers to retirees in their 70s and older. During
a typical week in a dual use library in Texas, preschoolers gather in eager anticipation for
story time. Seated in a semi-circle, the bright upturned faces burst into laughter while
158

listening to Ladybug Girl’s latest predicament or hearing Pete the Cat optimistically
remind us that, “It’s all good.”
Two afternoons each week senior adult library patrons sit at desktop computers.
Proving that it is never too late to learn, the class focuses on mastering basic computer
skills necessary to adapt in our ever-changing digital world. Meanwhile, students and
faculty come and go. They gravitate to the library to check out material, use the Internet,
or just visit with friends and browse their electronic devices. In a combined library, a
grandmother may share a sitting area with a 17-year-old working on Algebra 2 problems,
while other teens play card games and adults fill out job applications online. In this welllit library, a living room of learning, there is space for all and everyone is welcome.

September 26, 2015
Dear

,

Thank you for completing the Informed Consent form to participate in the research Standards for Joint Use School/Public Libraries in Texas - A Delphi Study. I am grateful
for your participation, which will truly make a difference.
The Round 1 Survey link is included in this email and will connect you to a Google form
to directly return your answers to the researcher. Your responses will remain anonymous
and confidential. The link will remain active today until Monday, October 5th to maintain
a reasonable progression of study data.

Round one of the study will focus on identifying the categories and components library
experts feel should be included in Joint Use School/Public Library Standards. Round 1
responses will be gathered to determine the questions for Round 2. The current study will
seek to create a checklist of standards for school/public libraries to assess effective
library service.

There are three rounds in this Delphi study. Each round will only take a small amount of
your valuable time. At the conclusion of the study, an aggregated copy of the final results
and proposed standards checklist will be provided to you.

Appendix D
Round One Comments From Panel Members
Comments:
1.
Access to all materials in a joint use library should be in compliance with local,
state, federal laws concerning protection of children.
	  
2.
A joint use library should not be just a school library open to the public for some
limited	  hours; a long range plan is needed to assess if needs of school and
community are met.	  
3.

There should be a certified school librarian in a joint use school/public library.

4.

The collections should be accessible to all users.

5.

There should be signage welcoming both school and public visitors.

6.

There must be clear rules about sharing space with public and students during
school	  hours.	  

7.

A “true” joint use library must fully service the needs of public patrons. The
library and	  staff must engage with the community.	  

8.

There must be communication between state education agency and state library
agency.

9.

Internet filtering should be used only as required by law. Technology equipment
should	  be available for checkout	  

10.

Joint use libraries should provide programs for school and community groups.
The	  library space should be available to community groups during school hours.	  

11.

Small communities may not be able to afford a master’s degreed librarian. There 	  
should be a strongly defined policy for the librarian to supervise, hire, and
terminate according to both the school system and public library policy.	  

12.

13.

All of the state accreditation requirements should be met by joint use libraries.
Only a	  few are listed in your questionnaire. Public library staff should be familiar
with school	  research techniques
	  
Many of your components should not be included in joint use library standards.

14.

There needs to be one certified school librarian, as well as trained public library
183

staff.	  Computer classes and staff professional development is	  essential to maintain 	  
currency of staff skill levels.
15.

No joint use library will succeed of the thinking of the administration separates
school	  from public issues. Staff, hours, funds, etc must be united. What goes for
one goes for all.	  We have just marked our 27 year anniversary as a joint use
library and that has been our	  philosophy from the beginning. There needs to be a

Dear ,
Thank you for your participation in Round 1 of the research - Standards for Joint Use
School/Public Libraries in Texas - A Delphi Study. Welcome to Round 2!
The Round 2 Survey link is included in this email and will connect you to a Google form
to return your answers directly to me. Your responses will remain anonymous and
confidential. The link is active from Wednesday, October 8 until Wednesday, October 15
to maintain a reasonable progression of study data.
Round 2 asks you to rate the components library experts identified for proposed Joint Use
School/Public Library Standards. These components were determined from the panel
responses in Round 1. The Round 2 survey contains 45 questions. Round 3 should be
shorter, because it will address only the components that do not reach consensus in
Round 2. I will provide statistical results from Round 2, to allow you to confirm or revise
your opinions about the proposed joint use library standards.
Thank you for your continued support. At the conclusion of the study, I will provide you
with a gift card as a token of my appreciation for your professional time and effort.
Please feel free to contact me at susiecasstevens@gmail.com or call me at (972)979-6573
with any questions or concerns. Click on the link to begin your participation in Round 2.

Appendix H
Round Two Comments From Panel
Round Two Categories

Panel Comments

Leadership and
Administration

Be aware there are many public library accreditation,
you mention just a few of them.

Collections

Interlibrary loan programs and Ebook platforms are
very expensive. To include this standard puts small
joint use libraries at a
disadvantage.

Collections

Needs to be worded so that each library’s collection
meets the needs of the community it serves.

Library Environment

#15 needs to be broken apart. Meeting space is
essential for a standards document. The other two are
not.

Library Environment

It is essential that a joint use library provide space for
classroom lessons; spaces that are free from
interruptions from the public.

Library Environment

Joint use libraries should not be housed in existing
school buildings, but should be in separate library
facilities to provide better access than schools do.

Finance

Sometimes, a joint use library is seen as a way to save
money without Budget consideration of how both
school and public needs will be met.

Finance

Instead of a percentage budget, use raw numbers
updated annually for improved accuracy and simplicity.

Public Relations

If there are standards for regular libraries, then it is not
necessary to include in a joint use library as it is
implied in all libraries as standards.

Public Relations

Marketing is important but because communities are so
208

diverse, it would be hard to set a standard. What is best
for one community isn’t necessarily good for all
communities.
Technology- Balance of
print and electronic
resources.

I had trouble with #24. How can we specify a balance
when technology needs will change so rapidly? If we
make firm what must be, we will have to change the
policy with each new advancement.

Technology- Internet
filtering

Public libraries can filter responsible and often do to
qualify for Erate and other funding. Adult patrons
should not be limited in their information access by
filters designed for students, nor should they be
required to seek permission to have certain sites
unblocked so that they may maintain privacy.

Library Services

Many of these issues are better addressed in policies
and procedures. While important, these features should
not be part of a standard document.

Personnel

If there is one professional librarian, then it should be a
certified school librarian. A public librarian may not
have the teaching skills of a school librarian.

Teaching and Learning

#38 covers too much ground and I am not sure what it
means. Are instructional services for the public, or is
every librarian a trained instructor?

Information Science

Public library standards recommend a master’s degreed
librarian, but many joint use libraries serve small
populations where this is unlikely unless the school
side hires a certified school librarian. The public
accreditation standards do not require an MLS until the
library serves over 25,000.

Round Three Comments From Panel
Round Three Categories

Comments

Leadership and Administration
1. Meet all Texas quantitative
requirements for accreditation

If you are referring to the quantitative
standards in public library accreditation then I
think those as a whole should be in the
standards for joint use libraries.
Without this assurance any joint library project
is doomed to failure, whether now or in the
near future.
This is a dodgy one. If the library has adequate
government funding other than the school
district then they can certainly meet standards
and maintain accreditation. If not... I hate to
see a library penalized and possibly lose
accreditation and the benefits it conveys over
this. This is a perfect example of why a
separate set of standards would certainly be of
benefit to Joint Use Libraries.

Collections
I do not feel that this should necessarily be a
2. Interlibrary loan program for school part of joint library standards. However, it
and public library patrons.
should be a part of regular library operations.
This and the Texshare databases are examples
of the importance of accreditation.
Interlibrary loan allows both public and school
patrons the ability to access materials beyond
the local collection. Intralibrary loan is also
important; especially when the joint library is
both a branch library in a public system and a
campus library in a large school system. In this
scenario, the joint library must be an active
partner in both systems.
It is very important patrons have the
availability to access materials, and the ILL
220

program affords that accessibility. Including
this statement in the joint use library standards
strengthens the ILL partnership with other
libraries, as it is spelled out as something we
will participate in.
Collections
If both communities cannot use the collections
3. Accessibility to library collection not sure I see how it is really serving the joint
for all (school and public) patrons.
purpose.
Local community standards may play a role in
accessibility, primarily to avoid conflicts that
would lead some communities to abandon the
standards completely. However, if compliance
is enforced in some way (such as provision or
denial of funding), then accessibility should
remain an essential part of the standards.
If collections are not accessible to all users
then you do not have a joint library. I have
seen too many examples of "joint libraries"
where collection access was limited to certain
times of the day or certain age groupings. This
is totally against the spirit of a true joint
library,
Library Environment
4. Space requirements meet existing
Texas Public Library Standards for the
population the library serves.

Since our facility is joint use, it is essential that
Texas Public Library Standards be followed.
This must be spelled out in the policy (and
should be updated when the TPLS are
updated).
You can't force a school to comply with
somebody else's standards. In most cases the
school owns the building.

Library Environment
School facility requirements (the
5. Library space meets Texas school Commissioner's rules) carry the weight of law.
facility requirements per the school
enrollment.
Since our facility is joint use, it is essential that
Texas School Facility Requirements be
followed. This must be spelled out in the
221

policy (and should be updated when the TSFR
are updated).
Library Environment
6. Designated funds and specific
monetary responsibility between the
city and school district for repair and
maintenance of building and grounds.

In the area of strengthening partnerships, it is
essential to spell out specific monetary
responsibilities, and to update this area
frequently when monetary amounts change.
Requirements for specific designation of
authority and responsibility in each component
of the join library are the most crucial parts of
the standards.
If you do not have this spelled out and agreed
to, the chances that you will have a successful
joint library facility are slim.

Library Environment
The issue of meeting space is also contingent
7. Designated meeting space for on size of the library.
community groups and classroom
spaces free from public interruption.
Here again what niche is the joint library
serving in the community? How is classroom
space arranged in the school in general? What
public meeting space is needed and what
public meeting space is available elsewhere in
the community?
Library Environment
8. How important are physical signage
and posters welcoming school and
public patrons, as well as informing
visitors of public and school library
services?

Important practice but not necessary for
standards.
I hope this item would be a part of any contract
between two entities as the joint library is
established. Too many standards tend to stifle
creativity and limit options for quality joint
library service.
Signs will facilitate the quiet, orderly flow of
foot traffic. Strategically placed signs will
reduce questions about what services are
available, while spurring interest in those
services. I am not sure specific sign
language/information would be beneficial if
222

included in the joint use library standards.
Finance
9. Flexible funding allocated by
current needs that provide budget for
programs and resources that serve both
school and public library users.

As technology evolves, flexible funding
allocations will become more important. A
flexibility paragraph should be included in the
standards, with annual updates.
Again this should be a part of the contract that
establishes the joint library operation
This one is worded a bit confusingly - a joint
library should have funds and budget to serve
the needs of both communities - if this is in the
standards not sure you need this.

Public Relations
10. Marketing a unified vision of the
joint use library service to the school
and public community, including
circulation, usage, and budget
information for school and public
awareness.

We live and perish upon the altar of public
opinion. We must have open and clear
communications.
Libraries need to let their communities know
what they are doing.

Technology
11. Offer print and electronic
resources as patron technology needs
demand and the local budget allows.

Again, I would like to see this in the operating
contract. Not all library users have access to e
readers, so offering both types of resources
will not restrict access to materials. We are all
about inclusion and freedom.
This is also a bit confusing - mixing
technology and collections - a library should
have policies and plans for both collections and
technology to meet the needs of both
communities.

Technology
12. Internet access that reflects
filtering appropriate to maintain eRate,
CIPA, and school district Acceptable

Filtering is important for users 17 and under.
Filtering removal must be allowed for 18 +
patrons so as to provide access to materials.
This must be spelled out in the library

This should be spelled out with specifics, and
include a flexible paragraph updated annually
as marketing outlets change. Again, this should
be a part of the contract for the establishment
of a joint library facility.

223

Internet Use policies.

standards.
I don't like filtering, but you have to comply
with requirements to maintain funding.
I think such a standard needs to reflect the
differences in need between the two
communities - schools filter, public libraries
don't always filter, and adults have rights to
have filters turned off - that the joint use
library recognizes and supports the needs of
both communities in accessing Internet
resources
No Erate funding without it.
This should be a part of the operating
agreement, with allowances for unfiltered
computer access available for public use.
It is important that School District standards do
not prevent public patrons from accessing
information that might not be appropriate for
school patrons, but is perfectly acceptable for
Adult patrons.

Library Services
13. Offer library service information
through a website, or other current
social media channels.

This is essential, and should be spelled out.
Reflects reaching people where they are.
Communication is essential, regardless of
library type.
There should be a general standard that covers
this, interlibrary loan and other basic library
services.
There are too many free website building
programs out there to not have this as a
requirement.

Library Services
14. How important is allowing the use
of library space by community groups
during school hours?

If you don’t allow this, you do not truly have a
joint library facility.
This is a standard some libraries would not be
able to comply with. Some schools have inner
224

libraries that only allow public access at times
other than school hours.
Without this standard, you just have a school
library that happens to be open to the public
some hours.
Depends on the structure of the facility.
A joint use library must function in both world
(public/school) and should provide all services
during all open hours to all patrons.
Personnel
15. Mandatory certification in school
librarianship, as well as a master’s
degreed librarian if the population
served is greater than 25,000 (Texas
Public Library requirement).

These requirements must be maintained and
spelled out in the joint use library standards.
This is essential to basic quality library service.
If you are unwilling to provide this then I
would question your sincerity in providing
quality library service to your community.
I don't think the librarian has to have a degree
from an ALA accredited university. My degree
is from Texas A & M Commerce. We have had
a successful library program for 17 yrs.

Teaching and Learning
16. Simultaneous student and public
access to instructional library services
at all times, such as reference,
computer, and information location
assistance.

Again, If you do not provide this you are not
really a joint library facility.
Proper staffing is essential so that both
functions can occur simultaneously.
I would assume you would set a standard for
personnel in order to achieve this goal.
Inclusion for all patrons must be maintained.

Teaching and Learning
17. How important are community
(public) research, computer, and
library resources classes?

Educating the public should be addressed in
the mission/vision area. It is good practice to
offer classes, but it is not a one size fits all in
the area of standards. Depends on needs of the
community.
It is a good practice to offer these classes but
225

they depend on the population the library is
serving and the needs of the community.
Lower socio economic communities will have
different needs than more affluent
communities. It's not a one size fits all in the
area of standards.
Information Science
18. Consistent outcome-based
evaluation of library services such as
summer reading programs, to assess
whether library programs have
achieved their intended results?

Outcome-based evaluation should be done with
caution. It takes more than basic knowledge for
it to be effective. Much evaluation that is
outcome-based is not accurate because those
doing the evaluation do not understand the
process.
doing solid evaluation of programs and
services is a best practice.
Outcome based evaluation is important, but
should not be included in the library standards.
This should be included in another document.
Our constituents want to understand that the
library is worthwhile, and data best serves this
purpose, alongside an excellent
advertising/communication plan.
Outcome-based requirements should include
detailed instructions for library staff and
administrative bodies on how outcome based
data may be gathered and reported.
The outcome-based evaluation is only a tool
for assessment. It is a good practice to evaluate
programs and services but shouldn't be
mandated in standards.

Proposed Joint Use Library Standards for Texas School/Public Libraries

I. Leadership and Administration Standards
Goals: A. Demonstrate effective joint use library leadership and management.
B. Harmonious long-term goals between city and school.
1. Written policies and procedures should reflect the authority of the Library
Board, the school board, and other governing agencies of the joint use library.
2. The joint use library will have a joint mission statement approved by the
school and public library governing entities that encompasses the interests of
the school and public patronage.
3. The library will prepare an annual report for the library funding agencies.
4. The joint use agreement will reflect the goals, objectives, and strategic plans
